            <!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Microservices are great architecture for various IT areas. It supports the successes of many organizations, but on the other hand is often subject to quite strong criticism. How to avoid possible problems and properly use the mechanisms provided by microservices?</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="the-objectives-of-introducing-microservices">The objectives of introducing microservices</h2><p>We have already mentioned business expectations towards IT in the organization in the <a href="https://www.softax.pl/blog/microservices-strengths-and-weaknesses-part1-small-modules/">first part</a> of the article. Let's remind ourselves – IT is to be able to support the growing number of customers, to keep the solution and data security, support for building new functions – in the field of innovation or integration with partners, and this all while maintaining cost effectiveness.</p><p>Microservices are to be the answer to these expectations. In the first two parts of the article we described the features of this approach. We will now try to address the expected benefits of implementing this architecture. Of course, expectations are different, below we have collected the most frequently mentioned set:</p><ul><li>fast and scalable creation of solutions,</li><li>maintaining high ability to change,</li><li>ability to frequent and fast software deliveries,</li><li>ease of production maintenance,</li><li>efficient use of computing resources,</li><li>matching the requirements of the cloud.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://www.softax.pl/blog/content/images/2020/06/microservices_objectives-.png" alt="Objectives of microservices introduction"></figure><p>Most of the benefits of microservices are presented in contrast to the opposing monolithic model. Of course, microservices and monolith are not the only two available models of solution architecture. However, in this article we will also sometimes refer to the monolith in order to more clearly present the differences in approaches of both these methodologies.</p><h3 id="do-microservices-really-bring-the-expected-benefits">Do microservices really bring the expected benefits?</h3><p>It depends. In our opinion, the considered architecture allows to achieve the expected benefits, but the naive understanding of microservices, as a division of the solution into small modules, unfortunately does not guarantee it. Many details are important, that only together, properly treated, allow to use the full potential of this technology. We will now try, one by one, to present the individual expectations and consider how to implement the microservices in order to fulfill these objectives as much as possible.</p><h2 id="fast-and-scalable-solution-creation">Fast and scalable solution creation</h2><p>The business always expects the smooth implementation of ordered changes and generally quick delivery of ready-made solutions. It is often the case that changes are forced by the regulatory environment, or the business arrangements of various stakeholders are prolonged and little time is left for actual implementation. By delivering faster and working in parallel we can deliver more.</p><h3 id="do-microservices-allow-to-create-solutions-quickly">Do microservices allow to create solutions quickly?</h3><p>Of course yes. It is very easy to create new modules, and it is also easy to make changes to the existing ones, because they are small and have a focused logic. The use of microservices also allows for parallel work of different teams. Each module is independent, so we have less communication. Smaller than in other methodologies, individual modules are easier to understand, modify, test and implement. Together this means faster delivery, and that is what we wanted.</p><h3 id="can-you-work-quickly-in-monolith-too">Can you work quickly in monolith too?</h3><p>In certain situations, yes. If we are a startup, at the beginning of software development we'll actually see the effects sooner creating a monolith. In a monolith we can get started faster, microservices require more initial investment in the solution architecture and work organization. The situation turns around when we are already a larger and more mature organization and our solution becomes more complicated. Due to the lack of independence of the modules, the development of the monolith slows down: frequent analysis of large business areas is required, regular arrangements are necessary, side effects appear. However, at the beginning of solution development, the monolith has its advantages.</p><h3 id="do-you-always-have-to-create-solutions-quickly">Do you always have to create solutions quickly?</h3><p>The faster the better. Theoretically. But usually it is that by increasing the speed of implementation we lose something. Fast may mean "without proper documentation", "without adequate implementation of cross-cutting concerns", "without full testing" or "without maintaining the consistency of the solution". We don't want that. Such an approach means difficulty in maintaining the ability to change, frequent code duplication and a slowdown in future development. <strong>In general, avoiding documentation is one of the biggest mistakes in system architecture at all.</strong>Insufficient quality of tests means failed implementations and errors visible to the clients.</p><p>Microservices require a lot. While the implementation of changes in this architecture may be very fast, ensuring the appropriate quality of the solution requires a lot of work. The advantage of this approach, however, is the possibility of experimenting with technologies, as well as obtaining quick feedback on the solution, even when it is not yet ready for production lunch.</p><h3 id="what-else-to-watch-out-for">What else to watch out for?</h3><p>Team independence combined with the expected fast pace of delivery may mean that a single module will remain easy to maintain, but the system as a whole will get stuck in its complexity. <strong>In a microservice architecture it is easy to create new modules, but their integration with the entire system is often not straightforward.</strong></p><p>It is worth remembering to watch out for all kinds of "shortcuts". Such as the code reuse of different modules or tight coupling of components (about which we wrote in the <a href="https://www.softax.pl/blog/microservices-strengths-and-weaknesses-part2-module-independence/">second part</a> of the article). Often in the short term this allows to build a solution faster, but reduces the independence of services, and that makes future changes more difficult and prolonged. A solution done "quickly", as an experiment, can stay with us for a long time. Remember about documentation, so that we always have a full understanding of the solution architecture.</p><p>If we want a fast solution creation to be a constant feature of our system, it is also advisable to provide a certain framework for action. That is, for example, certain methods, standard for our solution, for services integration, security mechanisms, tracing or logging.</p><h3 id="scaling-of-software-development">Scaling of software development</h3><p>The division of the application into independent modules also allows more developers to work on it. The principles of loosely coupled microservices help a lot in this. Thanks to them we don't get into problems connected with the accumulation of backlog at the level of single people or teams.</p><p>The rules related to design (especially concerning vertical division of teams) or data independence, combined with automation of manufacturing and implementation processes mean that <strong>microservices respond particularly well to the need to scale software development</strong>.</p><p>It is worth remembering, however, that parallel work of developers is also allowed by modular and layered architecture in general, in particular SOA, and not necessarily only microservices.</p><p>The problem with scaling development, however, occurs in a monolithic solution, if it reaches a certain, more significant size. This model limits the ability of independent teams to work independently – it is necessary to coordinate tasks, deliveries and production implementations. Parallel changes in the same code, implemented by different teams, basically guarantee deployment and maintenance problems.</p><h2 id="maintaining-a-high-ability-to-change">Maintaining a high ability to change</h2><p>Creating solutions quickly, in the long run, would not be possible without maintaining a high ability to change. Such a feature of a solution results from many factors. In our opinion, the most important is the transparency of the solution – i.e. the ease of assesing the structure and operation of our system.</p><h3 id="solution-transparency">Solution transparency</h3><p>The fast creation of new functions, introducing changes and the possibility of parallel work of many teams depends directly on the transparency of our solution. If we do not understand the system and responsibilities of individual modules, it is difficult to make modifications without the risk of errors and side effects. Individual changes can degenerate the system, making it difficult to develop and maintain the solution later on. As the size and scope of functionality increases, this becomes an increasingly serious problem. How can you evaluate microservices in this field? The answer is not clear.</p><h3 id="how-does-it-look-like-in-a-monolith">How does it look like in a monolith?</h3><p>In case of a monolith it is very easy to lose transparency. This is not due to the complexity of the architecture (which in the case of a monolith is generally simple), but to the many unclear relationships, which are a consequence of the lack of independence of various functional modules. The monolith, on a larger scale and after a longer period of development, becomes a set of numerous requirements, correctly or incorrectly implemented. It is difficult to determine the area of any change, the original purpose of various mechanisms found in the code often no one remembers.</p><h3 id="and-the-microservices">And the microservices?</h3><p>Microservices deal with the above problems very well, but the question of complications remains – will a solution with a few hundreds or thousands of separate modules be transparent? Well, not necessarily. <strong>The structure of each module may be clear, but the links between them don't have to be so.</strong> On a larger scale it is a significant cognitive load. So is there anything we can do about it? It depends on the actual system architecture.</p><h3 id="the-architecture">The architecture</h3><p>If the architecture is completely flat (the system as a set of equal services), looking at it, we will not get clear information about which components are used for what and where their responsibility lies. In this case, quite a detailed (and exhaustive) analysis would be necessary.</p><p>The situation will change for the better if we introduce some sort of hierarchy within the set of services. Separating certain functional areas, perhaps in the form of system layers, and assigning individual microservices to them will allow to define special system …</p></div></section></article></div></main></div></div>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>After starting to use <a href="https://rolisz.ro/2019/12/30/cracking-the-human-memory/">spaced repetition more actively</a> and being <a href="https://rolisz.ro/2020/05/24/bullet-journaling/">more consistent with my journaling</a>, now I've tackled improving my note taking skills.</p><p>Over the last couple of months, I've read about various note-taking methods, different approaches and diverse goals for them and they helped me change my perspective on collecting ideas.</p><h2 id="my-previous-approaches-to-taking-notes">My previous approaches to taking notes</h2><p>While I was still in school, I didn't take too good notes. I guess the Romanian educational system is not set up to encourage that kind of critical thinking which leads to taking good notes. In most classes, the teacher would dictate a lesson, I would write that down and then memorize it, without needing to create my own summarized version of the lesson.</p><p>Then I took notes in Google Keep. When it came out, I was impressed by how simple and snappy it was, compared to Evernote for example. I've used it for around 6 years, so I have a lot of notes jotted down there. But Keep doesn't offer good ways to organize notes, having only tags and search. But to search, you have to remember something to look for, so it's almost impossible to find notes which you have forgotten.</p><p>As I've started moving my notes from Keep to Obsidian, I found a lot of old notes which I had totally forgotten about. Some of those notes were ideas I had, but I never followed up on them. Looking back they were good ideas: I know because in the meantime other people have implemented them.</p><h2 id="goals-of-a-note-taking-system">Goals of a note taking system</h2><p>A goal of a note taking system should be to store information, so that your brain can do more fun/useful stuff.</p><p>But another goal is to help you connect ideas, even from different domains. As you read things in books, blogs, or come up with ideas on your own, eventually some of them will be related and can be combined to make something even better. The note taking system should facilitate creating these connections.</p><p>It should also help you process your notes. A note is not a static thing. It's not something you just write down and then never touch again. Almost all ideas will eventually need refining. When you read a book and find something noteworthy, you write some notes, but in time you find that you can reword it better, as you understand things better. For your own ideas, in time you add something; you cut some things, hopefully making them better and then you create something with them.</p><p>Lastly, the note organizing system should help you organize and browse your notes. It should encourage serendipitous rediscovery of forgotten notes. It should help visualize them. It should make it easy to see all notes that are related to a certain note or to a certain topic.</p><figure><img src="https://rolisz.ro/content/images/2020/07/image-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-5.png 600w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-5.png 1000w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/image-5.png 1600w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/image-5.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Meta: Writing this post in Obsidian. Left: folder pane; middle: raw markdown; right: Rendered note</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> is a new desktop app for creating a "A second brain, for you, forever.". It's quite new, it was released publicly two months ago and it's not even at version 1.0, but development is progressing quite quickly, with a new version coming out almost weekly.</p><p>Obsidian is built around Markdown files, which means that the notes are portable and won't get stuck in an old program, should the company go out of business. It enhances the Markdown syntax with the some shortcuts for creating connections between pages using <code>[[name of other page]]</code> syntax. You can see for each page what other pages link back to it. There's also a way to embed one file (or part of a file) into another one. </p><figure><img src="https://rolisz.ro/content/images/2020/07/image-6.png" alt="" srcset="https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-6.png 600w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-6.png 1000w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/image-6.png 1600w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/image-6.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The graph view</figcaption></figure><p>One cool looking feature in Obsidian is the graph view, where you can visualize how your notes are connected. This leads to some interesting looking "constellations". </p><p>There are also plugins available. For now, the API is internal, so all the plugins are made by the same company, but they say that once they reach 1.0, they will make the API public. </p><p>Because Obsidian is based on Markdown files, you can store them wherever you want and you can sync them across devices with your favorite syncing tool. So far, I've used GitHub. </p><p>One disadvantage is that it doesn't have a mobile app so far (or a remote interface in general). On one hand, it's not a big issue for me, because my goals for notes require a big screen and a nice keyboard. In practice, I still like to have access to my notes even on the go, so I just use an Android Git client with a Markdown editor. Maybe one day I'll change this to expose my notes as a static website. </p><h2 id="my-note-taking-workflow">My note taking workflow</h2><p>My workflow is inspired by (but only inspired, not fully copied from) the <a href="https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125?gi=635ef2e210e3">Zettelkasten</a> method of Niklas Luhman, which is the trending note taking framework du jour, sprinkled with ideas from <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/basb">Tiago Forte</a> and others. When my note-taking workflow grows up, it wants to be like <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z3SjnvsB5aR2ddsycyXofbYR7fCxo7RmKW2be">Andy Matuschak's notes</a>. </p><p>I have a loose categorization of my notes into folders. I'm not very strict about them and I don't want to spend much time organizing a hierarchy. Some notes also have tags (simply words prefixed with # and Obsidian is smart enough to start a search for them if you click on one). </p><p>Many of my notes don't start their life in Obsidian, but in my bullet journal. When I hear something new, or I read something interesting, often my bullet journal is closer to me, so I jot down the main ideas there. Then, when I get to my computer and I have time I copy it into Obsidian and I flesh out the ideas fully. Then I try to find any other notes that are relevant and add connections to them. </p><p>One thing that I try to do is to make my notes my own. This means that if I read an interesting article, I don't just copy paste the interesting parts, but I actually reword them and write them down as I understood them. This helps both comprehension and retention. </p><p>For certain topics, I create index maps, where I list all the notes that I have related to that topic. So notes belong to multiple index maps, because they are relevant in different areas. </p><p>As I add new notes and create connections between them, I end up revisiting old notes and updating them. Sometimes it's with a negative update (it didn't pan out, it was a wrong idea), but sometimes it's a positive one (a further development or something similar someone else has done). </p><p>The most interesting part is when notes from very different areas start to "touch" each other. Because of the graph view, it's easy to see how close notes are to each other. I also use the graph view to see what notes are isolated and then I try to find them a place. As you can see in the above screenshot, I still have a lot of work to do. </p><p>So far I have added 160 notes in Obsidian, so it's a small knowledge base. I still have many notes in Google Keep to move over. But I feel like Obsidian has already helped me (I feel on top of my notes) and I hope something nice (and useful) will come out of it. </p><p>Top photo by <a href="https://nds.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian#/media/Bild:Obszidi%C3%A1n(Vezuv)005.jpg">Pogány Péter - Egen Wark</a>.</p><p><em>I’m publishing this as part of <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">100 Days To Offload</a> - Day 31.</em></p>

July 28, 2020 | https://bojanvidanovic.com/posts/speeding-up-static-websites-with-pjax/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bojanvidanovic.com/posts/speeding-up-static-websites-with-pjax/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>With the fast-growing trend of static websites, many people are moving their blogs from <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a>, etc, to static websites built with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> or <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. And there is a good reason for that. One of the reasons is security, cutting down server costs, ease of maintenance, performances, and many others. But in this article, I would like to focus on performances.</p>
<p>As everybody knows, static websites offer out-of-the-box very fast performances without any configuration. You have no database, no dynamically generated content, just serving HTML files from your hosting. As simple as that. But using the PJAX technique we can improve loading performances and enhance the user’s experience a lot!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-pjax-and-how-it-works">What is PJAX and how it works?</h2>
<p>PJAX technique is using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/pushState">PushState</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29">AJAX</a>. Basically, on a page request, we will manually update the URL and inject the new content on the page, thus avoiding reloading your page’s layout or any resources (JS, CSS), giving a fast page load.</p>
<p>Here are the steps of the process with <a href="https://barba.js.org/">Barba.js</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check if the link is valid and eligible for PJAX. If yes, prevent normal browser behavior.</li>
<li>Change the URL using the push state API.</li>
<li>Start fetching the new page via an XMLHttpRequest.</li>
<li>Create a new transition instance.</li>
<li>As soon the new page is loaded, barba.js parses the new HTML (taking .barba-container) and puts the new content on the DOM inside #barba-wrapper.</li>
<li>The transition instance will take care of hiding the old container and showing the new one.</li>
<li>As soon as the transition is finished, the old container is removed from the DOM.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-to-implement-pjax-on-a-website">How to implement PJAX on a website?</h2>
<p>There are many PJAX libraries, like <a href="https://barba.js.org/">Barba.js</a>, <a href="https://sennajs.com/">Senna.js</a>, <a href="https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks">Turbolinks</a>, <a href="https://github.com/MoOx/pjax">Pjax</a>, etc. Usually, they all offer extremely easy implementation, I prefer using Barba.js for simple websites and Senna.js for more complex ones as it has a better API. In this article, I will use Barba.js</p>
<p>The implementation consists of 2 parts:
Setting up DOM markup
Script initialization.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-dom-markup">Setting up DOM markup</h3>
<p>Barba.js needs to know how your website is set up, so it will need a few HTML attributes:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html">&lt;<span>body</span> <span>data-barba</span><span>=</span><span>"wrapper"</span>&gt;
  <span>&lt;!-- put here content that will not change
</span><span>  between your pages, like &lt;header&gt; or &lt;nav&gt; --&gt;</span>

  &lt;<span>main</span> <span>data-barba</span><span>=</span><span>"container"</span>&gt;
    <span>&lt;!-- put here the content you wish to change
</span><span>    between your pages, like your main content &lt;h1&gt; or &lt;p&gt; --&gt;</span>
  &lt;/<span>main</span>&gt;

  <span>&lt;!-- put here content that will not change
</span><span>  between your pages, like &lt;footer&gt; --&gt;</span>
&lt;/<span>body</span>&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>The wrapper is the main Barba section that contains all your page structure and the Barba container.
The container defines a section in which content is updated automatically when you navigate between your pages.</p>
<h3 id="script-initialization">Script initialization</h3>
<p>After setting up the DOM attributes we simply include Barba.js script in the head of the document and initialize the script:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html">&lt;<span>script</span> <span>type</span><span>=</span><span>"text/javascript"</span> <span>src</span><span>=</span><span>"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@barba/core"</span> <span>async</span> <span>onload</span><span>=</span><span>"barba.init({})"</span>&gt;&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>That’s it.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This approach will give a SPA-like feeling of the website since there are much fewer server requests.</p>

                <p><span>The illegal wildlife trade (IWT) is a growing threat to biodiversity. This trade is becoming one of the most valuable illegal trade sectors. IWT threatens biodiversity and can have a negative impact on the economy. Hiding or laundering IWT revenues undermines financial integrity. Financial criminals facilitate money laundering activities by making billions of dollars of illegal trade in rhino horns, ivory, and other similar wildlife products.</span></p><p><span>  It has published a global report on IWT for the first time by assessing the aspects of money laundering (ML) of Financial Action Task Force (FATF) wildlife crimes and how judicial districts should apply FATF standards to combat IWT. </span></p><h2><b>Illegal Wildlife Trade (IWT) Relationship With Money Laundering </b></h2><p>   <span>FATF released the June 2020 Money Laundering and the Illegal Wildlife Trade report. The purpose of the <a href="http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/Money-laundering-and-illegal-wildlife-trade.pdf">FATF report</a> is to provide guidance on measures that can be taken to combat money laundering from the Illegal Wildlife Trade. The Illegal wildlife trade (IWT) is a major organized crime that fuels corruption and threatens biodiversity. According to the 2016 UN World Wildlife Crime report, criminals trade products derived from more than 7,000 wild animal and plant species worldwide. Criminals illegally trade not only iconic mammals but also less well-known species such as bird, amphibian species, corals, reptiles, boney fish. A striking example is illegally hunting criminals to make bags and shoes from the skin of pythons, to consume them as food, and to be used as a traditional medical tool.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>FATF defines illegal wildlife trade as a "global threat", which is also linked to other organized crime such as drug trafficking and arms trade. Criminals abuse the official financial industry to hide illegal revenues from wildlife crimes and money laundering. According to the report, an estimated 7 billion to 23 billion dollars of illegal wildlife trade takes place annually. Although making a profit from illegal wildlife trade is one of the most effective ways of money laundering, there is a deficiency in monitoring the financial flows of wildlife smugglers, this means that countries rarely focused on the financial aspect of this crime. Therefore, the criminals continued to expand their activities in this area.</span><span><br></span></p><h2><b>Methods Used for The Illegal Wildlife Trade  </b></h2><p>   <span>All criminals in IWT often use shells and front companies to hide payments and launder the revenues of their illegal activities. They primarily use shell companies to facilitate the transfer of value among the union members of the criminals, between buyers and sellers, or to hold assets. In addition, criminals often use legitimate frontline companies to hide the transfer of value from IWT. On the other hand, criminals use the import-export industries to legally demonstrate the movement of goods and payments across borders. Some of the vulnerable sectors that criminals use to clear your income are breeding facilities, pet shops, zoos, the decor, and the fashion industry. </span></p><p><span>Simply to explain their process, Illegal funds obtained are transferred to third parties via bank transfers through e-banking platforms, loans or payments, licensed money transfer systems, and banks. Third-party accounts also often use innocent bank mules. Their illegal transactions are not noticeable, and thus money laundering takes place. Furthermore, with the development of online markets and mobile, social media-based payments, The Illegal Wildlife Trading has increased.</span><span> </span></p><h2><b>Cooperation in Financial Crimes Related to The Illegal Wildlife Trade </b></h2><p> <span>According to the FATF Recommendation, all jurisdictions require that Illegal Wildlife Trade identify, assess, and take action to reduce the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing. Moreover, As stated in the FATF report, if criminal offenses related to money laundering caused by Illegal Wildlife Trade abroad occurred in another country, this should definitely constitute a crime. As a result, wildlife crime committed abroad as a basis for money laundering should not only be able to provide international cooperation in cases where double criminality is required but also through domestic investigations and prosecutions. </span></p><p><span> On the other side, Cooperation between the public and private sectors is important for the identification and disruption of IWT related financial flows. Especially in jurisdictions with public-private partnerships, there has been an interaction between the public sector and financial institutions in the monitoring of crimes related to IWT. Collaborations include both strategic and operational information exchange. As a result of the survey conducted by FATF, most of the countries' cooperation in combating IWT-related financial crimes is realized within the financial sector and to a lesser extent among non-financial sectors. </span></p><h2><b>FATF Recommendations in Combating IWT </b></h2><p>   <span>To combat money laundering (ML) and Illegal Wildlife Trade (IWT), both high-level political commitment and improved operational cooperation are needed. It is very important to work closely with sectors that play a role in combating money laundering with law enforcement officers responsible for wildlife crime. Studies can improve countries and private sector activities. The role of FATF Standards is very important in combating illegal wildlife trade. </span></p><p><span>   Understanding of IWT's threats to non-financial businesses, different geographic country risk profiles for different species, and asset management practices related to illegal wildlife trade are required. FATF encourages strengthening money laundering risk understandings related to such crimes through comprehensive risk assessments and sharing the results of these efforts with all relevant authorities.  </span><span> </span><span><br></span><span><br></span><br></p>

July 28, 2020 | https://amitness.com/2020/07/checklist/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://amitness.com/2020/07/checklist/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
<p>When developing an NLP model, it’s a standard practice to test how well a model generalizes to unseen examples by evaluating it on a held-out dataset. Suppose we reach our target performance metric of 95% on a held-out dataset and thus deploy the model to production based on this single metric.</p>
<p>But, when real users start using it, the story could be completely different than what our 95% performance metric was saying. Our model might perform poorly even on simple variations of the training text.</p>
<p>In contrast, the field of software engineering uses a suite of unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to evaluate all aspects of the product for failures. An application is deployed to production only after passing these rigorous tests.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/checklist-software-testing.png" alt=""></p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04118">Ribeiro et al.</a> noticed this gap and took inspiration from software engineering to propose an evaluation methodology for NLP called <strong>“CheckList”</strong>. Their paper won the best overall paper award at ACL 2020.</p>
<p>In this post, I will explain the overall concept of CheckList and the various components that it proposes for evaluating NLP models.</p>
<h2 id="behavioral-testing">Behavioral Testing</h2>
<p>To understand CheckList, let’s first understand behavioral testing in the context of software engineering.</p>
<p>Behavioral testing, also known as black-box testing, is a method where we test a piece of software based on its expected input and output. We don’t need access to the actual implementation details.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you have a function that adds two numbers together.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>We can evaluate this function by writing tests to compare it’s output to the expected answer. We are not concerned with how this function was implemented internally.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>test_add</span><span>():</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>3</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>1</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>2</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Even for a simple function such as addition, there are capabilities that it should satisfy. For example, the addition of a number with zero should yield the original number itself.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>

</tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="checklist-framework">CheckList Framework</h2>
<p>CheckList proposes a general framework for writing behavioral tests for any NLP model and task.</p>
<p>The core idea is based on a conceptual matrix that is composed of <span>linguistic capabilities</span> as rows and <span>test types</span> as columns. The intersecting cells contain multiple test examples generated from templates that we run and calculate the <span>failure rate</span> for.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><span>Capability</span> / <span>Test</span></th>
<th><span>Minimum Functionality Test(MFT)</span></th>
<th><span>Invariance Test(INV)</span></th>
<th><span>Directional Expectation Test(DIR)</span></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><span>VOCABULARY</span></td>
<td><span>15.0%</span></td>
<td><span>16.2%</span></td>
<td><span>34.6%</span></td>

<tr>
<td><span>NER</span></td>
<td><span>0.0%</span></td>
<td><span>20.8%</span></td>
<td>-</td>

<tr>
<td><span>NEGATION</span></td>
<td><span>76.4%</span></td>
<td>-</td>
<td>-</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>…</span></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>By calculating the failure rates for various test types and capabilities, we can know exactly where our model is weak.</p>
<p>Let’s understand each part of this conceptual matrix in detail now.</p>
<h3 id="1-test-types">1. Test Types</h3>
<p>These are the columns in the previous matrix. There are 3 types of tests proposed in the CheckList framework:</p>
<h4 id="a-minimum-functionality-testmft">a. Minimum Functionality Test(MFT)</h4>
<p>This test is similar to unit tests in software engineering. We create a collection of (text, expected label) pairs and test the model on this collection.</p>
<p>For example, we are testing the negation capability of the model using an MFT test below.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/checklist-mft.png" alt=""><br>
Template: I <span>{NEGATION}</span> <span>{POS_VERB}</span> the <span>{THING}</span></p>
<p>The goal of this test is to make sure the model is not taking any shortcuts and possesses linguistic capabilities.</p>
<h4 id="b-invariance-testinv">b. Invariance Test(INV)</h4>
<p>In this test, we perturb the text examples in a way that the label should not change. Then, the model is tested on this perturbed example and the model passes the test only if its prediction remains the same (i.e invariant).</p>
<p>For example, changing the location from Chicago to Dallas should not change the original sentiment of a text.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/checklist-INV.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We can use different perturbation functions to test different capabilities. The paper mentions two examples:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Capability</th>
<th>Perturbation</th>
<th>Invariance</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>NER</td>
<td>Change location name in text</td>
<td>Should not change sentiment</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Robustness</td>
<td>Add typos to the text</td>
<td>Should not change prediction</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h4 id="c-directional-expectation-testdir">c. Directional Expectation Test(DIR)</h4>
<p>This test is similar to the invariance test but here we expect the model prediction to change after perturbation.</p>
<p>For example, if we add a text “You are lame” to the end of a text, the expectation is that sentiment of the original text will not move towards a positive direction.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/checklist-DIR.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We can also write tests where we expect the target label to change. For example, consider the QQP task where we need to detect if two questions are duplicates or not.</p>
<p>If we have a pair of duplicate questions and we change the location in one of the questions, then we expect the model to predict that they are not duplicates.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Capability</th>
<th>Question 1</th>
<th>Question 2</th>
<th>Expected</th>
<th>Predicted</th>
<th>Passed</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>NER</td>
<td>How many people are there in <span>England</span>?</td>
<td>What is the population of <span>England</span>?</td>
<td>Duplicate</td>
<td>Duplicate</td>
<td>✔</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>NER</td>
<td>How many people are there in <span>England</span>?</td>
<td>What is the population of <span>Turkey</span>?</td>
<td>Not Duplicate</td>
<td><span>Duplicate</span></td>
<td><span>X</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3 id="2-linguistic-capabilities">2. Linguistic Capabilities</h3>
<p>These are the rows in the CheckList matrix. Each row contains a specific linguistic capability that applies to most NLP tasks.</p>
<p>Let’s understand examples of capabilities given in the original paper. The authors provide a lot of examples to help us build a mental model of how to test new capabilities relevant to our task and domain.</p>
<h4 id="a-vocabulary-and-pos">a. Vocabulary and POS</h4>
<p>We want to ensure the model has enough vocabulary knowledge and can differentiate words with a different part of speech and how it impacts the task at hand.</p>
<p>For example, the paper shows the 3 test types for a sentiment analysis task.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Test Type</th>
<th>Example</th>
<th>Expected</th>
<th>Remarks</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>MFT</td>
<td>The company is Australian</td>
<td>neutral</td>
<td>neutral adjective and nouns</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>MFT</td>
<td>That cabin crew is <span>extraordinary</span></td>
<td>positive</td>
<td>sentiment-laden adjectives</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>INV</td>
<td><span><del>the</del></span> ⮕ <span>our</span> nightmare continues</td>
<td>no change</td>
<td>Replace neutral words with other neutral words</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DIR</td>
<td>AA45… JFK to LAS. <span>You are brilliant</span></td>
<td>move towards +ve</td>
<td>Add positive phrase to end</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DIR</td>
<td>your service sucks. <span>You are lame</span></td>
<td>move towards -ve</td>
<td>Add negative phrase to end</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This can also be applied for the QQP task as shown below.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Test Type</th>
<th>Question 1</th>
<th>Question 2</th>
<th>Expected</th>
<th>Remarks</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>MFT</td>
<td>Is John a teacher?</td>
<td>Is John <span>an accredited</span> teacher?</td>
<td>Not Duplicate</td>
<td>Modifiers change question intent</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h4 id="b-named-entity-recognitionner">b. Named Entity Recognition(NER)</h4>
<p>It tests the capability of the model to understand named entities and whether it is important for the current task or not.</p>
<p>We have examples of NER capability tests for sentiment analysis given below.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Test Type</th>
<th>Example</th>
<th>Expected</th>
<th>Remarks</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>INV</td>
<td>We had a safe travel to <span><del>Chicago</del></span> ⮕ <span>Dallas</span></td>
<td>no change</td>
<td>Switching locations should not change predictions</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>INV</td>
<td><span><del>Benjamin</del></span> ⮕ <span>Anna</span> was your savior</td>
<td>no change</td>
<td>Switching person names should not change predictions</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We can also apply this to the QQP task.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>

<td>Keep first word and entities, replace everything else with ROBERTA</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h4 id="c-temporal">c. Temporal</h4>
<p>Here we want to test if the model understands the order of events in the text.</p>
<p>Below are examples of tests we can devise to evaluate this capability for a sentiment model.</p>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>As discussed in the <a href="https://leapfin.com/blog/an-accountants-guide-to-order-to-cash/">first post</a> in this series, Order to Cash describes the procedure for processing customer orders, applying payments to invoices, and matching payments to the cash received in a company’s bank account.</p>
<p>In this process, cash flows through a number of systems described in detail below.</p>
<p>Accountants perform cash reconciliations to ensure that cash has appropriately gone through these systems for each transaction.</p>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>A cash reconciliation is the process of verifying the completeness of a sale or transaction across the company’s financial systems. Its completion provides assurance for both cash and revenue balances.</p>
<p>Multiple financial systems are involved in a cash reconciliation and generally, cash balances across these systems do not match.</p>
<p><img src="https://leapfin.com/blog/content/images/2020/05/cash-reconciliation-example.png" alt="cash-reconciliation-example"></p>
<p>We’ll explore cash reconciliations further below, but first we’d like to address a common misconception.</p>
<h5 id="cashreconciliationvsbankreconciliation">Cash Reconciliation vs. Bank Reconciliation</h5>
<p>Cash reconciliations are often misunderstood to be the same thing as bank reconciliations.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.accountingcoach.com/bank-reconciliation/explanation">bank reconciliation</a> is the process of matching transaction amounts reported in a bank statement with those recorded in the general ledger. Its purpose is to ensure that the cash balance recorded in the general ledger aligns with the entity’s actual cash balance in the company’s bank account. While companies and banks record the same transactions, the time at which a company records cash in the general ledger often differs from the time at which their bank reports the associated change.</p>
<br><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="systemsinvolvedinacashreconciliation">Systems Involved in a Cash Reconciliation</h2>
<p>A cash reconciliation is more complex and comprehensive than a bank reconciliation because it involves a company's entire financial technology stack. Below are the four most common systems involved in a cash reconciliation. They can vary depending on company size, business model, or technological maturity.</p>
<h5 id="billingsystem">Billing System:</h5>
<p>A billing system creates and manages customer invoices that allow customers to pay for their purchases. Cash from billing systems represent how much cash is expected to be collected from sales.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Aria, Chargebee, Recurly</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="paymentprocessor">Payment Processor:</h5>
<p>A payment processor relays customers’ payment information to a company’s bank and the customers’ banks in order to complete a transaction. It verifies payment legitimacy and provides instructions to banks for fund transfers. Cash from payment processors represent the final cash received by the company’s bank.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Stripe, Adyen, Braintree/PayPal, WorldPay</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="companysbank">Company’s Bank:</h5>
<p>A company’s bank collects and deposits the cash from transactions that are successfully processed by payment processors. It is the final system involved in a cash reconciliation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="revenuerecognitionsystem">Revenue Recognition System:</h5>
<p>A revenue recognition system calculates revenue for the current period and liabilities for future deferred revenues. It ingests information from both billing systems and payment processors to perform these calculations according to the company’s arrangements and policies.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Leapfin, NetSuite ARM, Zuora RevPro</li>
</ul>
<br><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Generally, the cash balances across these systems <em>do not match</em>, which is precisely why accounting teams need to perform cash reconciliations.</p>
<p>Common reasons for mismatch across these financial systems include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Currency differences (Transaction currency, local exchange currency, payout currency)</li>
<li>Foreign exchange translations (How an international company translates foreign subsidiary earnings into its reporting currency)</li>
<li>Timing differences (Deposits in transit, time zones, etc.)</li>
</ol>

<p>The simplest way to examine the relationship between cash, revenue, and deferred revenue is to understand the deferred revenue roll forward. A deferred revenue roll forward is a simple calculation that ensures incoming and outgoing activities to the deferred revenue balance are properly accounted for.</p>
<p><img src="https://leapfin.com/blog/content/images/2020/05/deferred-revenue-rollforward-1.png" alt="deferred-revenue-rollforward-1"></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>First, let’s review deferred revenue itself.</p>
<p>Deferred revenue is a cash payment from a customer for goods or services to be provided in the future. Since the seller’s obligation has not been filled, the cash has not been earned, and the seller records this as a liability on the Balance Sheet via a deferred revenue balance. Deferred revenue is especially common among subscription and SaaS companies, in which payments are made upfront in exchange for service periods in the future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: On Jan 1, 2020 a customer makes a $120 purchase for a subscription service spanning Jan 1, 2020 to Dec 31, 2020.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="generalledgerimpact">General Ledger Impact:</h5>
<table>
<tbody><tr><th>Month</th><th>Account</th><th>DR</th><th>CR</th></tr>
 <tr><td>Jan 1</td><td>Cash</td><td>$120</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Deferred Revenue</td><td></td><td>$120</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>As the seller completes its obligations over time to earn the revenue, the deferred revenue balance on the Balance Sheet is reduced accordingly by the amount of revenue earned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: The seller recognizes revenue monthly based on the service period of Jan 1, 2020 to Dec 31, 2020. $120 across 12 months results in revenue of $10 per month.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="generalledgerimpact">General Ledger Impact:</h5>
<table>
<tbody><tr><th>Month</th><th>Account</th><th>DR</th><th>CR</th></tr>
<tr><td>Jan 31</td><td>Deferred Revenue</td><td>$10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Revenue</td><td></td><td>$10</td></tr>
<tr><td>Feb 28</td><td>Deferred Revenue</td><td>$10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Revenue</td><td></td><td>$10</td></tr>
<tr><td>March 31</td><td>Deferred Revenue</td><td>$10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Revenue</td><td></td><td>$10</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>And so forth for April 30, May 31, etc...</p>
<p>At month 12 on Dec 31, 2020, the deferred revenue balance will be fully exhausted as the $120 cash payment would be fully recognized.</p>
<p>Check out our previous blog post on <a href="https://leapfin.com/blog/revenue-cash-reconciliation-for-subscription-businesses/">Revenue Cash Accounting for Subscription Businesses</a> for more detailed journal entries.</p>
<br><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="cashisimportanttodeferredrevenue">Cash is Important to Deferred Revenue</h2>
<p>Since cash is an important part of the deferred revenue calculation, cash balance figures must be accurate for deferred revenue to be reliable. Accounting teams can be confident in their revenue figures by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Performing cash reconciliations to verify that cash activity in the period is accurate</li>
<li>Comparing the deferred revenue roll forward calculation and deferred revenue balance in the general ledger.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the beginning deferred revenue, cash, and ending deferred revenue balances have been substantiated, then there is reasonable assurance that revenue for the period is also correct.</p>
<p>It may seem simple in this example, but calculating deferred revenue can be quite complicated. Because revenue is derived from sales in both the current and prior periods, companies with high volume of transactions and/or multiple product lines may experience additional difficulty calculating deferred revenue.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<div>

			
<p>For <a href="https://github.com/LeaVerou/css-almanac/issues/10">some of the statistics</a> we are going to study for this year’s Web Almanac we may end up needing a list of CSS shorthands and their longhands. Now this is typically done by <a href="https://github.com/LeaVerou/prefixfree/blob/gh-pages/prefixfree.js#L298">maintaining a data structure by hand</a> or <a href="https://github.com/LeaVerou/prefixfree/blob/gh-pages/prefixfree.js#L298">guessing based on property name structure</a>. But I knew that if we were going to do it by hand, it’s very easy to miss a few of the less popular ones, and the naming rule where shorthands are a prefix of their longhands <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Apr/0155.html">has failed to get standardized</a> and now has even more exceptions than it used to. And even if we do an incredibly thorough job, next year the data structure will be inaccurate, because CSS and its implementations evolve fast. The browser knows what the shorthands are, surely we should be able to get the information from it  …right? Then we could use it directly if this is a client-side library, or in the case of the Almanac, where code needs to be fast because it will run on millions of websites, paste the precomputed result into whatever script we run.</p>



<p>There are essentially two steps for this:</p>



<ol><li>Get a list of all CSS properties</li><li>Figure out how to test if a given property is a shorthand and how to get its longhands if so.</li></ol>



<p>I decided to tell this story in the inverse order. In my exploration, I first focused on figuring out shorthands (2), because I had coded getting a list of properties many times before, but since (1) is useful in its own right (and probably in more use cases), I felt it makes more sense to examine that first.</p>



<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> I’m using <code>document.body</code> instead of a dummy element in these examples, because I like to experiment in <code>about:blank</code>, and it’s just there and because this way you can just copy stuff to the console and try it wherever, even right here while reading this post. However, if you use this as part of code that runs on a real website, it goes without saying that you should create and test things on a dummy element instead!</em></p>



<h2>Getting a list of all CSS properties from the browser</h2>



<p>In Chrome and Safari, this is as simple as <code>Object.getOwnPropertyNames(document.body.style)</code>. However, in Firefox, this doesn’t work. Why is that? To understand this (and how to work around it), we need to dig a bit deeper.</p>



<p>In Chrome and Safari, <code>element.style</code> is a <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSStyleDeclaration">CSSStyleDeclaration</a></code> instance. In Firefox however, it is a <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSS2Properties">CSS2Properties</a></code> instance, which inherits from <code>CSSStyleDeclaration</code>. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSS2Properties"><code>CSS2Properties</code></a> is an older interface, defined in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSS2Properties">the DOM 2 Specification</a>, which is now obsolete. In the <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom/#the-cssstyledeclaration-interface">current relevant specification</a>, <code>CSS2Properties</code> is gone, and has been merged with <code>CSSStyleDeclaration</code>. However, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1290786">Firefox hasn’t caught up yet</a>.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lea.verou.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-2.png" alt=""><figcaption>Firefox on the left, Safari on the right. Chrome behaves like Safari.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Since the properties are on <code>CSSStyleDeclaration</code>, they are not own properties of <code>element.style</code>, so <code>Object.getOwnPropertyNames()</code> fails to return them. However, we can extract the <code>CSSStyleDeclaration</code> instance by using <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/proto">__proto__</a></code> or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/getPrototypeOf">Object.getPrototypeOf()</a>, and then <code>Object.getOwnPropertyNames(Object.getPrototypeOf(document.body.style))</code> gives us what we want! </p>



<p>So we can combine the two to get a list of properties regardless of browser:</p>



<pre><code>let properties = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(
	style.hasOwnProperty("background")? 
	style : style.__proto__
);</code></pre>



<p>And then, we just drop non-properties, and de-camelCase:</p>



<pre><code>properties = properties.filter(p =&gt; style[p] === "") // drop functions etc
	.map(prop =&gt; { // de-camelCase
		prop = prop.replace(/[A-Z]/g, function($0) { return '-' + $0.toLowerCase() });

		if (prop.indexOf("webkit-") &gt; -1) {
			prop = "-" + prop;
		}

		return prop;
	});</code></pre>



<p>You can see a <a href="https://codepen.io/leaverou/pen/eYJodjb?editors=0010">codepen with the result here</a>:</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2>Testing if a property is a shorthand and getting a list of longhands</h2>



<p>The main things to note are:</p>



<ul><li>When you set a shorthand on an element’s inline style, you are essentially setting all its longhands.</li><li><code>element.style</code> is actually array-like, with numerical properties and <code>.length</code> that gives you the number of properties set on it. This means you can use the spread operator on it:</li></ul>



<pre><code>&gt; document.body.style.background = "red";
&gt; [...document.body.style] 
&lt; [
	"background-image", 
	"background-position-x", 
	"background-position-y", 
	"background-size", 
	"background-repeat-x", 
	"background-repeat-y", 
	"background-attachment", 
	"background-origin", 
	"background-clip", 
	"background-color"
]</code></pre>



<p>Interestingly, <code>document.body.style.cssText</code> serializes to <code>background: red</code> and not all the longhands.</p>



<p>There is one exception: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/all">The <code>all</code> property</a>. In Chrome, it does not quite behave as a shorthand:</p>



<pre><code>&gt; document.body.style.all = "inherit";
&gt; [...document.body.style]
&lt; ["all"]</code></pre>



<p>Whereas in Safari and Firefox, it actually returns every single property <em>that is not a shorthand</em>!</p>



<figure><img src="https://lea.verou.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-1.png" alt=""><figcaption>Firefox and Safari expand <code>all</code> to literally all non-shorthand properties.</figcaption></figure>



<p>While this is interesting from a trivia point of view, it doesn’t actually matter for our use case, since we don’t typically care about <code>all</code> when constructing a list of shorthands, and if we do we can always add or remove it manually.</p>



<p>So, to recap, we can easily get the longhands of a given shorthand:</p>



<pre><code>function getLonghands(property) {
	let style = document.body.style;
	style[property] = "inherit"; // a value that works in every property
	let ret = [...style];
	style.cssText = ""; // clean up
	return ret;
}</code></pre>



<h2>Putting the pieces together</h2>



<p>You can see how all the pieces fit together (and the output!) in <a href="https://codepen.io/leaverou/pen/gOPEJxz?editors=0010">this codepen</a>:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>How many of these shorthands did you already know? </p>

  <section>
      <p>Core thesis: One coherent narrative of the past 50 years of human civilization progress:</p>
<ul>
<li>We went from a materially scarce society to a materially abundant one; and</li>
<li>from an informationally scarce society to an informationally abundant one.</li>
<li>The challenge of this decade is attention scarcity. Many of the day-to-day used tools and content in social spaces are actively misaligned, and operating on the basis of soaking up attention for monetization. And because the financial engine underlying this is <a href="https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/09/23/out-to-get-you/" target="_blank">unbounded</a> (unlike people's honest effort, which is not), on a sufficiently long timespan (such as where we are circa ~2020), this engine eats up everything.</li>
</ul>

<p>To unpack the problem a bit:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>"…Tools and tricks that casinos and psychologists and others have used for decades, have been sharpened and personalised and put in your pocket leashes around your brain to tug at you and -yeah I know how dramatic that sounds but nonetheless- it is the explicit goal of many of these systems." "it’s easy to point at the worst of them but.. What’s on my mind a lot is I’m almost more worried about what they’ve done to the whole landscape of attention around them because they’ve become so good at capturing your attention. They’ve upped an evolutionary competition from everything else in the world.</em></li>
<li><em>Everything that survives on human attention all entertainment and media has to evolve better ways at capturing that attention or risk starvation or replacement by a more fit species. The intent is not malicious it’s just blind evolution, which is far more concerning because there’s almost nothing that can be done.</em></li>
<li><em>You’re trying to walk a narrow path through a jungle full of things calling to you and with competition comes specialization: even if you know how to avoid the top predators something less obviously dangerous may get you. The tension traps don’t have to be flashy and fast: some work better with a kind of repetitive dullness because they hook into your mind exactly, or symbiotic species form a little loop that you just circle endlessly going from one to the other to another and back again.</em></li>
<li><em>I worry this is creating an attentionally deficit society that you constantly have a brain tugged at and pulled at is to end up with a brain so used to having its time and attention captured and consumed that even if you step away briefly you’re left with a mind unable to be on its own to be idle to reflect.”</em> Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf2VxeIm1no" target="_blank">CPG Grey: Walk with me</a></li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>gwern: "Underuse of System II particularly manifests as over-exploitation/under-exploration, where large potential improvements are foregone because of a lack of a habit or other systematic factor which would trigger exploration. [..] One way to measure under-exploration is noting instances where exogenous randomization or destruction of the status quo option leads to permanent changes or net efficiency gains after the shock is removed, indicating learning or that the status quo was suboptimal all along."</li>
<li>Like with drugs, the issue with these platforms is that they make you feel okay with being bored; while boredom is a trigger for needing to do something more; and these platforms, like a sponge, soak up that extra energy, and redirect it towards hate.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Taxonomy of attention problems:</h2>

<p>Software scaffolds:</p>
<ul>
<li>youtube &amp; wall/feeds selecting for content which maximizes the "engagement" / amount of time you're spending there; at extremes, this happens by driving people to more extremist content, but the algo tends to find it's way around attention barriers</li>
<li>software scaffolds optimizing for drama-maximization. Worst offender here used to be Tumblr, which allowed people to pick-quote specific parts from an overall article, without backlinks, or context present. This created a strong evolutionary pressure for the most anger-inducing pieces to spread, which could then further mutate, and become a super-germ</li>
<li>To a lesser extent, Twitter does the same</li>
</ul>

<p>Culture scaffolds:</p>
<ul>
<li>controversy igniting thought-germs evolution. "If there is some argument that splits the population, and lasts forever, you're looking at a super-successful pair of symbiotic anger germs, that have reached ecological stability" (CGP Grey, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE3j_RHkqJc" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE3j_RHkqJc</a> ) . This is known as the "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731210923/http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/" target="_blank">toxoplasma of rage</a>".</li>
<li>people taking offense &amp; offense taking being rewarded, which feeds more anxiety in target group: people "<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23640135" target="_blank">sit around looking to be offended to raise their own social value amonst their online peers</a>."</li>
<li>These things can happen naturally, but more often than not are deliberately led by a "lapidation entrepreneur" : <em>"&nbsp;Someone makes a mistake, or a foolish or offensive comment, and lapidators come out in force, often in a state of frenzy. Usually they are led by lapidation entrepreneurs, who have their own agenda. They might be concerned with self-promotion. They might be concerned with promoting a cause or with defeating an opponent, for whom the lapidation victim is taken to stand, or can be made to stand. They may want to make the occasion for lapidation stand for the opponent, so that the opponent, or the cause for which they stand, is that occasion." </em> [ <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3407390" target="_blank">Lapidation and Apology by Cass R. Sunstein</a> ]</li>
</ul>



<h2>Solutions:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The general meta-problem with any short-term hacks, is the strong incentive for the memes, and the agents in the system to hack around any published solutions, and so they aren't <a href="https://sdrinf.com/reflection-completeness" target="_blank">reflection-complete</a>: the more people know about them, the less they work. Solutions below therefore fall into categories of: either non-scaleable, hard to reach, or have an incentive that is more aligned with the user</li>
<li>For gathering data on how aligned your infospace is with your own values,&nbsp;KPIs:</li>
<li>"<em>A key metric of mental health is how many of your thoughts are new thoughts (sentences you haven't spoken inside your mind before) vs old thoughts (words that have run through your mind many times).</em>" (by EY)</li>
<li>a good qualitative exercise, is to regularly ask yourself how a piece of content makes you feel. If your first intuitive feeling is anger, you might just be looking at a particularly fit piece of toxoplasma.&nbsp;</li>
<li>a good quantitative exercise is taking snapshots of your monitor every 30 seconds (autoscreen) for a day, or two, then reviewing where you're spending your time on, and deciding whether you're okay with such allocation of your time</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Things which currently work: small communities, where there is a barrier of entry, for enduring connections (iterative, infinite game, as opposed to transient one-shots prominent on large social networks); reputational capital, and knowing eachother for a long periods of time</li>
<li>A leverage point in avoiding toxoplasma, is the bridge people: people who are being rewarded for taking offense, and therefore select for the worst possible behavior of the outgroup. These people act as <em>stressors</em>, specifically triggering ideations of worst-case-scenarios. The fix here is removing these people from your feeds/circles of influence.</li>
<li>participating in non-US communities. There are two angles here: the business models of many US corps can't be made economical in non-US territories, and therefore they don't target these; and for US-specific culture pieces, anything which does show up goes through the great filter of geography -had to be deemed useful enough for other countries to include it in their communities.</li>
<li>Self-hosted systems for anything valuable. Dropbox -&gt; owncloud, filters below</li>
<li>filters, filters everywhere</li>
<li>One of the most promising solution is coming from MIT media labs: <a href="https://gobo.social/" target="_blank">https://gobo.social/</a> which allows you to (transparently) filter your twitter / facebook feeds based on preferences. Imperfect, but directionally correct</li>
<li>For Twitter, I wrote my own filter which uses ML magic to classify individual tweets according to pre-labelled tags.</li>
<li>Software filters, a lot of them. Specifically:</li>
<li>Against advertisement (ublock origin, and it's many extensions)</li>
<li>Against being enrolled into targeting systems (again, ublock to filter out client-side JS tech)</li>
<li>Tampermonkey for overriding site's defaults (eg opting out from dark design patterns)</li>
<li>Site-specific filters: HN keyword filter, reddit enhancement suite, fluffbusting purity</li>
<li>For specific keyword list, see eg <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BestOfNoPolitics/wiki/filters" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/BestOfNoPolitics/wiki/filters</a></li>
<li>Mental filters, selecting for reliable/useful information sources:</li>
<li>The best source on this is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtN07XYqqWSKpPrtNDiCHTzU" target="_blank">Crash Course: Navigating Digital Information</a> , highly recommended</li>
<li>When evaluating a site/social account:</li>
<li>Who is behind this information? Friends/person/company? &amp; Why are they sharing it? What are the incentives in that content being read?</li>
<li>What is the evidence for their claims? Is it backed up with evidence? Is that evidence from a reliable source?</li>
<li>search for opposite -is there any evidence *against* it?</li>
<li>Lateral reading: Lateral reading: you have to leave the site to understand the site. Read content side-by-side with what others have to say about it. What do other sources say about the organization and its claims?</li>
<li>[ref:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZsaA0w_0z0&amp;index=2&amp;list=PL8dPuuaLjXtN07XYqqWSKpPrtNDiCHTzU" target="_blank">The Facts about Fact Checking</a>&nbsp;@ CC]</li>
<li>Being very selective for the communities I participate in. At the very basic level, still-working communities have either very strong moderation, some barrier of entry (payment, knowing about the community in the first place, initial onboarding interview), or more likely all of the above</li>
<li>Aggressively filtering out people who take offense, replicate the toxoplasma of rage, or are otherwise being animated by memes. Specific exercise for this: open fb feed, read until you find a thing which does not improves your life, click on owner (author / group) -click “friend” -&gt; unfollow. Iterate until sanity is restored.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, a bit of activism, which when scaled up to large number of people can actually correct for some of this:</p>
<ul>
<li>For persons, the constructive way to nudge into proper behavior is sending them a friendly pm on how to make the conversations more productive: <a href="https://devonzuegel.com/post/the-silence-is-deafening" target="_blank">https://devonzuegel.com/post/the-silence-is-deafening</a></li>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The software ecosystem has a lot of useful but unsafe code, and the easier it is to sandbox that code, the more
often that’ll happen. If it were as simple as passing the compiler a <code>--sandbox</code> flag
that makes an unsafe library unable to see or affect anything
outside of it, that would be incredible! We can’t get it quite that easy,
but this post describes <strong>WasmBoxC</strong>, a sandboxing approach that is
very simple to use. All you need to do is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Compile the unsafe library using a <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> (wasm) compiler instead of the normal system compiler</strong>.
That uses wasm internally, but you don’t need to care about that —
all you see is it emits a C file with sandboxed code.</li>
  <li><strong>Write some C to interface with the compiled C of the unsafe library</strong>. (This is
necessary because the sandboxed code can’t access outside memory, and also it
uses the portable wasm ABI.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Compile and link that C code, and now that unsafe library is sandboxed from the rest of your application!
In a later section we’ll see concrete examples of how easy both those steps are.</p>

<p>Here is the approach in more detail:</p>

<p><img src="https://kripken.github.io/blog/assets/wasmboxc.png" alt="unsafe code => safe wasm => safe c => safe native"></p>

<p>By <strong>compiling to wasm</strong> we sandbox the code, preventing it from accessing
anything on the outside.
That includes both <em>memory</em> - the sandboxed code can’t read or write to anywhere outside it -
and <em>capabilities</em> - the sandboxed code can’t do anything but pure computation,
unless you give it a function to call to do things like read from a file, tell
the time, etc.
We also get the rest of the wasm guarantees on
<a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/security/">safety</a> and
<a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/portability/">portability</a>. Wasm
sandboxing is even safe to run in the same process as other code (at least modulo
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)">Spectre-type</a>
vulnerabilities), much like
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Software Fault Isolation (SFI)</a>.</p>

<p>After we’ve compiled an unsafe library to wasm, how can we run it as part of our
application?
We could integrate a wasm VM and run the wasm there. But instead,
with WasmBoxC we take a <strong>VM-less</strong> approach and compile the wasm into native
code, while preserving the wasm semantics, including the sandboxing.
That native code can be linked normally into an application, which
is much simpler than integrating a wasm VM.</p>

<p>The specific approach WasmBoxC takes to compile wasm into native code is to
<strong>compile it to C</strong> using
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt">wabt</a>’s
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/tree/master/wasm2c">wasm2c</a> tool,
and then run a standard C compiler on it. In fact,
WasmBoxC’s approach compiles into a <strong>simple subset of C</strong>.
This is a big part of what makes this approach so simple, and
brings several advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s easy to read and verify the generated C for security.</li>
  <li>It lets us use a C compiler like clang or gcc to make the sandboxed
code very fast.</li>
  <li>It’s very easy to use the code in existing build systems.</li>
  <li>It’s easy to write code to interact with the sandbox.</li>
  <li>A single build of C code can be compiled and run on practically any platform,
and code to interact with the sandbox also only needs to be written once.</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite the simplicity of using C, WasmBoxC sandboxing has low
overhead: just <strong>14%</strong> with some non-portable C code (the
“signal handler trick”, see later), or <strong>42%</strong> in 100% portable C
(with no OS- or CPU-specific operations at all). We’ll also see that there are options
in between those 14% and 42% numbers.</p>

<p>The basic idea in WasmBoxC is simple and
<a href="https://twitter.com/FlohOfWoe/status/1011523018428780544">not original</a>.
What is
new in this post is showing that the approach works, doing
benchmarking on real-world code to show it is fast, presenting complete examples of how
easy it is to sandbox real-world libraries, and writing up the approach in
detail to describe the benefits (see in particular the section on memory-safe
languages).
This post also invents a name for the technique.</p>

<h2 id="speed">Speed</h2>

<p>To get an idea of WasmBoxC’s speed, let’s take a look at
<a href="https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/master/tests/test_benchmark.py">20 benchmarks</a>,
comparing clang 9.0.1, clang 11 (dev version as of May 23 2020), gcc 9.2.1, and
WasmBoxC. All numbers are normalized to clang 9 (which is therefore equal to 1; lower numbers are better).</p>

<p><img src="https://kripken.github.io/blog/assets/wasmboxc-perf.png" alt="performance results"></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>compiler</th>
      <th>relative speed</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>clang 9.0.1</td>
      <td>1.00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>clang 11 (dev)</td>
      <td>0.97</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>gcc 9.2.1</td>
      <td>0.93</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>WasmBoxC (explicit)</td>
      <td>1.42</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>WasmBoxC (OS-based)</td>
      <td>1.14</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>These benchmarks include a wide variety of code, and the ones prefixed with <code>zzz_</code> are real-world
codebases or benchmarks:
the 
<a href="https://box2d.org/">Box2D</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_(software)">Bullet</a>
physics engines, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coremark">CoreMark</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINPACK_benchmarks">LINPACK</a>
benchmarks, the
<a href="https://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> VM (one GC and one computational benchmark),
the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm">LZMA</a>
and
<a href="https://zlib.net/">zlib</a>
compression libraries,
and the
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a> database.
Incidentally, this shows WasmBoxC can run all of
these today!</p>

<p>Two results are shown for WasmBoxC, representing two implementations of memory sandboxing. The first is <strong>explicit</strong> sandboxing, in which each memory load and store is explicitly verified to be within the sandboxed memory using an explicit check (that is, an <code>if</code> statement is done before each memory access). This has <strong>42%</strong> overhead.</p>

<p>The <strong>OS-based</strong> implementation uses the
“<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/pull/1442/files#diff-e962256d2c336a13791ce03c1dae5d2fR106">signal handler trick</a>” that
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/3334d8dff757051c7a359818e0ceb5ad7852fdbc/js/src/wasm/WasmSignalHandlers.cpp">wasm</a>
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17y4kxuHFrVxAiuCP_FFtFA2HP5sNPsCD10KEx17Hz6M/edit#heading=h.tbi7hpbheoai">VMs</a>
use.
This technique reserves lots of memory around the valid range and relies on
CPU hardware to give us a signal if an access is out of bounds
(for more background see section 3.1.4 in
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Tan, 2017</a>).
That is fully safe and has the benefit of avoiding explicit bounds checks. It has
just <strong>14%</strong> overhead! However, it cannot be used everywhere (it needs
signals and CPU memory protection, and only works on 64-bit systems).</p>

<p>There are more options in between those 14% and 42% figures.
Explicit and OS-based sandboxing preserve wasm semantics perfectly, that is, a trap
will happen exactly when a wasm VM would have trapped. If we are willing to relax
that
(but we may not want to <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/pull/1432">call it wasm</a> if we do)
then we can use masking sandboxing instead
(see section 3.1.3 in
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Tan, 2017</a>),
which is 100% portable like explicit sandboxing and also prevents any accesses
outside of the sandbox, and is somewhat faster at <strong>29%</strong> overhead. Other sandboxing
improvements are possible too - almost no effort has gone into this yet.</p>

<p>An interesting thing happens in the <code>lua_binarytrees</code> and <code>havlak</code> benchmarks,
where WasmBoxC is actually faster than both gcc and clang in all sandboxing modes,
up to 32%! How can we beat normal native builds, and by so much?
<a href="https://twitter.com/kripken/status/1262092956070109185">Looking into this</a>,
both of these benchmarks use a lot of <code>malloc</code>s and data structures with pointers.
Like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X32_ABI">x32 ABI</a>, wasm is 32-bit,
so pointers take half the space. Measuring the maximum process memory used
in <code>lua_binarytrees</code>, WasmBoxC uses 33% less which helps a lot with CPU cache usage.
While this makes a big difference on these two benchmarks, we are likely
getting some speedup on the others as well due to this factor, as on average x32
is faster than normal x64
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X32_ABI#Details">by around 5-8%</a>.
Wasm is a nice way to get something
like x32’s benefits!</p>

<p>The benchmarking here measures performance <em>within</em> the sandbox. It
does not measure the speed of calls from the outside in or inside out. Such
calls can be very fast because the sandboxed code is just C, which means that
we can even inline across the sandbox boundary — safely! — if we do
LTO. I verified that happens in the sandboxing example in the next section,
see later. (Note, however, then using the signal handler trick may make things
more complicated here.)</p>

<p>Some final notes on performance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We can compile WasmBoxC’s C code with any native compiler. In the
above we did so always with clang 9 for simplicity. The results vary a little
when changing the compiler, for example the “explicit” sandboxing results go from
14% up to 16% with gcc 9.2 or down to 11% with clang 11. There’s nothing magical about
that 14% figure — we are at the point where native compiler differences matter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Results should improve over time as wasm adds more performance features
like <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/simd">simd</a> (note that the native compilers we
compared to may have gained an advantage from autovectorization).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That WasmBoxC can reach 14% overhead shows that the
cost of compiling through wasm (which cannot represent irreducible control
flow, for example) is fairly low, and also that current compilers to wasm are
not introducing significant unnecessary overhead.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve done my best to measure everything here carefully and accurately, but
it’s possible I’ve made a mistake somewhere. Please check my work and see if you
get similar results!</p>

<h2 id="ease-of-use">Ease of use</h2>

<p>This section has a full example of WasmBoxC usage. Here are the source files:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// my-code.c</span>

<span>#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</span>
<span>// We could also include the .wasm.h file for these,</span>
<span>// but let's declare externs manually for the example.</span>

<span>extern</span> <span>void</span> <span>wasmbox_init</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>);</span>

<span>extern</span> <span>uint32_t</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>Z_twiceZ_ii</span><span>)(</span><span>uint32_t</span><span>);</span>

<span>extern</span> <span>uint32_t</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>Z_do_bad_thingZ_ii</span><span>)(</span><span>uint32_t</span><span>);</span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"Initializing sandboxed unsafe library"</span><span>);</span>
  <span>wasmbox_init</span><span>();</span>
  <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Calling twice on 21 returns %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>Z_twiceZ_ii</span><span>(</span><span>21</span><span>));</span>
  <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"Calling something bad now..."</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Z_do_bad_thingZ_ii</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
  <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"(this will never be printed, as the bad thing will trap)"</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>main()</code> is pretty simple: Initialize, call something in the sandbox that does a
computation for us, and call something that will trap inside the sandbox.
(What’s with the <code>Z_</code> stuff? See later in “API”.)</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// unsafe-lib.c</span>

<span>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
</span>
<span>__attribute__</span><span>((</span><span>used</span><span>))</span>
<span>int</span> <span>twice</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>__attribute__</span><span>((</span><span>used</span><span>))</span>
<span>int</span> <span>do_bad_thing</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>size</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Allocate an unknown size here (so the LLVM optimizer doesn't know if the</span>
  <span>// store later down is valid or not).</span>
  <span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>malloc</span><span>(</span><span>size</span><span>);</span>
  <span>// Write to an address that is definitely not in the sandbox (the default</span>
  <span>// memory size is much smaller), which in wasm will trap.</span>
  <span>x</span><span>[</span><span>1024</span> <span>*</span> <span>1024</span> <span>*</span> <span>1024</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span><span>;</span>
  <span>// Avoid the optimizer knowing the store can never be observed.</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span><span>)</span><span>x</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>twice()</code> does what you’d expect, and <code>do_bad_thing</code> does a store that will
definitely trap. (Ignore the details there; for this example we need the LLVM optimizer not to
remove the bad code as undefined behavior!)</p>

<p>And here’s how easy it is to use WasmBoxC to get a fully sandboxed library linked with our normal code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># build our main code to an object normally</span>
<span>$ </span>clang my-code.c         <span>-c</span> <span>-O3</span> <span>-o</span> my-code.o

<p>In this post, we will experiment and observe how keeping
the important regions of an image and masking the rest affects the accuracy of
several state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks.</p>

<h2 id="important-pixels-and-where-to-find-them">Important pixels and where to find them</h2>

<p>Explainability in machine learning is an increasingly popular topic - understanding
why certain predictions were made is necessary for humans to trust machine learning models
and deploy them in real-life scenarios.
Several methods have been proposed already, like LIME <a href="#lime">(Ribeiro et al., 2016)</a>
 and KernelSHAP <a href="#NIPS2017_7062">(Lundberg &amp; Lee, 2017)</a>, which
allow us to understand which parts of an input was important
for a particular prediction by assigning attribution scores to feature values. These
are model-agnostic methods, meaning that they do not assume anything about the
target model’s architecture or parameters (they are treated as black boxes).</p>

<p>Today we will look at a model-specific method, in particular, Integrated Gradients
<a href="#sundararajan2017axiomatic">(Sundararajan et al., 2017)</a>.
This method is focused on neural networks as it relies on being able to evaluate the gradients
of the model’s output with respect to the input. The goal of Integrated Gradients is to
figure out which pixels in an image contributed most to the neural network’s prediction.</p>

<figure>
<p><img src="https://seansaito.github.io/images/masked-accuracy/ig_examples.png" alt="ig_0" height="100%" width="100%"></p>
  <figcaption>Fig 1. Example outputs of Integrated Gradients. The attributions are sharper
compared to simply taking the gradients (source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01365">arxiv</a>).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So how does Integrated Gradients work? The method involves taking the
input image, the neural network, and some baseline image
(e.g. a black image or random noise) to observe how the model’s prediction changes as we
linearly interpolate between the baseline and input images. In particular, we measure the
gradients at each interval of a linear path between the input and the baseline, then summing
the gradients to find the final attributions per pixel. More formally, Integrated Gradients
are calculated as follows:</p><p>

\[\begin{equation*}

IntegratedGradients_i(x) = \frac{x_i - b_i}{m} \sum_{h=1}^m
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}( b + \frac{h}{m}(x-b) )

\end{equation*}\]

</p><p>This equation finds the attribution value of each pixel $i$ in the input image $x$.
$b$ represents the baseline image, and $m$ is the number of steps between $x$ and $b$,
so $b + \frac{h}{m}(x-b)$ is the interpolation between $x$ and $b$ at step $h$ out of $m$.
We then get the gradient of the model output $f$ at pixel $x_i$ for this interpolated input
($\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}$). Finally we evaluate the weighted sum of the gradients at each
interpolation step $h$ to find the Integrated Gradients attribution for each pixel.</p>

<figure>
<p><img src="https://seansaito.github.io/images/masked-accuracy/ig_intuition.png" alt="ig_0" height="100%" width="100%"></p>
  <figcaption>Fig 2. An illustration of what Integrated Gradients does.
We start from two points in the image space, the input image and some baseline,
and we calculate the gradients of the network at each point along the way. Summing all
the gradients gives us the Integrated Gradients attributions. Kudos to
<a href="https://de.linkedin.com/in/marco-spinaci">Marco Spinaci</a> for sharing the graphic!</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Integrated Gradients supports several axioms which are desirable for gradient attribution
methods. While we won’t discuss these in detail, here’s a very brief summary of each:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sensitivity</strong>: if two inputs differ by one pixel and get different predictions, then
that pixel should get a non-zero attribution score.</li>
  <li><strong>Implementation invariance</strong>: if two models have the same outputs for every input, then
Integrated Gradients should produce the same attributions for both models, even if they
are implemented differently.</li>
  <li><strong>Completeness</strong>: the attribution scores computed by Integrated Gradients should sum to
the difference between the prediction of the input image and that of the baseline.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do checkout their <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01365">paper</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/ankurtaly/Integrated-Gradients/blob/master/icml_slides.pdf">slides</a>
for more details! We will now move onto the experiments.</p>

<h2 id="masking-out-unimportant-parts">Masking out unimportant parts</h2>

<p>Here are the steps we take to mask out an image using integrated gradients:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Inputs: an image, a model, cut off percentage $p$</li>
  <li>Apply Integrated Gradients on the image</li>
  <li>Create “components” but summing the attribution scores of 3x3 squares</li>
  <li>Select the top $p \%$ of 3x3 squares based on total attribution scores</li>
  <li>Set pixels not in top $p \%$ of components (i.e. the unimportant parts) to zero</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s important to note that, taking the top 50% of gradient attributions does not mean
taking 50% of all pixels. We rely on the PyTorch implementation found
<a href="https://github.com/TianhongDai/integrated-gradient-pytorch">here</a>
for computing Integrated Gradients attributions. We apply this procedure to all
validation images in ImageNet to create a masked dataset. For $p$, we choose a range
of values (90, 70, 50, and 30).</p>

<p>Here are some example images:</p>

<figure>
<p><img src="https://seansaito.github.io/images/masked-accuracy/ig_grid_1.png" alt="ig_0" height="100%" width="100%"></p>
  <figcaption>Fig 3. Example images of the masked dataset.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Most images are still recognisable when $p=90$ or $p=70$, whereas the objects are
no longer identifiable when $p=30$.</p>

<p>We compare several pre-trained models from PyTorch’s <code>torchvision.models</code> module
(<a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html">documentation</a>). For these
experiments, we will just compare the top-1 accuracies of each model on the masked datasets.</p>

</figure>

<p>Accuracy deteriorates as $p$ decreases, and at $p=30$ the models are only
slightly better than random guessing. What’s surprising is that, even when we keep the
top 90% of gradient attributions and their respective pixels,
the models’ accuracies drop significantly (more than half for VGG-16!).
The results suggest that these convolutional neural networks require the entirety of
the image in order to reach state-of-the-art accuracy, even if we keep the most important
features.</p>

<p>This got me thinking of another experiment to further test this hypothesis -
what if we deliberately mask out the important regions of an image and test the models’
accuracies? So instead of keep the top 90% of gradient attributions, we keep the bottom
10%. Such a dataset would look like this:</p>

<p>The lower $p$ is, the more visible the images are as we hide fewer pixels.
Here are the accuracies of each model:</p>

<p>As expected, accuracy increases as we decrease $p$. However, when you compare these
results to the first table, something weird is apparent. Take a look at $p=50$.
For the VGG-16 model, when we keep the <em>top</em> 50% of attributions, we get
an accuracy of 0.91%, whereas when we keep the <em>bottom</em> 50% worth of attributions,
we instead get 16.06%! Just to check, I compared images which keep the top 50% of
gradient attributions to images that keep the bottom 50%. One would assume that the
top 50% of gradient attributions and corresponding pixels would yield better visual
clues. Well, here’s the comparison:</p>

<figure>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Model</th>
      <th>Top 50% of gradient attributions</th>
      <th>Bottom 50% of gradient attributions</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>VGG-16</td>
      <td>0.91</td>
      <td>16.06</td>

  <figcaption>Fig 5. A comparison of images keeping the top 50% and images
keeping the bottom 50% of gradient attributions</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For some images, keeping the top 50% of gradient attributions indeed carves out
the object itself (e.g. the medieval ship off the coast in the third image from
the left). But it does appear that, for some images, keeping the top 50% removes
too much context to the point where it’s even difficult for a human to identify the objects.
What do you think? As mentioned earlier, taking the top 50% of gradient attributions does not mean
taking 50% of all pixels. Therefore for some images, the top 50% of gradient attributions
may correspond to a smaller proportion of pixels.</p>

<h2 id="summary-and-thoughts">Summary and thoughts</h2>

<p>In this article, we explored Integrated Gradients, a popular way to generate
gradient-based attributions for each pixel, and use it to create datasets where we
mask out important or unimportant regions of pixels. We then experimented with several
state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks and measured their accuracies on these
datasets. Interestingly, even when keeping the top 90% of gradient attributions and their
corresponding pixels, the top-1 accuracies of these models drop significantly.
Perhaps even more surprising is that keeping
the bottom 50% of gradient attributions gave <em>higher</em> accuracy than keeping the
top 50%.</p>

<p>What conclusions can be made out of these experiments? It’s probably safe to say that
state-of-the-art neural networks require the entirety of the input image in order to
reach high performance. But these results have in fact raised more questions for me:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Why do the bottom half of gradient attributions yield higher accuracy than images
taking the top half?</li>
  <li>What if we train a model from scratch using one of these masked datasets? Or mix
regular images with these masked images? Would this improve model robustness?</li>
  <li>Is there (or should there exist)
some correlation between $p$ and overall accuracy of the model? E.g. if I keep
the top 90% of gradient attributions should I expect at least 90% of the original
accuracy?</li>
</ul>

<p>These questions would likely lead to separate investigations for the future. Do reach out
if you have questions, any ideas about the above questions, or want to collaborate!

<div>
<p>This week I received the latest 14in laptop from Lenovo, the T14s (AMD gen1). Below are some of the tweaks / setup I’ve done on my machine (and generally all my laptops) which typically increase the battery life (with no noticeable reduction in performance).</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated.jpeg"><img src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128.jpeg" alt="" width="700" height="500" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128.jpeg 1800w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128-300x214.jpeg 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128-1024x732.jpeg 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128-768x549.jpeg 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128-1536x1097.jpeg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128.jpeg" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128.jpeg 1800w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128-300x214.jpeg 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128-1024x732.jpeg 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128-768x549.jpeg 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128-1536x1097.jpeg 1536w"></a></p>
<p>The specs are as follows (Lenovo Thinkpad T14s):</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU – 8 Core, 16 Thread – AMD Ryzen 7 Pro 4750u</li>
<li>GPU – AMD Renoir</li>
<li>DISK – 2Tb – M.2 NVME SSD – 970 EVO Plus</li>
<li>RAM – 32 Gb</li>
<li>DISPLAY – 1080p low power (ISP)</li>
<li>KEYBOARD – backlit English</li>
</ul>
<p>As all my machines run on Arch Linux (with Gnome as the GUI), I went ahead and installed the latest build. It worked out of the box, no issues, was up in about an hour.</p>
<p>However, it does requires quite a few optimizations to get power consumption down on a laptop. The goal is always to maximize battery life, while enabling all the functions you’d normally do on a machine.</p>
<h2>BIOS</h2>
<p>On any new laptop, it’s often possible to disable features you don’t need in the BIOS. For instance, any 3rd party software and unused components (such as fingerprint scanner), Bluetooth, etc. can switched off. Often, this will power down those components and save battery.</p>
<p>In this case, I turned off the following components (it’s possible to turn them back on, if needed):</p>
<ul>
<li>Ethernet LAN</li>
<li>USB Port</li>
<li>Memory Card Slot</li>
<li>Smart Card Slot</li>
<li>Fingerprint Reader</li>
</ul>

<p>There is also some 3rd party software which apparently you can also uninstall:</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled.jpeg"><img src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled.jpeg" alt="" width="533" height="142" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled.jpeg 780w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled-300x80.jpeg 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled-768x205.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled.jpeg" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled.jpeg 780w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled-300x80.jpeg 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled-768x205.jpeg 768w"></a></p>
<p>That’s it! It’s possible to later turn on components if necessary. This should result in some minor reductions in power draw.</p>
<h2>TLP or PowerTop</h2>
<p>On the software side, the first step is to install <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Powertop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PowerTop</a>. This lets you manage and monitor <em>almost </em>everything you’ll need related to power consumption: turning off components, increasing system wakes, etc.</p>
<p>This can get rather complex, but for brevity: <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Powertop#Calibration_to_prevent_inaccurate_measurement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">start with calibrating PowerTop</a>. I should note, this will run several measurements, changing screen brightness, fan speed, etc. and will take some time (few minutes), so be prepared:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo powertop --calibrate
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Launch powertop with sudo:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo powertop</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Tab over to “Tunables” and turn on / off various recommendations. This can often result in 5-25% gains in battery life. To set all recommendations to “good”, utilize auto-tune:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo powertop --auto-tune</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This will automatically run all the possible recommendations.</p>
<p>Finally, if you’d like these changes to be persistent (aka not run the command every time you startup the laptop), it’s recommended you create a service:</p>
<pre>/etc/systemd/system/powertop.service</pre>

<p>Then enable the service:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo systemctl enable powertop.service</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This will automatically tune your computer to improve power utilization on boot (although it’ll slow the boot process 1-3 seconds).</p>
<p>It is also important to note that there is <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/TLP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TLP</a>, which also offers a similar service to PowerTop. There are some noticeable differences with TLP. TLP for instance, doesn’t shutdown all connected devices (i.e. PCI devices).</p>
<p>I personally chose TLP, but many other swear by PowerTop.</p>
<p>TLP requires a far more minimal setup:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo systemctl enable tlp.service</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2>Suspend vs Hibernate</h2>
<p>The next improvement that can dramatically improve the time between charges is modifying the suspend behavior.</p>
<p>Don’t know what suspend is?</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Suspend to RAM</strong> – Keep machine state in RAM. This requires keeping the RAM powered, but power is cut to other components of the system (keyboard, monitor, etc.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Essentially, when a laptop lid opens, it instantly boots, often before the laptop is fully ajar. This lets you get “right to work”, but that requires the RAM to be constantly powered.</p>
<p>There is an alternative method, often called <em>Suspend to Disk</em> or <em>Hibernation</em></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Hibernation (Suspend to Disk)</strong> – Saves the machine state into the <a href="https://www.linux.com/news/all-about-linux-swap-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>swap space</em></a> on disk and completely powers off the machine. When the lid is opened / machine is powered on, the machine state is loaded into RAM.</p></blockquote>
<p>The hibernation method can save power for very long periods, as it completely powers down the machine. The drawback is that (at least on my machine) it can take 10-30 seconds to boot into the prior state.</p>
<p>In addition, a <strong>swap file or partition is required</strong>. Note, it is recommend that the swap space is 2-3x than the available RAM.</p>
<p>The beauty, is it’s possible to marry the two methods called: <em>suspend-then-hibernate</em>. It’s possible to <em>suspend</em> for a duration of time (say one hour), then if the laptop isn’t brought out of <em>suspend</em> it will <em>hibernate</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Suspend then Hibernate</strong> – Keep the machine state in RAM for a duration of time, then transition to <em>Hibernation</em> on disk.</p></blockquote>
<p>I should note, it’s also possible to do both <em>suspend</em> and <em>hibernate</em> at the same time, in the case of power loss.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Suspend and Hibernate</strong> – The machine state is copied to the <em>swap space</em> and continues to be stored in RAM. The RAM will continue to draw power, but if power is lost the machine state can be recovered.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Closing the Lid</h2>
<p>The most effective power saving method (as discussed above) is to hibernate, every time.</p>
<p>However, it can be rather annoying to close a laptop, realize you need something, then reopen it and waiting 30 seconds for it to boot.</p>
<blockquote><p>Is a 30 second delay in booting your laptop worth the power savings?</p></blockquote>
<p>Honestly, most people should say it’s a worthy trade. Thirty seconds is a negligible amount of time, given we often open our laptops for hours.</p>
<p>That being said, there’s something primal about being able to open a laptop and being “ready-to-rock” in less than a few seconds. With that in mind, I used the <em>Suspend-then-Hibernate</em> configuration. The <em>suspend-then-hibernate</em> behavior will let the computer quickly boot for some specified amount of time (say 2 hours), after which it will enter the hibernation state.</p>
<h2>Hibernate Configuration</h2>
<p>First, to configure the <em>hibernate</em> behavior, simply edit the following files.</p>
<p>To get <em>hibernate</em> configured, inform GRUB where and how to swap. I personally recommend a swap partition over a swap file as the swap file appears to cause issues in some machines[<a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/6769/hibernate-and-resume-from-a-swap-file" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>].</p>
<p>To accomplish this, find the swap partition, and add the UUID to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT.</p>
<pre><strong>$ sudo lsblk</strong>
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
nvme0n1     259:0    0  1.8T  0 disk 
├─nvme0n1p1 259:1    0    1G  0 part  
├─nvme0n1p2 259:2    0   64G  0 part [SWAP]
└─nvme0n1p3 259:3    0  1.8T  0 part /
<strong>$ sudo lsblk -f | grep SWAP</strong>
├─nvme0n1p2 swap   1 &lt;UUID&gt;  [SWAP]</pre>
<p>Add the resume=UUID=&lt;PARTITION UUID&gt; to the following file:</p>
<pre>/etc/default/grub</pre>

<p>From there, you can start hibernating by adding the MAJ:MIN values for the swap partition to /sys/power/resume with the following command[<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Power_management/Suspend_and_hibernate#Hibernation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a>]:</p>
<pre>sudo echo 259:2 &gt; /sys/power/resume</pre>
<p>It should then be possible to hibernate.</p>
<p>To make the changes to GRUB on boot, execute the following:</p>
<pre>sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg</pre>
<p>At this point, a reboot is recommended.</p>
<h2>Suspend-Then-Hibernate Configuration</h2>
<p>Once it’s possible to enter &amp; wake from the hibernation state, we can then transition to the <em>suspend-then-hibernate</em> step. For this, we have to configure systemd to handle entering <em>hibernation</em> from the <em>suspend</em> state after a given period.</p>
<p>There are two edits here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set a delay in the sleep.conf, which will inform systemd how long to stay in the suspend state before hibernating.</li>
<li>Inform systemd the behavior of the power switch, lid closing, and suspend state.</li>
</ol>
<p>See the file edits below:</p>
<pre>/etc/systemd/sleep.conf</pre>

<pre>/etc/systemd/logind.conf</pre>

<p>The above enables closing the lid or clicking power button to trigger a <em>suspend-then-hibernate state.</em> For the first 45 minutes (in this case), the machine state will be kept in RAM. After 45 minutes (in this case), the machine state will write to disk and power down.</p>
<p>When the lid is next opened, if the machine is in the&nbsp;<em>suspend</em> state (&lt;45 minutes), logging in will take a second or two. If the machine is in the <em>hibernation</em> state, the system will power up, load the machine state into RAM, then let you login (~25-30 seconds).</p>
<h2>Quickly Recovering from Hibernation</h2>
<p>One quick way to speed up recovering from hibernation is to reduce the time the grub menu is up. To edit this, go to:</p>
<pre>/etc/default/grub</pre>
<p>And edit the following command, I changed it from GRUB_TIMEOUT=5 to:</p>
<pre>GRUB_TIMEOUT=1</pre>
<p>This saves an addition 4 seconds on boot, although this does mean you’ll have to act fast if you need to utilize the grub menu. After that, you’ll have to execute the following command for it to take effect:</p>
<pre>sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg</pre>
<p>Beyond speeding up GRUB, you can run the following command to analyze the boot up process via <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Improving_performance/Boot_process" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">systemd-analyze</a>:</p>
<pre>$ sudo systemd-analyze
Startup finished in 5.566s (firmware) + 2.088s (loader) 
+ 1.010s (kernel) + 9.702s (userspace) = 18.368s 
graphical.target reached after 9.614s in userspace</pre>
<p>To get a more detailed list use the blame or critical-chain argument:</p>
<pre>$ sudo systemd-analyze critical-chain
The time when unit became active or started is printed after the "@" character.
The time the unit took to start is printed after the "+" character.

<p>In this case, it appears the network manager is the real bottleneck. This is a <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NetworkManager#Enable_NetworkManager_Wait_Online" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">known issue</a>, and can be addressed by disabling the NetworkManager-wait-onine.service. Although, it should be noted this could cause your system to fail to boot, if the network daemons require internet connection (highly unadvised to use such systems on a …</p></div></article></div>

Hardly anybody I know of reads the physical newspaper – in fact the only people I know of are my parents and grandparents. What do the others do? The others open one of the news websites to stay updated with what’s happening. There may be many of us though, who don’t have a fixed website we like to read our news on, and generally open whichever we come across first. Have we ever stopped to think how much the news sites track readers?</p> <h2>Premise</h2><p>With the latest update of Snap Search, we’re now blocking more ads, trackers and analytics than ever before. To test the efficiency, we decided to try various news websites and see how these sites track readers.</p><p>To keep the competition fair, we picked 1 topic which all of them had written about – in this case about TV reporter Victoria Price who was diagnosed with cancer after a viewer emailed her to get a lump on her throat checked.</p><h2>Rules</h2><ol><li>The following list is not in any

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"> <h2>Intro</h2> <p>&nbsp; I want to examine together with you various types of sort algorithms and the tricks they use to lower the magic O number. I reach the conclusion that high performance algorithms that are labeled as specific to a certain type of data can be made generic or that the generic algorithms aren't really that generic either. I end up proposing a new form of function that can be fed to a sorting function in order to reach better performance than the classic O(n*log(n)). Extra bonus: finding distinct values in a list.</p> <h2>Sorting</h2> <p>&nbsp; But first, what is sorting? Given a list of items that can be compared to one another as lower or higher, return the list in the order from lowest to highest. Since an item can be any type of data record, to define a generic sorting algorithm we need to feed it the rules that make an item lower than another and that is called the comparison function. Let's try an example in Javascript:</p>  <pre><code>  // random function from start to end inclusive
  function rand(start, end) {
    return parseInt(start + Math.random() * (end - start + 1));
  }
  
  // measure time taken by an action and output it in console
  let perfKey = 0;
  function calcPerf(action) {
    const key = perfKey++;
    performance.mark('start_' + key);
    action();
    performance.mark('end_' + key);
    const measure = performance.measure('measure_' + key, 'start_' + key, 'end_' + key);
    console.log('Action took ' + measure.duration);
  }
  
  // change this based on how powerful the computer is
  const size = 10000000;
  // the input is a list of size 'size' containing random values from 1 to 50000
  const input = [];
  for (let i = 0; i &lt; size; i++)
    input.push(rand(1, 50000));
  
  // a comparison function between two items a and b
  function comparisonFunction(a, b) {
    if (a &gt; b)
      return 1;
    if (a &lt; b)
      return -1;
    return 0;
  }
  
  const output = [];
  // copy input into output, then sort it using the comparison function
  // same copying method will be used for future code
  calcPerf(() =&gt; {
    for (let i = 0; i &lt; size; i++)
      output.push(input[i]);
    output.sort(comparisonFunction);
  });
</code></pre> <p>&nbsp; It's not the crispest code in the world, but it's simple to understand:</p> <ul><li>calcPerf is computing the time it takes for an action to take and logs it to the console</li> <li>start by creating a big array of random numbers as input</li> <li>the array in a result array and sorting it with the default sort function, to which we give the comparison function</li> <li>display the time it took for the operation.</li></ul> <p>&nbsp; This takes about 4500 milliseconds on my computer.</p> <p>&nbsp; Focus on the comparison function. It takes two items and returns a number that is -1, 0 or 1 depending on whether the first item is smaller, equal or larger than the second. Now let's consider the sorting algorithm itself. How does it work?</p> <p>&nbsp; A naive way to do it would be to find the smallest item in the list, move it to the first position in the array, then continue the process with the rest of the array. This would have a complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>). If you don't know what the O complexity is, don't worry, it just provides an easy to spell approximation of how the amount of work would increase with the number of items in the input. In this case, 10 million records, squared, would lead to 100 trillion operations! That's not good.</p> <p>&nbsp; Other algorithms are much better, bringing the complexity to O(n*log(n)), so assuming base 10, around 70 million operations. But how do they improve on this? Surely in order to sort all items you must compare them to each other. The explanation is that if a&lt;b and b&lt;c you do not need to compare a to c. And each algorithm tries to get to this in a different way.</p> <p>&nbsp; However, the basic logic of sorting remains the same: compare all items with a subset of the other items.</p> <h2>Partitioning</h2> <p>&nbsp; A very common and recommended sorting algorithm is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="sometimes called partition-exchange sort, Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.">QuickSort</a>. I am not going to go through the entire history of sorting algorithms and what they do, you can check that out yourself, but I can focus on the important innovation that QuickSort added: partitioning. The first step in the algorithm is to choose a value out of the list of items, which the algorithm hopes it's as close as possible to the median value and is called a pivot, then arrange the items in two partitions: the ones smaller than the pivot and the ones larger than the pivot. Then it proceeds on doing the same to each partition until the partitions are small enough to be sorted by some other sort algorithm, like insertion sort (used by Chrome by default).</p> <p>&nbsp; Let's try to do this manually in our code, just the very first run of the step, to see if it improves the execution time. Lucky for us, we know that the median is around 25000, as the input we generated contains random numbers from 1 to 50000. So let's copy the values from input into two output arrays, then sort each of them. The sorted result would be reading from the first array, then from the second!</p>  <pre><code>  // two output arrays, one for numbers below 25000, the other for the rest
  const output1 = [];
  const output2 = [];
  const pivot = 25000;
  
  calcPerf(() =&gt; {
    for (let i = 0; i &lt; size; i++) {
      const val = input[i];
      if (comparisonFunction(val, pivot) &lt; 0)
        output1.push(val);
      else
        output2.push(val);
    }
    // sorting smaller arrays is cheaper
    output1.sort(comparisonFunction);
    output2.sort(comparisonFunction);
  });
</code></pre> <p>&nbsp; Now, the performance is slightly better. If we do this several times, the time taken would get even lower. The partitioning of the array by an operation that is essentially O(n) (we just go once through the entire input array) reduces the comparisons that will be made in each partition. If we would use the naive sorting, partitioning would reduce n<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>to n+(n/2)<sup>2</sup>+(n/2)<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;(once for each partitioned half), thus n+n<sup>2</sup>/2. Each partitioning almost halves the number of operations!</p> <p>&nbsp; So, how many times can we half the number of operations for? Imagine that we do this with an array of distinct values, from 1 to 10 million. In the end, we would get to partitions of just one element and that means we did a log<sub>2</sub>(n) number of operations and for each we added one n (the partitioning operation). That means that the total number of operations is... n*log(n). Each algorithm gets to this in a different way, but at the core of it there is some sort of partitioning, that b value that makes comparing a and c unnecessary.</p> <p>&nbsp; Note that we treated the sort algorithm as "generic", meaning we fed it a comparison function between any two items, as if we didn't know how to compare numbers. That means we could have used any type of data as long as we knew the rule for comparison between items.</p> <p>&nbsp; There are other types of sorting algorithms that only work on specific types of data, though. Some of them claim a complexity of O(n)! But before we get to them, let's make a short detour.</p> <h3>Distinct values</h3> <p>&nbsp; Another useful operation with lists of items is finding the list of distinct items. From [1,2,2,3] we want to get [1,2,3]. To do this, we often use something called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="an ordered tree data structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings. Unlike a binary search tree, no node in the tree stores the key associated with that node; instead, its position in the tree defines the key with which it is associated; i.e., the value of the key is distributed across the structure.">trie</a>, a tree-like data structure that is used for quickly finding if a value exists or not in a list. It's the thing used for autocorrect or finding a word in a dictionary. It has an O(log n) complexity in checking if an item exists. So in a list of 10 million items, it would take maybe 20 operations to find the item exists or not. That's amazing! You can see that what it does is partition the list down to the item level.</p> <p>&nbsp; Unfortunately, this only works for numbers and strings and such primitive values. If we want to make it generic, we need to use a function that determines when two items are equal and then we use it to compare to all the other items we found as distinct so far. That makes using a trie impossible.</p> <p>&nbsp; Let me give you an example: we take [1,1,2,3,3,4,5] and we use an externally provided equality function:</p> <ul><li>create an empty output of distinct items</li> <li>take first item (1) and compare with existing distinct items (none)</li> <li>item is not found, so we add it to output</li> <li>take next item (1) and compare with existing distinct items (1)</li> <li>item is found, so we do nothing</li> <li>...</li> <li>we take the last item (5) and compare with existing items (1,2,3,4)</li> <li>item is not found, so we add it to the output</li></ul> <p>&nbsp; The number of operations that must be taken is the number of total items multiplied by the average number of distinct items. That means that for a list of already distinct values, the complexity if O(n<sup>2</sup>). Not good! It increases exponentially with the number of items. And we cannot use a trie unless we have some function that would provide us with a distinctive primitive value for an item. So instead of an equality function, a hashing function that would return a number or maybe a string.</p> <p>&nbsp; However, given the knowledge we have so far, we can reduce the complexity of finding distinct items to O(n*log(n))! It's as simple as sorting the items, then going through the list and sending to output an item when different from the one before. One little problem here: we need a comparison function for sorting, not an equality one.</p> <h2>So far</h2> <p>&nbsp; We looked into the basic operations of sorting and finding distinct values. To be generic, one has to be provided with a comparison function, the other with an equality function. However, if we would have a comparison function available, finding distinct generic items would become significantly less complex by using sorting. Sorting is better than exponential comparison because it uses partitioning as an optimization trick.</p> <h2>Breaking the n*log(n) barrier</h2> <p>&nbsp; As I said above, there are algorithms that claim a much better performance than n*log(n). One of them is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="a non-comparative sorting algorithm. It avoids comparison by creating and distributing elements into buckets according to their radix. For elements with more than one significant digit, this bucketing process is repeated for each digit, while preserving the ordering of the prior step, until all digits have been considered. For this reason, radix sort has also been called bucket sort and digital sort.">RadixSort</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burstsort" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="cache-efficient algorithms for sorting strings. They are variants of the traditional radix sort but faster for large data sets of common strings, first published in 2003, with some optimizing versions published in later years.">BurstSort</a> is a version of it, optimized for strings. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_sort" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="an algorithm for sorting a collection of objects according to keys that are small integers; that is, it is an integer sorting algorithm. It operates by counting the number of objects that have each distinct key value, and using arithmetic on those counts to determine the positions of each key value in the output sequence.">CountSort</a> is a similar algorithm, as well. The only problem with Radix type algorithms is that they only work on numbers or recursively on series of numbers. How do they do that? Well, since we know we have numbers to sort, we can use math to partition the lot …</p></div></div>

<p><span>Millions of users use Uber’s applications everyday across the globe, accessing seamless transportation or meal delivery at the push of a button. To achieve this accessibility at scale, our mobile apps require low-latency and highly reliable network communication, regardless of where customers use our services.</span></p>
<p><span>The network communication for all of Uber’s mobile applications are powered by the edge and the mobile networking infrastructures. The edge infrastructure provides secure connectivity for the HTTPS traffic originating from the mobile apps to the backend services. Uber’s edge infrastructure combines the global presence of public cloud platforms that help reduce app latencies with the additional ability to fallback to our own managed data-centers when required for enhanced reliability.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On the mobile side, a core component of our networking stack is the failure handler that intelligently routes all mobile traffic from our applications to the edge infrastructure. Uber’s failure handler was designed as a finite state machine (FSM) to ensure that the traffic sent via cloud infrastructure is maximized. During times when the cloud infrastructure is unreachable, the failover handler dynamically re-routes the traffic directly to Uber’s data centers without significantly impacting the user’s experience.</span></p>
<p><span>After rolling out the failover handler at Uber, we witnessed a 25-30 percent reduction in tail-end latencies for the HTTPS traffic when compared to previous solutions. The failover handler has also ensured reasonably low error rates for the HTTPS traffic during periods of outages faced by the public cloud infrastructure. Combined, these performance improvements have led to better user experiences for markets worldwide.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In this article, we share the challenges faced in designing the mobile failover handler for Uber’s applications, and how the design evolved as we operationalized the system across our users globally.</span></p>

<h2><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure</span></h2>
<p><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure comprises front-end proxy servers that terminate secure TLS over </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol"><span>TCP</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC"><span>QUIC</span></a><span> connections from the mobile apps. The HTTPS traffic originating from the mobile apps over these connections are then forwarded to the backend services in the nearest data-center using existing </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_pool"><span>connection pools</span></a><span>. The edge infrastructure spans across public cloud and privately managed infrastructures as shown in Figure 1, below, with the front-end proxies hosted both within public cloud regions and in Uber’s managed data-centers:&nbsp;</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_8070" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8070"><a href="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2nd-.gif"><img src="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2nd-.gif" alt="" width="1200" height="541"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8070">Figure 1. Uber’s edge infrastructure powers our mobile applications by routing mobile traffic either over the cloud infrastructure or directly to Uber’s managed data-centers.</figcaption></figure>

<p><span>Hosting the edge servers on public cloud enables us to leverage its widely deployed network of </span><a href="https://networkencyclopedia.com/point-of-presence-pop/"><span>Points of Presence</span></a><span>, or PoPs. </span><span>Terminating the QUIC/TCP connection closer to the user generally </span><span>results in better performance, translating to lower latency and error rates for the HTTPS traffic. In addition, the cloud’s front-end servers support newer, more </span><a href="https://eng.uber.com/employing-quic-protocol/"><span>performant protocols</span></a><span> that further lowers the latencies during poor network conditions. As such, it is critical we maximize the amount of HTTPS requests from mobile routed via the cloud regions to ensure the best possible user experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, if app requests are always routed to the cloud, we risk significant service interruptions during both&nbsp; local- and global-level disruptions. Such connectivity issues can be </span><a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi20spring_burnett_prepub.pdf"><span>attributed</span></a><span> to various components of the public clouds or the intermediate ISPs. Issues due to DNS service, load balancers, BGP routing, mis-configurations of network middleboxes, cloud outages etc. can lead to DNS or QUIC/ TCP connection timeouts. When disruptions occur, Uber’s platform must have the ability to dynamically failover and reroute incoming requests to our private data centers to ensure uninterrupted service.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The front-end servers hosted in the cloud and data-centers are registered as different </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name"><span>domain names</span></a><span>. By selecting the most appropriate domain-name, the mobile apps can route requests either through the cloud regions or directly to the Uber data-centers.</span></p>

<h2><span>Mobile Failover handling</span></h2>
<p><span>To facilitate highly performant and reliable app experiences for our users, we built an in-house failover handler that resides within the mobile networking stack as an interceptor placed above the core HTTP2/QUIC layers. As HTTPS requests are generated from the application, they pass through the failover handler, that rewrites the domain-name (or host-name) before they are processed by the core HTTP library. This ensures that the HTTPS traffic can be dynamically routed to the appropriate edge servers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Asynchronously, the failover handler continuously monitors the health of the domains and switches the domain if required based on the errors received from the HTTPS responses. The logic that decides when to switch the domains is the core component of the failover handler, and the main topic of discussion in this article.</span></p>
<p><span>The failover handler uses network errors for HTTPS responses as the signal to detect reachability issues with the domain. The fundamental challenge when designing the failover handler was distinguishing between errors on the user’s end due to mobile connectivity failures and errors on our end due to edge infrastructure unavailability or unreachability.&nbsp; This problem is further exacerbated due to the high usage of cellular/ LTE networks for Uber’s applications, especially at global scale. Mobile networks are </span><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/00aa/a84be127c04a21b5f5f8dc5d2426921654e2.pdf"><span>less reliable and stable</span></a><span> than their wired counterparts, prone to intermittent failures, connectivity issues, and congestion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Receiving temporary DNS errors or QUIC/ TCP connection timeouts for our primary domain (domain-name for the edge servers hosted within cloud regions) does not necessarily mean that it is unavailable; in most cases, this failure is actually due to an intermittent loss in connectivity. Imagine, for instance, going into a tunnel and losing mobile service. In such a scenario, switching the domain from a primary domain to a back-up domain does not help and may result in </span><i><span>lower</span></i><span> performance once connectivity recovers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Round robin-based failover handler</span></h3>
<p><span>A few straight-foward solutions we tested failed to address this challenge effectively. An earlier iteration of our failover handler used a round robin-based system configured with a list of domains. The first domain was the primary domain that provided the best possible performance. The primary domain was followed by back-up domains, typically Uber’s managed data-center servers, to ensure ability to fallback when the primary domain is unavailable. On receiving a specific network error—DNS errors, timeouts, TCP/TLS errors, and so on—the system switched the domain to the next in the list for all subsequent HTTPS requests.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While this round robin solution met our availability requirements, it had a few drawbacks regarding performance:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Aggressive host switches:</b><span> A few intermittent network errors cause the system to switch domains. Excessive switching across domains may result in unnecessary DNS lookups and connection setups causing additional delays.</span></li>
<li><b>Substantial requests routed to non-performant domains</b><span>: In the event of network errors, the system settles on one of the domains in the list with equal probability after the network recovers. We saw significant sessions settle on the lower-performing back-up domains, despite the primary domain being available. The system would only transition back to the primary domain following another round of network errors.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Threshold-based failover handler</span></h3>
<p><span>To avoid excessive domain switching, we also experimented with a threshold-based failover handler. Instead of triggering failover based on a single network error, the threshold-based solution switches domains only after encountering a minimum number of network errors.&nbsp; However, it proved hard to find a threshold value that worked efficiently across different applications, regions, and network types (LTE, WiFi etc.). Setting the value too low caused unnecessary switching, but setting it too high delayed recovery in scenarios where the primary domains were actually unavailable. Besides, this system did not completely solve the drawbacks of the previous approach.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Edge-driven failover handling</span></h3>
<p><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure has automated recovery mechanisms to mitigate domain failures, such as DNS re-mapping. In this situation, excessive errors on our primary domain triggers a reconfiguration of the domain-name to IP address mapping for the affected domain. DNS propagation is not instantaneous though, since the revised mapping must propagate across all DNS nameservers globally.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Oftentimes, the unreachability of the primary domain is also limited to a small region, a city, or a specific mobile carrier, and cannot be effectively mitigated by DNS mapping updates alone. Mobile apps have a better context of the connectivity conditions and can react in real-time. Hence, we determined that a device-local failover handler is necessary to ensure connectivity in addition to our edge-driven failover handling mechanisms.</span></p>

<h2><span>Failover handler design</span></h2>
<p><span>When designing Uber’s failover handler, we wanted to ensure we hit three main criteria that was lacking in existing solutions we assessed:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Maximize the usage of primary domains: </b><span>&nbsp;We needed our failover handling solution to operate in a way to preferentially route traffic to the primary domains, which typically offer the best performance. Maximizing the amount of HTTPS traffic going through these domains ensures lower latency and a better user experience overall.</span></li>
<li><b>Effectively differentiate between network errors and host-level outages: </b><span>The system required a robust mechanism that could confidently identify actual domain failures and lower the probability of switching to an alternate host because of intermittent mobile network connectivity issues.</span></li>
<li><b>Reduce degraded experience during primary domain outages: </b><span>Our failover …</span></li></ol></div></div>

        <p>Much advocacy of Haskell, in general, boils down to type-safety and elimination of bugs. How boring. My personal experience is that bugs are trickier in Haskell and I can write bad code in an extraordinary variety of ways.</p>
<p>I don’t code in Haskell to help eliminate bugs. That seems a goal unlikely to produce joy in my code. I write Haskell primarily because in enables me to name things a bit better.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-learning">What is Learning?</h2>
<p>As an example, I came across this quote within the first few pages of a popular online course on machine learning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. ~ Tom Mitchell</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s how I unpacked this into types:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | learning is to use experience to change the performance of a task.</span>
<span>newtype</span> <span>Learn</span> f e p <span>=</span>
  <span>Learn</span> { change <span>::</span> (<span>Foldable</span> f) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Experience</span> f e <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Task</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Task</span> e p }

</code></pre></div><p>A common approach to newtypes is to label the unwrapping as a reversal of the newtype (such as <code>unlearn</code> or <code>unLearn</code>) but this misses an important naming opportunity: to use a Learn is to change.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | An experience is set of e's</span>
<span>newtype</span> <span>Experience</span> f e <span>=</span> <span>Experience</span> { set <span>::</span> f e }
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | A task takes an e and measures performance.</span>
<span>newtype</span> <span>Task</span> e p <span>=</span> <span>Task</span> { measure <span>::</span> e <span>-&gt;</span> p } <span>deriving</span> (<span>Profunctor</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>This could be thought of (and coded) as an ordinary function with type (e -&gt; p). The advantage of using a newtype, however, is to highlight the two ways that a task can change:</p>
<ul>
<li>changing the way a task is performed (the <code>e</code>).</li>
<li>changing the way a task is measured (the <code>p</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Acting on a learning, you can change the way a task is performed, such as changing parameters of a function, or change the way you view what performance is.</p>
<p>To change the way a task is performed, taking experience into account, is to make progress. Progress is made one step at a time.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | To progress, is to transduce a Task, via a carrier</span>
<span>newtype</span> <span>Progress</span> e p <span>=</span> <span>Progress</span> { step <span>::</span> e <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Task</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Task</span> e p}
</code></pre></div><p>Putting these above types together in a useful way, to learn, is then to repeatedly apply a progressive step to a set of experiences.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | to learn, is to make Progress from an Experience.</span>
<span>learn</span> <span>::</span> <span>Progress</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Learn</span> f e p
<span>learn</span> p <span>=</span> <span>Learn</span> $ <span>\</span>(<span>Experience</span> e) task <span>-&gt;</span> foldr (step p) task e
</code></pre></div><p>To <code>machine learn</code>, we change the way a <code>machine</code> does a task, based on learning, measuring whether performance improves, and adopt the new way to do a task if it does.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | to improve, given a way to change a task by experience, </span>
<span>--</span>
<span>-- you need to choose the better performace way over an experience set.</span>
<span>improve</span> <span>::</span>
  (<span>Ord</span> (f p), <span>Foldable</span> f, <span>Functor</span> f) <span>=&gt;</span>
  <span>Progress</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span>
  <span>Experience</span> f e <span>-&gt;</span>
  <span>Task</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span>
  <span>Task</span> e p
<span>improve</span> progress es task <span>=</span>
  bool task task' (p' &gt; p)
  <span>where</span>
    task' <span>=</span> change (learn progress) es task
    p <span>=</span> measure task &lt;$&gt; set es
    p' <span>=</span> measure task' &lt;$&gt; set es
</code></pre></div><p>The constraints contained in the above code are mostly based on suggestions from ghc to get a compile, and I didn’t think about them much in drafting. Type constraints provide useful guide-rails for future development of these ideas.</p>
<h2 id="machine-learning-in-haskell">Machine Learning in Haskell?</h2>
<p>In the above example of improving we are left with an <code>Ord (f p)</code> constraint - that the performance over an experience set is ordinal. If we narrow the constraint to a <code>Num (f p)</code>, in other words, assume that the size of the <code>f p</code> is meaningful, then we have wandered in to the traditional numerical methods domain, and can, for example, start to think about gradients to speed up our improvement.</p>
<p>By insisting on useful and concrete names (aka types), Haskell supplies a constrained domain we can further explore.  For example, are there machine learning examples that don’t fit the candidate types and constraints?</p>
<p>Naming things is hard, and other ways of coding tend to avoid the task. Types bring me joy and I shall keep them, thank you very much, and continue to curate collections of them, for fun and profit. In this example, I now have as good a definition of machine learning as you’ll find out in the wild, and my progress on machine learning will be more comprehensive, faster and safer than bashing away in python.</p>
<p>And yet, to a first degree, machine learning in Haskell does not exist, swamped by the easiness of dynamic types. If the promises being made by ML are to be eventually honoured, however, it may need less code bashing and better naming.</p>

And by both measures, the numbers are dramatically lower.</p>  <p>Births considered very premature —&nbsp;born at fewer than 29 to 32 weeks&nbsp;— have&nbsp;dropped by&nbsp;34&nbsp;to 40 per cent, he said.</p>  <p>"If we use their gestational age and if we are talking about the very earliest preemies,"&nbsp;Alshaikh&nbsp;said.</p>  <p>"That's kind of dramatic, actually, and surprising for us."</p>  <p>The numbers are even more dramatic for babies under one kilogram.</p>  <p>"If we used birth weight, those babies born less than one kilo, the number was actually very low and half of what we used to see in the last few years, during the same period of time of the year."</p>    <p>Alshaikh said the trend is very unusual.</p>  <p>"Soon after the lockdown in mid-March, we started to see fewer babies coming to our unit and to intensive care units, and these numbers of preemies were also low in April and mid-May," Alshaikh said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"So by that time, by late May, we felt like we needed to look at the numbers, and see where we are. And also at that time we started hearing that other hospitals, in Ireland and Denmark, have also noticed the drop down in the number of preemies."</p>  <p>When Calgary doctors took a good look at the numbers and compared them to the same time last year, it was an eyeopener.</p>  <p>"We were surprised," Alshaikh said. "We saw that our number is way lower than what we used to see during this period of time."</p>  <p>There are three main causes that doctors are looking at.</p>  <p>One is social distancing, which may have cut down on the amount of general infection from contact with others.</p>  <p>Another is less air pollution, from fewer cars being on the roads.</p>  <p>"This might actually help because studies in the past showed that air pollution actually increases the risk for preterm birth," Alshaikh said.</p>  <p>And simply not going out to work — resting — may be a final key.</p>  <p>"By staying home, a pregnant woman may have less stress from commuting and from work,&nbsp; and that might have helped them," Alshaikh said, adding it's too soon to know for sure which of these lockdown-related factors have contributed the most.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.3068968.1431344120!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/premature-babies.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.3068968.1431344120!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/premature-babies.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.3068968.1431344120!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/premature-babies.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.3068968.1431344120!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/premature-babies.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.3068968.1431344120!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/premature-babies.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.3068968.1431344120!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/premature-babies.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Calgary doctors who noticed a reduced number of premature births during the pandemic lockdown, are seeing those numbers rise again as restrictions have eased.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Jim Lynch, Flickr cc)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>&nbsp;"We see sometimes variation during the year, but it's not to the degree that we see fewer babies," Alshaikh said. "And the fact that we see the same trend in Ireland, in Denmark in Australia, it's kind of surprising for everyone working in this field."</p>  <p>Preterm birth comes with a host of challenges for the babies and their parents.</p>  <p>"The risk is high on children and their families, and also medical care resources," Alshaikh said. "For children, the risk increases for vision and hearing problems, and also for learning disability. It's higher even as the gestational age goes down. For example,&nbsp; 24 weeks is at very high risk compared to babies born at 28 weeks gestation or at 32 weeks gestation."</p>  <h2>Doctors teaming up to study</h2>  <p>The Calgary doctors will continue to study the phenomenon, which could hold clues to reducing preterm births in general.</p>  <p>For now, Alshaikh said it's too early to provide any specific advice to pregnant woman — other than to avoid stress, try to rest at home, get a lot of sleep&nbsp;and focus on good nutrition.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"We've teamed up, actually, with the teams across the world, in Ireland and also in Denmark, and there is also a group in Manitoba working on this project, and we are hoping to understand more the ways to prevent the preterm birth, and also like to see if we can understand more on risk factors that are affecting preterm birth," Alshaikh said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>But the Calgary doctor said there is one alarming development already —&nbsp;as the lockdown restriction ease, those preterm birth numbers are already on the rise again.</p>  <p>"We are actually noticing, even in Calgary, that when the restrictions started to be eased, the number of preterm babies coming to our unit and intensive care is going up again, which is quite actually interesting for us," Alshaikh said. "And we are trying to tease out what factors are affecting this trend."</p>  <p><strong>With files from <em><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/listen/live-radio/1-97-the-homestretch">The Homestretch</a></em>.</strong></p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><h3>What is the Blueprint?</h3>

<p>The Draft Blueprint ("the Blueprint") is the "first draft" of Plan Bay Area 2050, integrating 25 resilient and equitable strategies from the predecessor <a href="https://www.planbayarea.org/2050-plan/horizon">Horizon initiative</a>. The Blueprint is a critical step in the Plan Bay Area 2050 process as the region strives to advance towards the adopted Vision of a more affordable, connected, diverse, healthy and vibrant Bay Area for all.</p>

<h3>We Need Your Input</h3>

<p><strong>Public input is key in the success of the Plan Bay Area 2050 Blueprint, and we want to hear from you in 3 easy steps:</strong></p>

<ol><li>Read the <a href="https://www.planbayarea.org/sites/default/files/pdfs_referenced/PBA2050_Draft_BPStrategies_071320_0.pdf">Blueprint Strategies</a> and <a href="https://www.planbayarea.org/sites/default/files/PBA2050_Draft_BPOutcomes_071720.pdf">Blueprint Outcomes</a></li>
	<li>Watch the <a href="https://mtc.ca.gov/whats-happening/news/video-gallery/crafting-blueprint-bay-areas-future">animated video</a></li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://mtcbata.typeform.com/to/vLNnYjUS">Fill out the survey</a> by August 10, 2020</strong></li>
	<li>Have more feedback? Visit our <a href="https://www.planbayarea.org/2050-plan/blueprint/blueprint-public-comment">Public Comment page</a> for additional ways to contact us</li>
</ol><h3>Public Workshops</h3>

<p>See the list of <a href="https://www.planbayarea.org/meetings-and-events#events">upcoming Public Workshops</a> and join us in real time to learn more and share your feedback.</p>

<h3>From <em>Horizon</em> to the Blueprint to the Plan</h3>

<p>Before now, the Horizon Initiative tested strategies against a wide range of external forces, exploring which policies and investments were best prepared for an uncertain future – from rising telecommute levels to economic boom &amp; bust cycles to consumer preference shifts. Creating the Blueprint is a key first step toward creating the Plan itself, and thus the Blueprint planning phase will require iteration and deep engagement of the public, stakeholders and elected officials.</p>

<p>The Plan Bay Area 2050 Draft Blueprint weaves together transportation, housing, economic and environmental strategies, alongside an expanded set of growth geographies, to advance critical climate and equity goals. Designed to accommodate the 1.5 million new homes necessary to house future growth and address overcrowding, as well as 1.4 million new jobs, the Draft Blueprint integrates critical strategies to address our severe and longstanding housing crisis. With infrastructure investments in walking, biking and public transportation – as well as critical sea level protections designed to keep most Bay Area communities from flooding through 2050 – the Draft Blueprint makes meaningful steps towards the adopted Plan Bay Area 2050 Vision.</p>

<p>While still remaining fiscally constrained per federal planning requirements, the Draft Blueprint includes available revenues from Needs and Revenue assessments as well as new regional revenues for transportation, housing, economic development and environmental resilience.</p>

<h3>Highlights of the Draft Blueprint include:</h3>

<ul><li><strong>Improving Affordability for All:</strong> The Draft Blueprint reduces the cost burden for housing and transportation, with even greater reductions for low-income residents.</li>
	<li><strong>Expanding Housing Opportunities:</strong> The Draft Blueprint integrates investments to build more than 400,000 new permanently-affordable homes.</li>
	<li><strong>Focusing Growth in Walkable Places:</strong> The Draft Blueprint focuses the majority of new homes and new jobs in walkable communities with frequent transit services.</li>
	<li><strong>Saving Lives and Protecting Communities:</strong> In addition to saving more than 1,500 lives from roadway crashes through 2050, the Draft Blueprint also protects 98 percent of housing units at risk of sea level rise inundation through the year 2050 with new resilient infrastructure.</li>
	<li><strong>Positioning the Region for Robust Economic Growth:</strong> Despite over $200 billion in new taxes in the decades ahead to pay for the bold strategies approved in February 2020, Bay Area businesses are forecasted to rebound robustly.</li>
</ul></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>While writing the post on AWS reservations I started thinking if there’s any arbitrage opportunity in the reservations. For example - does it make sense to do a 1 year or 3 year reservation for some instance types of upgrade an instance class to get a better reservation value?</p>

<p>You can do this manually using ec2instances.info which provides a quick way to look at EC2 pricing info although forces you to pick the type of reservations you’re interested in. To speed things up I just ran the <a href="https://github.com/powdahound/ec2instances.info">ec2instances.info script</a> to scrape the data into a JSON with a <a href="https://github.com/dangoldin/analyze-ec2instance.info">quick script</a> to extract the relevant details into a CSV file. After that, it was as simple as loading into <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h5H3vsZluk1_TGGMGrZq-KFiha-Bfhu4OBzyp5QynA8/edit#gid=0">Google sheets</a> for some analysis and visualization.</p>

<p>There are a few surprises - the biggest was how much of a variance there is by instance type. The smallest discount comes with the 1 year convertible, no up front payment option and ranges from around 21% for the i3en series but goes up to 49% for the i2 series. I’m sure most of this is a function of the age and demand for the types but it’s worth auditing use cases to see whether you get more bang for the buck on a slightly older instance. The same pattern holds when you look at the 3 year full up front payment options. The i2 series gets you a 75% discount while the discount on the i3en series climbs to 62%.</p>

<p>Another interesting analysis is to compare the cheapest reserved option (1 year convertible, no upfront) with the most expensive (3 year standard, full upfront) to check out the outliers. As expected, they’re strongly correlated but you do so see variance - for example the p2 and p3 series have a similar discount for the 1 year term term but the p2 gets you a 10% larger discount than the p3 for the 3 year term.</p>

<p>The code is up on <a href="https://github.com/dangoldin/analyze-ec2instance.info">GitHub</a> with the data available on a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h5H3vsZluk1_TGGMGrZq-KFiha-Bfhu4OBzyp5QynA8/edit#gid=0">Google spreadsheet</a> so if there’s anything else that stands out I’d love to know about it.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
  In the history of shortwave receivers, the Wadley loop played an
  important role. It was invented by the South African engineer Trevor
  Wadley in 1946 and it was applied in professional shortwave receivers
  from Racal in the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1970s it was popular in
  amateur shortwave receivers until it gave way to PLL synthesizer
  circuits.

</p><p>
  It is a very clever circuit that made it possible to construct
  shortwave receivers that covered the entire HF spectrum with good
  image rejection, good dial accuracy and good frequency stability
  (adequate for SSB). Circuit complexity and cost were modest compared
  to other receiver designs that met the same requirements.

</p><p>
  The Wadley loop utilizes two tuning knobs that tune two different
  continuously variable frequency oscillators (VFOs). The first tuning
  knob tunes to the required megahertz band from 0 to 29. Though it
  controls a continuously variable oscillator, it appears to act as a
  band switch. Due to drift cancelation, any deviation from an integer
  multiple of 1MHz is canceled out. The second tuning knob tunes to
  the exact frequency within one megahertz band.
 
  
</p><h2>History of shortwave receivers</h2>

<p>
  The very first shortwave receivers used regenerative circuits. They
  typically had one or more RF amplifiers (vacuum tubes) with tuned
  circuits between them. All of these tuned circuits were tuned to the
  received frequency. This is called a TRF (Tuned Radio Frequency)
  receiver. The final RF amplification tube had positive feedback,
  such that it nearly oscillated but not quite. This provided much
  gain and selectivity, but setting the feedback level just right was
  critical. Too much and the circuit would oscillate. Satisfactory
  results could already be had with just the regenerative tube without
  any other amplifiers before it. But if you made such receiver to
  oscillate, the whole neighborhood would be treated to a howling
  sound. This was a problem especially in the normal broadcast bands
  (mediumwave and in Europe also longwave).

</p><p>
  After 1930, the superheterodyne receiver would be used nearly
  universally.  It would provide uniform and good nearby selectivity
  across the tuning range, something a TRF receiver could not do. Plus
  that you did not treat the whole neighborhood to a howling sound if
  you did not know how to tune properly. In a superheterodyne
  receiver, a variable oscillator is used to mix the received signal
  to a fixed frequency, the Intermediate Frequency of IF. Further
  amplification and filtering is performed at that fixed frequency. By
  varying the oscillator frequency you tune to a different station. As
  the oscillator is at a frequency different from the received
  frequency and the signal is not very close to the antenna
  input. radiation from the local oscillator is typically not a
  problem for the neighbors.
  
</p><p>
  Around World War 2, even professional communications receivers were
  still standard superheterodynes. They may have used a higher than
  standard IF and an extra tuned RF stage to improve image rejection,
  but the basic system was the same.

</p><p>
  In the 1950s and 1960s many professional communications receivers
  would use double conversion (two different IF frequencies). Further
  they would use one carefully calibrated Variable Frequency
  Oscillator (VFO) and mix its output with numerous different crystal
  frequencies to obtain the local oscillator signal for all bands.
  This way the VFO could have only one tuning range at a comparatively
  low frequency, so its stability and dial accuracy could be good
  enough for SSB and RTTY. Double conversion for these receivers still
  meant IF frequencies of 1 to 3MHz, certainly not 40MHz or higher.

</p><p>
  For example the German Rohde &amp; Schwarz EK07 receiver of the 1960s
  has a first IF of 3.3MHz (for the higher bands) and it has a VFO at
  a 3.4-6.4MHz, a 3MHz wide range. To obtain the required
  stability and dial accuracy for such a comparatively wide range it
  relied heavily on mechanical precision engineering, rather than clever
  circuit design.
   
</p><p>
  One brand of professional communications receivers however, used
  the Wadley loop. This brand was Racal, producer of the famous RA17
  receivers.  And yes, it does use a first IF of around 40MHz, hence it
  does not require special treatment of the lower bands (which would
  need single conversion if the first IF was lower). Now the RA17 did
  use mechanical precision engineering for the VFO, but the
  requirements were less strict than for the EK07 (having only a third
  of the tuning range). And the number of switches and band-dependent
  filters was drastically reduced compared to the EK07.

</p><p>
  In 1973 the same Wadley loop was introduced in a consumer grade
  receiver, the Barlow Wadley XCR30. Although its performance was much
  less than that of the Racal, it cost only a small fraction (around
  1/25th of price of the Racal). Its performance was much better than
  that of any general coverage receivers you could buy in this price
  range. The Yaesu FRG-7 was introduced in 1977 and it performed
  considerably better than the Barlow Wadley. 
  
</p><p>
  The Wadley loop had its limitations though and in the 1970s,
  professional communications receivers moved to PLL synthesizers to
  generate their tunable local oscillator signals to mix the received
  signal to a high first IF. Amateur receivers followed suit after
  1980. In the meantime there were some very interesting designs that
  combined a VFO (tuning a 1MHz wide range) with a PLL synthesizer to
  generate 1MHz multiples. This system was used by the Kenwood R1000
  and Yaesu FRG-7700.

</p><p>
  Modern receivers use direct digital synthesis (DDS) instead of (or
  combined with) PLL synthesizers. In the 1990s some high end
  communications receivers digitized the final IF signal and did the
  IF filtering and demodulation digitally in a DSP (digital signal
  processor). This technique is now commonplace, even in cheap
  receivers. Instead of a dedicated DSP chip one can use the power of a
  modern personal computer to do the job. There is now a trend to use
  a low first (and only) intermediate frequency, typically less than
  48kHz, in the range of normal sound cards. To suppress the image
  frequency, one can use two mixers and two AD converters, each fed by
  oscillator signals of the same frequency and 90 degrees apart. This
  is called quadrature mixing.

</p><p>
  As of 2016 it is now even possible to directly digitize the entire HF
  spectrum from 0 to 30MHz and do all further processing in a
  computer. No more mixers, no more image frequencies (but you still
  need good anti-aliasing filters).

  
</p><h2>The superheterodyne receiver</h2>

<p>
Let's start with an ordinary superheterodyne circuit for a standard
LW/MW radio, whose diagram is shown below. Such radios were made from
the 1930s to the 1990s. The received signal (either in the longwave
range 150-350kHz or in the mediumwave range 530-1620kHz) is fed
through a preselector, typically a parallel resonant LC circuit of a
fixed coil and a variable capacitor. The coil could be wound on a
ferrite bar, so the coil itself would act as an antenna. The received
signal is mixed with a variable oscillator to obtain the desired 455kHz
intermediate frequency. The oscillator also contains a resonant LC
circuit containing a fixed coil and a variable capacitor. The
variable capacitor is typically a dual variable capacitor where both
capacitors are on a single shaft so they are varied both by rotating
the shaft. Both the preselector and the oscillator have two tuning
ranges. The coils for both ranges can be switched using a band switch.

</p><p>
<img src="https://lennartb.home.xs4all.nl/radio/superhet.svg" width="1000" alt="Block diagram of a superheterodyne receiver">

</p><p>
The 455kHz IF signal is fed through a series of narrow band filters
and amplifiers. The filters select the 455kHz signal with a well
defined bandwidth (around 10kHz in an AM broadcast receiver). The
amplified signal is then demodulated using a diode detector. The
demodulated signal is further amplified and fed to a speaker.

</p><p>
In traditional radios these filters were constructed from transformers
and capacitors. In more modern radios you would find ceramic
resonators. Communications receivers would contain several ceramic
filters with different bandwidths, that can be
selected. Communications receivers would also contain a BFO, a Beat
Frequency Oscillator that oscillates near the 455kHz IF. The diode
detector could then be replaced by a product detector, which is
basically another mixer.

</p><p>
Finally we would have an AGC (Automatic Gain Control) circuit. The
amplified IF signal is detected by another diode and then smoothed
using a much larger capacitor to eliminate all modulation and just
retain the carrier level. This signal is used to control (reduce) the
gain of the IF amplifiers. This reduces the effect of fading and it
reduces the difference in audio level between strong and weak
stations.

  
</p><h2>Problems with the superheterodyne for shortwave</h2>

<p>
  The standard superheterodyne works surprisingly well for mediumwave
  and longwave. But if we move on to shortwave, we will run into the
  problem of image frequencies. In a superheterodyne circuit, two
  frequencies will mix to the desired IF (f1) if you tune the
  oscillator to a given frequency f2. f2+f1 and f2-f1. So if you tune
  the oscillator to 1455kHz and the IF is 455kHz, both an input signal
  of 1000kHz (f2-f1) and an input signal of 1910kHz (f1+f2) will mix
  to the IF. We do have a tunable preselector and 1910kHz (unwanted) is far
  removed from 1000kHz (wanted), so there will be no problem.

</p><p>
  But on shortwave the situation is different. If you tune to
  15100kHz, the image frequency is at 16010kHz, well within the range
  of a single resonant LC circuit used a a preselector.

</p><p>
  There are two straightforward ways to reduce the
  problem. Professional shortwave receivers of the 1940s would
  typically use both methods combined:

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a id="introduction"></a><a href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>This document is a gentle introduction to the double-entry counting method, as written from the perspective of a computer scientist. It is an attempt to explain basic bookkeeping using as simple an approach as possible, doing away with some of the idiosyncrasies normally involved in accounting. It is also representative of how <a href="http://furius.ca/beancount/"><span>Beancount</span></a> works, and it should be useful to all users of <a href="http://plaintextaccounting.org/"><span>plain-text accounting</span></a>.</p>
<p>Note that I am not an accountant, and in the process of writing this document I may have used terminology that is slightly different or unusual to that which is taught in perhaps more traditional training in accounting. I granted myself license to create something new and perhaps even unusual in order to explain those ideas as simply and clearly as possible to someone unfamiliar with them.</p>
<p>I believe that the method of double-entry counting should be taught to everyone at the high school level everywhere as it is a tremendously useful organizational skill, and I hope that this text can help spread its knowledge beyond professional circles.</p>
<h2 id="basics-of-double-entry-bookkeeping">Basics of Double-Entry Bookkeeping<a id="basics-of-double-entry-bookkeeping"></a><a href="#basics-of-double-entry-bookkeeping" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>The double-entry system is just a simple <em>method of counting</em>, with some simple rules.</p>
<p>Let’s begin by defining the notion of an <strong>account</strong>. An account is something that can contain things, like a bag. It is used to count things, to accumulate things. Let’s draw a horizontal arrow to visually represent the evolving contents of an account over time:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/5b1da6643866c557b2a5ce687e70ee1db16b14de.png"></p>
<p>On the left, we have the past, and to the right, increasing time: the present, the future, etc.</p>
<p>For now, let’s assume that accounts can contain only one kind of thing, for example, <em>dollars</em>. All accounts begin with an empty content of zero dollars. We will call the number of units in the account the <strong>balance</strong> of an account. Note that it represents its contents at a particular point in time. I will draw the balance using a number above the account’s timeline:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/842dcb36da9e0e70c35d1023d65d8a571062baf0.png"></p>
<p>The contents of accounts can change over time. In order to change the content of an account, we have to add something to it. We will call this addition a <strong>posting</strong> to an account, and I will draw this change as a circled number on the account’s timeline, for example, adding $100 to the account:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/5e5e7897a346355eccd4d21ec9485c3464a2d996.png"></p>
<p>Now, we can draw the updated balance of the account after the posting with another little number right after it:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/0c8a78dac61ae7fddde25761f036e7f379cad247.png"></p>
<p>The account’s balance, after adding $100, is now $100.</p>
<p>We can also remove from the contents of an account. For example, we could remove $25, and the resulting account balance is now $75:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/98e314125325ecc72262a73a21b74db3200414fd.png"></p>
<p>Account balances can also become <em>negative</em>, if we remove more dollars than there are in the account. For example, if we remove $200 from this account, the balance now becomes $-125:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/bdc8a23347040de123e3359a7c8f0cc253c6d7d2.png"></p>
<p>It’s perfectly fine for accounts to contain a negative balance number. Remember that all we’re doing is counting things. As we will see shortly, some accounts will remain with a negative balance for most of their timeline.</p>
<h3 id="statements">Statements<a id="statements"></a><a href="#statements" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Something worthy of notice is how the timeline notation I’ve written in the previous section is analogous to paper account statements institutions maintain for each client and which you typically receive through the mail:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th><em><strong>Date</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Description</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Amount</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Balance</strong></em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2016-10-02</td><td>...</td><td>100.00</td><td>1100.00</td></tr><tr><td>2016-10-05</td><td>...</td><td>-25.00</td><td>1075.00</td></tr><tr><td>2016-10-06</td><td>...</td><td>-200.00</td><td>875.00</td></tr><tr><td><em><strong>Final Balance</strong></em></td><td>875.00</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Sometimes the amount column is split into two, one showing the positive amounts and the other the negative ones:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th><em><strong>Date</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Description</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Debit</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Credit</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Balance</strong></em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2016-10-02</td><td>...</td><td></td><td>100.00</td><td>1100.00</td></tr><tr><td>2016-10-05</td><td>...</td><td>25.00</td><td></td><td>1075.00</td></tr><tr><td>2016-10-06</td><td>...</td><td>200.00</td><td></td><td>875.00</td></tr><tr><td><em><strong>Final Balance</strong></em></td><td>875.00</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Here, “debit” means “removed from your account” and “credit” means “deposited in your account.” Sometimes the words “withdrawals” and “deposits” will be used. It all depends on context: for checking and savings accounts it is usual to have both types of postings, but for a credit card account typically it shows only positive numbers and then the occasional monthly payment so the single column format is used.</p>
<p>In any case, the “balance” column always shows the resulting balance <em>after</em> the amount has been posted to the account. And sometimes the statements are rendered in decreasing order of time.</p>
<h3 id="single-entry-bookkeeping">Single-Entry Bookkeeping<a id="single-entry-bookkeeping"></a><a href="#single-entry-bookkeeping" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>In this story, this account belongs to someone. We’ll call this person the <strong>owner</strong> of the account. The account can be used to represent a real world account, for example, imagine that we use it to represent the content of the owner’s checking account at a bank. So we’re going to label the account by giving it a name, in this case “Checking”:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/380ec8fea9ee9069411a61ccabcc838de44042ef.png"></p>
<p>Imagine that at some point, this account has a balance of $1000, like I’ve drawn on the picture. Now, if the owner spends $79 of this account, we would represent it like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/b24d8c1e40edf6fd7e9d768ba8f0df279cd41f0e.png"></p>
<p>Furthermore, if the expense was for a meal at a restaurant, we could flag the posting with a <strong>category</strong> to indicate what the change was used for. Let’s say, “Restaurant”, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/7ee843cd9b997a9447bb022d7d35121a820e296d.png"></p>
<p>Now, if we have a lot of these, we could write a computer program to accumulate all the changes for each category and calculate the sums for each of them. That would tell us how much we spent in restaurants in total, for example. This is called the <strong>single-entry method</strong> of accounting.</p>
<p>But we’re not going to do it this way; we have a better way. Bear with me for a few more sections.</p>
<h3 id="double-entry-bookkeeping">Double-Entry Bookkeeping<a id="double-entry-bookkeeping"></a><a href="#double-entry-bookkeeping" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>An owner may have multiple accounts. I will represent this by drawing many similar account timelines on the same graphic. As before, these are labeled with unique names. Let’s assume that the owner has the same “Checking” account as previously, but now also a <strong>“</strong>Restaurant<strong>”</strong> account as well, which can be used to accumulate all food expenses at restaurants. It looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/3c380375442a643877c59660832bd7df6192e9cb.png"></p>
<p>Now, instead of <em>categorizing</em> the posting to a “restaurant category” as we did previously, we could create a matching posting on the “Restaurant” account to record how much we spent for food, with the amount spent ($79):</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/b86a7242b92effc613f88bc0cc70381d72e774f0.png"></p>
<p>The “Restaurant” account, like all other accounts, also has an accumulated balance, so we can find out how much we spent in “Restaurant” in total. This is entirely symmetrical to counting changes in a checking account.</p>
<p>Now, we can associate the two postings together, by creating a kind of “parent” box that refers to both of them. We will call this object a <strong>transaction</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/b77efafcf2d6a6f1afbfb13da70be2f892b339b4.png"></p>
<p>Notice here that we’ve also associated a description to this transaction: “Dinner at Uncle Boons”. A transaction also has a <strong>date</strong>, and all of its postings are recorded to occur on that date. We call this the transaction date.</p>
<p>We can now introduce the fundamental rule of double-entry bookkeeping system:</p>
<pre><code>The sum of all the postings of a transaction must equal zero.
</code></pre>
<p>Remember this, as this is the foundation of the double-entry method, and its most important characteristic. It has important consequences which I will discuss later in this document.</p>
<p>In our example, we remove $79 from the “Checking” account and “give it” to the “Restaurant” account. ($79) + ($-79) = $0. To emphasize this, I could draw a little summation line under the postings of the transaction, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/b4182b9f64113868123cbcec20d468ab18b2786f.png"></p>
<h3 id="many-accounts">Many Accounts<a id="many-accounts"></a><a href="#many-accounts" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>There may be many such transactions, over many different accounts. For example, if the owner of the accounts had a lunch the next day which she paid using a credit card, it could be represented by creating a “Credit Card” account dedicated to tracking the real world credit card balance, and with a corresponding transaction:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/f85a66510ce2e3bb614edca76463a9c4752a7d26.png"></p>
<p>In this example, the owner spent $35 at a restaurant called “Eataly.” The previous balance of the owner’s credit card was $-450; after the expense, the new balance is $-485.</p>
<p>For each real world account, the owner can create a bookkeeping account like we did. Also, for each category of expenditure, the owner also creates a bookkeeping account. In this system, there are no limits to how many accounts can be created.</p>
<p>Note that the balance in the example is a negative number; this is not an error. Balances for credit card accounts are normally negative: they represent an amount <em>you owe</em>, that the bank is lending you <em>on credit</em>. When your credit card company keeps track of your expenses, they write out your statement from their perspective, as positive numbers. For you, those are amounts you need to eventually pay. But here, in our accounting system, we’re representing numbers from the owner’s point-of-view, and from her perspective, this is money she owes, not something she has. What we have is a meal sitting in our stomach (a positive number of $ of “Restaurant”).</p>
<h3 id="multiple-postings">Multiple Postings<a id="multiple-postings"></a><a href="#multiple-postings" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Finally, transactions may have more than two postings; in fact, they may have any number of postings. The only thing that matters is that the sum of their amounts is zero (from the rule of double-entry bookkeeping above).</p>
<p>For example, let’s look at what would happen if the owner gets her salary paid for December:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/18980f41275676c5c7cf3b39dd256512bb45b78b.png"></p>
<p>Her gross salary received in this example is recorded as $-2,905 (I’ll explain the sign in a moment). $905 is set aside for taxes. Her “net” salary of $2,000, the remainder, is deposited in her “Checking” account and the resulting balance of that account is $2,921 (the previous balance of $921 + $2,000 = $2,921). This transaction has three postings: (+2,000) + (-2,905) + (+905) = 0. The double-entry rule is respected.</p>
<p>Now, you may ask: Why is her salary recorded as a negative number? The reasoning here is similar to that of the credit card above, though perhaps a bit more subtle. These accounts exist to track all the amounts from the owner’s point-of-view. The owner gives out work, and receives money and taxes in exchange for it …</p></div></div></div>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Simon’s algorithm is a quantum computing algorithm invented to solve a contrived problem which is called Simon’s problem. Compared to one of the other quantum computing algorithms, <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Jozsa-Algorithm/">Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm</a>, which only requires to run once, Simon’s algorithm requires to run the algorithm multiple times, yet it is still able to solve Simon’s problem exponentially faster asymptotically running on quantum circuits than the best conventional probabilistic algorithm running on classical circuits.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss Simon’s problem and Simon’s algorithm in details.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="xor-properties">XOR Properties</h4>

<ul>
  <li><em>Commutativity</em>: $A \oplus B = B \oplus A$</li>
  <li><em>Associativity</em>: $A \oplus (B \oplus C) = (A \oplus B) \oplus C$</li>
  <li><em>Identity element</em>: $A \oplus 0 = A$</li>
  <li><em>Self-invertible</em>:  $A \oplus A = 0$</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="reducing-sum-or-difference-to-boolean">Reducing Sum or Difference to Boolean</h4>

<p>If $x$ and $y$ are binary values, $x, y \in \{0, 1\}$, we have</p>



<p>where $\oplus$ is $\text{XOR}$ (binary addition modulo 2). This could be easily verified using truth table.</p>

<h4 id="inner-product-and-inner-product-space-for-binary-vector-space">Inner Product and Inner Product Space for Binary Vector Space</h4>

<p>In the previous <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Inner-Product/">blog post</a>, we have defined the inner product and inner product space for complex vector space. Similarly, we could also define the inner product and inner product space for binary vector space.</p>



<p>Given two binary vectors $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n$, $\mathbf{x} = \{x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_{n-1}\}$ and $\mathbf{y} = \{y_0, y_1, \cdots, y_{n-1}\}$, the inner product of $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ is defined as</p>



<p>which is somewhat similar to the inner product definition for real vector space.</p>



<p>The bitwise exclusive-or operation $\oplus$ was also defined for binary vectors $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ of the same length. Given two binary vectors $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n$, $\mathbf{x} = \{x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_{n-1}\}$ and $\mathbf{y} = \{y_0, y_1, \cdots, y_{n-1}\}$,</p>



<p>The following inner product properties are satisfied based on the above inner product definition.</p>



<p>Given $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}^{\prime}, \mathbf{y}, \mathbf{y}^{\prime} \in \{0,1\}^n$, using the $\text{XOR}$ distributivity property we derived above,</p>



<p>Similarly,</p>



<p>Let $\mathbf{0} = \{ \underbrace{0, 0, \cdots, 0}_{n} \} =  0^n$, we have</p>



<h4 id="hadamard-operator">Hadamard Operator</h4>

<p>Most of the important properties of Hadamard operator have been derived in the prerequisites section of my previous blog post on <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Jozsa-Algorithm/">Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm</a>. Unlike Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, Simon’s algorithm is only going to use a small fraction of the Hadamard operator properties that Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm has used. I would just copy the properties useful for Simon’s algorithm algorithm. For the derivation, proof, and other properties of Hadamard operator, the reader should refer to my previous blog post.</p>



<p>To extract an arbitrary column $j$ from $H^{\otimes {n}}$, we prepared a one-hot quantum system basic state vector $| \mathbf{y} \rangle = [y_0, y_1, \cdots, y_{2^n-1}]^{\top}$, where $y_j = 1$ and $y_k = 0$ for $k \neq j$.</p>



<p>where $| \mathbf{x}_i \rangle$ is a quantum system one-hot basic state vector,  $|\mathbf{x}_i\rangle = [x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_{2^{n}-1}]^{\top}$, where $x_i = 1$ and $x_k = 0$ for $k \neq i$.</p>



<p>Specifically, if $j = 0$, $| \mathbf{y} \rangle = [\underbrace{1, 0, 0, \cdots, 0}_{2^n} ]^{\top} = | \mathbf{0} \rangle$,</p>



<h3 id="simons-problem">Simon’s Problem</h3>

<p>Simon’s problem is defined as the follows. Given a black box function $f: \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n$, we are further assured that there exists a hidden binary string $\mathbf{c} \in \{0,1\}^n$, such that, for all $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n$,</p>



<p>where $\oplus$ is (bit-wise) $\text{XOR}$ (binary addition modulo 2).</p>



<p>Our goal is to find out what $\mathbf{c}$ is.</p>

<h4 id="mapping-properties">Mapping Properties</h4>

<p>There are some properties of the mapping $f$. $f$ is either a one-to-one or two-to-one mapping.</p>



<p>$\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $f$ is a one-to-one mapping</p>



<p><em>Proof</em></p>



<p>For $f$ is a one-to-one mapping $\Rightarrow$ $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$, it is too trivial to prove.</p>



<p>For $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$ $\Rightarrow$ $f$ is a one-to-one mapping, we would like to prove by contradiction.</p>



<p>If $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$ and $f$ is not a one-to-one mapping, there must exists $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$, $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{y}$, and $f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{y})$. According to the assurance, $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{x}$. This raises contradiction and therefore $f$ has to be a one-to-one mapping when $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>



<p>$\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $f$ is a two-to-one mapping.</p>



<p><em>Proof</em></p>



<p>For $f$ is a two-to-one mapping $\Rightarrow$ $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$, it is too trivial to prove.</p>



<p>For $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$ $\Rightarrow$ $f$ is a two-to-one mapping, we would like to prove by contradiction.</p>



<p>If $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$, for any $\mathbf{x}$, we must have $\mathbf{y}$, where $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c}$ and $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{y}$, $f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{y})$. So $f$ is at least a two-to-one mapping. Assuming there exists a tuple of $\mathbf{x}$, $\mathbf{y}$, and $\mathbf{z}$, where $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c}$, $\mathbf{z} \neq \mathbf{x}$, and $\mathbf{z} \neq \mathbf{y}$, and $f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{y}) = f(\mathbf{z})$. According to the assurance, $\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c}$. But $\mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{y}$ so we have $\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{y}$. This raises contradiction and therefore $f$ has to be a two-to-one mapping when $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="trivial-solution">Trivial Solution</h4>

<p>Solving Simon’s problem could be trivial.</p>



<p>If we happen to know any $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$, where $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{y}$ and $f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{y})$, we immediately know $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$ and $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{y}$. This is because,</p>



<p>If we have checked all $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n$ and found there are no $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$, where $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{y}$ and $f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{y})$, we immediately know $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$.</p>



<p>So the trivial solution for solving Simon’s problem is to evaluate $f$ using the values in $\{0,1\}^n$ one by one, and check if the newly evaluated valued has been shown in the previous evaluations.</p>

<h4 id="asymptotic-complexity-for-trivial-solution">Asymptotic Complexity for Trivial Solution</h4>

<p>Using hashing, we should be able to check if the newly evaluated valued has been shown in the previous evaluations in $O(1)$. However, most of the computational cost comes from evaluating $f$ using the values in $\{0,1\}^n$ one by one.</p>



<p>If $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$, if we are extremely lucky and the first two evaluated values $f(\mathbf{x}_0) = f(\mathbf{x}_1)$, then we are done and $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{x}_0 \oplus \mathbf{x}_1$. However, in the worst scenario, we would have to have evaluate $2^{n-1} + 1$ of the values in $\{0,1\}^n$.</p>



<p>If $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$, we would know it after evaluating $2^{n-1} + 1$ of the values in $\{0,1\}^n$ by realizing that there are no two evaluated values are the same.</p>



<p>Therefore, using the trivial solution, in the worst scenario, we would have to run the evaluation $2^{n-1} + 1$ times to determine the value of $\mathbf{c}$.</p>



<p>So the question is, can we do better?</p>

<h3 id="simons-algorithm">Simon’s Algorithm</h3>

<h4 id="design-quantum-circus">Design Quantum Circus</h4>

<p>Similar to the quantum gates we used for the <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Algorithm/">Deutsch algorithm</a> and the <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Jozsa-Algorithm/">Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm</a>, the black-box $f(\mathbf{x})$ is represented using a quantum gate $U_f$.</p>

<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://leimao.github.io/images/blog/2020-07-26-Simon-Algorithm/U_f.png">
    <figcaption>$U_f$</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>The quantum gate $U_f$ is a unitary matrix which maps from $| \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes | \mathbf{y} \rangle$ to $| \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes | f(\mathbf{x}) \oplus \mathbf{y} \rangle$, namely $U_f (| \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes | \mathbf{y} \rangle) = | \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes | f(\mathbf{x}) \oplus \mathbf{y} \rangle$, for $\mathbf{x} \in \{0, 1\}^n$ and $\mathbf{y} \in \{0, 1\}^n$. When $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{0}$, $| f(\mathbf{x}) \oplus \mathbf{y} \rangle = | f(\mathbf{x}) \oplus \mathbf{0} \rangle = | f(\mathbf{x}) \rangle $, $| \mathbf{y} \oplus f(\mathbf{x}) \rangle$ is just $| f(\mathbf{x}) \rangle$.</p>



<p>Note that the above mapping is not necessarily valid when $| \mathbf{x} \rangle$ and $| \mathbf{y} \rangle$ are superpositions.</p>



<p>Let’s further check if we could achieve fewer runs with superpositions and $U_f$.</p>



<p>We have the following quantum circus. Let’s compute the each of the quantum states in the circus. The mathematics is actually much easier compared to the ones in the <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Jozsa-Algorithm/">Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm</a>.</p>

<div>

    <figcaption>$U_f$</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>









<p>Suppose $\mathbf{x}_2 = \mathbf{x}_1 \oplus \mathbf{c}$, and we also have $\mathbf{x}_1 = \mathbf{x}_2 \oplus \mathbf{c}$. Because</p>







<p>We could further rearrange $|\varphi_3\rangle $,</p>



<p>Note that $\langle \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{c} \rangle$ is a binary value. When $\langle \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{c} \rangle = 1$, $\sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } \frac{(-1)^{\langle \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{x} \rangle} \big( 1 + (-1)^{\langle \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{c} \rangle} \big) }{2} = 0$, which means that for the top output qubits, we have exact zero probability of observing $\mathbf{z}$. We could only observe $\mathbf{z}$ whose $\langle \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{c}\rangle  = 0$ for the top output qubits.</p>



<p>Statistically, when $\mathbf{c} = 0$, $\langle \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{c}\rangle  = 0$, for all $\mathbf{z} \in \{0,1\}^2$. This means all $\mathbf{z}$ are possible to be observed from the top output qubits. So what is the probability of observing $\mathbf{z}$, $p(\mathbf{z})$? Is it uniformly distributed?</p>





<p>Because $\mathbf{c} = 0$ and $f$ is an one-to-one mapping, we have</p>









<p>So when $\mathbf{c} = 0$, $p(\mathbf{z})$ is a uniform distribution and $p(\mathbf{z}) = \frac{1}{2^n}$.</p>



<p>How about when $\mathbf{c} \neq 0$?</p>





<p>Because $\mathbf{c} \neq 0$ and $f$ is a two-to-one mapping, we …</p></div></div>

    <h2 id="internally">Internally</h2>
<p>I’ve managed a few small teams, and the worst situations always happen when I avoid conflict early.</p>
<p>Hypothetically, if Sam does 3 problematic things, I might only address 2 of them. Maybe I don’t want Sam to think I’m mean, or maybe I need Sam to stay encouraged. Regardless of my intent, it becomes increasingly difficult for me to address that 3rd behavior, and increasingly burdensome to spin my wheels serving as an unnecessary intermediary in Sam’s interactions, trying to create a buffer between that 3rd behavior and the rest of the office. This is obviously stupid and unsustainable, and becomes more awkward to correct over time.</p>
<p>This often creeps up in more subtle ways. A developer might provide a lot of critical feedback on every new round of designs. I want the designer to feel empowered and trusted, but I also want the developer to care about the overall product. It’s perfectly possible to strike a good balance &amp; accurately communicate with everybody… However, it’s human-instinct to optimize each message for the receiver, and to sliiiightly oversell the degree to which I agree with the developer’s criticisms, or to soften those same criticisms when speaking with the designer. These little tweaks, which feel like hard work &amp; good management in the short-term, can really snowball over time.</p>

  <p><img src="https://gazzini.com/essays/posts/alignment/expectations.jpg" alt="A graph with time on the X axis and reckoning on the Y axis. It demonstrates that for any initial degree of misunderstanding, the expectations deviate further from reality until it is corrected."></p><p>To minimize the magnitude of reckoning:</p>
<ul>
<li>A good manager will force the reckoning sooner</li>
<li>A great manager will avoid the misalignment in the first place</li>
<li>An excellent manager will avoid this misalignment without making anyone feel bad</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="externally">Externally</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, many people believe that the role of a great recruiter (or salesperson, marketer, director, or anybody) is to actually increase the degree of misalignment in the above graph… In other words, that they should oversell. In a large enough company, someone else downstream will have to deal with the reckoning:</p>

  <p><img src="https://gazzini.com/essays/posts/alignment/before.jpg" alt="A graph where most recruiters tell the truth, but 1 evil recruiter lies and is rewarded for it."></p><p>If this incentive system goes unchecked, it quickly devolves into a situation where everybody knows that everybody oversells, and so the common wisdom is to mentally discount any promise made by a salesperson, recruiter, marketer, engineer, or really anybody:</p>

  <p><img src="https://gazzini.com/essays/posts/alignment/after.jpg" alt="A graph where most recruiters lie, but the candidates all adjust their expectations accordingly. This causes the truthful recruiters to suffer, because their truth is also discounted."></p><p>I’ve noticed that a lot of mentorship involves helping newcomers recognize the overselling for themselves &amp; learn to navigate these worlds of semi-truths &amp; complex incentives. I’ve also noticed that this flavor of BS is always bad for the overall system / company / marketplace / world.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Externally, this pattern is unavoidable. Free markets will always be susceptible to some assumed misalignment, although regulations can help.</p>
<p>Within a company, however, this behavior is toxic. Whenever I see a team sugar-coating metrics, I know that it won’t be fun to work in implementation at that company. When the rubber meets the road, the fingers will start pointing.</p>
<h2 id="misc">Misc</h2>
<p>Here are some other things that I did to make myself miserable as a new manager:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lacking the confidence to make hard decisions, and offloading them to someone more confident but less informed</li>
<li>Waiting waaaay too long to fire people</li>
<li>Reading a lot of books on management, and expecting <em>my</em> manager to immediately live the ideals of those specific books</li>
<li>Trying to manage former peers without intentionally, drastically resetting the relationship</li>
</ul>
<p>I can avoid most of these by constantly asking myself what issues I’m avoiding today, and pursuing the ones that might turn into big issues later.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>The deep ocean is one of the most challenging places for any animal to live. Creatures that live in the deep ocean cope with high water pressures, cold temperatures, food scarcity, and a lack of sunlight. There are <a href="http://www.seasky.org/deep-sea/ocean-layers.html">three “zones”</a> of the ocean, which are defined by how much sunlight they get. Sea water scatters and absorbs light, so the deeper you go, the darker it becomes. The surface zone is referred to as the “sunlight zone”. This is where most marine species live, and where plankton, kelp, and algae are able to photosynthesize. At about 650 feet, a fish will enter what is known as the “twilight zone”, where sunlight rapidly decreases with depth. At 3,300 feet down, in the “midnight zone”, there is no light other than the light that animals themselves create.</p>

<p>A big problem that fish in the twilight zone face is how to camouflage themselves. With low levels of sunlight coming from above and no light source below them, the fish appear as obvious silhouettes to predators swimming below and make for easy meals. However there are certain fish families, such as dragonfish, lanternfish, and hatchetfish, which use <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzZWWyimUGI">counter-</a></em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzZWWyimUGI"><em>illumination</em></a> to camouflage themselves from predators below.</p>

<p>Counter-illumination is when an animal emits light from its underside to avoid being seen from below. Fish that are able to counter-illuminate have special organs called photophores on their bottom half, or ventral side, to create light. They create this light either through a chemical reaction, or through a<em> symbiotic relationship</em> with bacteria that live within the photophore.</p>
<p>But how do fish know how bright their photophores should be? Just like on land, light in the ocean fluctuates based on factors like the weather and what time of day it is. These fish can adjust the strength of the light produced by their photophores to match the intensity of the light coming from above them, but most fish have forward facing eyes, so there is no way for them to see the light they are producing on the ventral side of their body. Davis and co-authors aimed to solve this mystery by looking at photophores found on the faces of these deep sea fish.</p>
<p><strong>What did they find?</strong></p>
<p>Davis and co-authors used 21 fish that were collected and preserved on research cruises between 2009 and 2017 from the Gulf of Mexico, as well as 15 preserved specimens that they borrowed from the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History. They targeted specific species that had photophores around their eyes, but did not use the photophores on their face as a “search light”. Species that used photophores as a search light use the light they produce as a flashlight to attract and hunt prey, like the angler fish from Finding Nemo.</p>
<div id="attachment_27368"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-27368" src="https://i1.wp.com/oceanbites.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/figure_fish.png?resize=422%2C364&amp;ssl=1" alt="Three images of fish in the Davis et al. study. Arrows show the direction of light from the photophores, moving towards the fish’s eyes. " width="422" height="364" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/oceanbites.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/figure_fish.png?resize=300%2C259&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/oceanbites.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/figure_fish.png?resize=150%2C129&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/oceanbites.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/figure_fish.png?resize=768%2C663&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/oceanbites.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/figure_fish.png?resize=232%2C200&amp;ssl=1 232w, https://i1.wp.com/oceanbites.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/figure_fish.png?w=891&amp;ssl=1 891w" sizes="(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p id="caption-attachment-27368">Three images of fish in the Davis et al. study. Arrows show the direction of light from the photophores, moving towards the fish’s eyes.</p></div>
<p>Once they had collected and described these fish and their relationship to one another, they looked at the direction in which the photophores were facing using a microscope and a miniature version of a CT scan. They found photophores that faced the fish’s eyes in all of the species that had photophores used for camouflage. All of these eye facing photophores were also surrounded by a layer of melanin, the same pigment that is responsible for determining the color of human skin and hair color. This layer of melanin focused the light from the photophores towards the fish’s eyes. In some of the fish species the eye had adapted to have a special opening in its lens, called the <em>aphakic gap</em>, which was lined up with the light produced by their photophores.</p>
<p>The researchers concluded that fish that had eye facing photophores used them as a calibration tool to match the intensity of the light around them. They used this specialized photophore as a proxy for the brightness of their ventral photophores, and then were able to adjust the light they were producing to eliminate their silhouettes.</p>
<p><strong>Why does this matter?</strong></p>
<p>This research is a great example of how scientists use <em><a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/science-magazines/biology-comparative-morphology-studies-structure-and-function">morphology</a></em>, or the form of an animal, to see how it is related to other animals and how its body has evolved over time. Davis and co- authors were able to construe that these two traits, having photophores on their bellies and photophores facing their eyes, evolved dependently. <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIEoO5KdPvg">Dependent trait evolution </a></em><em>&nbsp;</em>occurs when two traits that are tied to each other evolve at the same time. Because the photophores on the face of the fish determined how they were able to control their counter-illumination, and better counter-illumination led to better camouflage, fish that evolved to have both of these traits had a greater chance of survival and a greater opportunity to reproduce to pass down those traits to their offspring.</p>

By tracking collisions of phytoplankton, I can see how sticky they are by observing how often they stay together when they collide instead of bouncing off of each other.&nbsp; When I am not working on my thesis you can find me on the beach, reading a book, or working on a painting!</p></div></div>

<p>The past few years have seen many different SaaS apps pop up and appeal to businesses. From CDPs to AI, to session replay, there have been many different advanced platforms marketers can add to their toolbelts. One of my personal favorite tools over the past few years has been FullStory. FullStory is a session replay web app that allows site owners to literally watch what a user does on their website – in full video. Previously martech folks were stuck with heat mapping software like Kissmetrics and HotJar – and even to a lesser extent Google Analytics. While these tools were certainly helpful in addressing which parts of a web page were clicked on or interacted with the most, they were static interpretations of the data. </p>



<div><p>Tools like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fullstory.com/" target="_blank">FullStory </a>and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.clicktale.com/" target="_blank">Clicktale </a>take these one step further and actually provide real-time playback of what a user is doing on a website. This is also possible across sessions and even can follow a user from signup all the way through onboarding – it’s really up to you. At first glance, this seems like a godsend. The ability to actually watch what people do on your site – where they get stuck or what they’re reading when they ultimately convert or exit is one of the more powerful funnel optimization tools to come out in the past decade. I personally can attest to their efficacy. They helped me drop a SaaS CAC from $1,250 to $100 in 3 months. </p><p>There are many other instances in which I have gone into a business, implemented one of these tools, and improved conversion rates by an order of magnitude in a fraction of the time it used to take. In just a few days of watching sessions it is possible to tell:</p></div>



<ul><li>What is preventing users from converting</li><li>Where are customers losing interest in the page</li><li>Why people are dropping out of the checkout process</li><li>What content users focus in on and what they skim past</li><li>What part of the site or app crashed and how did it happen</li></ul>



<p>These are all incredibly powerful insights in the hands of a skilled marketer, so what gives? Why doesn’t everyone secretly record their users and optimize based on the data? First, its helpful to understand what session replay is, and what it isn’t…</p>



<h2>What EXACTLY is Session Replay?</h2>



<p>Session Replay is precisely what it sounds like – the ability for the site owner, or someone else, to replay the session a specific user experienced while on the site. It includes scroll activity, mouse activity, clicks, swipes, taps, and just about any other action you can think of on a website. It has a lot of other names but session replay is generally the widely accepted term that these SaaS platforms use themselves.</p>



<p>It lets you see EXACTLY where someone gets stuck so that you can design a way to fix it and reduce the friction within whatever action you’re trying to get a user to take. It can also let you remotely diagnose speed or loading issues for customers – taking it one step beyond tools like Lighthouse. Being able to see specifically which files load slowly in the real world and on real users’ devices is amazing from an optimization standpoint.</p>



<p>With that being said, these tools themselves carry a pretty heavy payload and can slow down your site by a double-digit percentage on their own. On their own they are not enough to improve the efficacy of your site or app – they need to be wielded by a scrappy marketer who can identify the issues and implement solutions to solve them. </p>



<h2>Visionary or Voyeur?</h2>



<p>While periodically I feel like a voyeur when using these tools, I do see the benefits and generally feel they outweigh the privacy concerns. In my experience the friction in implementing these tools generally comes from the engineering team who feels like they infringe on privacy rights. Are they right? Well, sort of. Out of the box these tools have the ability to record usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and other sensitive information. That is where the implementation of the tool, both from a tech standpoint and from a configuration standpoint within the platform comes into play.  It is easy to block certain fields from recording into these tools, but generally, it has to be done manually.</p>



<p>FullStory blocks password and CC number by default but those can both be disabled by a less than honest marketer in order to get additional information about a customer. While I have never seen or heard that happening myself, it is certainly possible as these tools don’t require the obfuscation of some of the more sensitive data. </p>



<p>Some point to the feeling of “big brother” watching your users browse around on the website. Which is kind of what it is doing, but the blind spot here is that the marketer (me) generally doesn’t care who the user is – they just want to know what is getting in the way of the conversion, something session replay does better than any other tool out there at the moment. If the dataset were wiped of any personally identifiable information, it would still be useful to watch anonymized sessions move through a funnel and pinpoint friction.</p>



<div><p>Technically you’re also supposed to list the fact that you are using these types of programs within your Privacy Policy or EULA, and you’re even supposed to be able to toggle the script on or off within a “cookie bar” in order to totally comply with today’s regulations but I have yet to see that actually happen.</p><p>Additionally, who knows what these companies are doing with the data they have? Could they be mining it only to sell advice on optimizing funnels to the highest bidder? It really does allow for a lot of data and PII to cross into the unknown. How can someone even opt-out of this data collection if they wanted to? </p></div>



<h2>Are They Worth Using?</h2>



<p>The short answer is yes. On the surface you cant find a much more effective tool at optimizing the behavior on your website. The magic combo would be to combine session replay with a CRO tool like Optimizely or VWO to identify issues and then implement tests to counter them.</p>



<p>The longer answer depends on your conscious. In a time where people are increasingly worried about identity theft, facial recognition, and giving too much data to big tech companies, session replay does straddle the line between effective optimization tool and privacy nightmare. It’s worth evaluating the stance of your company on privacy and data security issues before implementing one of these tools.</p>

<p>The humble Casio F91W has been an iconic watch since it was first made in Japan back in 1989. Upon its release, it was sold for around $20 making it one of the world’s first affordable digital watches. Today, Casio still produces over 3 million of the F91W every year. The prevalence of this iconic timepiece through the years means it’s likely you’ve worn one at some point. If you have, then it’s probably the only thing you have in common with Osama bin Laden, Chechen militants, and Napoleon Dynamite. Congratulations!</p>



<p>As a kid in school, I personally remember being told off for talking in the back of the class. I had been caught excitedly telling my friends that I had just figured out what kind of watch the most wanted man on earth, Osama bin Laden, wears. As punishment, I was called up to answer the maths question on the board, at which I failed miserably. <em>”You need to focus on what matters! You can’t solve maths problems but you can tell everyone about the watches worn by terrorists?”</em> screamed my teacher. <a href="https://reaperfeed.com/about-reaper-feed/">Looking back</a>, I feel I prioritized the right kind of knowledge.</p>

<p>The Casio F91W was designed by Ryusuke Moriai which he described as “small, flat and simple”. The watch features a seven-segment numerical display on a grey LCD screen. Water-resistant, extremely durable and accurate to within 30 seconds a month, it’s a tried and tested piece of kit.</p>

<p>If there’s one thing that’s to be said for international terrorists, they know a thing or two about choosing reliable products for waging war. The F-91W joined the ranks of other terrorist accessories like the Kalashnikov and the Toyota technical because it’s cheap, solid, and reliable. Oh, and it also doubles as a bombmaking accessory which we’ll look into later.</p>



<h3><strong><em>A Terrorist Fashion Icon</em></strong></h3>



<p>Whilst Casio has advanced further into combat watches through its iconic Casio G-Shock range, the F91W has remained the true battlefield accessory throughout modern warfare. Aside from iconic weapons, the Casio F-91W is the only branded accessory that Osama bin Laden was ever seen wearing in the open. Al-Qaeda was reported to <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gitmo/prisoner/720.html">hand the watches out to recruits</a> at their terror training camps across Afghanistan and Pakistan throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. Thus, it was al-Qaeda and bin Laden who arguably started the terrorist trend surrounding the watch.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/obl_AP070817055372-1.jpg?w=696&amp;ssl=1" alt="Osama Bin Laden wearing Casio FW91" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/obl_AP070817055372-1.jpg?w=371&amp;ssl=1 371w, https://i1.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/obl_AP070817055372-1.jpg?resize=239%2C300&amp;ssl=1 239w, https://i1.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/obl_AP070817055372-1.jpg?resize=335%2C420&amp;ssl=1 335w" sizes="(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Osama bin Laden wearing the iconic F-91W.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>During the height of the War on Terror, it didn’t take long for the US government to spot the prevalence of the Casio F91W amongst terrorists. In 2011, Wikileaks released a document labeled the “Matrix of Threat Indicators for Enemy Combatants” which was intended to assist staff at Guantanamo decide which detainees are more likely to carry out suicide attacks. According to the document, owning an F-91W was the biggest giveaway of a serious terror suspect alongside ownership of a satellite phone, a radio transceiver, or large quantities of cash.</p>



<p>However, this wasn’t just paranoia. Statistics in other similar documents released by Wikileaks revealed that around a third of inmates being held at Guantanamo that were captured whilst wearing an F-91W had a known correlation with explosives. The F-91W watch came up almost 150 times in the piles of leaked <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gitmo/pdf/ym/us9ym-000840dp.pdf">Guantanamo prisoner assessments</a>. Ironically, four of the chaplains who worked at Guantanimo Bay also wore the watch.</p>

<p>One of the detainees at Guantanamo was grilled over the prevalence of the watch amongst suspected terrorists. He claimed that the water-resistant feature of the F91W watch was handy due to the Islamic requirement for followers to wash up to their elbows before prayers. Innocent enough explanation, right? Well not really. Interrogators smelled a rat when another prisoner claimed the prevalence of the watch amongst Jihadi inmates was simply due to the built-in compass that helped them pray towards Mecca. However, there is no compass in the F91W.</p>



<p>Despite the fairly frosty relationship between the two, ISIS didn’t let it get in between their choice of a good wristwatch. The F-91W was a feature of various ISIS militants including Tunisian born Tariq al-Harzi who was a high ranking Emir of the Islamic State. It was also worn by Kevin Chassin who was a French-born Jihadist who went to Syria to join ISIS. He was subsequently utilized for his high propaganda value in ISIS videos. </p>

<p>However, the leader of ISIS Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi wasn’t so fond of the cheap Casio F91W. Instead, al-Baghdadi opted for a flashy watch that sparked debate over the exact model. The watch was spotted during his infamous speech in Mosul that declared the formation of the so-called Caliphate. It was believed to be either a Rolex or an Omega Seamaster, both of which run north of $3,000 and contradict the contents of his speech as well as his ideals.</p>



<p>It’s not just Jihadist terrorist groups that wear the watch. Introducing Subcomandante Marcos who, until recently, led the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) in Mexico. The photogenic insurgent leader was pictured in an iconic photo on horseback while smoking a pipe and wearing, you guessed it! </p>

<p>Of course, the watch is not only appreciated by the terrorists of the world but likewise by the people who combat them. Various fighting forces across the Middle East have been seen using the watch. Such as the Syrian Democratic Forces which is a coalition waging an anti-ISIS campaign across war-torn Syria.</p>



<h3><em><strong> How the Casio F91W Became a Bomb Makers Accessory</strong></em></h3>



<p>The Casio F91W is not only the terrorist’s timepiece of choice due to its ruggedness and reliability. Due to its long-lead timer, it also doubles as a bomb-making accessory for various terror groups around the world from Afghanistan to Chechnya. Deadly usage of the watch has been well documented through various case studies.</p>

<p>According to US intelligence officials, the watch doubles as a bomb timer as its alarm can be set beyond a 24-hour period. During the War on Terror, Pakistani ISI officials found more than 600 of the watches in a terrorist safe house in Karachi which led to a period of anybody being found wearing an F91W watch to be liable for arrest and questioning. However, with the watch being available for $4 dollars on Pakistani markets, simply possessing a Casio watch doesn’t prove anything and this tactic of arrest was soon dropped.</p>



<p>In September 1999, a series of bombs were detonated inside four Russian apartment buildings in the cities of Moscow, Volgodonsk, and Buinaksk. The blasts killed 367 people and injured over 1,000 others. Russian investigators concluded that the attackers had been trained in terror camps being run by Ibn al-Khattab inside Chechnya which had recently gained unstable independence following the First Chechen War.</p>

<p>Investigations carried out inside Chechnya discovered that the bombs used in the attacks were comprised of ammonium nitrate and aluminum powder, with plastic serving as an intermediate explosive. The detonator? A combination of a Krona battery and a Casio F-91W. </p>



<blockquote><p>“about a third of inmates at JTF-GTMO [the unit in charge of Guantanamo] who were captured wearing one of these watches had a known correlation with explosives”.</p><cite>– Prisoner evaluation sheet from Guantanamo.</cite></blockquote>



<p>In 1994, an al-Qaeda militant named Ramzi Yousef used the Casio F-91W as a 4-hour timer on the bomb he constructed in an airplane toilet of Philippine Airlines Flight 434. He proceeded to leave his deadly work under the seat before leaving the plane. It detonated on the next flight, killing a Japanese businessman named Haruki Ikegami who sat in Yousef’s seat. Thankfully, the bomb’s orientation caused the energy to be mostly absorbed by Ikegami. Thus other passengers and the plane were not catastrophically damaged.</p>



<p>So, to round off this article I feel it’s fitting to make a comparison between Ryusuke Moriai and Mikhail Kalashnikov. Just like when Kalashnikov designed the AK47 intended solely for the defense of his motherland, the innovative inventor Ryusuke Moriai could never have predicted that his creation would go on an unstoppable path of its own and be used for far more sinister purposes than ever intended. Mr. Moriai had unwittingly created a watch ideal for modern warfare.</p>

<p>I was hoping to find a profound statement from Casio on the watch being used for deadly means by some pretty evil people. I was looking for something similar to what Kalashnikov said about the violent impact of his life’s work. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/apr/28/casio-f-91w-watch-design-hipsters-al-qaida">The Guardian</a> approached the PR department for Casio hoping for a similar statement on the widespread use of the F-91W amongst global terrorists. But they just received a blunt email stating: “Casio is not making any further comment on the F-91W watch at this point in time.” Damn.</p>

two competing, intrinsically motivated agents agree on essentially

the other by inventing  experimental protocols where both

<p>This essay will hopefully be the first post in a series covering some of the basics of how things in the past, particularly in the ancient world, were made.  This isn’t a how-to guide (we’re not going to go into that much depth) but instead intended as a window into the many tasks that made a pre-modern society <em>work</em>, tasks that are so often <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/07/12/collections-the-lonely-city-part-i-the-ideal-city/">left </a><a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/07/19/the-lonely-city-part-ii-real-cities-have-curves/">out </a>of the modern imagination of the past.  Throughout, I want to highlight not only the jobs, but also <strong>the people who did them</strong> and the <strong>human landscapes they created</strong>.</p>



<p>Each entry in this series is likely to come in multiple parts – as you will soon see, almost everything worth making has to be made in quite a few steps and each step is often complex enough to occupy its own weekly post.  I <em>think</em> this series will run in four parts (possibly with a fifth part addendum), but no plan survives contact with my tendency to overwrite.  I wanted to start with farming instead of something more flashy and exciting like iron production (where I know there is quite a lot of interest in how one goes from reddish rock to polished sword), for the simple reason that <strong>agriculture sits at the foundation of every other form of production</strong>.  Every person in an agrarian society whose job – mining, smithing, tanning, timber-cutting, trading, tailoring, <em>everything</em> – doesn’t involve primary food production is subsisting off of the food production of others, typically (as we’ll see) <em>many</em> others.</p>



<p>That said, <em>this post</em> is mostly about <strong>farmers</strong> more than <em>farming</em> (we will talk about the mechanics of farming, just not right away!).  One thing I want to highlight in this series are the many different jobs and occupations <em>and the people who did them</em> who tend to lurk in the background of our imagination of the past, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/07/12/collections-the-lonely-city-part-i-the-ideal-city/">where they appear at all</a>.  And in the case of farming in much of the pre-modern world, the survival strategies of subsistence farmers exert a very strong shaping influence on the countryside and life for non-farmers (terminology note: ‘subsistence’ farming refers to farming directed primarily towards the survival of the farmers and their families; in much of the pre-modern world, there was a fairly sharp divide between <em>most</em> farmers who farmed on a subsistence basis and the largest market-oriented estates of the wealthy, who will be our focus <em>next</em> week).</p>



<p>As a final caveat before we dive in, I specialize in the economy of the ancient Mediterranean, so my observations here are going to tend (where not otherwise noted) to be <em>most</em> true in the Mediterranean world, in that period (c. 650 BC – 450 AD).  Where I know there are major exceptions, I’ll try to note them, but it’s simply not possible to know every production permutation <em>everywhere</em> and at <em>every</em> time.  For this series, we’re going to focus on wheat production, with a bit of a Mediterranean bias (but I’ve tried to pull in some evidence from North China as well; by and large I’ve found that wheat cultivation seems to create <em>similar </em>patterns everywhere, but there is local variation).</p>

<p><strong>Bibliography note at the outset</strong>: for the sake of keeping these posts readable, especially since I don’t have an easy footnote function here, I am not going to laboriously cite everything at each point of reference, but I’ll include a bibliography note up front for the whole series.  My information for the ancient Mediterranean is drawn from a number of sources, the most important of which are P. Erdkamp, <em>The Grain Market in the Roman Empire</em> (2005); N. Rosenstein, <em>Rome at War: Farms, Families and Death in the Middle Republic</em> (2004); Foxhall and Forbes, “Σιτομετρεία: The Role of Grain as a Staple Food in Classical Antiquity,” <em>Chiron</em> 12 (1982) and Foxhall, “The Dependent Tenant” <em>JRS</em> 80 (1990), and just reading a pile of Greek and Roman agricultural writers (Columella, Cato, Pliny the Elder, Xenophon, etc).<br>Note also C. Fischer-Bovet, <em>Army and Society in Ptolemaic Egypt</em> (2014), W. Scheidel, <em>Death on the Nile</em> (2001) and R. Bagnall and B. Frier, <em>The Demography of Roman Egypt </em>(1994) for the Egyptian demographic modeling.  Egypt is an important reference for demographic data because relatively more records survive there due to the arid conditions preserving papyrus.<br>I am less well read on Medieval European agriculture, but I should note some reliance here on M. Bloch, <em><em>La Société Féodale</em></em> (1940; available trans. Manyon, 1962) and E.L.R. Ladurie, <em>Les Paysans de Languedoc</em> (1966; available trans. J. Day, 1976).  Also relevant on general features and broad continuity, J. Landers, <em>The Field and the Forge</em> (2003); for the military history minded, Landers (and Rosenstein) are more focused on the connection between agriculture and military activity.<br>My references to Chinese agriculture are from Cho-yun Hsu, <em>Han Agriculture: The Formation of Early Chinese Agrarian Economy</em> (1980).</p>



<h2>Why Bread?</h2>



<p>From the outset I want to note that agriculture, especially subsistence agriculture, typically is not planting simple mono-cultures of a single crop.  I opted to focus in this series on <strong>bread</strong> because it is <em><strong>usefully simple</strong></em> for a number of reasons.  It lets us focus on wheat and barley, which are relatively simple crops to talk about but also (in the broad sweep of Eurasia where they were the primary crop) provided the majority of calories for the <em><strong>vast</strong></em> majority of people.  Vegetables, fruit, meat, other animal products (along with sauces and things derived from them) were in the ancient Mediterranean generally expensive things, used by most normal people (read: the not-super-rich) to <em>flavor</em> a meal that still consisted mostly of bread, when they were available at all.  That’s because (as we’ll see) wheat and barley were efficient and cheap to grow at scale.</p>

<p>That doesn’t mean that people <em>only</em> ate bread, to be clear.  The Mediterranean diet is built on a <em>triad</em> of grapes, grains and olives; animal products were also in the diet.  Grains don’t have a broad enough range of nutrients to really subsist someone forever; you need proteins and vitamins and so on.  <strong><em>But</em></strong> when we are looking at the bulk of what was eaten any way we measure it – calories, volume, weight, labor intensity, economic scale – cheap, mass-available grains just dominate, so that’s where we start.  When scholars model ancient agriculture and food habits, they build a nutritional model centered on grains and then supplement with other things as necessary (which as an aside is <em>also</em> how the Greeks and Romans actually talk about food – rations that we are quite sure included meat and vegetables are typically given as grain allowances, e.g. Thuc 4.16.1; Plut. <em>Lyc</em>. 12.2; Plb. 6.39.13; Cato, <em>de Agr.</em> 56).</p>



<p>Finally, a <strong>terminology note</strong>: when I say <strong>wheat</strong> I mean genus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat"><em>triticum</em> </a>and its subspecies; when I say <strong>barley</strong> I mean <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barley">Hordeum vulgare</a></em>.  I am going to use ‘grain’ or ‘grains’ to refer to both crops together (although there are many other grains).  The British frequently use the word ‘corn’ to refer to wheat; this causes no end of confusion in Americans, for whom ‘corn’ means <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize">maize</a>.  I do not know that I will reference maize, but if I do, I will call it maize and to avoid confusion, I am not going to use corn at all as a term.  Apologies to my British readers whose usage is, I should note, older but also more confusing.</p>



<p>To start with, we need to start not with our crops, <strong>but with our farm and farmers.</strong></p>



<h2>The Farming Household</h2>



<p>Looking at our peasant household, what we generally have are large families on small farms.  The households in these farms were not generally nuclear households, but extended ones.  Pre-Han Chinese documents assume a household to include three generations: two elderly parents, their son, his wife, and their four children (eight individuals total).  Ptolemaic and Roman census data reveal a bewildering array of composite families, including multi-generational homes, but also households composed of multiple nuclear families of siblings (so a man, his wife, his brother and then brother’s wife and their children, for instance), and so on.<strong>  Normal family units tended to be around eight individuals, but with wide variation</strong> (for comparison, <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/families/households.html">the average household size in the United States for a family is 3.14</a>).</p>

Note how many individuals (presumably a mix of neighbors, friends and the extended family) are attached to this dwelling – and also how it is a multi-purpose structure, both a workshop and residence.</figcaption></figure>



<p>At the same time that households <strong>were <em>large</em> (by modern standards), the farms they tilled were, by modern standards, very small</strong>.  The normal size of a Roman household small farm is generally estimated between 5 and 8 <em>iugera</em> (a Roman measurement of land, roughly 3 to 5 acres); in pre-Han Northern China (where wheat and millet, not rice, were the staple crops), the figure was “one hundred mu (4.764 acres)” – essentially the same.  In Languedoc, a study of Saint-Thibery in 1460 showed 118 households (out of 189) on farms of less than 20 <em>setérée</em> (12 acres or so; the <em>setérée </em>appears to be an inexact unit of measurement); 96 of them were on less than 10 <em>setérée</em> (about 6 acres).  So while there is a <em>lot</em> of variation, <strong>by and large it seems like the largest cluster of household farms tend to be around 3 to 8 acres or so; 5 acre farms are a good ‘average’ small farm.</strong></p>



<p>This coincidence of normal farm size and family size is not an accident, but essentially represents …</p></div></div>

<p><span>A groundswell of support is emerging for families of the victims of April’s mass killing and their demands for a public inquiry.</span></p>
<p><span>On Thursday, the provincial and federal governments </span><a href="https://www.halifaxexaminer.ca/province-house/no-public-inquiry-into-mass-murders/"><span>announced a joint independent review</span></a><span> would be conducted into the tragedy rather than a public inquiry. That’s what victims’ families, national women’s organizations, senators, and many others had asked for.</span></p>
<p><span>Hours after the announcement, Dawn Parke became an administrator of a newly created Facebook group called </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/306124757254346/?multi_permalinks=306663027200519&amp;notif_id=1595612557492154&amp;notif_t=group_activity&amp;ref=notif"><span>‘Nova Scotians for a Public Inquiry.</span></a><span>’</span><span> Within 12 hours, they had more than 3,600 members. As of Friday afternoon, it had jumped to 6,000.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Parke said her priority is ensuring the families of the victims — some of whom have joined the page — are supported and heard. She wasn’t surprised to see the group’s numbers grow so quickly.</span></p>
<p><span>“There’s a lot of anger, and the majority of the people that have joined the page believe that there are mistakes, that this is a cover up, and that there’s been no transparency,” Parke said in an interview.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“There are people from every different background, regardless of political affiliation or personal belief. I think we are all united in our grief and in our rage and the ineptitude that has been demonstrated.”</span></p>
<p><span>Parke lives in Moncton, NB now, but grew up in Colchester County, specifically Wentworth. She knew three of the victims personally.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“I went to high school with them, was friends with them, interacted with them,” she said. “But I think all of Nova Scotia has a connection to this whether we knew the victims personally or we know other people who knew them personally.”</span></p>
<p><span>Parke said many Nova Scotians reaching out via the group say they have no faith in the review process announced yesterday. She said even if the review could address all their concerns and get the answers they were seeking, the level of mistrust in government is currently too deep. Because a public inquiry is what the families want and need, she believes we should all be listening to them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“This is their (the governments’) version of a bandaid, or in some ways a muzzle, not just for the victims and their families, but for all of our communities and for all women,” Parke said.</span></p>
<p><span>“This has the potential to explode because we’re at a very serious level of public anger and public mistrust in Nova Scotia, and I don’t think that our politicians should be ignoring that.”</span></p>
<p><span>Although the group is focused on Nova Scotia, Parke said many Canadians are coming onboard and they welcome and encourage anyone with concerns to join them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“There have been countless communities across Canada that have faced this type of violence before and haven’t received the answers that they’re looking for, and I think as Nova Scotians and Canadians we’re all fed up with the lack of transparency,” she said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“This is taxpayers’ money that goes into these institutions and that they have complete control over what’s shared publicly is unacceptable…These people were our friends, our neighbours, our nurses, family, and we need to get justice for them and justice includes a public, independent inquiry.”</span></p>
<h3>Petition gaining momentum <span>&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span>Parke is also actively encouraging members of the group to sign an online petition created last night by Dartmouth resident Jenny Negus.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.change.org/p/government-of-nova-scotia-have-a-public-inquiry-into-nova-scotia-s-mass-shooting?utm_content=cl_sharecopy_23669419_en-CA%3A4&amp;recruiter=1134470319&amp;recruited_by_id=cb26d2c0-cd48-11ea-a7f6-6fa128536285&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_initial&amp;utm_term=psf_combo_share_initial"><span>Negus’s petition</span></a><span> calls on the federal and provincial governments to hold a public inquiry. She started it at the request of a family member of one of the victims who was killed by the gunman the Halifax Examiner refers to as GW.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As of Friday afternoon, the number of signatures on her petition had exceeded 5,800.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Although her initial target was 500 signatures, it grew so quickly that she now has much loftier goals. Negus’s ultimate hopes is that the petition swells into the tens of thousands and forces the federal and provincial governments to reverse course on the independent review and deliver on a public inquiry.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“It is disgusting and it’s unbelievable that an independent review was called because that’s not what they’re asking for, they’re not asking for a quick answer, they’re asking for an inquiry,” Negus said.</span></p>
<p><span>“This has affected everybody. It has affected people, families and communities right across Nova Scotia, and they all care about each other. Nova Scotians aren’t a ‘one-for-all’ kind of people, we try to be there for each other.”</span></p>
<p><span>Negus said the length of time it took to arrive at an independent review coupled with all the questions and mistrust in government has many Nova Scotians frustrated and grateful for a way to express their anger over Thursday’s decision.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“It takes two minutes to sign it to support them (the families). I’m in contact with at least one person from each family and they’ve all thanked me, they’ve all said this is needed,” she said.</span></p>
<h3>NDP calls for emergency sitting</h3>
<p><span>On Friday morning, NDP leader Gary Burrill wrote to Premier Stephen McNeil calling for an emergency sitting of the legislature in order to put forward a bill seeking to establish a full public inquiry into the events of April 18-19.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Citing “grave concerns” with the independent review approach over a public inquiry, Burrill said people were “rightfully confounded” at the decision to do “anything short” of a public inquiry.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>In an interview, NDP justice spokesperson Claudia Chender said the process announced yesterday has led to a deluge of emails from constituents asking her to advocate for a public inquiry. She said criticism over the decision appears to be “almost universal.”</span></p>
<p><span>“I think it’s rare that you see such a unified response to a government action, and so in the past 24 hours or so since the review was announced we’ve heard almost universal condemnation,” Chender said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“Even Minister Mark Furey in the press conference yesterday when asked admitted that in fact no one asked for a review, but hundreds if not thousands of people have asked for an inquiry.”</span></p>
<p><span>Chender said a decision of this magnitude is far too important for the government to make without “being held to account” publicly. She said it must be done in the legislative context so they can introduce their bill mandating a public inquiry, have it debated, and ask questions of the justice minister.</span></p>
<p><span>“We could make our arguments that we’ve heard on behalf of our constituents and they could respond to them, and we could have a fulsome debate which we think this deserves,” she said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“I think we’ve heard an almost universal sentiment that Nova Scotians asked for a public inquiry and they deserve one.”</span></p>
<h3>McNeil: ‘doing everything we possibly can’</h3>
<p><span>During Friday’s public COVID-19 media briefing, the premier was asked by several reporters about the decision and the outrage it has provoked.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>McNeil reiterated his belief that an independent review was the best approach, not a public inquiry. He said that if the three panel members at any point in the process believe they require more power, they can ask and the province will respond and work with them “to ensure that we get to the bottom and deliver on the answers.”</span></p>
<p><span>McNeil also said a critical component of the process for his government was ensuring that family members had access and were able to participate.</span></p>
<p><span>“I want to reassure all of those in this province who have been impacted by those two days or quite frankly have been feeling the pain and suffering that those families have been feeling,” McNeil said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“We as a government are doing everything we possibly can to get to the bottom of those answers and will support these three prominent Canadians who have the ability to ensure that they get to those answers.”</span></p>

				<p>An irrational number is a number that can’t be represented as a fraction using integers for the numerator and denominator.</p>
<p>I’m a big fan of irrational numbers, and one of the biggest reasons for that is that they are great at making low discrepancy sequences, which give amazing results when used in stochastic (randomized) algorithms, compared to regular random numbers.  Low discrepancy sequences are cousins to blue noise because they both aim to keep samples well spread out, but the usage case is different, so it’s situational whether to use blue noise or an LDS.  That means that luckily there is room enough in the world for both LDS and blue noise.</p>
<p>This post is a random grab bag of things relating to irrational numbers.</p>
<p>Pythagorian cultists supposedly murdered someone to keep irrational numbers a secret, so this is technically forbidden knowledge, I guess.</p>

<p>Continued fractions are a way of writing numbers that can be useful for helping analyze irrational numbers, and rational approximations to specific numbers – whether they are rational or irrational.</p>
<p>If a continued fraction is infinitely long, that means it represents an irrational number, and all irrational numbers have continued fractions that are infinitely long.  If a continued fraction is not infinitely long, that means it’s a rational number.</p>
<p>Here is the beginning of the continued fraction for pi.</p>
<p><a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/pi.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/pi.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>Another way of writing continued fractions is to get rid of all the redundant “1 divided by…” and just write the integers you see on the left.  The continued fraction for pi above would look like this, which is a lot more compact:</p>
<p>[3;7,15,1,292,1,1,1,2,1,3,1]</p>
<p>Let’s talk about how you make a continued fraction by walking through how to make it for pi, or at least 3.14159265359 anyways, since pi goes forever.</p>
<p>First up you take the integer part and use that as the first digit.  Subtracting that integer part out leaves you with a remainder:</p>
<p>[3]<br>
remainder: 0.14159265359 </p>
<p>We take 1/remainder to get 7.06251330592.  The integer part of this number is going to be our next number.  Subtracting the integer part out gives us our next remainder:</p>
<p>[3;7]<br>
remainder: 0.06251330592</p>
<p>1/remainder is 15.9965944095, which makes our next integer and remainder into:</p>
<p>[3;7,15]<br>
remainder: 0.9965944095</p>
<p>1/remainder is 1.00341722818, so now we are at…</p>
<p>[3;7,15,1]<br>
remainder: 0.00341722818</p>
<p>1/remainder is 292.63483365 so now we are at:</p>
<p>[3;7,15,1,292]<br>
remainder: 0.63483365</p>
<p>1/remainder is 1.57521580653 and we’ll stop at the next step:</p>
<p>[3;7,15,1,292, 1]<br>
remainder: 0.57521580653</p>
<p>Wherever you have a large number in the continued fraction, it’s because you just did one divided by a small number. The larger the integer means the smaller the remainder there was to make that integer.</p>
<p>The smaller a remainder is, the better approximated the number is at that step of the continued fraction.</p>
<p>This means that when you see a large number in a continued fraction, that if you truncated the continued fraction right before that large number, you’d have a pretty good approximation of the actual number that the continued fraction represents.</p>
<p>The larger the number, the better the approximation.</p>
<p>Because of this, looking at the continued fraction for pi, below, you can see that it has a pretty large number (292) pretty early in the sequence.</p>
<p>[3;7,15,1,292,1,1,1,2,1,3,1]</p>
<p>This means that the following continued fraction approximates pi “pretty well”.</p>
<p>[3;7,15,1]</p>
<p>We’ll cover how to figure this out further down in the post, but that fraction is actually 355/113 and has a special name “Milü”, found by Chinese mathematician and astronomer, Zǔ Chōngzhī, born 429 AD.  It is within 0.000009% of the value of pi.</p>
<p>More info from wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mil%C3%BC" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mil%C3%BC</a></p>
<p>So, while pi is probably the most famous irrational number, it certain isn’t the most irrational number that there is, as it is so easily approximated by smallish integers in a division.</p>
<p>Quick note if you write a program to convert a floating point number to a continued fraction: If you try to make a continued fraction for a number that a floating point can’t represent exactly – such as 4.1 – you will get a very tiny remainder which then makes a very large integer when you flip it over.  In my case, when using doubles, it made such a large number that converting it to an integer overflowed the integer.  One way to address this is to just consider any remainder smaller than some threshold as zero.  Like maybe any remainder less than 0.00001 can be considered zero.</p>

<p>So even though pi is not the most irrational number, phi is (pronounced “fee”, and is aka the golden ratio).  Yes, it is the most irrational number!</p>
<p>We’ll use the value 1.61803398875 and make a continued fraction.</p>
<p>[1]<br>
remainder: 0.61803398875<br>
1/remainder: 1.61803398875</p>
<p>[1;1]<br>
remainder: 0.61803398875<br>
1/remainder: 1.61803398875</p>
<p>[1;1,1]<br>
remainder: 0.61803398875<br>
1/remainder: 1.61803398875</p>
<p>Wait a second… do you see a pattern? the remainder is always the same value, and then when we do 1/remainder we always get the golden ratio again.  That means this continued fraction is 1’s all the way into infinity.</p>
<p>In the last section we saw how having a large number in the continued fraction meant that a number was well approximated at that point in the continued fraction.</p>
<p>The golden ratio has a 1 for every number in the continued fraction, which is the smallest value you can have. That means it’s as least well approximated as you can be, at every stage in the continued fraction.</p>
<p>This is what is meant by the golden ratio being the most irrational number.  It’s the least well approximated by rational numbers (dividing one integer by another).</p>
<p>When I said I liked irrational numbers I was mainly talking about the golden ratio, but other highly irrational numbers, like the square root of 2, are also nice.  Highly irrational numbers have the properties that I like – the properties that make them useful to use as low discrepancy sequences.</p>
<p>An interesting thing you may have noticed above is that when you divide 1 by the golden ratio, you get the golden ratio minus 1.  That is:</p>
<p>1 / 1.61803398875 = 0.61803398875</p>
<p>If you replace the golden ratio with “x” you get this equation:</p>
<p>1/x = x-1</p>
<p>If you solve that equation, you will get the golden ratio out.  It is the only number that has this property! Well actually, -0.61803398875 does too, and relates to the fact that there is a + and – root solution to that quadratic equation, but maybe that’s not that surprising.  1/-0.61803398875 is -1.61803398875. The behavior is the same, it’s just happening on the other side of zero.</p>
<p>Something else interesting about the golden ratio is that if you square it, it’s the same as adding 1.</p>
<p>1.61803398875*1.61803398875=2.61803398875</p>
<p>That gives you a formula:</p>
<p>x*x = x+1</p>
<p>If you solve that, you get the golden ratio again as the only solution (well, and the negative golden ratio minus 1 just like before).  Probably not too surprising if you look at the formulas though, as you can use simple algebra to change one formula into the other.</p>

<p>If you had a continued fraction and wanted to turn it into a regular fraction (or real number), you could run the process in reverse.</p>
<p>However, doing that means you start at the right most digit of the continued fraction and work left til you get to the beginning. How do you do this with an infinitely long continued fraction, like an irrational number would have?</p>
<p>Luckily there is a way to start at the left and work right, so that you can get approximations to infinitely long continued fractions (irrational numbers).</p>
<p>Let’s do this with pi, with this much of the continued fraction:</p>
<p>[3;7,15,1,292,1,1]</p>
<p>What you do is make a table which has a row for the numerator and denominator.  The first numerator is 1, and the first denominator is 0.  The second numerator is the first number in the continued fraction sequence, and the second denominator is 1.</p>
<p><a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofraction0a.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofraction0a.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>The formula for the rest of the numerators and denominators is…</p>
<ul>
<li>numerator[index] = CF[index] * numerator[index-1] + numerator[index-2]</li>
<li>denominator[index] = CF[index] * denominator[index-1] + denominator[index-2]</li>
</ul>
<p>Doing that from left to right, you get this:</p>
<p><a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofraction0b.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofraction0b.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>Below we do that with pi, golden ratio, sqrt(2) and an irrational number i came up with that is not very irrational, and is well approximated by 1.01.</p>
<p><a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofraction3.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofraction3.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>A quick fun tangent is that you might notice that for golden ratio, both the numerators and denominators are the Fibonacci numbers.  This is the link between the golden ratio and Fibonacci numbers.</p>
<p>Below shows the percentage error of each number, as more terms in the continued fraction are added.</p>
<p><a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofractionerror1.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofractionerror1.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>Golden ratio error decreases the slowest which shows that the golden ratio is least well approximated by fractions.  The made up irrational number that is approximately 1.01 has error decreasing the fastest because it is the least irrational of these numbers.  Pi shows itself as having fairly low irrationality, and the square root of 2 is fairly irrational.</p>
<p>Here is the error on a log y axis to better show the difference in error.</p>
<p><a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofractionerror2.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofractionerror2.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>It’s worth noting that 1/goldenRatio aka 0.61803398875 is every bit as irrational as the golden ratio itself is.  The reason for this is that we are flipping the numerator and denominator over for this fraction that doesn’t exist.  Flipping it over doesn’t make it more representable as a fraction.</p>
<p>When I’m using the golden ratio for low discrepancy sequences, i usually use that 1/goldenRatio value, also known as “the golden ratio conjugate” because the smaller value means it’s going to have fewer numerical issues and more precision, when working with small values (like between 0 and 1).</p>
<p>Also, there are an infinite amount of numbers just as irrational as the golden ratio.  You can calculate them by calculating:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%27+%3D+%28p%2Aa%2Bq%29+%2F+%28r%2Aa%2Bs%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0" alt="a' = (p*a+q) / (r*a+s)" title="a' = (p*a+q) / (r*a+s)"></p>
<p>where p,q,r,s are integers and the absolute value of p*s-q*r is 1.</p>
<p>That is the Moebius transform.</p>
<p>If you are wondering what the least irrational number is, it looks like there are multiple (infinite) and they are just numbers that …</p></div></div>

    <p>How computationally expensive are various fundamental floating point mathematical operations? &nbsp;Here’s a quick and dirty benchmark, which, although surely quite naive, seems to capture the rough&nbsp;relative cost of a few operations.</p>

<h4 id="motivation">Motivation</h4>

<p>This quarter I am taking a course on&nbsp;numerical linear algebra. &nbsp;Naturally, we are covering topics like the fundamentals of floating point arithmetic, numerical stability, matrix decompositions, and algorithm analysis.</p>

<p>In a few of our assignments, we are&nbsp;tasked with determining the <em>exact number of floating point operations</em> (FLOPs) required to execute some particular algorithm. Analyzing the complexity of algorithms is certainly a useful exercise, but it’s silly to give the impression that we can produce the <em>exact</em> FLOP count. &nbsp;I’m not much of a hardware guy, but I at least know that modern CPUs are stupendously complex, and any FLOP count we can write down on paper after inspecting pseudocode has no chance at being “exact” in any meaningful way.</p>

<p>Besides the overall futility of these exercises, we are instructed to&nbsp;consider each of the following operations as a&nbsp;baseline of “1 FLOP”: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root. &nbsp;As we will see shortly, these operations are not even close to equivalent in terms of real-world computational expense, so it’s misleading to count these all as&nbsp;equal atoms&nbsp;of computation.</p>

<p>Anyways… on one recent assignment we were asked to look at the FLOP count for some technique that used a rotation matrix. &nbsp;As you might expect for rotation-y stuff, the matrix entries were based on various trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, arctan). &nbsp;I was in a rush when doing the assignment, so I casually assigned 1 FLOP to each of these trig functions. &nbsp;I felt partially justified in doing this, as I had <a href="http://randomascii.wordpress.com/2014/10/09/intel-underestimates-error-bounds-by-1-3-quintillion/" target="_blank">just learned</a> that these trig functions are in fact offered as single CPU instructions in modern Intel x86. &nbsp;Given that we were glossing over so much already, it seemed excusable&nbsp;to consider as atomic anything that can theoretically be done in a single CPU instruction. Regardless, I was&nbsp;docked points. Hmph.</p>

<p>OK fine, I’m not&nbsp;worried about the points, but now I’m&nbsp;curious about how expensive these operations really are. &nbsp;If “square root” qualifies as 1 FLOP, is it really so wrong to lump in “sine” as 1 FLOP, too?</p>

<h4 id="benchmark">Benchmark</h4>

<p>I dusted off the C++ region of my brain, and hacked up the following test program. It was fun to (ab)use macros heavily here.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;math.h&gt;
#include &lt;chrono&gt;

            (clock_::now() - beg_).count();
    }

    // time the baseline code:

<h4 id="results">Results</h4>

<p>Compiling this benchmark non-optimized (so that nothing gets erased or rearranged) and running on my Intel Core i7 machine, I get the following results. &nbsp;I’ve normalized so results are relative to the cost of “plus.”</p>

<p><img src="https://latkin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/FLOPchart1.png" alt="benchmark results"></p>

<p>So&nbsp;of the “1 FLOP” operations, it turns out&nbsp;division and square root are really about 4x and 6x as expensive, respectively, as the baseline of addition.&nbsp;Trig functions appear to land somewhere in the 15x-20x range, and exp about 10x.</p>

<p>So yes, trig functions&nbsp;really are significantly more expensive than +-*√ (though it still seems a bit arbitrary to count sqrt&nbsp;and division as 1 FLOP).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Measuring the productivity of most professions is exceptionally challenging. Would you measure a lawyer’s productivity by the number of cases they close? Or a doctor’s productivity by the number of operations they perform?</p><p>Moving to the software engineering realm, should your company start measuring lines of code produced by engineers? Please no. How about pull requests per engineer? Nah. Sprint velocity on the company level? 😬</p><p>While it may be tempting to get started with these metrics, resist the temptation. These metrics reward output, people who put in immense amounts of busywork. Another issue with these metrics is that they create unhealthy team dynamics - your company won’t be more successful if teams compete internally, save that energy for competitors. Instead, your productivity metrics should focus on outcomes.</p><p>I’ve tried to summarize my thoughts on the company, team and individual levels.</p><h2 id="Driving-business-outcomes-on-the-company-level"><a href="#Driving-business-outcomes-on-the-company-level" title="Driving business outcomes on the company level"></a>Driving business outcomes on the company level</h2><p>Let’s take a look at a recent study, the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Accelerate</a> and to what conclusions Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim arrived after four years of research. They identified the following key performance indicators of high performing engineering organizations: lead time, deployment frequency, mean time to restore and change-fail percentage. Let’s take a look at them, one by one.</p><p><strong>Lead time</strong> is the amount of time it takes for the engineering teams to ship a feature, end-to-end. While it may be challenging to do this across the board (as features will differ in scope), you can simplify it a bit, and define it as the time it takes someone from opening a pull-request till deploying it to production.</p><p><strong>Deployment frequency</strong> is more straightforward, as the name suggests, it represents the number of production deployments over a given period.</p><p><strong>Mean time to restore</strong> represents the amount of time it takes to restore service, once you had an outage.</p><p><strong>Change-fail percentage</strong> tells you what percentage of your deployments result in an outage that you have to restore.</p><p>The beauty of these metrics is that they are relatively simple to track. I bet you are already using some CI/CD pipelines, so the deployment frequency is given. Mean time to restore and change-fail percentage is something that your post-mortem meetings should already record. Without question, the most challenging metric here is around lead-times: it will be a compound metric that you’ll derive from code review times, CI build times and deployment times.</p><blockquote><p>While the mean time to restore and change-fail percentage metrics may seem like purely reliability metrics, they are not. The worse those indicators are, the more time engineers will spend on incidents and less on features that your customers are paying for.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Team-health-metrics"><a href="#Team-health-metrics" title="Team health metrics"></a>Team health metrics</h2><p>I believe that candid and compassionate feedback is central to a cohesive, high-functioning team. Managers, whether they are front-line managers or above, play a crucial role in creating a feedback culture: a culture where every employee feels safe and comfortable providing feedback to other members of the team, or of that of the broader organization.</p><p>While trust is not simple to measure either, anonymous surveys can help with it. By doing surveys for your teams regularly, you can also keep track of your progress in different areas (trust is just one of them).</p><p>Questions like these (well, more like statements that people have to agree or disagree with) might give you some idea of how you, as a manager, do when it comes to building trust:</p><ul><li>“My manager proactively solicits feedback.”</li><li>“My manager creates a safe environment, built on trust and respect.”</li><li>“I can communicate openly with my manager and my team about our work, even when I disagree.”</li></ul><p>Other areas you might want to gauge are vision, alignment, learning and adapting. Questions like this may be useful:</p><ul><li>“My manager learns from mistakes.”</li><li>“My manager acts on the feedback they receive.”</li><li>“My manager communicates how our team contributes to the company’s overall mission.”</li></ul><p>Please note that while this section focuses on team health, most of the questions are about the team’s manager. The reason for that is because most team members will try to model their behavior based on their manager. The manager’s actions have a profound effect on what the team will treat as desired, accepted or discouraged behaviors.</p><h2 id="Competencies-for-individuals"><a href="#Competencies-for-individuals" title="Competencies for individuals"></a>Competencies for individuals</h2><p>So far, we’ve covered what productivity metrics may look like on the company and team level: let’s take a look at how productivity can be measured on the individual level.</p><p>In my opinion, the work engineers have to do is way too complex to be measured by a single metric, like the number of pull requests an engineer opens, or the number of RFC they write. No metric can do justice in trying to capture the real work. So why bother?</p><p>Instead, engineering productivity should be measured against career ladders (tracks). What’s common in the career ladders most companies have, is that they identify a handful of critical competencies and behaviors that the company values and rewards. <a href="https://www.progression.fyi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Progression.fyi</a> has a good collection of open-sourced career ladders that you can look at. One of the reasons most companies should have an easily accessible and discoverable career ladder is because it helps set the expectations for both engineers and managers on what’s expected of them, and what they need to achieve to advance in their career at their current company.</p><p>Okay, but what does it have to do with engineering productivity? Everything. Creating a career ladder is the perfect opportunity for setting the example of a productive engineer for each level. As a manager, you’ll have a clear set of expectations and standards for each level, which helps you coach team members, whether they are struggling in their current role, or if they are preparing for a promotion.</p><hr><p>This is far from everything, but it summarizes what I’ve been thinking about the topic in the past couple of months. What are your thoughts on the subject? Please share them in the comments section below!</p></div></div>]]>

<p>In today’s, in the past and probably in the future world — the time is more valuable than money, and the right time waits for no one. Hence, we have to make the most out of it to succeed in life.</p>
<p>Time is an extremely scarce resource.</p>
<p><strong>Every one of us has 24*60=1440 minutes a day, and totally about 28000 days to live</strong> (that’s how many days an average person lives since being born). And by the time you read this, you may have already lost significant chunk!</p>
<p>Developers can organize their day, maintain a busy schedule, feel very bored and unfulfilled, and never have enough time. Why so? Because often, the tasks they are doing throughout their day do not excite them or align with what they want—their goals and dreams.</p>
<p><strong>If you don’t work towards your dreams and goals, you aren’t investing your time in yourself—you are wasting it.</strong></p>
<p>Wasting time is a choice, and it’s one that is entirely within your control. It is really important to make this choice on purpose (and not accidentally) and use your time effectively.</p>
<p>That’s why you should try to make each minute of each day count because every minute you sit idly doing nothing or wasting time, there is someone out there working hard towards the same goal gaining the edge over you.</p>
<p>Moreover, making better use of your time is also saving time. I had to learn how to manage my time effectively and productively because I procrastinated a lot in the past.</p>
<p>And here are some straightforward strategies that you can use to utilize your time better and feel much more fulfilled, energized, and happier:</p>
<h2 id="-set-goals">🎯 Set goals</h2>
<p>When you have goals you want to achieve, you are less likely to waste time on things not related to those goals: everything you do starts feeling that it has a purpose.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If nobody told you today... You have a purpose and never give up on your goals.</p>— GOOD JOB LARRY 🍊 (@LarryJuneTFM) <a href="https://twitter.com/LarryJuneTFM/status/1278045173629349888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 30, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<p>Besides, <strong>it’s crucial to establish processes and systems to achieve those goals!</strong></p>
<p>A process is a step-by-step action that helps you efficiently and systematically reach your goals. Not having a process is worse than not having a plan.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-prioritize-things">💎 Prioritize things</h2>
<p>Most developers have thousands of things (projects!!!) going on at any one time. The key is to focus only on what matters the most to move you toward your big goal.</p>
<p>You should align your time with your big picture priority. Everything else should go on the do-not-do-list! <a href="https://www.inc.com/jory-mackay/warren-buffetts-personal-pilot-reveals-billionaires-brilliant-method-for-prioritizing.html">Here is how Warren Buffet approaches it.</a></p>
<p><em>“It’s said that a wise person learns from his mistakes. A wiser one learns from others’ mistakes. But the wisest person of all learns from others’ successes.”— John C. Maxwell</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-say-no">🙅‍♀️ Say “No”</h2>
<p>Here I am still in the development process, but it has already become much better. I say “no” much more often today.</p>
<p>When I have inquiries of any kind or even my own project ideas, I always reflect on this principle: <strong>if you say yes to this, you automatically say no to something else.</strong> Because you can only do one thing at a time, is this thing more important than other things for achieving my goals?</p>
<p>This way, whole kinds of projects or requests fall through the grid—the filter which recognizes what really matters for me, for my most critical resource—my time.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-less-calls-less-meetings">📆 Less calls, less meetings</h2>
<p>Time is an incredibly valuable asset in a product company, and especially in a startup business. When you spend the day sprinting from meeting to meeting, the time flies by.</p>
<p>In fact, most meetings are pointless. Some people like to attend meetings for the sake of meetings. Hence, you could cancel 70%-80% or more of them, making no difference in your work.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you schedule meetings for your developers every few hours the only way they make progress is if they don’t pay attention to the meeting at all.</p>— Frank Wiles (@fwiles) <a href="https://twitter.com/fwiles/status/1245718151607828489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 2, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<p>Meetings might interrupt the workflow of individual contributors like developers and designers who need to concentrate for extended periods to deliver tangible value for the product. As a result, the working day of developers can turn into a long evening spending in front of the laptop while trying to mark some of those overdue items off their TODO-list.</p>
<p>Still, meetings are an essential function of communication on the team; that’s why it’s crucial to decide whether every scheduled meeting is worth your time before joining it.</p>

<h2 id="-time-for-emails">📬 Time for emails</h2>
<p>I don’t answer all emails immediately. I have a fixed time limit for emails; usually, I look at them just once per day, because answering emails and dealing with Slack/Teams messages can be scheduled just like everything else.</p>
<p>The power of time blocking for emails comes in choosing when you do this task instead of disturbing your focus and decreasing your productivity every moment of your day.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.mayooshin.com/time-blocking-elon-musk-manage-time/">Elon Musk uses the time blocking method to go through “critical emails” each day.</a></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-automate-things">🤖 Automate things</h2>
<p><strong>We are programmers; we naturally don’t like routine and doing repetitive tasks.</strong> If it happens to us twice or more, we are looking for ways to automate it.</p>
<p>Especially in finance, this can be important. For example, automatic tracking of your expenses is one thing that can lead to financial freedom; it can be used to reduce our spending by tracking our expenses to free more cash from your dev-salary monthly investment.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="-be-in-the-moment">🚀 Be in the moment</h2>
<p>Thinking about the past is pointless. Our whole life is ruining because we think much more about the past and future.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can forget about the present.</p>
<p><strong>The “now” is more important than anything:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You always have to focus on what you can do now, rather than what you can do in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You always have to focus on what you have now and what you could do with the thing you have now.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>“Live life for the moment because everything else is uncertain.”―Louis Tomlinson</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-dont-swap-money-for-time">📊 Don’t swap money for time</h2>
<p>And also don’t overspend money on useless things. <strong>Because the more you spend, the more time you need to recover this resource.</strong></p>
<p>Our income is indeed limited by time. Basically, we trade in 8-10 hours/day for income and have to wait years before obtaining the necessary job promotion with a fair chance that we may not get that promotion.</p>
<p>That’s why it is necessary to stop swapping money for the time by:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Changing your mindset around earning and spending</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Building an asset that scales (like a side project that will bring passive income)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using your “passive” money  and savings to make you more money—start investing or growing your side hustle</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://ilonacodes.com/financial-tips-for-freeing-extra-money-for-investment/">There are so many different ways to free money for investments without overworking or thinking of getting another job.</a></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-ignore-distractions">⚡️ Ignore distractions</h2>
<p>We live in a modern world where it is incredibly easy to get distracted, for example, via Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Such interruptions cost not only precious productive hours but also valuable effort and energy. Instead, <strong>invest your time in more important things that will make you closer to your goals and dreams.</strong></p>
<p>You can learn more about how to prevent distractions and sharpen your focus by reading the <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/324560">“7 Proven Strategies for Overcoming Distractions”</a> article.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-stop-letting-other-peoples-opinions-control-you">🤯 Stop letting other people’s opinions control you</h2>
<p>When you have to formulate your actions according to others, it actually wastes a lot of time too.</p>
<p>It can prevent you from doing the things you want to do or being who you truly are. Basically, you will tie yourself to the yo-yo of what other people think of you.</p>
<p><em>“The trouble is you think you have time.” – Buddha</em></p>
<p>You have better things to care about than the opinions of others on you because life gives us enough to deal with as is.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Time is the most valuable asset you own. Once it is gone, it is gone.</p>
<p>Forever.</p>
<p><strong>Invest your time into making yourself a more knowledgeable and smart person, working for something that will pay you off today or tomorrow.</strong></p>
<p>Become a Pro at time management, stop undervaluing your time, stop swapping it actively for money, and instead start investing your time into a variety of assets, including yourself.</p>

        <p>Giving product demos can be stressful and overwhelming. You need to focus on the software, your presentation and keep your potential client's needs at the front of your mind. These tips help me stay focused and deliver a confident and professional demo.</p><h3 id="be-prepared">Be prepared</h3><p>The most valuable step you can take to improve your product demos is preparation. I have written a <a href="https://lukelowrey.com/product-demo-checklist/">demo preparation guide</a> that outlines the research, planning and practice techniques that have helped me.</p><h3 id="don-t-go-alone">Don't go alone</h3><p>It is very difficult to maintain your focus and enthusiasm for any presentation longer than half an hour. In my experience it is nearly always best to bring some backup from your team. An extra person can concentrate closely on questions, get a better read on how the demo goes, and give you a chance to catch your breath every now and then.</p><ul><li>Only bring people that will be able to contribute. I have found that using two presenters works well. One person takes control of the software and the other handles the introductions and company overview, and is the first call for questions.</li><li>Each person included in the presentation should be given some space to contribute. It could be as simple as splitting the introduction and demo between you or handing off a standard technical explanation. There is nothing more awkward then sitting through an hour meeting and never having a chance to contribute.</li><li>Try to include people to cover both business and technical expertise.</li></ul><h3 id="be-friendly-but-stick-to-business">Be friendly but stick to business</h3><p>It is very useful to break the ice with your audience before you kick on into the demo. My advice is to keep it simple and brief; you don't want to appear unfriendly but you also need to ensure you have time to show your software in the best light.</p><h3 id="mostly-stick-to-your-plan">Mostly stick to your plan</h3><p>Hopefully you have come prepared with a demo of some high-level user stories and a demo script. A demo where no one says anything is not a good sign but being peppered with questions and never getting into a groove is also an issue. You need to balance answering questions and adapting to the audience's preference with telling the story of your product the way you have planned.</p><ul><li>Let the audience know up front what you are going to show them. It gives them a chance to point out what is important to them and will also give them an idea of what will be shown so they don't need to jump ahead with questions.</li><li>Always describe the software in business terms rather than technical functions. An easy way to remind yourself to do this is starting explanations with <em>"As a [end user type] I can..."</em></li><li>Stop and ask for questions at convenient spots in your presentation. For example, once you have completed some workflow.</li></ul><h3 id="control-your-tempo">Control your tempo</h3><p>A problem that many developers have (including me) when presenting software is moving too fast. When you know the product well and have a time limit it is easy to blow through every function of the software at a million miles an hour.</p><ul><li>Don't try to show everything. You should spend the most time on your product's strongest features; no need to open every page.</li><li>Deliberately pause at key discussion points. I normally mark these in my demo script. You want to leave on the screen interesting, strong features of the product as you pause and make your point. </li><li>When you pause, take your hands completely off the keyboard and mouse. This is your cue to look at the camera or audience and speak using hand gestures.</li><li>Go easy on the mouse. Try not to dart your mouse all over the screen. An annoying habit I need to be aware of is flicking my mouse all around the button I am talking about. Slow your mouse movement down and take your hand off completely when you talk.</li></ul><h3 id="tips-for-presenting-remotely-over-video">Tips for presenting remotely over video</h3><figure><img src="https://lukelowrey.com/content/images/2020/05/demo-screen.png"><figcaption>Example remote demo screen setup</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Prepare your software and desktop. Get your product setup in its own window or tabs. Close down your chat app, email and anything else that could pop something embarrassing onto the screen.</li><li>Share as little as possible. If you are demoing a web application, stick to the web browser. As above you want to limit the chance of oversharing.</li><li>Keep your script on screen. If you have a big monitor and can limit your screen sharing to a single window it is very useful to keep your notes visible to the side of the main demo.</li><li>Get the right window size and zoom level. With a big widescreen monitor sharing Fullscreen is not always the best option. Play around with window size and zoom level before the demo to find a good fit.</li><li>Open by stating <em>"We are looking at the homepage..."</em> this should prompt someone to interrupt your screenshare is not working and is more natural than <em>"can everyone see this?"</em></li><li>Make sure you look at the camera. I have a habit of watching my own video feed when presenting. Because of this I tend to move my video to just below my webcam to ensure I am always facing the camera.</li><li>Try a custom virtual background. For a simple, branded background try <a href="https://www.actionablebackground.com/">actionablebackground.com</a>.

</p>
<p>
Sometimes, all we really need is a big pile of logs 
</p>
</div>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Logging isn't cheap, so we often disable debug level logs (and lower) when we deploy our code to production. When things are going well, this isn't an issue. But when an error log pops up, much of the context around what was happening in the code is missing. A single line about the stack trace often just isn't enough. It'd be pretty nice to have a more detailed picture of what was happening at the time of failure. If only we had turned on those debug and trace logs.</p>
<p>Well, there's a reason we don't. Simply put, it's expensive. Often, there's an order of magnitude more debug and trace level logs than all other logging levels combined. So if we were to log it all, we'd have to spend multiples more.</p>
<p>We have to choose between a bad option and a worse option:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don't debug log and miss the crucial context when an error occurs</li>
<li>Log everything and pay up</li>
</ol>
<p>This is where most conversations around this end. Option 2 is a non-starter so we go option 1. If an error pops up we try to replicate the bug locally with debugging on and work from there.</p>
<h2>Using A Ring Buffer</h2>
<p>Luckily, this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma">false dichotomy</a>. We have a third option. Use a ring buffer to store debug logs and flush it when an error occurs.</p>
<p>This technique is conceptually simple. It takes just a sentence to describe, and not much has changed about the way things are logged. We still use the same logging libraries and the same logging software patterns, but now we have access to far more information in our logs when things go wrong.</p>
<p>You can have your cake and eat it too. You can avoid logging verbosely while at the same time having access to those verbose logs when it matters.</p>
<h2>An Example</h2>
<p>Say that we're building a Django backend for our online widget store, and say that there's a bug somewhere in
the pseudo code below.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>
<span>def</span> <span>handle_order_post_request</span><span>(</span>req<span>)</span><span>:</span>
  customer <span>=</span> get_customer<span>(</span>req<span>)</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>not</span> is_authorized_customer<span>(</span>customer<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> HttpStatusUnauthorized<span>(</span><span>)</span>

  orders <span>=</span> get_orders<span>(</span>req<span>)</span>
  verify_prices<span>(</span>orders<span>)</span> 
  verify_inventory<span>(</span>orders<span>)</span> 

  checkout_info <span>=</span> process_order<span>(</span>order<span>)</span>
  save_checkout<span>(</span>checkout_info<span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> HttpStatusOk<span>(</span>checkout_info<span>)</span>


<span>def</span> <span>process_order</span><span>(</span>orders<span>:</span> List<span>[</span>OrderItems<span>]</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> CheckoutInfo<span>:</span>
  logger<span>.</span>debug<span>(</span><span>"total price: %d"</span><span>,</span> order<span>.</span>price<span>)</span>

  total_price <span>=</span> <span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>[</span>order<span>.</span>price <span>for</span> order <span>in</span> orders<span>]</span><span>)</span>

  most_expensive_item <span>=</span> <span>max</span><span>(</span>
    orders<span>,</span> key<span>=</span><span>lambda</span> order<span>:</span> order<span>.</span>price
  <span>)</span>

  <span>return</span> CheckoutInfo<span>(</span>
    total_price<span>,</span>
    most_expensive_item<span>,</span>
  <span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We've launched our widget store, and it's a hit. The widgets our flying off the shelves. Things are going
great but every once in a while our backend errors and a would-be customer leaves our site unhappy.
Without ring buffer logging, here are the logs.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>[</span>INFO handle_order_post_request<span>]</span> POST /checkout
<span>[</span>ERROR save_receipt<span>]</span> non-nullable field most_expensive_item is null</code></pre></div>
<p>Something is going wrong, but what is it? with just a single line error it's difficult to tell what's going
wrong even if we had the stack trace. However, if we had all the contextual debug logs we'd have far more
useful information:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>[</span>INFO handle_order_post_request<span>]</span> POST /checkout
<span>[</span>DEBUG get_orders<span>]</span><span>[</span>ring_id <span>2022</span><span>]</span> number of orders: <span>2</span>
<span>[</span>DEBUG verify_prices<span>]</span><span>[</span>ring_id <span>2022</span><span>]</span> prices changes: <span>1</span>
<span>[</span>DEBUG verify_inventory<span>]</span><span>[</span>ring_id <span>2022</span><span>]</span> items out of stock: <span>2</span>
<span>[</span>DEBUG total_price<span>]</span><span>[</span>ring_id <span>2022</span><span>]</span> total price: <span>0.0</span>
<span>[</span>ERROR save_receipt<span>]</span><span>[</span>ring_id <span>2022</span><span>]</span> non-nullable field most_expensive_item is None</code></pre></div>
<p>Now we see a more full picture of the story. The transaction began by processing two orders from the customer. One
of the prices were updated, but both items were out of stock.</p>
<p>Aha! when items were out of stock, they were removed from the checkout meaning that there was no most expensive
item since the list was empty. Now we know what to do to fix this problem.</p>
<p>Now, this example isn't enough to tell you whether or not ring buffer logging is worth it for your codebase. I'm not going
to make an argument telling you what you should be doing when I have no context in what you deal with. But I definitely do
recommend playing around with it to see if it works for you.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-53">
	

	
	<div>
		
<p>In <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="The Beginning of Infinity, (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Infinity-Explanations-Transform-World/dp/0143121359" target="_blank">The Beginning of Infinity,</a> David Deutsch proposes that the creation of knowledge encoded in genes is similar to the creation of knowledge by people. Knowledge creation involves two phases. It starts with mutations, changes or errors in the replication of the DNA sequence, which are similar to our creative leaps or conjectures. This resembles the creative or brainstorming phase. Next, via natural selection, mutations or variations are selected for in order to survive particular environments. This resembles the competitive or argumentative phase. It involves selection of specific ideas among all the conjectures we have come up with. Let’s call the first phase hypothesis generation (mutations/variations) and the second phase truth filtration (natural selection).</p>



<p>The first phase requires a high velocity of creative, surprising ideas. The second phase requires a careful, reasonable breakdown of these ideas. Contributions to the first phase involve creativity at best and fraud at worst. Contributions to the second phase involve thoroughness at best and pessimism at worst. We need both.</p>



<p>This essay talks about the first phase, where what matters is that which is surprising. A mutation is a mutation only if it is different from the original, expected sequence; in other words, a surprise. One of the ideas in information theory, which underlies modern computing, is that information is surprise. What disseminates through Twitter is what is surprising. You scroll through the mundane and pause at the surprising. Billion dollar start-ups were surprising ideas. Investments that generated high returns were surprising. If they weren’t surprising, other people would have started these companies or invested in these ideas and then they would not have had outlier outcomes. Economic growth is surprising because it primarily relies on the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/IdeaPF.pdf" target="_blank">flow of new ideas</a>. Stand-up comedy that works is surprising. One of the theories on laughter is that we laugh when we are surprised. </p>



<p>All these also need to be “true” in some sense, but they have to be surprising to begin with because if they weren’t, they would be arbitraged away, either emotionally (e.g. Twitter, stand-up) or financially (e.g. start-ups, investing). We crave surprise, however, we want it in appropriate doses. Sociologist Murray Davis said in one of his <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="papers (opens in a new tab)" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/004839317100100211" target="_blank">papers</a> that if an idea questions one of your weakly held beliefs, you accept it as interesting. If it questions one of your strongly held beliefs, you dismiss it as insane. (I think that if an idea is completely new and doesn’t wrestle with any of your beliefs, you might not notice it.)</p>



<p>What helps the first phase, hypothesis generation, is typically different from what helps the second phase, truth filtration. Truth filtration comes from peer review, markets, experiments, and democracy. It requires criticism, devil’s advocacy, error correction, and honesty. On the other hand, hypothesis generation requires coddling, encouragement, and a suspension of belief. It requires an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisational_theatre">improv</a>-like “yes and” rather than “no but”. It tends to come from solitude or small groups (e.g. Einstein, Satoshi Nakomoto, start-ups) because most large groups devolve into devil’s advocacy.</p>



<p>We have many institutions, incentive structures, and emotional responses for truth filtration. We can instinctually argue the other side when someone shares an idea. Twitter, Reddit, and Hacker News are all suited for truth filtration; users are quick to call out BS or offer counterarguments. Cunningham’s Law is a good articulation of this – “the best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question; it’s to post the wrong answer.” Mutations are “wrong” in some sense and most will never be selected for, however, they need to be encouraged to reach their potential before weeding them out. So while society has a plethora of mechanisms in place for truth filtration, it has poor institutions, incentive structures, and emotional responses for hypothesis generation.</p>



<p>Some significant, especially new, ideas may begin as tentative hesitations. In Jony Ive’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="eulogy (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnGI76__sSA" target="_blank">eulogy</a> of Steve Jobs, he said, “He (Jobs) better than anyone understood that while ideas ultimately can be so powerful, they begin as fragile, barely formed thoughts, so easily missed, so easily compromised, so easily squished.” Solitude is a good starting point, but discussions with people add creative value – they make your mind race in interesting directions. Improv is a good framework to think about what helps hypothesis generation. The key elements of improv are listening, trying to find ways to make an idea work, and being present. We should have a few institutions and emotional responses that help respond to a new hypothesis by assuming that this is our new reality and running with it. These ideas are like newborn babies; they are too young to be killed with criticism, even if that is honestly what we think about doing at that moment.</p>



<p>In the first phase, anyway, truth does not matter as much as surprise. Instead of, “why could this be wrong?” a good response would be, “in what worldview could this be right?”. This involves suspending your belief for a moment and, like an improv artist, uncompromisingly building on what the other person is thinking and feeling. It is a pure engagement with the idea without bringing in how many other people have tried it before and failed. It is a fantasy world in which this idea is new, original, and deserving of being explored to its fullest potential. You want the hypothesis generator to leave the discussion feeling energized and with a fuller version of her idea.</p>



<p>Improv isn’t about mere agreement. Many times, agreement is as boring as disagreement. When someone says A, the typical response is “yes, A!” or “not A!”. A better response would be “if A is true, then B” or “why A?” or “A adds to C, which this other person proposed”. Improv involves deeply empathizing with an idea, identifying its premise, and then taking that premise in an interesting direction. A good response to A can’t just be B if B is unrelated, but B is a good response if you use the premise in A to get to B. When someone proposes A, we often think that the purpose of the conversation is to decide between A and not A. But A can lead to B, C, D, E, and an infinite number of other options, so merely agreeing or disagreeing with something exploratory isn’t as interesting.</p>



<p>In practice, it may be difficult in some cases to separate hypothesis generation and truth filtration. The process of creating knowledge is fluid; we are making creative leaps as we are discovering what is true. However, there are ideas for which this is clearer. The improv approach is suitable for early, exploratory ideas; for example, “what if everything is priced in life years?” or “maybe we can replace cars with …”. It isn’t suitable for long-drawn, argumentative ideas like “abortion should be legal”, “free will doesn’t exist”, “Seinfeld is better than Friends”, “intelligence isn’t inherited”, etc.</p>



<p>What’s misleading about the phrase “truth filtration” is that while we might think that we are filtering for truth, sometimes we are not creative enough to understand that something is true. Stewart Brand put it well – “Reality is routinely stranger than fiction because reality has no obligation to sound plausible.” Also, sometimes we might just be focused on winning an argument instead of finding the truth. Winning an argument often involves disproving the other side’s weakest point, while finding the truth involves trying to disprove your strongest point. It would be nice to have a platform with the thoughtfulness of Hacker News but that thoughtfulness put to build on rather than reject exploratory ideas.</p>



<p>Hypothesis generation is important because without mutations or creative leaps, there would be nothing for evolution to select for. We need more institutions, incentive structures, and emotional responses that encourage creative leaps; we need some version of improv for ideas.</p>

        <p>I have been working on a custom <a href="https://lukelowrey.com/ghostsolo">Ghost theme</a> to power my blog (you are looking at an early version right now!). One thing I wanted to have a crack at was a dark/light theme switcher. It turns out with modern CSS this is pretty straight forward.</p><p>The approaches I considered were:</p><ul><li>CSS classes set on the &lt;body&gt;</li><li>Switch out style sheet entirely</li><li>CSS variables</li></ul><p>I went with CSS variables because my blog audience tends to be on the latest browser versions so I don't need to worry much about browser support (<a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-variables">not that it is too bad</a>). </p><h3 id="using-css-variables-for-themes">Using CSS variables for themes</h3><p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties">CSS variables</a> are properties you can set in your stylesheets that can be used in later styles. They are similar to tools such as SASS but built directly into CSS. This makes them very well suited for theming.</p><p>This is a simplified snippet from the default variables used in my theme <a href="https://lukelowrey.com/ghostsolo">GhostSolo</a>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>:root {
    --background-color: #fff;

}

a {

a:hover {
    text-decoration: underline;
    filter: brightness(80%);
}
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>In my theme I have variables for a couple of key style choices to allow distinct colour themes beyond dark/light. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>:root {

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Most overviews of register allocation are ridiculously complex and not at all practical. I hope, that by the end of this reading, you will gain a deeper understanding of the vocabulary and concepts that are often employed when discussing register allocation. Near the end, I’ll have a full-blown linear scan register allocator written in OCaml. If you want to follow along, you can find the code <a href="https://github.com/Heasummn/ocaml_reg_alloc" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h2 id="what-is-register-allocation">What is Register Allocation?<a href="#what-is-register-allocation" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h2><p>I/O is slow. It is ridiculously slow. Reading from RAM takes about 50-100ns, reading from a register takes approximately 300ps. That is a difference of approximately 3 orders of magnitude. When you’ve got a program that requires every ounce of speed it can have, storing values in registers rather than RAM would result in a 1000x speedup. As compiler developers, it is our job to make sure that we are making full use of the registers available to us.</p><p>Register Allocation is a very interesting problem that arises in compiler development. How do we make the best use of registers while maintaining correctness?</p><h2 id="vocabulary-and-concepts">Vocabulary and Concepts<a href="#vocabulary-and-concepts" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h2><p>There are a ton of resources talking about register allocation out there, but a lot of them don’t stop and clarify the vocabulary that is being used. If you’re just looking for code samples, you can skip past this section.</p><h3 id="statement-ordering">Statement Ordering<a href="#statement-ordering" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h3><p>Programs are trees, yet when talking about register allocation, we talk about the program as a sequence of statements. This is something that is often just glossed over and to be fair, it’s not very complex, but it’s not obvious either. We need some way of converting an AST into a sequence of statements that maintain dependencies. This is called a <strong>reverse postordering</strong> and is easily derived from a DFS. Most register allocation algorithms are applied per basic block, but can also be applied globally.</p><h3 id="liveness">Liveness<a href="#liveness" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h3><p>We say that a variable is <em>alive</em> if it is being used. We can represent this pretty easily using an array of start and endpoints, also known as <strong>live ranges</strong>. Register allocation becomes messy and a lot slower when using ranges, so instead we like to talk about just the start and endpoint of a variable’s life, also known as <strong>live intervals</strong>. We use liveness analysis when allocating registers, but it is also useful for type checking and some common optimizations, so computing the intervals is essentially “free”.</p><h3 id="spilling">Spilling<a href="#spilling" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h3><p>Say we have 4 registers in our system and 5 variables that are alive at the same time. It is impossible to fit 5 gallons into a 4-gallon container, so we are out of luck. That won’t stop us though, we’re going to spill a variable. Spilling is the act of saving a variable into memory, rather than storing it in a register. To rephrase what we were saying earlier, we want a register allocation algorithm that minimizes unnecessary spilling. How do we choose which variable should be spilled though?</p><h3 id="heuristic">Heuristic<a href="#heuristic" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h3><p>There is no correct answer to the question we posed above. In a more positive tone, any answer is correct. We will choose something called a <strong>spilling heuristic</strong>, which is just how we decide which variable gets spilled. In linear scan register allocation, the algorithm that I’ll demonstrate in just a moment, the most common heuristic is to spill the variable that “dies” the latest.</p><h3 id="graph-coloring">Graph Coloring<a href="#graph-coloring" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h3><p>Graph coloring is the problem of giving each vertex in a graph a different color (from some fixed set of colors) than any of its neighbors. This is not a “compiler problem”, but it was discovered that register allocation can be simplified to graph coloring. If we draw a graph with every single variable as a vertex and an edge between them if they are alive at the same time, we get a <strong>register inference graph</strong>, which we can then color with the registers available to us. The only problems are that some graphs cannot be colored and graph coloring is NP-complete and computationally expensive. There is a clever algorithm developed by <strong>Chaitin et al.</strong> that handles spilling in reasonable time. I will not be going over the algorithm, but send me a message if you’re interested.</p><h2 id="linear-scan-register-allocation">Linear Scan Register Allocation<a href="#linear-scan-register-allocation" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h2><p>I promised code, let’s get to that code. From <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~palsberg/course/cs132/linearscan.pdf" target="_blank">their 1999 paper</a> Poletto and Sarkar devised a ridiculously simple and clever algorithm for register allocation. We greedily assign and free registers until we can’t fit them in anymore, which is when we spill.</p><p>Linear scanning is ridiculously fast, but as you may have guessed, it does not produce optimal code. When <code>ocamlc</code> added an option for linear scanning, they saw compile-time improvements of almost 25%. The difference in performance between Chaitin’s algorithm and linear scanning is so minuscule that for a lot of applications it does not matter, but we like as much performance as we can have. Linear scanning is used most often in JITs, like Oracle’s Hotspot, because compilation speed matters a ton. This is the basic algorithm:</p><pre><code data-lang="none">LinearScanRegisterAllocation
    active ← {}
    for each live interval i, in order of increasing start point do
        ExpireOldIntervals(i)
        if length(active) = R then
            SpillAtInterval(i)
        else
            register[i] ← a register removed from pool of free registers
            add i to active, sorted by increasing end point

ExpireOldIntervals(i)
    for each interval j in active, in order of increasing end point do
        if endpoint[j] ≥ startpoint[i] then
            return
        remove j from active
        add register[j] to pool of free registers

SpillAtInterval(i)
    spill ← last interval in active
    if endpoint[spill] &gt; endpoint[i] then
        register[i] ← register[spill]
        location[spill] ← new stack location
        remove spill from active
        add i to active, sorted by increasing end point
    else
        location[i] ← new stack location
</code></pre><p>We enter the algorithm with all of the variables in our code represented as <em>live intervals</em>. In OCaml, we’ll define these to look like this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="ocaml"><span>type</span> interval <span>=</span>
  <span>{</span> name<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>;</span>
    reg<span>:</span> regs<span>;</span>
    location<span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>;</span>
    start_point<span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>;</span>
    end_point<span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p><code>regs</code> is just an enum containing all the registers that we have. To make life easier for us, let’s define a constructor:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="ocaml"><span>let</span> make_interval name start close <span>=</span>
  <span>{</span>
    name <span>=</span> name<span>;</span>
    reg <span>=</span> <span>Spilled</span><span>;</span>
    location <span>=</span> <span>-</span>1<span>;</span>
    start_point <span>=</span> start<span>;</span>
    end_point <span>=</span> close<span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>To represent our input, we will use a global mutable array. I couldn’t figure out a way to make this completely immutable, but we’ll get pretty close. Once the algorithm is done, we’ll want to have the register or spilled status of each interval in the array.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="ocaml"><span>let</span> intervals <span>=</span> <span>[|</span>

</code></pre></div><p>That’s pretty straightforward. The intervals that we defined above don’t require any spilling, so let’s implement the expire function and see if the algorithm works.</p><h3 id="expiring-intervals">Expiring intervals<a href="#expiring-intervals" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h3><p>We will partition the current active registers into two groups, one for all expired intervals (intervals whose endpoint we are currently past) with free registers, and one for all intervals that are still alive</p><div><pre><code data-lang="ocaml"><span>let</span> expire_old_intervals active current pool <span>=</span>

</code></pre></div><p>If we remove the reference to spilling and run our algorithm, it works! This is my output:</p><pre><code data-lang="none">Interval a with reg eax at location -1
Interval b with reg ebx at location -1
Interval c with reg ecx at location -1
Interval d with reg edx at location -1
Interval e with reg eax at location -1
Interval f with reg ecx at location -1
Interval g with reg ebx at location -1
</code></pre><p>Yours may differ if you chose to implement <code>get_reg</code> differently, and that’s okay. On some machines, certain registers are faster or more efficient, and so <code>get_reg</code> would need some sort of heuristic for choosing which register it allocates.</p><h3 id="spilling-1">Spilling<a href="#spilling-1" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h3><p>Last but not least, we need to spill. The most common heuristic is choosing to spill the interval that will die the latest. The simplest heuristic, however, is to just spill whatever we are currently dealing with.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="ocaml"><span>let</span> stack_location <span>=</span> ref 0

<span>let</span> spill_interval current <span>=</span>
  <span>let</span> current<span>,</span> i <span>=</span> …</code></pre></div></div></div></div>

I’ve gone through the most common frameworks below, and how they differ for biotech companies. </p><p>I’m defining a tech startup here as a company whose product is largely based off of code. I am not including in my arbitrary categorization ‘deep tech’ (e.g., autonomous trucks, satellite startups, etc), which often face similar challenges as biotech companies. </p><p>Biotech here is a startup developing a drug. </p><p><em>These are generalizations, and many exceptions exist. </em></p><h2><strong>Risks and Finding Product Market Fit</strong></h2><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Significant market and execution risks<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Minimal market risk, a lot of technical risk</strong></p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_605840"><div><p>In tech, the company often uses a standard software stack and applies it in a novel way (a new product). The question is usually not ‘can this thing be built’, but ‘does anyone want this thing we made’?</p><p>In biotech, this is flipped. The market (a disease) is well established, but the ability to develop a product (a drug) that addresses this market is the core risk. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_607921"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Rolling derisking, early signs of product-market fit<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Derisking comes in bursts over years (biological milestones), early signals less reliable</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_617219"><div><p>In tech, you want the ‘up and to the right’ chart, showing exponential increase of some core metric of the company. Adoption, revenue, and other metrics derisk the company and give early signs of PMF. Early signs can be highly predictive of the company’s eventual success.</p><p>In biotech, derisking the company is predominantly tied to specific biological milestones. These come in bursts, with long periods of waiting in-between. Additionally, early milestones (such as the drug working in mice) aren’t 1-to-1 predictive of eventual success (the drug working in people).</p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_619233"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Iterate to product-market-fit<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Product (drug) finalized years before on market</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_631626"><div><p>In tech, the product is constant iterates and improves from customer feedback to find the exact product that people want. </p><p>In biotech, due to the extensive regulation, the final product (the drug) is finalized years before it first goes into people.

At minimum, the founders almost always have significant scientific training - a PhD can take 6-8 years, and post-docs 2-3 years each. It is less common to see founders in their 20s and you almost never see ‘youth wunderkinds’. This is in part due to the conservatism of the industry and in part because extensive scientific training is generally necessary to have enough biological insight to correctly identify an opportunity. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_420694"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Can create a new market<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Markets are diseases and therefore public domain</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_422265"><div><p>In tech, some of the most successful companies created or defined their market - a classic example being ride sharing.

In tech, companies generally focus around one product or core offering, only differentiating once they have earned the right to do so by finding PMF with their first product.</p><p>A significant reason for this is to derisk the company against biological randomness. Instead, focus in a biotech company is usually around a core competency - e.g., a method of discovering drugs, or a way of delivering the drug - and then diversified within this core competency. For example, gene therapy company Spark Therapeutics had a core competency of AAV-based gene therapy (a virus loaded with DNA to treat a genetic disease) but leverages this competency simultaneously across multiple diseases. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_484564"><p><strong>﻿</strong><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Outsourcing product development or engineering unadvisable<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Common to use contractors for key experimental work</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_497310"><div><p>In tech, not having someone technical on the founding team is a classic ‘no no’.

			<h2>On 15th July, Ben Arc published in <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/an-open-letter-to-yanis-varoufakis-about-bitcoin">Bitcoin Magazine</a> an open letter addressed to me in a bid to convince me that I should re-assess my rejection of Bitcoin as a force for good; as a bulwark for democratising capitalism and paving the ground for socialism. Here is my reply:</h2>
<h3>Dear Ben Arc,</h3>
<h3>Thank you for your open letter and your efforts to bring a socialist perspective to bear upon my assessment of Bitcoin.</h3>
<h3>In my reply below, I shall address you as a fellow socialist, rather than put together a reply meant to address all sorts of different perspectives (e.g. Keynesian, Hayekian, neoclassical)</h3>
<h3>As you know, I am one of those who, back in 2011, were genuinely intrigued, fascinated even, by the remarkable blockchain algorithm. The prospect of a decentralised ledger controlled by its community of users was mesmerising.</h3>
<h3>As you also know, I was unimpressed by Bitcoin as an alternative to fiat money that is either likely, or indeed desirable, under our current capitalist predicament.</h3>
<h3>Having read your open letter, I remain as enthusiastic on blockchain’s capacities and as unimpressed by Bitcoin’s ability to help us either civilise or (as any socialist dreams of) transcend capitalism.</h3>
<h3>Two propositions support this view. In the hypothetical case where Bitcoin were, under presently-existing capitalism, to replace fiat money: (1) It would lack the mechanism necessary to stop capitalist crises from yielding depressions that benefit only the ultra-right; and, (2) Its community-based, democratic protocols would do little to democratise economic life.</h3>
<h3>I shall explain my two propositions briefly below. But, before you despair (at my continued negative take on Bitcoin), let me foreshadow the concluding sentence in the Epilogue below: Once (and, of course, if) socialism dawns, money will have to be founded on a distributed-ledger, monetary commons enabling tehnology.</h3>
<h3>In other words, I shall argue that Bitcoin is not fit for purpose under capitalism, or as a vehicle toward transcending capitalism, but something like Bitcoin will characterise monetary systems in a future world free of private banks and share markets.</h3>
<h3>OK, let me now support my two propositions:</h3>
<h2><strong><em>Proposition 1: Bitcoin lacks the shock absorbers necessary to prevent capitalist crises from doing untold damage to the working class</em></strong></h2>
<h3>Consider the Crash of 2008 or the more recent 2020 Covid-19-induced crisis. Suppose that Central Banks did not have the capacity instantly to create trillions of dollars, euros, pounds and yen – and instead had to rely on a spontaneous majority of Bitcoin’s users to agree to a massive increase in the supply of money. The result would be a 1929-like collapse of banks and corporations.</h3>
<h3>While socialists would shed no tears for the tragedy of the oligarchy, socialists should beware that a 1929-like systemic collapse is bound to strengthen the forces of the ultra-right – not of the socialist left (that has been, since at least 1991, languishing in the doldrums of political paralysis).</h3>
<h3>Technically, there is of course nothing that would prevent the Bitcoin community from agreeing instantly to even a doubling of the money base. However, the Tragedy of the Commons guarantees that Bitcoin owners will be subject to the usual prisoner’s dilemma dynamic that prevents the boost in the money supply necessary to avert the liquidation of potentially viable businesses and jobs. Moreover, this free-rider problem is made far, far worse by the fact that Bitcoin ownership is very unequally distributed, thus giving the Bitcoin-rich powerful incentives to restrain the growth of the money supply (since such restrictions would boost their private rents at the expense of the public interest).</h3>
<h3>In short, the free-rider problem that guarantees the maximal reinforcement of any capitalist crisis (in any economy relying on Bitcoin as its main currency) will be turbocharged by the unequal ownership of Bitcoin – which is unavoidable in any monetary system overlaid upon contemporary capitalism.</h3>
<h2><em>Proposition 2: Under capitalism, Bitcoin’s dominance will not democratise economic life – or give socialism a chance</em></h2>
<h3>Suppose, again, that some magic wand is waved and Bitcoin replaces fiat money under contemporary capitalist conditions. In other words, as Bitcoin replaced dollars, pounds, euros and yen, property rights over land, resources and machines remain as they are while private equity firms and pension funds continue to own the bulk of shares trading in Wall Street, the City etc. All that will have changed is that Central Banks will vanish and the community of Bitcoin users will determine the global money supply (subject to the free-rider problems mentioned above).</h3>
<h3>At the firm level, nothing will have changed. Jeff Bezos will still control a massive monopsony-cum-monopoly, Facebook will still own the whole marketplace within its platform, Exxon-Mobil will continue to lean on weaker developing country governments to drill for oil and gas that should be left in the Earth’s guts etc.</h3>
<h3>And what of private banks? They would, make no mistake here, find ways of creating complex derivatives based on Bitcoin – derivatives that will soon (just like Lehman Brothers’ CDOs prior to 2008) function as stores of value and means of exchange; i.e. as private money. Massive bubbles denominated in Bitcoin will build up and they will burst just as they did in the 19<sup>th</sup> century under the Gold Standard. And then?</h3>
<h3>In the absence of Central Banks and with the Bitcoin community in the clasps of the aforementioned free-rider problem, depression will follow – as it did before the Fed was instituted in the US. Thus, the tragedy mentioned in Proposition 1 above kicks in.</h3>
<h3>In short, not only will the democratisation of money via Bitcoin fail to democratise capitalism but it will also give an almighty boost to the forces of regression.</h3>

<h3>Bitcoin’s great appeal is that it breaks the cronyist chain linking central banks and private bankers. However, it does not undermine the cronyism of the network of bosses, politicians and private bankers.</h3>
<h3>Lest we forget, 19<sup>th</sup> Century bimetallic America also lacked a central bank. Under the gold and silver standards, the public money supply was fixed – and could not be easily manipulated by the state (either the government or the, then non-existent, Fed). But that did not stop private bankers from leveraging public money out of thin air to create huge quantities of private money with which to fund the Robber Barons, i.e. the Jeff Bezoses, of the era.</h3>
<h3>In this sense, replacing fiat money with Bitcoin would take us back to a postmodern version of 19<sup>th</sup> Century America – not exactly a prospect socialists should go to the barricades for.</h3>
<h3>In summary, the monetary system is like the dog’s tail. It cannot wag the capitalist dog, in the sense that democratising money by means of a monetary commons will not democratise economic life but, rather, make capitalism uglier, nastier and more dangerous for humanity.</h3>
<h3>Having said all this, a monetary commons (that may very well rely on something like the blockchain underpinning Bitcoin) will, I have no doubt, be an essential aspect of a democratised economy; of socialism.</h3>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The software ecosystem has a lot of useful but unsafe code, and the easier it is to sandbox that code, the more
often that’ll happen. If it were as simple as passing the compiler a <code>--sandbox</code> flag
that makes an unsafe library unable to see or affect anything
outside of it, that would be incredible! We can’t get it quite that easy,
but this post describes <strong>WasmBoxC</strong>, a sandboxing approach that is
very simple to use. All you need to do is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Compile the unsafe library using a <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> (wasm) compiler instead of the normal system compiler</strong>.
That uses wasm internally, but you don’t need to care about that —
all you see is it emits a C file with sandboxed code.</li>
  <li><strong>Write some C to interface with the compiled C of the unsafe library</strong>. (This is
necessary because the sandboxed code can’t access outside memory, and also it
uses the portable wasm ABI.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Compile and link that C code, and now that unsafe library is sandboxed from the rest of your application!
In a later section we’ll see concrete examples of how easy both those steps are.</p>

<p>Here is the approach in more detail:</p>

<p><img src="https://kripken.github.io/blog/assets/wasmboxc.png" alt="unsafe code => safe wasm => safe c => safe native"></p>

<p>By <strong>compiling to wasm</strong> we sandbox the code, preventing it from accessing
anything on the outside.
That includes both <em>memory</em> - the sandboxed code can’t read or write to anywhere outside it -
and <em>capabilities</em> - the sandboxed code can’t do anything but pure computation,
unless you give it a function to call to do things like read from a file, tell
the time, etc.
We also get the rest of the wasm guarantees on
<a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/security/">safety</a> and
<a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/portability/">portability</a>. Wasm
sandboxing is even safe to run in the same process as other code (at least modulo
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)">Spectre-type</a>
vulnerabilities), much like
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Software Fault Isolation (SFI)</a>.</p>

<p>After we’ve compiled an unsafe library to wasm, how can we run it as part of our
application?
We could integrate a wasm VM and run the wasm there. But instead,
with WasmBoxC we take a <strong>VM-less</strong> approach and compile the wasm into native
code, while preserving the wasm semantics, including the sandboxing.
That native code can be linked normally into an application, which
is much simpler than integrating a wasm VM.</p>

<p>The specific approach WasmBoxC takes to compile wasm into native code is to
<strong>compile it to C</strong> using
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt">wabt</a>’s
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/tree/master/wasm2c">wasm2c</a> tool,
and then run a standard C compiler on it. In fact,
WasmBoxC’s approach compiles into a <strong>simple subset of C</strong>.
This is a big part of what makes this approach so simple, and
brings several advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s easy to read and verify the generated C for security.</li>
  <li>It lets us use a C compiler like clang or gcc to make the sandboxed
code very fast.</li>
  <li>It’s very easy to use the code in existing build systems.</li>
  <li>It’s easy to write code to interact with the sandbox.</li>
  <li>A single build of C code can be compiled and run on practically any platform,
and code to interact with the sandbox also only needs to be written once.</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite the simplicity of using C, WasmBoxC sandboxing has low
overhead: just <strong>14%</strong> with some non-portable C code (the
“signal handler trick”, see later), or <strong>42%</strong> in 100% portable C
(with no OS- or CPU-specific operations at all). We’ll also see that there are options
in between those 14% and 42% numbers.</p>

<p>The basic idea in WasmBoxC is simple and
<a href="https://twitter.com/FlohOfWoe/status/1011523018428780544">not original</a>.
What is
new in this post is showing that the approach works, doing
benchmarking on real-world code to show it is fast, presenting complete examples of how
easy it is to sandbox real-world libraries, and writing up the approach in
detail to describe the benefits (see in particular the section on memory-safe
languages).
This post also invents a name for the technique.</p>

<h2 id="speed">Speed</h2>

<p>To get an idea of WasmBoxC’s speed, let’s take a look at
<a href="https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/master/tests/test_benchmark.py">20 benchmarks</a>,
comparing clang 9.0.1, clang 11 (dev version as of May 23 2020), gcc 9.2.1, and
WasmBoxC. All numbers are normalized to clang 9 (which is therefore equal to 1; lower numbers are better).</p>

<p><img src="https://kripken.github.io/blog/assets/wasmboxc-perf.png" alt="performance results"></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>compiler</th>
      <th>relative speed</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>clang 9.0.1</td>
      <td>1.00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>clang 11 (dev)</td>
      <td>0.97</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>gcc 9.2.1</td>
      <td>0.93</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>WasmBoxC (explicit)</td>
      <td>1.42</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>WasmBoxC (OS-based)</td>
      <td>1.14</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>These benchmarks include a wide variety of code, and the ones prefixed with <code>zzz_</code> are real-world
codebases or benchmarks:
the 
<a href="https://box2d.org/">Box2D</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_(software)">Bullet</a>
physics engines, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coremark">CoreMark</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINPACK_benchmarks">LINPACK</a>
benchmarks, the
<a href="https://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> VM (one GC and one computational benchmark),
the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm">LZMA</a>
and
<a href="https://zlib.net/">zlib</a>
compression libraries,
and the
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a> database.
Incidentally, this shows WasmBoxC can run all of
these today!</p>

<p>Two results are shown for WasmBoxC, representing two implementations of memory sandboxing. The first is <strong>explicit</strong> sandboxing, in which each memory load and store is explicitly verified to be within the sandboxed memory using an explicit check (that is, an <code>if</code> statement is done before each memory access). This has <strong>42%</strong> overhead.</p>

<p>The <strong>OS-based</strong> implementation uses the
“<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/pull/1442/files#diff-e962256d2c336a13791ce03c1dae5d2fR106">signal handler trick</a>” that
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/3334d8dff757051c7a359818e0ceb5ad7852fdbc/js/src/wasm/WasmSignalHandlers.cpp">wasm</a>
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17y4kxuHFrVxAiuCP_FFtFA2HP5sNPsCD10KEx17Hz6M/edit#heading=h.tbi7hpbheoai">VMs</a>
use.
This technique reserves lots of memory around the valid range and relies on
CPU hardware to give us a signal if an access is out of bounds
(for more background see section 3.1.4 in
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Tan, 2017</a>).
That is fully safe and has the benefit of avoiding explicit bounds checks. It has
just <strong>14%</strong> overhead! However, it cannot be used everywhere (it needs
signals and CPU memory protection, and only works on 64-bit systems).</p>

<p>There are more options in between those 14% and 42% figures.
Explicit and OS-based sandboxing preserve wasm semantics perfectly, that is, a trap
will happen exactly when a wasm VM would have trapped. If we are willing to relax
that
(but we may not want to <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/pull/1432">call it wasm</a> if we do)
then we can use masking sandboxing instead
(see section 3.1.3 in
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Tan, 2017</a>),
which is 100% portable like explicit sandboxing and also prevents any accesses
outside of the sandbox, and is somewhat faster at <strong>29%</strong> overhead. Other sandboxing
improvements are possible too - almost no effort has gone into this yet.</p>

<p>An interesting thing happens in the <code>lua_binarytrees</code> and <code>havlak</code> benchmarks,
where WasmBoxC is actually faster than both gcc and clang in all sandboxing modes,
up to 32%! How can we beat normal native builds, and by so much?
<a href="https://twitter.com/kripken/status/1262092956070109185">Looking into this</a>,
both of these benchmarks use a lot of <code>malloc</code>s and data structures with pointers.
Like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X32_ABI">x32 ABI</a>, wasm is 32-bit,
so pointers take half the space. Measuring the maximum process memory used
in <code>lua_binarytrees</code>, WasmBoxC uses 33% less which helps a lot with CPU cache usage.
While this makes a big difference on these two benchmarks, we are likely
getting some speedup on the others as well due to this factor, as on average x32
is faster than normal x64
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X32_ABI#Details">by around 5-8%</a>.
Wasm is a nice way to get something
like x32’s benefits!</p>

<p>The benchmarking here measures performance <em>within</em> the sandbox. It
does not measure the speed of calls from the outside in or inside out. Such
calls can be very fast because the sandboxed code is just C, which means that
we can even inline across the sandbox boundary — safely! — if we do
LTO. I verified that happens in the sandboxing example in the next section,
see later. (Note, however, then using the signal handler trick may make things
more complicated here.)</p>

<p>Some final notes on performance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We can compile WasmBoxC’s C code with any native compiler. In the
above we did so always with clang 9 for simplicity. The results vary a little
when changing the compiler, for example the “explicit” sandboxing results go from
14% up to 16% with gcc 9.2 or down to 11% with clang 11. There’s nothing magical about
that 14% figure — we are at the point where native compiler differences matter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Results should improve over time as wasm adds more performance features
like <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/simd">simd</a> (note that the native compilers we
compared to may have gained an advantage from autovectorization).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That WasmBoxC can reach 14% overhead shows that the
cost of compiling through wasm (which cannot represent irreducible control
flow, for example) is fairly low, and also that current compilers to wasm are
not introducing significant unnecessary overhead.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve done my best to measure everything here carefully and accurately, but
it’s possible I’ve made a mistake somewhere. Please check my work and see if you
get similar results!</p>

<h2 id="ease-of-use">Ease of use</h2>

<p>This section has a full example of WasmBoxC usage. Here are the source files:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// my-code.c</span>

<span>#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</span>
<span>// We could also include the .wasm.h file for these,</span>
<span>// but let's declare externs manually for the example.</span>

<span>extern</span> <span>void</span> <span>wasmbox_init</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>);</span>

<span>extern</span> <span>uint32_t</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>Z_twiceZ_ii</span><span>)(</span><span>uint32_t</span><span>);</span>

<span>extern</span> <span>uint32_t</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>Z_do_bad_thingZ_ii</span><span>)(</span><span>uint32_t</span><span>);</span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"Initializing sandboxed unsafe library"</span><span>);</span>
  <span>wasmbox_init</span><span>();</span>
  <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Calling twice on 21 returns %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>Z_twiceZ_ii</span><span>(</span><span>21</span><span>));</span>
  <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"Calling something bad now..."</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Z_do_bad_thingZ_ii</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
  <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"(this will never be printed, as the bad thing will trap)"</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>main()</code> is pretty simple: Initialize, call something in the sandbox that does a
computation for us, and call something that will trap inside the sandbox.
(What’s with the <code>Z_</code> stuff? See later in “API”.)</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// unsafe-lib.c</span>

<span>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
</span>
<span>__attribute__</span><span>((</span><span>used</span><span>))</span>
<span>int</span> <span>twice</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>__attribute__</span><span>((</span><span>used</span><span>))</span>
<span>int</span> <span>do_bad_thing</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>size</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Allocate an unknown size here (so the LLVM optimizer doesn't know if the</span>
  <span>// store later down is valid or not).</span>
  <span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>malloc</span><span>(</span><span>size</span><span>);</span>
  <span>// Write to an address that is definitely not in the sandbox (the default</span>
  <span>// memory size is much smaller), which in wasm will trap.</span>
  <span>x</span><span>[</span><span>1024</span> <span>*</span> <span>1024</span> <span>*</span> <span>1024</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span><span>;</span>
  <span>// Avoid the optimizer knowing the store can never be observed.</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span><span>)</span><span>x</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>twice()</code> does what you’d expect, and <code>do_bad_thing</code> does a store that will
definitely trap. (Ignore the details there; for this example we need the LLVM optimizer not to
remove the bad code as undefined behavior!)</p>

<p>And here’s how easy it is to use WasmBoxC to get a fully sandboxed library linked with our normal code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># build our main code to an object normally</span>
<span>$ </span>clang my-code.c         <span>-c</span> <span>-O3</span> <span>-o</span> my-code.o
<span># build the unsafe library to C with emcc</span>
<span>$ </span>emcc unsafe-lib.c          <span>-O3</span> <span>-o</span> unsafe-lib.wasm <span>-s</span> WASM2C <span>--no-entry</span>
<span># build the unsafe …</span></code></pre></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>

      <p>Webpack is becoming the standard in bundling JavaScript, but what does that even mean and how does it work?  Let's
find out.</p>

<p>I find the configuration of Webpack hard to understand and derive.  I find the general concept of Webpack very
difficult to grasp, especially when reading the myriad blogs documenting the way to set it up—they are all different!</p>

<p>The source of these problems is that Webpack is a monolithic system that does many unrelated things in an opaque way, while also being designed around extreme flexibility.  Unlike a monolithic framework such as Ruby on Rails, nothing in  Webpack “just works”—you have to provide configuration for Webpack's most basic features to work.</p>

<p>This is part of JavaScript's culture—each new problem in your development environment is viewed as a chance to invent a
solution from first principles and no particular opinion on this is viewed as canonical or idiomatic.  This means we'll be
spending a lot of time in documentation and a lot of time making decisions that have nothing to do with our users or the
problems we're trying to solve for them.</p>

<p>So, let's figure out what even is a Webpack together by starting from nothing.  You'll be amazed at how little JSON you need to
throw at this problem, Medium blog posts be damned!</p>

<h2 id="what-problem-does-webpack-solve">What Problem Does Webpack Solve?</h2>

<p>Webpack exists to give us a feature of JavaScript that exists in most other languages by default - modularization.</p>

<p>As programmers, we want to put code in different files for the purposes of organization.  Said another way, we
don't want all our JavaScript in one file.  We may also wish to use third-party JavaScript libraries to help us.</p>

<p>Because JavaScript <a href="http://naildrivin5.com/blog/2016/01/13/hierarchy-of-software-needs.html">fails to meet many programmer's needs</a>, there has always been a requirement to have some
sort of way to deploy code organized in multiple files to a user's web browser. </p>

<p>The simplest way is to use a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag for each file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="js/main.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="js/address.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="js/billing.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is hard to maintain, so another way is to concatenate all the files together into one bundle during the build of your
application, and deploy just that bundle to the user's browser.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; find js -name \*.js \
          -exec cat {} \; &gt;&gt; bundle.js
</code></pre>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="bundle.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is what <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html">the Rails Asset Pipeline</a> effectively does.</p>

<p>This is not good enough for many reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Everything must be globally scoped, meaning name clashes are hard to avoid, especially when third-party code is involved.</li>
<li>In fact, it's not clear how to use third-party libraries - are they in your bundle, or separate <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags?</li>
<li>You cannot easly use languages that compile down to JavaScript, such as ES6, CoffeeScript, TypeScript or whatever.</li>
<li>Good luck writing unit tests.</li>
</ul>

<p>If only JavaScript had a module system like every other language.  It <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-modules">sorta does</a>, but not in any useful way, because no
browser supports the latest version of JavaScript.  And no browser ever will (since “the latest version of JavaScript“ is a
moving target).</p>



<p>Webpack implements a module system as well as a way to translate JavaScript code that doesn't work in any web browser to
JavaScript code that works in most web browsers.  It's like a C compiler.</p>

<p>It allows you to write code like this, which is remedial in most other modern languages:</p>

<pre><code>// inside main.js
import address from "address";
import billing from "billing";

billing.some_function();
address.some_other_function();
</code></pre>

<p>Webpack allows you to specify that <code>main.js</code> is your main file, and that <code>main.js</code> might contain instructions for locating other files, which Webpack should do, recursively until all needed files have been located. All those files should then be brought together and translated into a single file, suitable for use in a web browser.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, <code>webpack *.js &gt; bundle.js</code> does not do this.  Because the JavaScript ecosystem favors monolithic, do-everything tools, Webpack, in fact, does everything (except what it doesn't—we'll get to that).  It's super flexible, which means it's hard to use, hard to understand, and hard to learn.</p>

<p>I'm going to try to correct that by starting from a very simple case, and building things up, one step at a time, until we have a reasonable development and production environment, while only adding configuration when <strong>there is a problem that needs solving</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="webpack-from-first-principles">Webpack from First Principles</h2>

<p>To install Webpack, you'll need Node, so <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">go install it</a> (you might want to <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/">use a package manager</a>).  You'll need need a JavaScript library downloader, which used to be only NPM, but now you should use Yarn, so <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install">go install it</a>.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; node --version
v12.3.0
</code></pre>

<pre><code>&gt; yarn --version
1.21.1
</code></pre>

<p>Many tutorials and READMEs tell you to install JavaScript packages willy-nilly.  We aren't going to do that.  We're going to
have a file to keep track of all the stuff our project needs.  That file is <code>package.json</code> and Yarn can create one for us.  This
allows us to recreate our system whenever we want without having to re-execute a bunch of commands.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; yarn -y init
yarn init v1.21.1
success Saved package.json
Done in 0.03s.
warning The yes flag has been set. This will automatically answer yes to all questions, which may have security implications.
</code></pre>

<p>This will create an empty <code>package.json</code> for us.  Now, let's install Webpack!  Note that the CLI is a separate module.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; yarn add -D webpack webpack-cli
</code></pre>

<pre><code>yarn add v1.21.1

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last year, I switched all of my hosting from arbitrarily installed packages to Docker. This made installing and configuring incredibly simple, but updating a little less defined. Whilst Docker itself is updated through the system package manager (probably), the containers themselves aren’t.</p><p>Docker container versions are known as “tags”, and unlike regular version numbers, can be reassigned to a different container, meaning containers can be updated inside a version constraint, in much the same way a git tag can move to a different commit. This enables a pretty handy feature, whereby container maintainers can create tags for <code>1.12</code> and keep it up to date with the latest patch version (eg <code>1.12.0</code> - <code>1.12.99</code>). As nice as this is, it also adds a layer of complexity. If you’re noting that you want version <code>1.12</code> of a container, there’s no telling if that’s actually the <em>latest</em> <code>1.12.0</code>. Unfortunately, very few maintainers follow any sane <a href="https://semver.org/">SemVer</a> for their tags.</p><p>When you install a docker container, it’s always constrained to a version, which by default is <code>latest</code>. If you just <code>pull</code> all new containers, those pinned to <code>latest</code> will fetch newer versions, but anything pinned to a specific version (<code>1.12.4</code>) won’t be updated.</p><p>So, how can we deal with this?</p><p>Well, the obvious way to deal with this is to just keep on top of your tags. When a new version comes out, update the tag in your <code>docker-compose.yml</code>, <code>docker-compose pull</code>, and then restart the container (<code>docker-compose down &amp;&amp; docker-compose up -d</code>). This is simple, and robust, and means nothing will update without you knowing.</p><p>The downside is that this is obviously quite a lot of work. There are projects which <a href="https://docker-hub-rss.now.sh/">expose RSS feeds from docker hub</a>, but you’ve still got to go manually update each container and issue a <code>docker-compose pull</code>etc.</p><p>Here are some examples of the changes needed:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/RealOrangeOne/infrastructure/commit/452118e2a9f07b802840e34954e4a8ad9074e694">Update Synapse patch version</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/RealOrangeOne/infrastructure/commit/ba486a26e4457214509b8682473280d239036cd4">Update Duplicati LSIO version</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/RealOrangeOne/infrastructure/commit/005cc528b6ace28b70197d1d73afb92443d1a1d7">Update Nextcloud</a></li></ul><h2 id="pin-to-latest"><a href="#pin-to-latest">#</a> Pin to <code>latest</code></h2><p>This method is probably the most like the conventional package manager approach. If you just pin your versions to <code>latest</code>, then you can just periodically pull and restart all containers. Simple, right?</p><p>Well yes, but actually no. Pinning latest is generally considered bad practice unless you don’t actually care which version it’s using. In the event you need to rebuild your infrastructure, there’s no way of knowing which version you were actually running (without looking at the hash of the container), and getting back up and running can be just as annoying.</p><h2 id="watchtower-the-yolo-approach"><a href="#watchtower-the-yolo-approach">#</a> <code>watchtower</code> (the #YOLO approach)</h2><p>Docker doesn’t have an “update all running containers and restart the new ones” command, which is where <code>watchtower</code> comes in. <a href="https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/"><code>watchtower</code></a> is a tool which automatically fetches the newest version of a container, and restarts it for you with the same settings. <code>watchtower</code> won’t change tag for you, it’ll only update if the container under the tag changes.</p><p>By pinning all your containers to <code>latest</code> in combination with using <code>watchtower</code>, you’ll ensure your containers are always up to date 100% of the time. This sounds great, but it’s not. If a package releases a major version and breaking changes, your system will update automatically, perhaps leaving itself in a broken, unrecoverable state. Not something you want to wake up to!</p><h2 id="combination"><a href="#combination">#</a> Combination</h2><p>A more optimal solution is a combination of the above: some containers auto-update, and others are pinned to the versions you need, for when updating isn’t straightforward (eg Nextcloud).</p><p>So, here’s a workflow:</p><ol><li>Pin your containers as you need them, as loosely as you’re comfortable with. If you don’t actually care what version it’s using, and are confident it can update itself, pin <code>latest</code>. If you need a specific patch version for <em>reasons</em>, pin that. If you’re unsure, pin the latest major version, as anything below it shouldn’t have breaking changes, and should be backwards compatible.</li><li>Use <code>watchtower</code> to keep these pins up to date. This ensures <code>latest</code> always means <code>latest</code>, and that specific pins always reflect upstream, which makes rebuilding easier.</li><li>Have some way of knowing when new versions are released. Whether that’s via <a href="https://docker-hub-rss.now.sh/">DockerHub RSS</a>, <a href="https://github.community/t/rss-feeds-for-github-projects/292">GitHub releases</a>, or something else, it doesn’t matter.</li><li>When new versions are released, bump the pinned version in your <code>docker-compose.yml</code> (or alike), and re-deploy (<code>pull</code>, <code>down</code>, <code>up -d</code>).</li></ol><p>With this, you’ll have a container setup which reasonably matches the package management workflow you’re used to, with a couple niceties around auto updating. Only the packages you want to automatically update will automatically update, and the rest you can update when you’re notified of updates.</p><h3 id="but-my-container-doesnt-have-sane-versions"><a href="#but-my-container-doesnt-have-sane-versions">#</a> “But my container doesn’t have (sane) versions?”</h3><p>Unfortunately, all of what I’ve said above relies on the container maintainer publishing the relevant tags, in a way which you can keep updated. The official containers are great examples of how <strong>to</strong> do pinning: <code>1</code>, <code>1.12</code>, <code>1.12.3</code> and <code>latest</code> are all available for use and updated, as all containers should be.</p><div><p><code>&lt;rant&gt;</code></p><div><p><a href="https://www.linuxserver.io/">LinuxServer.io</a> maintain a number of really great containers, but don’t maintain these meta versions. You either have to pin to the exact version, including their own versioning (<code>18.0.4-ls81</code>) or <code>latest</code>.</p><p>This makes updating incredibly annoying, and requiring fairly constant updates to ensure the applications work correctly. If you use these containers, and want some slightly better tagging, go show your support: <a href="https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-jenkins-builder/pull/50">https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-jenkins-builder/pull/50</a></p></div><p><code>&lt;/rant&gt;</code></p></div><p>If a container you want to use doesn’t expose pinned versions like this, then there’s little you can do but ask the maintainer to add some more tags.</p><h2 id="concluding"><a href="#concluding">#</a> Concluding</h2><p>Maintaining a docker-based infrastructure is different, especially around updating, but it’s a decision I don’t regret. Mostly because it means I don’t need to care about inter-application compatibility, security or exactly how to run the application, it “just works”.</p><p>If you put in some work to set up notifications about software updates, it’s not too dissimilar to regular package managers, and yet has the nice benefits of keeping some things up-to-date.</p><p>I’ve been running this process for about 6 months, and it’s not caused me a single issue. Whilst there are some packages I need (looking at you <a href="https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-jenkins-builder/pull/50">LSIO</a>!) which I’ve been forced to pin to <code>latest</code>, the rest remain nicely pinned to versions.</p><p>You can see all of this in action in my <a href="https://github.com/RealOrangeOne/infrastructure/">infrastructure</a> repository!</p></div></div>]]>

                    <p>The title of this post might be familiar to those of you who are members on Zip Recruiter. This was the subject of one of the more outrageous job postings I was sent.</p>
<p>In this post Iâ€™m going to share with you some of the most ridiculous job posts they have sent me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Jeremy,</p>
<p>I have a job that I think lines up well with your resume. It's new, so they don't have many candidates yet.</p>
<p><strong>full stack developer</strong> - [redacted] - New York, NY <strong>$20 hourly (USD)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I now understand why they can't find any candidates...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you a super-star developer with a love of art?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And now I'm done. </p>
<p>This is just one of many job posts like this that I keep getting. This company is offering a NYC-based "super-star" full-stack web developer only $20 per hour... in US Dollars (in case you couldn't assume that?).</p>
<p>If this were a one-off post I was emailed, I would say, man, that company is never going to find a developer, but it isnâ€™t. I receive a ridiculously high number (at least once per day) job post from zip-recruiter offering salaries below the poverty line.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Web Application Developer</strong> - [redacted] - New York, NY <strong>$10,000 - $60,000 annual (USD)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, glad to see that they are paying me in greenbacks and not Argentinian Pesos! This salary is about $40,000 - $90,000 below market rate of a decent junior level web developer.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Lead JavaScript Engineer</strong> - [redacted] - New York, NY *<em>$150,000 - $175,000 Annually**</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This job is off to a great start. Decent salary for the job being offered.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benefits Offered: <strong>401K, Dental, Medical, Vision</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good, good. Heading in the right direction, but I wouldnâ€™t have added this to the post if this didnâ€™t have flaws:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Leading ticketing platform, with headquarters in Manhattan, are looking for a Senior C# Engineer to build and design APIâ€™s utilizing C#, Azure, .Net. This is an immediate start.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And there we are, looking at a role for a Lead JS Engineer, and somehow ended up on a Senior C# Engineer post. I guess they added the wrong title. Doesnâ€™t matter, though, I <em>AM</em> a Senior C# Engineer, so letâ€™s keep reading?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Lead JavaScript Engineer will ideal have the following attributes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3/4+ years building web applications in JavaScript</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And Iâ€™m lost again. JS, no C#, no JS with 9+ months experience?</p>
<p>I get it, Zip Recruiter is â€œcheap.â€� You get your first applicant for $10 (or free if you listen to ANY business podcasts), the job post goes out to dozens of job boards and thousands of emails. BUT if your first applicant is a C# dev that applies because they saw Senior C#, you have wasted your time, their time, $10, and if you want to see the other applicants, you have to upgrade your account and pay $375/mo until you call them to cancel (I know, because I still pay $10/mo to keep my account on pause because I donâ€™t feel like talking to people, and $10/mo is probably less expensive over 2 years than fighting with them to cancel my account is is worth, and they know it... fuckers).</p>

<![CDATA[Ohio Dept. Of Health Contact Tracing Leaks Citizen's Information]]>

July 27, 2020 | https://zachwick.com/posts/odh-contact-tracing/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://zachwick.com/posts/odh-contact-tracing/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        



<p>The Ohio Dept of Health is doing contact tracing as part of their response to COVID-19. When a person tests positive for COVID-19, they provide their local health department with the name and phone number of any recent close contacts. Those close contacts are then contacted by the local health department and are asked to self-quarantine for 14 days and take their temperature twice a day. These close contacts are also asked to self-report their temperatures and any other COVID-19 symptoms that they may have either over the phone to a health department employee or via a web app.</p>

<p>If a person chooses to report their temperature and other symptoms via the web app, they are sent a URL daily at 1600 and then again every 30 minutes until they visit the URL and report their information. These URLs look like the following:</p>
<div><pre>https://octs.odh.ohio.gov/symptom-tracker?p=T0RILTI5ODI1&amp;d=MDcvMTMvMjAyMA%3D%3D&amp;language=en</pre></div>
<p>This was the URL that I was sent one day, as I was a close contact of a person who had tested positive for COVID-19 and I did self-quarantine for 14 days.</p>



<p>Note that the query string of these URLs contains three fields; <code>p</code>, <code>d</code>, and <code>language</code>.</p>

<p>It’s clear that <code>language</code> refers to the language that the requested page should be presented in. This can easily be tested by substituting <code>es</code> for <code>en</code> and noting that the page is now presented in Spanish. Further testing revealed that the self-reporting web app is only available in English and Spanish.</p>

<p>After receiving one of these URLs via SMS every day, it was apparent that the value of the <code>p</code> field didn’t change, while the value of the <code>d</code> field did change each day. That suggested that the <code>p</code> field is the “patient id”, while the <code>d</code> field is the date for which the user is self-reporting their temperatures and symptoms.</p>

<p>Noting that ‘%3D%3D’ is the string ‘==’ being URL encoded, suggests that the value of the <code>d</code> field is simply the date in the format ‘MM/DD/YYY’ base64 encoded (because base64 encoded strings can be padded with ‘=’ or ‘==’ at the end). A simple test of this showed that when I base64 encoded the string ‘07/18/2020’, then URL encoded the result, and then supplied that value as the value of the <code>d</code> field, I could submit information for myself for any future date that was before the last day of my 14 day quarantine.</p>

<p>In my particular case, that meant that simply by changing the URL, I could submit temperature meausurements and other symptoms for myself for any date between 2020-07-07 and 2020-07-21. If I attempted to load the page for 2020-07-22, I was shown a message that I no longer need to complete the survey.</p>

<p>This ability to submit information for a day other than the current day probably isn’t strictly a security bug, but it is somewhat poorly designed and the server-side code clearly doesn’t do any validation on the reporting date since I was able to submit made up results for myself for 2020-07-18.</p>

<p>The more serious issue is the <code>p</code> field, which likely corresponds to a “patient id” or something of that ilk. Because the <code>d</code> field was base64 encoded, it would make sense that the <code>p</code> field is also something that has been base64 encoded. Note that the value of the <code>p</code> field does not have ‘%3D%3D’ at the end. This is because base64 encoded only <em>may</em> be padded with ‘=’ or ‘==’ at the end, but a string doesn’t strictly <em>need</em> to end with those characters. So, by taking the value of the <code>p</code> field and attempting to decode it as base64 yields (in my case) the string “ODH-29825”. This seems like it is in fact some kind of unique identifier for myself in ODH’s database.</p>



<p>Now that we understand what these fields are all used for, it is trivial to create query string parameters in reverse. For example one could attempt to use today’s date (07/27/2020) and the patient id of “ODH-00000” to craft a URL like:</p>
<div><pre>https://octs.odh.ohio.gov/symptom-tracker?p=T0RILTAwMDAw&amp;d=MDcvMjcvMjAyMA==&amp;language=en</pre></div>
<p>and attempt to load the page for that patient. This page will only load if you’ve both selected a valid ODH patient id, and that the date that you’ve used for the value of the <code>d</code> parameter is within the 14 day quarantine period for that ODH patient.</p>

<p>Originally, the patient’s first and last name were displayed on this page. This means that one can simply enumerate patient IDs from ODH-00000 to ODH-9999999 (or some large upper bound), and when an actual person’s name appears on the site, you then know that the person listed has been a close contact of a known positive COVID-19 case and is currently self-quarantining and monitoring. Once a person has been found, you must simply try up to the next 14 days as the value of the <code>d</code> field to determine when they were in contact with a positive COVID-19 case.</p>



<h3 id="2020-07-07">2020-07-07</h3>

<p>I begin receiving these text messages from ODH.</p>

<h3 id="2020-07-16">2020-07-16</h3>

<p>I resolve to report this to the State of Ohio, as I feel it is a big enough issue to warrant doing so.</p>

<h3 id="2020-07-16-1530">2020-07-16 @ 1530</h3>

<p>After searching around on <a href="https://ohio.gov/">https://ohio.gov</a>, I came across <a href="https://infosec.ohio.gov/Incidents/Reportanincident/StateGovernmentSites.aspx">https://infosec.ohio.gov/Incidents/Reportanincident/StateGovernmentSites.aspx</a>.</p>

<h3 id="2020-07-16-1540">2020-07-16 @ 1540</h3>

<p>I called the listed number (614-644-8660) and was asked to email the details of what I was reporting to csc@ohio.gov. I was also asked if I was a public employee, to which I responded that while I’m not an employee of the State of Ohio, I am an elected legislator in my village.</p>

<h3 id="2020-07-16-1549">2020-07-16 @ 1549</h3>

<p>I sent in an email indicating that I had been asked to email this address and asked how they would like me to securely get the details of the vulnerability to their team.</p>

<h3 id="2020-07-16-1551">2020-07-16 @ 1551</h3>

<p>I received automated emails that an incident had been created and had been assigned to someone.</p>

<h3 id="2020-07-16-1658">2020-07-16 @ 1658</h3>

<p>I received an email at the email address corresponding to my position as an elected legislator, asking to confirm that this email belongs to the same individual who sent the email to the state at 1540.</p>

<h3 id="2020-07-16-1702">2020-07-16 @ 1702</h3>

<p>I responded in the affirmative to the above email.</p>

<h3 id="2020-07-16-2114">2020-07-16 @ 2114</h3>

<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/zachwick/status/1283933170585554944">tweet the SHA256 sum</a> of <a href="https://github.com/zachwick/ODH_Contact_Tracing/blob/master/proof.txt">this file</a>.</p>

<h3 id="2020-07-17-1559">2020-07-17 @ 1559</h3>

<p>I received an email and then shortly after a phone call from a representative from the state and I provided the responding team a password-protected ZIP archive as an email attachment and provided the password to them over the phone. This was the alternative I proposed since the team didn’t seem interested in providing a GPG/PGP key that I could use to encrypt my message to them.</p>

<h3 id="2020-07-23-0929">2020-07-23 @ 0929</h3>

<p>I received an automated email that the incident had been resolved. This email contained the following note:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ODH worked with the vendor to strip the last names from the data. It was determined that the only data that a bad actor could see would be the name of the citizen that is being traced. ODH has excepted the fix of just removing the last name because of the volume of citizens that are being tracked.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I understand the tradeoffs that go into building software, but accepting a fix of only no longer displaying the last name of the person seems less than ideal. Anyone who can construct these URLs can still submit made-up information for any person currently under a 14-day quarantine that has elected to self-report their temperatures and symptoms via the ODH’s web app.</p>

<p>A few alternative, and somewhat more robust, fixes come to mind here. One option is to to create a single-use UUID that maps to a patient and date tuple in the ODH system backend, and then provide users with URLs that look like:</p>
<div><pre>https://octs.odh.ohio.gov/symptom-tracker?t=&lt;SOME_UUID_HERE&gt;</pre></div>
<p>These UUIDs should be created new for each patient for each day, and the server-side code that the self-reporting form submits to should ensure that the date for that UUID matches the current date and that the user has not yet submitted information for that day. This would make it much more difficult to enumerate all of the possible UUIDs and extract the names of people who may have been exposed to COVID-19 because a malicious actor would have a much smaller time window in which a constructed URL would be valid. This also adds at least some server-side data validation.</p>

<p>Another option would be to just turn off the ability for citizens to self-report this health information and instead have local health department employees contact each citizen under quarantine via phone each day to record their health information. This would be much more time consuming, and would cost much more, but would have the added benefit of not being susceptible to false data being reported for a citizen by a malicious actor simply constructing a URL.</p>



<p>I have <a href="https://github.com/zachwick/ODH_Contact_Tracing">a repo</a>, which contains a simple python script that demonstrates how to generate the URL for a given ODH patient id and date. It would be unethical to submit false data for a person other than yourself, but I feel it is important to show how trivial it is to construct these URLs.</p>

<p>It’s an unsettling feeling, leaving college, leaving high school or some kind of post high-school service and entering (what they call) the “real world” and realizing that offers of all kinds don’t come sliding through. Job offers, investment opportunities, whatever else. Yet there is this naive belief that is propagated to our youth that everything just sort of sorts itself out after you enter the aforementioned “real world”.  </p>



<p>The “real world” was laid out to me by some high school teachers/counselors like this: you graduate high school, you go to college, you graduate college, you get a job, you save, you have a family, you retire. Boom, done. You hardly have to think or worry at all, it’s all done for you. They espoused this plan because that’s the plan that worked for them. </p>



<p>When I look at the generation of my high school teachers and counselors this is how life seemed to be (according to my tiny brain) for them when they were my age. Everything was prepackaged and pre-bundled for you on a little conveyor belt, all you had to do was pluck the package you wanted and off you went, things would then go relatively smoothly. And as long as you didn’t destroy it completely and make an effort to keep the plan together, things were going to work out.  </p>



<p>Things are different now, a lot different. This isn’t to say things were better then or worse now, or vice versa, it simply is what it is. </p>



<p>It’s almost like in previous generations the ordinary person didn’t *need* to have a lot of options. Don’t get me wrong, they had most of the same options we do today, they are just … less reliable now. The paths taken then seemed to be more of a success compared to those same paths when taken by my generation. When I refer to “paths” I mostly mean credentialization, but specifically university credentialization. It seems that a few decades ago as long as the proper hoops were jumped through you would be alright. The hoop jumping trick is starting to wear out, and doesn’t have that same appeal to younger people. Not only is the appeal not there, those old paths just don’t work for the masses like they used to.  </p>



<p>I am growing more and more certain that these traditional options are running out of steam. They had their time, they worked, and that’s fine. So what about us zoomers/millennials? What options do we have? </p>



<p>Well, for starters, I think my options are going to be closer to fishing in the wild on my 3rd foodless night than they are to selecting meals off a fast food menu. Our food will have to be caught ourselves and our career options are going to have to be crafted in the same way. </p>



<p> Why do you have to make your own? Mostly because credentialization doesn’t represent real knowledge like we thought it did for a long time. It’s mostly a signal, and it turns out when you build a family/business/economy on people who signalled they have knowledge it’s not as sustainable as it otherwise might be when those people have legitimate knowledge and experience. The college degree means diddly compared to what it meant 50 years ago. When my high school counselors got out of college they went right into the jobs they’d have for the rest of their careers (retirement plans included), and essentially coasted until that retirement came.  I know I am not the only one who got out of college and expected all kinds of those same kind of opportunities to flow in, because that’s what was sold to me in high school! This promise school teachers and advisors make you that once you get there to the “real world” things will be similar to how they always have been. BIG NOPE. Not anymore. That was probably naive of me to take their word for it but hey, here we are. </p>



<p>Ironically, after being taught dependence on the system for so long, the second I got out of that system and into the “real world” the first thing it taught me was 1) Holy crap, they were all wrong, and 2)  no one is going to save me, no employer, no politician, nothing. And even if you are “saved” today with some kind of career opportunity or political handout it’s hardly ever on your terms. And if someone comes to save you it’s probably going to look like this: </p>



<figure><img src="https://i.redd.it/dcf82fk9tz431.jpg" alt="Why even go to school anymore : recruitinghell" width="385" height="483"></figure>







<p>Giving yourself your own options and crafting options for yourself is the best way to make those be to your liking – there will always be product-market fit when it’s done this way.  In my experience with opportunities/jobs that weren’t on my terms they were worth doing only because I realized that it wasn’t sustainable for me and it wasn’t what I wanted to be doing in the long haul. This sort of experience bogs the psyche down. </p>



<p>There is no modern credentialization I can think of that will help you on your way to self sustainability and optionality. The only way to become self-sustainable is to tinker and make decisions based on new information that comes to you. None of this was taught to me while I was in the credential process, I was basically taught dependence on superiors and blind trust to the system, and not much else. There are roles in which credentialing plays an extremely vital part of your path, I am not talking about that. I am referring to the kids who are ostensibly great at nothing and decent at a few things who happen to have no idea what they want to study so they just go to college for a bachelors in business management and end up hating the trajectory that put them on. These kids – much like myself – relate more to Chris Farley or a Johnny Cash. Those who aren’t getting PHD’s anytime soon. </p>



<p>As someone who experienced “Educational Iatrogenics” – by trying to educate me, I was placed on the completely wrong path by nimwit credentializers – and because of that there is damage that needs to be undone, knowledge that needs to be unwound.</p>



<p>But in this case it may be better not to depend on those around you, it may be better for you to take things into your own hands and craft those options yourself, because no one is going to give them to you. This is what our youth should be taught at a younger age – in a less harsh and a more hopeful tone than mine obviously.</p>



<p>I think those who find themselves in a situation much like this are starting to ask themselves this question; Is “thriving” on someone else’s terms as good as surviving (with a non-zero chance of thriving) on your own terms? </p>

The idea of "getting it right" can be incredibly stressful if you're just starting out and things are going wrong left, right and centre. The save file has been corrupted, images aren't aligned in the way you wanted them to or the character's animation isn't right. In these situations, it's important to take a break, come back to it and get the initial version done.</p><p>Once it's done, celebrate. You made something real and amazing. That's right - you made it. Sometimes the smallest of achievements can be the biggest.&nbsp;</p><p>And let's face it, game development isn't the easiest of things. Even if you're using a no-code solution like Playmaker or Buildbox, you still have to think about the game you want to make, art, music, gameplay changes and much, much more. It isn't easy.</p><p>Pat yourself on the back once that first version has been completed and think about where to go to next. This is your journey.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Docker desktop and minikube are popular options for local development.  Do you need both installed for local development or can you save some RAM and run a only one  of them.  Below are some questions to help you decide which one to use in your situation.</p>



<p><strong>Which version of Kubernetes are you running in production? </strong></p>



<p>Kuberenets (k8s) is on a three month release cycle with an N-2 support policy. For example in July 2020 k8s 1.18 is the most recent GA release, 1.17 and 1.16 are currently supported. When k8s 1.19 is released 1.16 will fall out of support. Many organizations run the oldest supported k8s to minimize risk to production systems.</p>

<p>Docker Desktop includes a hard coded version of Kubernetes. For example at time of writing the most recent Docker desktop includes k8s 1.16.5 since that is the oldest supported version of k8s. </p>

<p>Currently it is not possible to change the version of k8s in Docker desktop. If you need an older version of k8s you will have to install an older version of Docker desktop.  Basically Docker is shipping  the  “most stable, widely used” version of k8s since many organizations run the oldest GA version of k8s in production.  </p>



<p> Minikube supports the most recent GA version of k8s plus the previous 6 minor versions.   You can pass minikube a command line argument to  launch a specific version of k8s. For example, <code>minikube start --kubernetes-version=v1.18.3 </code>will launch k8s 1.18.3</p>



<p><strong>How do you build your container images?</strong></p>



<p>If you use a <code>Dockerfile</code> during development you will need to have Docker desktop installed, otherwise you won’t be able to run <code>docker build</code> to create a container image on your laptop. </p>



<p>If you are building your container image using tools such as <a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib">JIB</a> that don’t require a local Docker daemon you can run minikube without Docker desktop.</p>



<p><strong>Do you need a local container registry?</strong></p>



<p>Minikube does not ship with a container registry. By default it will try to resolve container images from Docker hub and other public registries. If you need to build containers on your laptop and you want minikube to pull them form your laptop rather than a remote container registry you will benefit from running Docker desktop since it includes a local container registry. </p>



<p><strong>How do you manage local development dependencies? </strong></p>



<p>If your application depends on commonly used OSS databases, message queues, caches you will have to decide how setup these dependencies on your laptop. There are three reasonable choices. </p>



<ul><li>Install on laptop </li><li>Run with docker-compose</li><li>Run on minikube </li></ul>



<p>Installing directly on a laptop can be time consuming and error prone. If you work on multiple apps or services that need different versions of PostgreSQL or MySQL then development becomes more time consuming and error prone.</p>



<p>You can run dependencies using docker-compose  which has a nice developer friendly workflow. </p>



<ul><li>checkout code </li><li><code>docker-compose up</code></li><li>write code / run tests on laptop that use services running in Docker</li><li><code>docker-compose down</code></li></ul>



<p>With docker-compose we are running third party dependencies in simple repeatable manner. </p>



<p>Minikube can also be used to run third party dependencies such as MySQL and other tools. To do so you will have to write k8s deployment manifests and expose the services using a NodePort on the minikube vm ip address. </p>



<p>If you want to use docker-compose for dependencies then you will need docker desktop, otherwise you can get away with minikube. </p>



<p><strong>Are you using JUNIT with test containers ?</strong></p>



<p>If you are using the <a href="https://www.testcontainers.org/">test containers</a> project for your automated testing you will need to  run Docker Desktop since test containers does not currently support Kubernetes. </p>



<p><strong>Which Operating System are you using for local development?</strong></p>



<p>Docker Desktop is available on MacOS and Windows  and it includes both k8s and docker . On Linux the docker distribution only includes docker, so you will have to  install  k8s from another source.</p>



<p>Minikube is available on Mac, Windows, and Linux.  If  you are looking for the same developer experience across Mac, Windows, and Linux then minikube is a good choice. </p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>Use docker desktop if  </p>



<ul><li>You need to build  container images from <code>Dockerfile</code></li><li>You need a local container registry</li><li>You are managing your local development environment with docker compose</li><li>You are using test containers with junit</li><li>The version of Kubernetes included in docker desktop is the version  you want to use</li><li>Your developers are only on MacOS and Windows.</li></ul>



<p>Use minikube if</p>



<ul><li>You need to pick a specific version of Kubernetes to work with </li><li>You don’t need a local container registry</li><li>You are not using test containers with junit</li><li>You have developers using Linux, MacOS, and Windows</li></ul>



<p>Based on your answers to the question above it is quite possible that you will need to run both. </p>

<p><em>Be kind to your future self. If</em><em> you feel stuck, the best thing you can possibly do for future “you” is to make time to reinvent present “you.”</em></p>



<p>Six months ago, I was totally out of answers.</p>



<p>It was a chilly, dreary January day in Denver, Colorado. I had just left my job at a marketing company back home in Philadelphia, and I had no idea what I was going to do next. My only instinct, the day I left the office for good, was to book a flight for a short getaway to the Mile-High City, one of my favorite places to visit. I needed that space. I needed that clarity of mind. I was sick and tired of striking out in my search for meaningful work, and I didn’t know where else to look. </p>



<p>Just three years prior, I made the decision to <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/06/08/12-lessons/">leave another unfulfilling office job to carve my own path</a>. At the time, I knew it was a huge risk, but it was something I knew I needed to do to have any chance of realizing my full potential. But on this cold and lonely day in Denver, it felt like Groundhog Day all over again. Walking down a quiet street in the city’s North Capitol Hill section, I saw my reflection in a café window. I saw no change.</p>



<p>In three years, I went from depressed office worker to world-traveler, to excited entrepreneur, to the pinnacle of the restaurant industry, and back to depressed office worker. Had I just spent those years chasing my tail? What had I accomplished besides coming full circle to yet another desk job?</p>



<p>If this was my master plan to reinvent myself and carve my own path, I was failing miserably. The problem was that I was relying too much on other people for opportunities to determine my future. The bigger problem was that I never gave myself the time to do it for myself.</p>







<h3><strong>The Missing Link</strong></h3>



<p>Running a restaurant for two of those three years since escaping the cubicle had left me with little time to even think, let alone sleep and shower. My family suffered for it. My girlfriend suffered for it. And my potential for the personal growth and freedom I so yearned for suffered for it.</p>



<p>While walking along the Pearl Street Mall in Denver, I did a quick mental calculation. There are only 24 hours in a day. No matter if you are just scraping by, or if you are Bill Gates, we all have the same amount of this most valuable asset—<em>time</em>. You spend a third of that time sleeping. When you account for the time spent eating, showering, driving, working, etc., you are left with a measly 2-3 hours. And that’s at best. With those remaining hours, you just want to spend it relaxing on the couch, unwinding from the day. When do you find time to reinvent yourself? How can you meaningfully change course from an unfulfilling path that is sucking up all of your time?</p>



<p>Sure, if you want to grind straight through each day, you are free to do that. While there are some mutants out there who have been successful using this method, it does not work for most of us. You simply cannot rely on willpower alone to build anything of quality and value in the long run. You have to get smart and build a reliable system that creates time and cultivates curiosity. On that day in Denver, I decided I needed to find more time to reinvent myself.</p>



<h3><strong>How to Find More Time</strong></h3>



<p>Coincidentally, Covid-19 took the world by storm shortly after I returned to Philadelphia. Was it a sign from the heavens that I was waiting for? Was it just a coincidence that I needed to recognize and take full advantage of? Whatever it was, it virtually cleared out months of time for me to reinvent myself. So I moved up to a cabin in the Pocono Mountains and got to work.</p>



<p>Even with the pandemic keeping many of us home, finding time still is a big problem. Working from home, handling kids, making dinner, handling the endless chores around the house, and making time to get outside to avoid cabin fever are among the responsibilities for those of us lucky enough to be working from home. Whether you are working from home, working on site, or simply looking for a better system for reinventing your life, I have a four-step, actionable process that will ensure your ability to pivot from an unfulfilling path.</p>



<h4><strong>Step One: Commit</strong></h4>



<p><em>“The difference between involvement and commitment is like ham and eggs. The chicken is involved; the pig is committed.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>– Martina Navratilova</p>



<p>The most important step of this entire equation is to commit to yourself. You must commit to making the change you so deeply desire. If not, then the rest of this process falls apart.</p>



<p>Just looking at yourself in the mirror and hoping for a change won’t do it. Looking at the Kardashians and wanting their life won’t do it. Chasing the highest paying job you can find won’t do it. Extrinsic motivation never works in the long run if you want to make meaningful change in your life.</p>



<p>You must have an intrinsic, in-your-blood, raging-fire type motivation. Everyone has it. Everyone has that “something” that gets them out of bed in the morning. It just depends on how much the fire has been dulled by years of unsatisfying work and sub-optimal habits.</p>



<p>For me, my intrinsic motivation is family. To reinvent myself is something I needed to do for my family (and a family of my own in the future). I never want to look at my reflection in another café window to see the same underachieving person. I needed to be better for myself and for my family. That is my driving force.</p>



<p>You could also use the <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/07/11/12-favorite-problems/">12 Favorite Problems</a> approach. There is no best approach to finding your purpose, but when I am out of answers, this method cuts straight through to the source.</p>



<p>Find that force in your own life—your “<em>why</em>.” Commit to reinvent yourself on a foundation of intrinsic motivation. Make it urgent, because you never know when your time on earth will be up. This is not a process for improving your life. This is a way of actively saving it.</p>



<h4><strong>Step Two: Simplify</strong></h4>



<p>Once you make this commitment to saving your life, you must take steps from the outset to clear a path. </p>



<p>Most of us, and I am surely in this group, can be hindered by clutter. Physical clutter, mental clutter, digital clutter, time clutter. All of this, whether conscious or not, serves to slow us down and overwhelm us.</p>



<h5><strong><em>Physical Clutter</em></strong></h5>



<p>I started by <strong>cleaning my work area</strong>. Getting rid of unnecessary papers, trash, and even objects that didn’t contribute to the look and feel of my work environment. Keeping only the necessary items in the physical spaces where I spend most of my time has made a world of difference. As I always say:</p>



<p><em>External Mess = Internal Stress</em></p>



<p>Don’t underestimate the power of your physical environment. Build a place that you are comfortable in, that motivates you, that facilitates calmness and thoughtfulness, that inspires you to do your best meaningful work. You will instantly become more efficient with your time.</p>



<h5><strong><em>Mental Clutter</em></strong></h5>



<p>This is possibly the toughest area to declutter. The mind is so complex, so unpredictable, and so ever-present that it is hard to even know where to start. </p>



<p>Pick one area that brings you the most stress. I started with quitting the news.</p>



<ul><li>By <strong>not watching the news</strong>, I have seen a drastic improvement in my metal state. It is a classic example of addition by subtraction. If a piece of news is important enough, it will find its way to me. But I’ll pass on being depressed by the never-ending stream of crime and politics.</li><li>Along the same lines, <strong>read less junk</strong>. Scrolling Buzzfeed and your Facebook timeline endlessly will do nothing but make you jealous and lethargic. Clear that head-space, and clear that time off your calendar for more useful activities that will get you on the path to achieving your goal.</li><li><strong>Meditate</strong>, or just simply give your mind some time to breathe. Constantly crowding it with unnecessary and stressful inputs will drain your ability and your inspiration for self-reinvention.</li></ul>



<h5><strong><em>Digital Clutter</em></strong></h5>



<ul><li><strong>Clean out your inbox</strong>. Better yet, schedule a time each week for “inbox-zero.” For me, that is every Sunday night. Being able to accomplish that goal before the new week is often the springboard I need to get off to an productive start.</li><li><strong>Clear your desktop on your computer</strong>. Create folders, label properly, and commit to maintaining your filing system. Clutter on your screen will lead to more feelings of overwhelm and ineffectiveness.</li><li><strong>Cut down on TV</strong>. You may be in the habit of watching Netflix with your loved ones when you have some free time. But turning off the TV and doing more interactive things with your family and friends can give you a boost in creativity and productivity that you wouldn’t normally get from passive screen time. Less TV is bound to free up a couple more hours per week.</li></ul>



<p>There are so many more ways to declutter your digital life. These are the three that have helped me the most.</p>



<h5><strong><em>Time Clutter</em></strong></h5>



<p>In our daily lives, we tend not to organize our time in the way we organize tangible areas like our desks, our homes, and our computers. Due to the invisibility of time, we often let our days become cluttered with insidious, time-sucking activities that will inevitably crowd out productive time each day. To fend off this type of clutter:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Block out time on your calendar for productive work</strong>. By scheduling your week ahead of time, you can visually account for where your time will go. I simply use the calendar on Microsoft Outlook. Many people use Notion or write it down by hand. It doesn’t matter what you use, as long as you make an effort to document it.</li><li><strong>Cut down on meetings</strong>. If someone needs to meet in person, see if a phone call will do.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<div>
						<p>Online communities often grow from a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Grouped-groups-friends-influence-social/dp/0321804112?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thstsst-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">small, enthusiastic, intelligent niche group</a> that is relatively self-policing to a larger, amorphous group that becomes stupider at a rate that’s an exponent of the number of users (the linked book is excellent on this topic). Initial moderators are usually enthusiasts and small groups are more like communities than cities. Later moderators, though, are usually adversely selected: What kind of person would voluntarily spend lots of time and energy policing a community for no money? Consequently, online community decline is often exacerbated by the moderator or moderators who eventually take over or seek power.</p>
<p>The psychology of someone who is willing to moderate a Reddit subsection—or any similar site, like many mailing lists—is not good. This sort of person is willing to spend a time at a thankless task that is hard to do well and rarely if ever remunerative.</p>
<p>Those who start at that task do so optimistically but often quit as their lives change or the task becomes more onerous. Who gets left? People with axes to grind; people with no sense of perspective; petty tyrants; and so on. I don’t use Reddit much for many reasons, but low moderator quality is one. I rarely bother messaging them because doing so is largely a waste of time.</p>
<p>The problem with moderators is not dissimilar from the problem of users: People who regularly have something interesting to say and the means to say it well get blogs, as I wrote in “<a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2013/06/05/social-news-sites-and-forums-should-encourage-users-to-blog/">Social news sites and forums should encourage users to blog</a>.” Those who don’t stay on Reddit. The average Reddit contributor has little stake in long-term reputation—unlike bloggers, journalists, and academics who use real names—and that shows in the quality and quantity of posts. That may not hurt the site—the popularity of bad TV shows over many years demonstrates lowest-common denominator issues—but it should hurt in terms of high-quality users.</p>
<p>A form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law">Gresham’s Law</a> applies to social sites and to moderators: bad commentary pushes out the good, and smart people flee stupid comments. One could alternately call this a <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Tragedy_of_the_commons.html">tragedy of the commons</a>, in which communal spaces become overrun with spam or commentary so stupid that it might as well be spam.</p>
<p>Reddit and similar sites can have an orthogonal problem, however, as they become so afraid of self-interested commentary or posts that they forbid it—thus causing smart people to go elsewhere with their thoughts, and leaving the dregs unwilling or able to create standalone communities or blogs.</p>
<p>This may be part of the reason why Reddit—even on the “good” subsections—tend to be better for beginners: anyone who gets past the beginning stages needs more expert advice than Redditors can provide. The same is happening to Hacker News, too, or it has already happened, though not as severely: Hacker News has an advantage in that its survival and the intelligent commentary on it is tied to a business that is in turn tied to ideas. Its moderators have a stronger incentive to get it right, since they’re not driven primarily by ego or overwhelming fear of “spam.”</p>
<p>That being said, anyone who has seen an unmoderated forum is aware of the fact that unmoderated forums are unusable. So getting rid of moderators is not a solution. In general the mechanisms of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Exit-Voice-Loyalty-Responses-Organizations/dp/0674276604;ref">exit, voice, and loyalty</a>, as described by Hirshman at the link, apply on the level of online communities. But constantly shifting for newer communities where smart people congregate is at best difficult and at worst a waste of time in and of itself. Reddit has to some extent worked on this problem through the sub-Reddit system, which is a better-than-nothing solution but not a great one.</p>
<p>Maybe there is no good solution to this from the perspective of smart users other than withdrawal. Better blogs written by smart individuals or groups are better than virtually any online, Reddit-like community I’ve found. Which is too bad. But I doubt most people in latter-day moderator positions are even willing or able to read this post, and, if they are, I don’t think they’ll understand it, and, if they do, I don’t think they’ll accept any of it.</p>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>SaaS businesses (particularly ones for technical users) sometimes have to deal with a vocal outcry that their product “is just a wrapper around” something. The implication is that ‘a wrapper’ is inherently not valuable, and it’s impossible to build a great business around such a product. This logic is a product of lazy thinking and myopia; <strong>‘wrappers’ can be insanely valuable.</strong><!-- more --></p>

<p>Here are a few examples that come to mind:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dropbox is “just rsync”</li>
  <li>Heroku is “just Linux containers on AWS”</li>
  <li>Netlify is “just static hosting and a CDN”</li>
  <li>Retool is “just MS Access reinvented for the web”</li>
  <li>IFTTT is “just cron + APIs”</li>
</ul>

<p>These statements are lazy thinking–they have elements of truth in them, but they aren’t complete. <strong>People are willing to pay for magic</strong>. This magic sometimes goes by names like “it just works” or “consumerized experience.” The thread that runs through the different monikers is that it accomplishes an otherwise painful<sup id="fnref:0" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:0">1</a></sup> task quickly and delights the user.</p>

<p>Technical users want to be delighted, too, even if the interaction layer may not be a GUI. It might be a CLI, fantastic docs, or a clean API (or likely all of the above). So, if you can take something painful and move the interaction layer, the value proposition of the underlying tools grows.</p>

<p>Big cloud providers will likely offer a comparable service, <a href="https://www.tclauson.com/2019/09/11/Unbundling-AWS.html">but these aren’t often existential threats to the best-in-class original</a>. Why? <strong>Because the interaction layer matters</strong> and a meaningful subset of users are willing to pay for the premium experience.</p>

<p>A few condensed observations about this ‘interaction layer’:</p>
<ul>
  <li>people want a ‘sensible defaults’ way of doing things … an opinionated way of starting out</li>
  <li>UI/UX matters a lot (this includes docs and CLI)</li>
  <li>rarely, the core value prop isn’t already being accomplished crudely by huge companies</li>
  <li>modern open-source companies that are successful have to nail this in ways their predecessors didn’t<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">2</a></sup></li>
  <li>consumerization of everything — i.e., how little of $PLUMBING can I get away with knowing?</li>
  <li>there are a meaningful number of technical users who can do something, but don’t want to waste otherwise valuable time doing so</li>
</ul>

<p>One could argue that the term for this is just ‘user experience,’ but that doesn’t seem quite right to me. Because it’s not about an experience of the underlying tool or process, it’s about creating an entirely new tool by ‘wrapping’ some of the original components.</p>

<article>
    <p>TL;DR
<a href="https://github.com/kovetskiy/mark">Mark — a tool for syncing your Markdown with Confluence</a></p>

<p>Oh man, I was so frustrated when I was trying to edit docs in Confluence, and it
broke all my text, trying to adjust any tags led to breaking the text even more.
I felt the same when Slack introduced their Wysiwyg editor that solved problems that never existed,
but at least they added an option to disable it.</p>
<p>Wysiwyg is the Devil’s Playground, but there is a solution.</p>
<p>Store with Git, write in Markdown, automatically sync with Confluence. Interesting? Let me tell you
about seven benefits that you could have if you could use Git for storing your docs instead of editing
them directly in Confluence:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Git</strong><br>
Confluence has a history of changes, but it’s very limited: you can’t do <code>git blame</code>,
you can’t do <code>git log -S</code> to search who added a specific text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pull Requests</strong><br>
Now, someone with a fresh set of eyes can identify problems and provide suggestions for docs.
You write code — someone reviews it, you write a book — someone reviews it.
Now, you write docs — someone reviews it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Instruments</strong><br>
We have some great tools like VSCode, Neovim, Sublime, or Idea with all required set of
extensions that make our coding even more efficient and less frustrating.</p>
<p>Then why not using it for writing docs? It’s more efficient than Wysiwyg for sure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No context switching</strong><br>
No need to jump around to read docs a bit. Just open it up in your editor
because you store the docs near to the code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hosting Agnostic</strong><br>
You can just push your docs on GitHub if you want to open source it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Decentralization</strong><br>
Everyone has their own complete copy of docs, develops it, and syncs up later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Continuous Integration</strong><br>
If you have a proper tool that I’m going to introduce, you can automatically update your docs in
Confluence after a successful <code>git push</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://github.com/kovetskiy/mark">Mark — a tool for syncing your Markdown documentation with Atlassian Confluence</a></p>
<p>Mark reads your Markdown file, creates a Confluence page if it doesn’t, uploads
attachments if any, translates Markdown into HTML, and updates the contents of the page via REST API.</p>
<p>It’s like you don’t even need to create sections/pages in your Confluence anymore, just mention them in
your .md files.</p>
<p>Mark uses an extended file format, which, still being valid markdown, contains several HTML-ish
metadata headers, which can be used to locate page inside Confluence instance and update it
accordingly.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="markdown"><span>&lt;!-- Space: &lt;space key&gt; --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!-- Parent: &lt;parent 1&gt; --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!-- Parent: &lt;parent 2&gt; --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!-- Title: &lt;title&gt; --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!-- Attachment: &lt;local path 1&gt; --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!-- Attachment: &lt;local path 2&gt; --&gt;</span>

Some text here.

<p><code>mark.md</code></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="markdown"><span>&lt;!-- Space: DEV --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!-- Parent: Automation --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!-- Parent: Documentation --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!-- Title: Sync Markdown to Confluence --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!-- Attachment: images/screenshot.png --&gt;</span>

Article text here.

</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ mark -u user -p password -b http://confluence/ -f mark.md
</code></pre></div><p>Mark will upload file <code>images/screenshot.png</code> as an attachment, create a page in Confluence by the
following path:<br>
<code>Dev / Automation / Documentation → Sync Markdown to Confluence</code>, then render
Markdown as HTML and put the contents via REST API on the user’s behalf.</p>
<h2 id="continuous-integration">Continuous Integration</h2>
<p>It’s quite trivial to integrate Mark into a CI/CD system, here is an example with <a href="https://snake-ci.com/">Snake CI</a>
in case of self-hosted Bitbucket Server / Data Center.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>stages</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span>- sync<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>Sync documentation</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>stage</span><span>:</span><span> </span>sync<span>
</span><span>  </span><span>only</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>branches</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>      </span>- main<span>
</span><span>  </span><span>image</span><span>:</span><span> </span>kovetskiy/mark<span>
</span><span>  </span><span>commands</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>    </span>- for<span> </span>file<span> </span>in<span> </span>$(find<span> </span>-type<span> </span>f<span> </span>-name<span> </span><span>'*.md'</span>);<span> </span>do<span>
</span><span>        </span>echo<span> </span><span>"&gt; Sync $file"</span>;<span>
</span><span>        </span>mark<span> </span>-u<span> </span>$MARK_USER<span> </span>-p<span> </span>$MARK_PASS<span> </span>-b<span> </span>$MARK_URL<span> </span>-f<span> </span>$file<span> </span>||<span> </span>exit<span> </span><span>1</span>;<span>
</span><span>        </span>echo;<span>
</span><span>      </span>done<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>In this example, I’m using the <code>kovetskiy/mark</code> image for creating a job container where the
repository with documentation will be cloned to. The following command finds all <code>*.md</code> files and runs mark against them one by one:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>for</span> file in <span>$(</span>find -type f -name <span>'*.md'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>echo</span> <span>"&gt; Sync </span><span>$file</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
    mark -u <span>$MARK_USER</span> -p <span>$MARK_PASS</span> -b <span>$MARK_URL</span> -f <span>$file</span> <span>||</span> <span>exit</span> 1<span>;</span>
    echo<span>;</span>
<span>done</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The following directive tells the CI to run this particular job only if the changes are pushed into the
<code>main</code> branch. It means you can safely push your changes into feature branches without being afraid
that they automatically shown in Confluence, then go through the reviewal process and automatically
deploy them when PR got merged.</p>

							<p>I recently TA’d a workshop Intro To Functional Programming With Elixir given by a co-worker. Not only did I want to help them out, I also wanted to support someone teaching as they learn, and learn something myself. </p><p>Over the past 6 months I’ve begun learning backend (via Elixir) in the way I’ve learned pretty much everything I know as a developer, by doing. Having a practical learning background means that I’ve started out in complex environments that offer a lot by way of example in real, production code — but it also means that there can be a lot of unknowns that remain along the way. The specific black box addressed in the workshop: the difference between functional and object oriented programming. </p><p>In most intros to Elixir this gets touched on at least in part, it being a functional language is one of the main attractions, but as a developer without a traditional CS background, I missed the lesson on what object oriented programming means, so knowing and leveraging the differences was beyond me. Something I really admire about my co-worker and all teach-as-they-learn instructors is the act of stepping up before feeling you’re on solid ground. It’s easy for me to eschew an instructor role for the usual reasons, telling myself “there are so many people out there who know more than me,” and “not knowing the material perfectly means I shouldn’t be explaining it to any one else.” In so many ways these mantras continue to feel true for me, but there is one caveat: they are less true in the programming world. The reality is, as programmers, we are all learning, all at the same time. If someone sits down to pair with you, they are coming to the problem the same as you. They might bring along a larger reference catalog with them, but they are still looking at, understanding and working at a problem just like you are.</p><p>In this workshop, my co-worker had a bunch of TAs in the (video conference) room, many very experienced engineers. As my co-worker went along through the talk, they allowed space for others to jump in if anything had been muddled or could use extra explaining. The majority of the time, they listened quietly along with everyone else. This was a brilliant, if somewhat intimidating setup. Shoot your shot and if there are any hiccups, there are other people around to catch them and fill in the blanks.</p><p>During the course of the lecture and in the subsequent breakout lab I found myself right in the middle of the road. I had a lot of questions, a lot of things I still didn’t understand, but I also was eager to help others who were earlier along in understanding concepts I had a better grasp on. Even things I did know, I was able to confirm them or learn new aspects to them or new applications. Even some simple things I hadn’t noticed before like syntactic indicators of functional programming made their way into my head and into an Elixir module talk I was soon to give for the second time. </p><p>I love practical explanations and drawing comparisons between concepts. I’m sure this is because of my learning experiences coming into development as I have. I’m still working on coming out of my shell on things I don’t know and filling in the education gaps as I work full time and jump into programming worlds that are new to me. One thing I’m beginning to understand more is how much avoiding teach-as-you-learn can be a real lose/lose. By the time you have a better command of a subject, you’re not as involved in the learning process around it. That means not only am I passing up an opportunity to learn and to do so in a more comfortable environment among peers where making mistakes and asking “dumb” questions feels less scary, I’m also less likely to pass on what I know and help someone else out. All this to say that I was inspired by my co-worker and the experience allowed me to rethink how I approach learning and how I could be more gratifyingly involved in teaching and improving with others.</p><p><em>Header photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@nesabymakers?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">NESA by Makers</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></em><br></p>

                    <p><strong>AI may replace human in enterprise decision making</strong></p><p>“As AI continues to be more prevalent, it is undeniable that <em>automated decisioning will replace traditional white-collar workers</em>. This means AI systems will be making the decisions instead of humans for anything from approving loans or deciding whether a customer should be on boarded to identifying corruption and financial crime. This is distinct from Robotic Process Automation (RPA), which simply emulates human decisioning. Instead, true AI systems will go beyond human capability. We can also expect to see greater understanding in the boardroom about what AI really means—including hard-nosed figures around competitive advance, reducing costs of operations and removing headcount. Expect to see this C-suite understanding trigger issues around unions and job security as a result of significant operational changes”—Imam Hoque, COO &amp; Head of Product, <a href="https://www.quantexa.com/">Quantexa</a></p><p><strong>AI for business insights discovery</strong></p><p>“AI will add an extra layer of predictability, allowing organizations to see patterns and gain insights from IoT devices and past customer behaviors—ultimately making supply chains smarter, leading to faster, more efficient production and fulfillment, and happier customers. <em>In 2019 and beyond, we can expect AI to take supply chains from reactive in nature to prescriptive levels, helping companies get one step ahead of consumers’ rising expectations</em>”—Hala Zeine, President of Digital Supply Chain, <a href="https://www.sap.com/index.html">SAP</a></p><p><strong>2019 will differentiate between laggards and leaders</strong></p><p><strong>“</strong>2019 is the year where we have everything in our hands to use digital technology; it will be the year that will differentiate the laggards and the leaders, providing competitive advantage to the forward-thinking organizations. The laggards still believe there is time, and will keep developing solutions in silos, making small progress, without realizing the pace of change is accelerating faster than in the last 20 years. <em>The leaders are the ones that are set for digital transformation across their organizations, and who will leverage Big Data and AI to deploy solutions that fundamentally affect the full drug development life cycle</em>; they will reverse the current trend—growth of drug development timelines by 25%, reaching a startling 12 years on average—and bring much-needed therapies to the market sooner”—Isabelle deZegher, Vice President, Integrated Solutions,<a href="https://www.parexel.com/"> PAREXEL</a></p><p><strong>A new breed of security data scientists will emerge</strong></p><p><em>“As AI and ML become mainstream, </em>a new breed of security data scientists will emerge in 2019<em>. Preparing, processing, and interpreting data require data scientists to be polymath. They need to know computer science, data science, and above all, need to have domain expertise to be able to tell bad data from good data and bad results from good results. What we have already begun seeing is the need for security experts who understand data science and computer science to be able to first make sense of the security data available to us today. Once this data is prepared, processed and interpreted, it can then be used by AI and ML techniques to automate security in real time”—Setu Kulkarni, Vice President of Corporate Strategy, </em><em><a href="https://www.whitehatsec.com/">WhiteHat Security</a></em></p><p><strong>Shop-for-data marketplace</strong></p><p>“<em>Centralized data will be replaced by a single view of all data</em>. Data is coming at us from different directions, at different speeds, and in different formats, and controlling this tsunami is one of the key markers of empowerment and success in the information age. Two massive trends are changing the landscape. First, different vendors are coming together to standardize data models. Second, and more important, is the emergence of enterprise data catalogs. These catalogs are accessible in a hub, with one view of the entire federated data estate, and deliver a shop-for-data marketplace experience. The more you share, collaborate, and use the hub, the more valuable it becomes to the business. Furthermore, it links your analytics strategy with your enterprise data management strategy, as the data becomes analysis-ready”—Dan Sommer, Senior Director, <a href="https://www.qlik.com/us">Qlik</a></p><p><strong>AI to satisfy the demand of consumers</strong></p><p>“We are still far from having a bonafide ‘smart home’ and the primary roadblock is the lack of the essential link between sensing and action. Currently, we have a variety of technologies that offer a compelling vision of the future, but that vision is impeded by the fact that the devices are isolated, lacking context, and are thus unable to act autonomously: the consumer must still supply the intelligence for the ‘smart home.’ <em>The mating of RF sensing technology with mesh and other networking schemes will amplify the value of network hardware, enabling them to provide powerful communications infrastructure and sensory feedback</em>—the necessary convergence of control and communications needed to create cognitive systems. We will see this convergence entering the market in 2019, led by forward-thinking tech players who will build out this visionary ecosystem to satisfy the demands of consumers who want to see a Jetson—esqe future, now.”—Nebu Mathai, EVP Product Engineering, <a href="https://www.cognitivesystems.com/">Cognitive Systems Corp.</a></p><p><strong>Trust credibly across user communities</strong></p><p><strong>“</strong>In 2019, the value statement of every vendor that builds AI systems should focus on BOTH the value they wish to create AND the underlying moral foundation of their service. How they collect data, with whom they share that data, and what they end up doing with that data will increasingly need a litmus test for what is acceptable and not. That litmus test needs to be part of the culture of the vendor—it needs to come from the inside out. While this will feel too ‘touchy-feely’ and constraining to some vendors, it is absolutely necessary for long-term business viability to establish trust credibly across their user communities. <em>Without transparency, there is no trust. Without trust, there is no data. Withoutdata, there is no AI</em>”—Ojas Rege, Chief Strategy Officer, <a href="https://www.mobileiron.com/en">MobileIron</a></p><p><strong>AI is making its impact across industries</strong></p><p>“Multi-trillion-dollar markets such as commercial real estate are comprised of an intricate web of interactions that affect every decision, and AI technology is now mature enough to tackle these highly complex transactions. As industry leaders are opening up to the potential of integrating advanced technology into core operations, <em>AI is making its impact felt across new industries that were previously off limits</em>. We see asset managers looking to develop new investment vehicles defined by AI that will enable enhanced performance in uncertain economic conditions, adding value throughout the entire investment lifecycle”—Guy Zipori, CEO, <a href="http://www.skyline.ai/">Skyline AI </a></p><p><strong>Need of third party data</strong></p><p>“The future of third-party data is critical for marketers to stay actionable and competitive in a fast-moving technology landscape. The culmination of high-profile corporate privacy scandals and new wide-sweeping data legislation has forced consumers to get to grips with their digital footprints and has caused them to be more critical over how they are targeted. <em>Moving forward, third party data will help marketers gather more insights surrounding how consumers use emerging technologies such as voice, location-based search and AI, so they can target them in a way that is compliant and drives ROI</em>. This data will remain key to informing the bulk of marketing strategy for years to come"—Chase Buckle, Senior Trends Analyst, <a href="https://www.globalwebindex.com/">GlobalWebIndex</a></p><p><strong>Impacts of AI on productivity and engagement</strong></p><p>“As automated technologies shape the workplace in 2019, it’s important for companies to think about how the onslaught of technology will impact their company culture in the short and long-term. Many organizations are already using AI to search for talent, but <em>when it comes to other areas of the workplace where employees will be encountering AI on a daily basis, companies need to understand employee perceptions from the start</em>. Before rolling out any new technology platforms, businesses need to be prepared to communicate the value the product will bring to the organization, how it will affect employees for the better, and the positive impact it will have on productivity and engagement. In doing this, companies will set their organizations up for success when implementing new technologies”—Andee Harris, President, <a href="http://highground.com/">HighGround/</a><a href="http://youearnedit.com/">YouEarnedIt</a></p>

Out of all the new things that came along with the release, one feature that stood apart was <a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/guides/machine-learning/ml-overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SnapML</a>.</p><p id="2991">SnapML allows lens creators to use their own custom machine learning models inside filters. Snapchat filters already use ML for a variety of things like face tracking, surface tracking, segmentation, facial gestures, and more.</p><p id="fef5">But with SnapML, developers can now go beyond those limits, using the breadth of their imaginations to combine custom ML models with Snapchat’s feature-rich augmented reality tools—and an audience of millions!</p><p id="49e5">Snapchat has made a lot of initial efforts to make the experience of implementing ML models as smooth and straightforward as possible. To do this, they’ve provided several ready-to-use templates that could be turned into AR experiences in only a few minutes. Let’s explore these templates and learn how to use them to create filters.</p><p id="a0a1">There are 5 main Lens Studio templates provided by Snap that cover some of the most common mobile machine learning tasks. We’ll cover the ML side of things a bit later, but first, here’s a look at the template projects inside Lens Studio:</p><h2 id="880d"><a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/templates/ml/style-transfer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Style Transfer</strong></a></h2><p id="a9ab"><a href="https://www.fritz.ai/style-transfer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Style transfer</a> is used to modify the overall visual appearance of the camera texture. Essentially, this task allows us to recompose the content of one image in the style of another.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/900/0*DNuj9eDDpeX3-grH.jpg" width="450" height="450" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*DNuj9eDDpeX3-grH.jpg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/900/0*DNuj9eDDpeX3-grH.jpg 450w" sizes="450px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*DNuj9eDDpeX3-grH.jpg?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="cc30">This could be used to create unique artistic styles or color filters. Imagine a selfie in the style of your favorite visual artists. This is similar to what we see in many image and video editing apps like <a href="https://prisma-ai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prisma</a> or <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/looq-photo-video-filters/id1159704664" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Looq</a>.</p><p id="f688">This project template contains an example ML model with a style transfer visual effect. We’ll discuss in more detail below how to implement your own custom style transfer model.</p><h2 id="4439"><a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/templates/ml/classification/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Classification</strong></a></h2><p id="5517">This template uses the <a href="https://www.fritz.ai/image-recognition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">image classification</a> ML technique, which is used to classify images into different labels. This task is also sometimes referred to as image labeling or image recognition.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/0*pIT8wD2np_V_vSgr.jpg" width="500" height="250" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*pIT8wD2np_V_vSgr.jpg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/0*pIT8wD2np_V_vSgr.jpg 500w" sizes="500px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*pIT8wD2np_V_vSgr.jpg?q=20"></p></div></div><figcaption><a href="https://www.fritz.ai/image-recognition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p id="1a92">This could be used to tell, for example, whether user is wearing a hat or not in a given image or video frame. However, to create this kind of model, you’ll need to train it on a large dataset. There’s a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=image+classification" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wide variety of image classification datasets out there</a>, but if there’s no dataset available for your use case, you’ll need to collect and label one.</p><p id="0e08">This template contains an example ML model that can tell if the user is wearing glasses or not, showing a particle effect if true. We’ll discuss in more detail below how to implement your own custom image classification model.</p><h2 id="f5e1"><a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/templates/ml/object-detection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Object Detection</strong></a></h2><p id="6f56">The <a href="https://www.fritz.ai/object-detection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">object detection</a> template could be used to identify and locate one or more target objects in a given image or video frame. Object detection is somewhat similar to image classification, but it’s important to quickly distinguish the two:</p><ul><li id="138a">Image classification assigns a label to an image. A picture of a dog receives the label “dog”. A picture of two dogs, still receives the label “dog”</li><li id="d8b8">Object detection, on the other hand, draws what’s called a bounding box around each dog and labels the box “dog”. The model predicts where each object is and what label should be applied. In that way, object detection provides more information about an image than recognition.</li></ul><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/800/0*_XrMzBf2PEBuQDiT.jpg" width="400" height="400" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*_XrMzBf2PEBuQDiT.jpg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/800/0*_XrMzBf2PEBuQDiT.jpg 400w" sizes="400px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*_XrMzBf2PEBuQDiT.jpg?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="baea">In Lens Studio, you could use this template to identify the location of the ring finger in an image or video frame, and use that prediction to place an AR ring for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/mobile-machine-learning-in-e-commerce-and-retail-visual-search-ebook-sample-f6bfbd49e36c">virtual product try-ons</a>.</p><p id="8adb">Again, here you’ll need a large dataset of objects you want to detect—and their bounding box coordinates—to create a custom model for this effect. <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=object+detection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here are some available datasets</a> to consider working with.</p><p id="f6ed">This template contains an example ML model that recognizes cars from the COCO dataset and draws bounding boxes around them. We’ll discuss in more detail below how to implement your own custom object detection model.</p><h2 id="6786"><a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/templates/ml/custom-segmentation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Custom Segmentation</strong></a></h2><p id="30fd"><a href="https://www.fritz.ai/image-segmentation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Segmentation</a> is an ML technique used to differentiate between the specific parts or elements of an image. Specifically, it works at a pixel-level—the goal is to assign each pixel in an image to the object to which it belongs (i.e. class label).</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/900/0*5UYUFjBGvXs6lGcc.jpg" width="450" height="450" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*5UYUFjBGvXs6lGcc.jpg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/900/0*5UYUFjBGvXs6lGcc.jpg 450w" sizes="450px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*5UYUFjBGvXs6lGcc.jpg?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="c28d">Segmentation could be used to add effects to a given segmented region. Snap Lense already had built-in segmentation to separate the user from the background, but with custom ML models you extend this task to anything you can think of—for example, segmenting the sky and changing it to into a beautiful, sunset-like pink-orange color.</p><p id="003c">This template contains an example ML model that recognizes a pizza and adds a sizzling effect to it. We’ll discuss in more detail below how to implement your own custom segmentation model.</p><h2 id="9286"><a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/templates/ml/ground-segmentation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Ground Segmentation</strong></a></h2><p id="164d">Very similar to the above template, but this one is designed to segment the ground and floor surfaces and can be used to change the ground to anything you’d like—i.e. hot lava, a frozen tundra, etc</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/600/0*OA5YaEqCcC_Qlkta.gif" width="300" height="534" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*OA5YaEqCcC_Qlkta.gif 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/600/0*OA5YaEqCcC_Qlkta.gif 300w" sizes="300px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/34/0*OA5YaEqCcC_Qlkta.gif?q=20"></p></div></div><figcaption><a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/templates/ml/ground-segmentation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">From Snap’s Ground Segmentation template</a></figcaption></figure><p id="e5a8">This template contains an example ML model that recognizes the ground and masks it with a frozen ice texture, as seen above.</p><h2 id="7490"><a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/templates/ml/ml-templates-library/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Third-Party Templates</a></h2><p id="8d81">Apart from these 5 ready-to-use templates from the Snap team, Snapchat and a few third-party creators have partnered to provide some more templates that could be used as a starting point for your effects, or could give you ideas and serve as inspiration for building your own custom models with SnapML!</p><p id="c128"><a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/templates/ml/ml-templates-library/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Let us take a look</a> at what they offer:</p><ul><li id="0e2e"><strong>Foot Tracking by Wannaby - </strong>Using this template you could attach 3D or 2D objects to the feet. You can also detect their location on the screen and when the feet touch each other.</li><li id="5738"><strong>Multi-Segmentation- </strong>whats’s better than segmentation?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
<p>I was trying to optimize a bash script and wondered how much echo statements would slow it down, so I did a few tests. I was specifically wondering if adding a check for verbosity before an echo statement would have a significant affect on runtime, vs just removing the echo statement all together.</p>

<p>I used this script to run the benchmark:

<p>I set <code>echo</code> to <code>01234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789</code> when benchmarking for long echo statements, and to <code>foo</code> when benchmarking short echo statements.</p>

<p>The different options had significant differences in runtime. Checking for verbosity and not printing took an average of <code>1.5 - 1.7</code> times as long as not printing anything at all! I definitely took this into consideration when deciding which echo statements were really necessary for my bash script.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that this benchmark is based on <code>echoing</code> to a file. By echoing to the console the options that print would take significantly longer.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any comments below!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><h4><strong>Want to see some tried and tested color schemes?</strong> </h4><p>Here are the most popular websites by search traffic in the US for 2020 so far. We've pulled out the most dominant colors they use in their user interface. This is a result of their design teams iterating over time learning how to make the ideal experience for their users. A fun thing I love to do is browse through a website in the <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Wayback Machine</a> to see the iterations to their web design over time.</p><p>‍</p><p>With no further ado, let's dive in.</p><p>‍</p><h2>1. youtube.com</h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 1,625,928,544</em></p><p>First up, we have YouTube. As the classic example of a user generated community, their use of a monochromatic color scheme allows their user content to stand out while the rest of the site's buttons dial back the stylistic features like extra chrome, button lines etc. The color red is used sparingly throughout the site experience to make their brand presence.</p><figure id="w-node-dd30d522abdd-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f0f3f346a77c079f50c_Youtube.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>2. en.wikipedia.org</h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 1,032,257,682</em></p><p>Next, we have Wikipedia, our collective human hive mind. The most important UI here is the blue link that is the connective UI between all the pages. Our branched experience is guided by the contrast of the black and blue text. The subtle pastel colors are used to identify different types of information on a page.</p><figure id="w-node-f3e9626686b1-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f1c2797441bbf314858_Wikipedia.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>3. twitter.com</h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 535,672,329</em></p><p>Twitter's web design has changed a lot over the years. The 2020 design has minimalized to a simple color scheme that consists of a dominant blue used for main call to actions, and a beautiful set of bluish grays to create a hierarchy of text styles.</p><figure id="w-node-57f2c70343ff-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f26091a846f51452e16_Twitter.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>4. facebook.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 512,517,207</em></p><p>Compared to Twitter, Facebook's color scheme is a bit more complex. It involves many more notifications and vibrant colors taking you from one corner of the UI to the next. It's surprising that Facebook hasn't mimicked more of Youtube's philosophy especially since they too rely on a lot of photography and user generated content.</p><figure id="w-node-d68aa9f10aad-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f313f346a777379f62c_Facebook.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>5. amazon.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 492,468,801</em></p><p>Amazon's web design is heavily anchored by the dark navigation bar with the search box. Since their shopping experience relies on intent to buy, reminding shoppers where to search and how accessible it is is very important for them. Light blues and yellows are used to accent the large boxes of white and bring attention to prime branding and other special deals.</p><figure id="w-node-f1131ed9d6fa-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f3f2a3bf07561ef0472_Amazon.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>6. yelp.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 189,284,057</em></p><p>Yelp's design is similar to Youtube. The wide use of whitespace makes way for the vibrant reds and blues to get the visitor's attention.</p><figure id="w-node-06063004e617-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f477532a80b1402e7de_Yelp.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>7. reddit.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 184,283,420</em></p><p>Reddit is a special one on this list. Since the value of Reddit is that anyone can customize a subreddit to their audience's liking, there is no universal color scheme for Reddit. On the homepage, it resorts to using bluish light grays and white to mark the community board layout.</p><figure id="w-node-bb013a4696fe-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f509fc4fe62dde19dcc_Reddit.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>8. imdb.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 168,686,113</em></p><p>Much like Amazon, IMDB relies on the search for its core experience. A darker color scheme is used all around the website to remind users of the movie going experience. Movie pages have a lighter appearance to give more attention to the blue text links and images.</p><figure id="w-node-af213f7b67ec-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f609508d3d4ce412e39_IMDB.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>9. fandom.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 168,358,254</em></p><p>Of all the websites on this list, Fandom definitely wins the title for most unique set of colors. While teal feels like the brand's most dominant color, the darker teals and bright neon green does a great job in supporting the composition.</p><figure id="w-node-2e0cffbe6628-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f6ad8a527e60c7b240d_Fandom.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>10. pinterest.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 160,008,934</em></p><p>Such a friendly set of colors. Although their user interface sets the expectation for a minimal set of colors like YouTube, they seem to be using muted versions of green, blue and yellow to give the website a splash of vibrancy,</p><figure id="w-node-3df77482884d-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f7347b1322743ea9d15_Pinterest.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>11. tripadvisor.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 107,547,225</em></p><p>Tripadvisor uses the very unique set of light neon colors, marking them separately from the other travel websites. Although the colors by itself can feel jarring in how bright it is, when paired together, the combination seems to work. To balance the eccentric color scheme, the color black is used for the input elements like textboxes and buttons.</p><figure id="w-node-9c75faa2153f-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f7a915325c29b2bcbf8_Tripadvisor.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>12. instagram.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 95,560,034</em></p><p>Instagram takes a page out of YouTube's brand color scheme. To highlight the photographs taken by Instagram users, the user interface uses black and white elements to blend it into the background. The primary colors like blue is reserved for buttons and the range of yellow to pink for their popular stories feature.</p><figure id="w-node-a3e998655c01-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f8366a20f0036a1f59c_Instagram.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>13. walmart.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 94,951,789</em></p><p>As opposed to Amazon, Walmart uses bold colors to highlight specials in a carousel layout. This prioritizes the curated products over the grid on the homepage. Accent colors of yellow is used for the call to action buttons.</p><figure id="w-node-e4385e966679-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f8cbb7b0af4d8921296_Walmart.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>14. craigslist.org<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 86,673,328</em></p><p>Oh the Craigstlist design that everyone loves to hate on. No matter what your opinion is, you have to admit it is very iconic. On a large canvas of white and light gray, a saturated blue is used for links. Orange and light yellow is used to highlight something new in the interface.</p><figure id="w-node-e03387aa1086-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f9766a20f1af5a1f5af_Craigslist.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>15. ebay.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 85,427,056<br></em></p><p>My eyes! Ebay sure does love a very bright set of colors. The large splashes of neon on the website directs your eyes to the different product categories of the marketplace.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			




<p>Scrypt is a slow-by-design <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/01/01/very-basic-intro-to-hash-functions-sha-256-md-5-etc/">hash function</a> or more accurately, a <a href="https://qvault.io/2019/12/30/very-basic-intro-to-key-derivation-functions-argon2-scrypt-etc/">KDF</a> function. Its purpose is to take some input data, and create a fingerprint of that data, but to do it very slowly. A common use-case is to take a password and create an n-bit private key, which is much longer and more secure. Here at <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/dashboard/courses">Qvault</a> we use a similar KDF for securing user passwords.</p>



<p>For example, let’s pretend your password is password1234. By using Scrypt, we can extend that deterministically into a 256-bit key:</p>



<p><strong>password1234 </strong>-&gt; <br>AwEEDA4HCwQFAA8DAwwHDQwPDwUOBwoOCQACAgUJBQ0JAAYNBAMCDQ4JCQgLDwcGDQMDDgMKAQsNBAkLAwsACA==</p>



<p>That long 256-bit key can now be used as a private key to encrypt and decrypt data. For example, it could be the key in an <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/01/02/very-basic-intro-to-aes-256-cipher/">AES-256</a> cipher.</p>



<h2><span id="Why_not_use_the_password_to_encrypt_directly">Why not use the password to encrypt directly?</span>
</h2>



<p>Most encryption algorithms, including AES-256, require that a key of sufficient length is used. By hashing the password, we can derive a longer, more secure, fixed-size key.</p>



<p>Furthermore, using a KDF like Scrypt provides additional benefits over a traditional hash function like <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/07/08/how-sha-2-works-step-by-step-sha-256/">SHA-2</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Computationally expensive and slow</li>
<li>Memory intensive (potentially several gigabytes of RAM is used to execute the hash)</li>
</ul>
<p>Often times <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/02/11/how-do-brute-force-attackers-know-they-found-the-key/">brute-force attackers</a> will try to break encryption by guessing passwords over and over until they get it right. <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/01/02/very-basic-intro-to-aes-256-cipher/">AES-256</a> and SHA-2 are fast, so an attacker would be able to guess many passwords per second. By using a slow hashing function like Scrypt to derive a key, we can force the attacker to waste more resources trying to break in.</p>



<h2><span id="Scrypt_Step-by-Step">Scrypt Step-by-Step</span>
</h2>



<p>Scrypt can be visualized by some psuedo-code:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func Scrypt(
	passphrase, // string of characters to be hashed
	salt,  // random salt
	costFactor, // CPU/Memory cost, must be power of 2
	blockSizeFactor,
	parallelizationFactor, // (1..232-1 * hLen/MFlen)
	desiredKeyLen // Desired key length in bytes
) derivedKey {
	// we'll get to theis
}</code></pre>



<p>Let’s go through the steps of converting those inputs into the desired <code>derivedKey</code></p>



<h3><span id="1_-_Define_Blocksize">1 – Define Blocksize</span>
</h3>



<pre><code lang="go">const blockSize = 128 * blockSizeFactor</code></pre>



<h3><span id="2_-_Generate_Initial_Salt">2 – Generate Initial Salt</span>
</h3>



<p>Scrypt uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2">PBKDF2</a> as a child key-derivation function. We use it to generate an initial salt. PBKDF2 has the following signature:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func PBKDF2(
	prf,
	password,
	salt,
	numIterations,
	desiredKeyLen
) derivedKey {}</code></pre>



<p>We use it as follows:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">const initialSalt = PBKDF2(HMAC-SHA256, passphrase, salt, 1, blockSize * parallelizationFactor)</code></pre>



<h3><span id="3_-_Mix_Salt">3 – Mix Salt</span>
</h3>



<p>Next, we mix the salt. We split <code>initialSalt</code> into <code>splitSalt</code>, which is a 2D array of bytes. Each sub-array contains 1024 bytes</p>



<pre><code lang="go">splitSalt := [][1024]byte(initialSalt)
for i, block := range splitSalt {
	newBlock := roMix(block, costFactor)
	splitSalt[i] = newBlock
}</code></pre>



<p>where <code>roMix</code> is:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func roMix(block, iterations){
	v := []
	x := block
	for i := 0; i &lt; iterations; i++ {
		v[i] = x
		x = blockMix(x)
	}
	for i := 0; i &lt; iterations; i++ {
		j := integerify(x) % iterations
		x = blockMix(x ^ v[j])
	}
	return x
}</code></pre>



<p>Where <code>integerify</code> is defined by <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7914">RFC-7914</a> and <code>blockMix</code> is:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func blockMix(block){
	r := len(block) / 128
	// split block into an array of 2r 64-byte chunks
	chunks := get2r64ByteChunks()

	x := chunks[len(chunks)-1]
	y := []
	for i := 0; i &lt; len(chunks); i++{
		x = salsa20-8(x ^ chunks[i])
		y[i] = x
	}
	return [y[0], y[2], ...y[2r-2], y[1], y[3], ...y[2r-1]]
}</code></pre>



<p>Where <code>salsa20-8</code> is the 8-round version of the algorithm defined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20">here</a>.</p>



<h3><span id="4_-_Finalize_Salt">4 – Finalize Salt</span>
</h3>



<p>Now <code>splitSalt</code> has been mixed in such a computationally exhausting way that we will call it an <code>expensiveSalt</code>. Expensive salt will be a single array of bytes, so we need to concatenate all the subarrays in <code>splitSalt</code>.</p>



<pre><code lang="go">expensiveSalt := append([], splitSalt...)</code></pre>



<h3><span id="5_-_Return_Final_KDF">5 – Return Final KDF</span>
</h3>



<pre><code lang="go">return PBKDF2(HMAC-SHA256, passphrase, expensiveSalt, 1, desiredKeyLen)</code></pre>



<p>The final pseudocode for our top level function is as follows:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func Scrypt(
	passphrase, // string of characters to be hashed
	salt,  // random salt
	costFactor, // CPU/Memory cost, must be power of 2
	blockSizeFactor,
	parallelizationFactor, // (1..232-1 * hLen/MFlen)
	desiredKeyLen // Desired key length in bytes
) derivedKey {
	const blockSize = 128 * blockSizeFactor

	const initialSalt = PBKDF2(HMAC-SHA256, passphrase, salt, 1, blockSize * parallelizationFactor)

	splitSalt := [][1024]byte(initialSalt)
	for i, block := range splitSalt {
		newBlock := roMix(block, costFactor)
		splitSalt[i] = newBlock
	}

	expensiveSalt := append([], splitSalt...)

	return PBKDF2(HMAC-SHA256, passphrase, expensiveSalt, 1, desiredKeyLen)
}</code></pre>



<p>Or, if you prefer, the pseudocode as defined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt">Wikipedia</a>:</p>



<pre><code lang="">Function scrypt
   Inputs:
      Passphrase:                Bytes    string of characters to be hashed
      Salt:                      Bytes    random salt
      CostFactor (N):            Integer  CPU/memory cost parameter - Must be a power of 2 (e.g. 1024)
      BlockSizeFactor (r):       Integer  blocksize parameter (8 is commonly used)
      ParallelizationFactor (p): Integer  Parallelization parameter. (1..232-1 * hLen/MFlen)
      DesiredKeyLen:             Integer  Desired key length in bytes
   Output:
      DerivedKey:                Bytes    array of bytes, DesiredKeyLen long

   Step 1. Generate expensive salt
   blockSize ← 128*BlockSizeFactor  //Length (in bytes) of the SMix mixing function output (e.g. 128*8 = 1024 bytes)

   Use PBKDF2 to generate initial 128*BlockSizeFactor*p bytes of data (e.g. 128*8*3 = 3072 bytes)
   Treat the result as an array of p elements, each entry being blocksize bytes (e.g. 3 elements, each 1024 bytes)
   [B0...Bp−1] ← PBKDF2HMAC-SHA256(Passphrase, Salt, 1, blockSize*ParallelizationFactor)

   Mix each block in B Costfactor times using ROMix function (each block can be mixed in parallel)
   for i ← 0 to p-1 do
      Bi ← ROMix(Bi, CostFactor)

   All the elements of B is our new "expensive" salt
   expensiveSalt ← B0∥B1∥B2∥ ... ∥Bp-1  //where ∥ is concatenation
 
   Step 2. Use PBKDF2 to generate the desired number of bytes, but using the expensive salt we just generated
   return PBKDF2HMAC-SHA256(Passphrase, expensiveSalt, 1, DesiredKeyLen);</code></pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the past we have <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-02-03-mapping-income-inequality-using-irs-soi-data/">blogged</a> about the IRS Sources of Income (SOI) data that we harvested and published as a <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/Liquidata/irs-soi/data/master">Dolt database</a>. We presented a compelling visualization that was relatively straightforward to create using that database. It was straightforward to create because of the work that went into transforming disparate and unruly files to a coherently presented database. Recently we <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-07-13-usps-crosswalk-database-on-dolthub/">highlighted</a> a dataset of USPS Crosswalk mappings that are widely used into academic and commercial settings to traverse between ZIP code and other geographic statistical entities, for example counties. They are also available as a <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-07-13-usps-crosswalk-database-on-dolthub/">Dolt database</a>. Finally just today we published US Census Bureau <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/Liquidata/census-population-estimates">population estimates</a> by county, indexed on FIPS code going back to 2010.</p>
<p>One of the most impressive features of using Dolt and DoltHub together is how elegant they make acquiring these datasets in your local environment. There is no need to sign up, and we aren't tying you to a compute environment we will try and charge you for. They simply enable distribution of datasets along with a SQL interface. Dolt runs wherever you need it to run. Users can skip downloading, parsing, and cleaning collections of files, and begin analyzing the data immediately.</p>
<p>In this post we show how these features make it easy to combine a specifically interesting dataset, the IRS SOI data, with generally useful datasets, the USPS Crosswalk data and county level population estimates, to essentially toggle the spatial resolution of the IRS data. We conclude by advocating for the concept of a data dependency delivered as a "drop in" resource. The benefit of this model is for companies and individuals that depend on data, but do not see at as a core competency, to focus on what they do best. This is very much how open source software works.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>To work through this locally you will need to get a copy of Dolt, which on <code>*nix</code> systems can be done with a single command, and we have documentation on the full range of installation options <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/docs/tutorials/installation/#dolt">here</a>:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>$ sudo bash -c 'curl -L https://github.com/liquidata-inc/dolt/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sudo bash'</code></pre></div>
<p>For the analysis component, you will need Doltpy, which has all other libraries imported in the sample code as a dependency. It's available on PyPi:</p>

<p>For the visualization you will need several Python libraries, but they can easily be installed as follows:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>pip install plotly plotly-geo geopandas==0.3.0  pyshp==1.2.10</code></pre></div>
<p>Let's move onto to acquiring data.</p>
<h2>Acquiring data</h2>
<p>Acquiring data with Dolt is easy. Let's set up a home for our analysis:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>$ mkdir -p ~/irs-analysis/dolt-dbs &amp;&amp; cd irs-analysis/dolt-dbs
$ dolt clone Liquidata/irs-soi
cloning https://doltremoteapi.dolthub.com/Liquidata/irs-soi
291,637 of 291,637 chunks complete. 0 chunks being downloaded currently.
$ dolt clone Liquidata/usps-crosswalk-data
cloning https://doltremoteapi.dolthub.com/Liquidata/usps-crosswalk-data
210,458 of 210,458 chunks complete. 0 chunks being downloaded currently.
$  dolt clone Liquidata/census-population-estimates
cloning https://doltremoteapi.dolthub.com/Liquidata/census-population-estimates
82 of 82 chunks complete. 0 chunks being downloaded currently.</code></pre></div>
<p>We now have two Dolt databases in <code>~/irs-analysis/dolt-dbs</code>, and we can launch the Dolt SQL shell in with the <code>--multi-db-dir</code> switch to make load them both into our SQL environment:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>$ ls -ltr
total 0
drwxr-xr-x  12 oscarbatori  staff  384 Jul 23 18:07 irs-soi
drwxr-xr-x   6 oscarbatori  staff  192 Jul 23 21:11 usps-crosswalk-data
$ dolt sql --multi-db-dir .
~/Documents/irs-analysis/dolt-dbs|&gt;&gt;  dolt sql --multi-db-dir .
# Welcome to the DoltSQL shell.
# Statements must be terminated with ';'.
# "exit" or "quit" (or Ctrl-D) to exit.
&gt; show databases;
+-----------------------------+
| Database                    |

| census_population_estimates |
| information_schema          |
| irs_soi                     |
| usps_crosswalk_data         |
+-----------------------------+</code></pre></div>
<p>We have now acquired two datasets, both maintained by DoltHub. We can use <code>dolt pull</code> to subscribe to changes to the datasets, making any derivative analysis we create "live."</p>
<h2>The Data</h2>
<p>We will be working with adjusted gross income by ZIP code, and then using the USPS Crosswalk data and county population estiamtes to translate that to county level per capita income. This works because the USPS publishes mappings from ZIP codes to various geographical statistical entities identified by FIPS code, mappings that we completely capture (across time and mapping pairs). The data includes "ratios" of residential and business addresses for pairings that are not one to one. For example a ZIP code and straddle county lines, and vice versa, and so these ratios provide a mechanism for us approximate how much of a given aggregate to apportion when we perform the mapping.</p>
<p>Let's take a peek at the data to see how it looks in practice:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>&gt; use irs_soi;

<p>We can see here a bunch of ZIP codes that are completely contained within counties. These ZIP codes contain only business addresses. That's not always the cade. Let's step into Python and do some analysis.</p>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>We saw earlier how easy it was to acquire the data from DoltHub using Dolt. The USPS Crosswalk dataset took around 450 files to build, each of them Excel files. So running a single command was a pretty big time saving, even over the narrow subset of the data we are interested in, around 50 files. Loading them into Dolt also required removing some corrupt data, so that work is now embedded in the database, and amortized over everyone that takes advantage of it.</p>
<p>This simple acquisition model is only fraction of the benefit of acquiring data via Dolt and DoltHub. The balance comes from the SQL interface that arrives with the data. We don't need to parse files, we can just use SQL's elegant declarative syntax to describe the data we are interested in, and then let the query engine deliver it to our preferred interface, in this case Python.</p>
<p>The goal of our analysis is to translate ZIP code level income data to the county level, so let's grab each dataset, and then combine them:</p>

<h2><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadavlev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nadav Lev</a> is far from your average VP of R&amp;D</strong></h2>

<p>His first “job” writing code was in the elite Israeli military intelligence agency <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_8200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unit 8200</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similar in function to the United States NSA, 8200 has been called&nbsp; “the foremost technical intelligence agency in the world.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every Israeli serves in the military after high school. Only a select few get into 8200.</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>I’ve been working with Nadav for about 15 months. I knew right away he was different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His brain moves fast and his speech is efficient – even when speaking with me in English which is his second language. He’s tough like you would expect from a military man. But also warm. After his team had been using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://linearb.io/" target="_blank">LinearB</a> for a few months, he would ask me <em>“do you want this feedback the Israeli way or the American way?”</em> I’m pretty sure he reserves the “Israeli way” for people he trusts so I chose to take it as a compliment 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p>His approach to building elite dev teams is different too. He’s not afraid to run his own playbook.</p>







<h3><strong>“Elite” software development team defined&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Before we get into Nadav’s leadership and team building secrets, it helps to understand how he thinks about elite teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Nadav’s top 6 not-so-obvious characteristics of an elite dev team:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>The team exhausts themselves to find the best solution to problems, not just any solution</li><li>“Automation-first” is built into the culture and day-to-day decision making of everything</li><li>Important ideas and steps get documented with a high level of quality and reverence&nbsp;</li><li>Discussions are mostly about the future, sometimes about the present, and rarely about past&nbsp;</li><li>When mistakes are made the first instinct is to create new process (not accuse)&nbsp;</li><li>They <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://linearb.io/blog/how-to-introduce-data-driven-culture-to-your-dev-team/" target="_blank">align engineering metrics to business goals</a>&nbsp;</li></ul>



<figure><blockquote><p>His #1 characteristic of a great team: <strong>They make other teams around them better.&nbsp;</strong></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Nadav played basketball growing up. He talks about great dev teams the way basketball analysts describe great point guards. <em>“Their play and their leadership make everyone around them better.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><em>Steph, Kemba, and Dame are three of the best.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>“It’s also important to look at the elite team through the eyes of the developer.”</em> Nadav said. <em>“Not everyone knows how it feels.” </em>Nadav pointed out some not-so-obvious things that feel differently about being a member of an elite dev team:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>You can be yourself and admit your mistakes freely without fear&nbsp;</li><li>It feels like everyone on the team is smarter than you – in a good way</li><li>Teammates behave the same to each other when the manager is not around</li><li>Teammates are regularly solving problems for you before you know you have one</li><li>Every time CI is not perfectly green, by the time you notice, someone is already fixing it</li></ul>







<h3><strong>Journey from top secret to top start-up</strong></h3>



<figure><p><strong>ALERT: </strong>Nadav’s story and secrets outline an actionable playbook for the following audiences:&nbsp;<br><strong>➜</strong> Developers looking for the path to get <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://linearb.io/blog/promoted-from-dev-to-team-lead-8-things-they-didnt-tell-me/" target="_blank">promoted to team lead</a><br><strong>➜</strong> Engineering leaders getting ready to scale up their existing team<br><strong>➜</strong> Engineering leaders coming in to build a new team from scratch<br><strong>➜</strong> Dev teams looking to advance from good to great</p></figure>



<p>Today, Nadav is Vice President of Research &amp; Development for the hot security start-up <a href="https://www.axonius.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Axonius</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was curious about his journey to get there so I asked him about his first project in 8200. He gave me a wry smile and said <em>“<strong>classified</strong>.”</em> It involved writing code and he was by himself. That’s all he could tell me without killing me 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>It must have gone well because after that first project he got to choose what he wanted to work on next and they assigned a second person to help him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It continued like that for a while. He kept impressing his bosses with cool, top secret tech. They kept assigning more people to help him on his next project.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“I started almost every team I was on but was never the formal leader. I got offers to be a team lead but I refused. <strong>I was having too much fun doing cool, hands-on shit</strong>.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Why did he keep moving from project to project? If the project went well, why not stay on to maintain it? <em>“<strong>Builders gotta build</strong>.<strong>”</strong></em>  Yes. They surely do 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nadav stayed with his unit for 6 years – double the required term of 3 years. During that time he met <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deansysman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dean Sysman</a>. Later, when Dean was CTO of a security start-up called Cymmetria, he recruited him to join.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“The final project I started in the army eventually had 50 people working on it. I felt great about what I accomplished and I was ready for a different challenge.”</em> It was time to build something new. He joined Cymmetria as senior developer.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Early on, I figured out that while we have awesome technologists, probably among the brightest in the world, <strong>no one knew how to manage development, release, and write good code. So I took charge</strong>.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sound familiar? This time when Nadav was offered the role of team lead he took it. <em>“The change was minimal. I was already documenting all of our sprint processes, leading our ceremonies, our testing approach… doing it de facto.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I asked if he liked being a lead, his eyes lit up and he got closer to the camera.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>He liked it. They raised series A funding and he scaled the dev team from 2 to 10. After three years they had built every feature on their wish list and the company was succeeding. Nadav wanted a new project and decided it was time to move on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eventually, he got in touch with Dean Sysman again who was now CEO of a new security start-up called Axonius. Dean didn’t want Nadav to be a dev or team lead. He wanted him to be his VP of R&amp;D.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Things moved even faster this time. In the 24 months after Nadav joined, Axonius exploded:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>The number of people in Axonius grew by 5X</li><li>Nadav scaled the number of people in R&amp;D by 5X</li><li>They won the <a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/about/press-releases/axonius-named-most-innovative-startup-at-2019-rsa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coveted RSAC most innovative start-up award</a></li><li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/axonius-nabs-58m-for-its-cybersecurity-focused-network-asset-management-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">They raised a whopping $95 million dollars</a> from top-tier investors&nbsp;</li></ul>







<h2><strong>7 secrets from 8200 for building elite dev teams</strong></h2>



<p>Naturally, after hearing this impressive story, I asked Nadav what he learned on the journey. Many of his fundamental beliefs for building and scaling teams trace back to his days in 8200.</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>**Name Redacted**, Captain Nadav Lev, and **Name Redacted**</figcaption></figure>







<h3><strong>Secret #1: Learn to lead without a mandate or official title&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Leading people without title or authority…&nbsp; Easy to say. Incredibly hard to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“I had to learn to get developers to do what I think was right without formal authority over them.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>So how exactly does he do it?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Nadav explains indirect leadership and how it can help you build teams and get promoted.</em></strong></p>



<iframe width="560" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HjI5uUuV6Qw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>







<h3><strong>Secret #2: “If you can’t stand the heat then don’t get into the kitchen.”&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Part of leading, especially when you don’t have the title, is putting in the work. <em>“Initially, at Cymmetria, I was doing my job plus creating process documents, writing training guides, building automation, helping everyone… It worked for me in the army so I did it again.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Isn’t that a lot of hours? I asked.<strong> </strong><em>“If you can’t stand the heat then don’t get into the kitchen.”</em></p>



<p>Ladies and gentlemen, that was Nadav giving it to me the “Israeli way” 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Nadav shares the truth about how much time indirect leadership takes.</em></strong></p>



<iframe width="560" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NaJcEtRYdVI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>







<h3><strong>Secret #3: The smarter the person, the more “why” matters&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>According to Nadav <em>“It’s easier to influence average employees. They’re more likely to follow your requests on face value. Your best people are actually harder to manage because they will push back if they don’t understand why you’re asking them to do something.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Nadav explains how to manage highly intelligent people using “why”</em></strong></p>



<iframe width="560" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yH9OBaGysZ4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>







<h3><strong>Secret #4: Become great at every job yourself before you hire anyone&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p><em>“I had a boss in the army tell me ‘if you want to be the best leader you can be, you must know the job of every person you work with, better than that person.”</em></p>



<p><em>“I was furious with this because it contradicted every leadership idea I knew of.”</em> I get it. I can think of about eight Harvard Business Review articles I’ve read that might disagree.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But over time Nadav saw the merit in this approach. Remember, your best employees will push back until they know why 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nadav explains <em>“In order to work with people effectively you have to understand them completely. In order to understand them, you have to understand their job. What are their difficulties? What are they trying to achieve? How are they being measured? How do they perceive you? If you walk a mile in their shoes, you will find that understanding them becomes much easier.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Now I understand. It’s not about control. It’s about empathy. It also doesn’t mean you have to DO every job better than the people that work for you. You just have to KNOW every job better. Like a coach of a basketball team. They understand what great looks like even if they never played at a high level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Nadav started at Axonius, he took this idea to the extreme, and started his tenure there in the most contrarian way I can imagine.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“My plan was to spend my first few weeks meeting everyone, learning, getting comfortable with the people. However, I realized that if I do that, I won’t have the time then to build all the processes and infrastructure we need. So I discarded my initial plan and put my heart and soul into personally building everything our team needed to succeed.”</em> </p>



<p>In two weeks he:</p>

<p>One of the most fundamental reasons why I believe that the value of Bitcoin will continue to appreciate is because it is much easier for people to start believing in it than it is for people to stop.</p>



<p>Bitcoin believers tend to believe in it strongly and sometimes even irrationally. For many people, it is like a religion. For many more, Bitcoin has a continuous influence on their way of life not dissimilar to other modern systems of belief such as climate change and veganism. To varying degrees, Bitcoin believers will weather potentially any storm (decreases in its value, attacks in the media, etc.). Qualitatively, Bitcoin believers are quite strong.</p>



<p>Quantitatively, outside of Bitcoin’s still relatively small base of believers, there are many more people who do not sufficiently understand Bitcoin than there are people who do understand it but do not believe in it. If the last decade is any indication, a certain and probably high percentage of those who do not yet understand Bitcoin will quickly and easily come to believe in it once they do.</p>



<p>Having observed these dynamics of the Bitcoin belief system, I am near certain that non-owners are coming to believe in Bitcoin faster than owners are losing their belief. In other words, the outside population is buying into Bitcoin faster than than the inside population is selling out. This trend seems poised to continue indefinitely. As long as it does, so will the appreciation of Bitcoin’s value due to the increasing demand for the limited and finite supply.</p>



<p>One can think of Bitcoin as having a natural network effect where the owner population is expanding exponentially in comparison with an extremely low churn rate among its existing owners. It is this sort of network effect that has given rise to the most valuable companies of our time. Bitcoin is not a company but it stands to benefit just the same.</p>



<p>Quants can do all the fancy analysis they want but the simple fact of the matter is that Bitcoin is worth nothing without people’s belief in it. If people stop believing in Bitcoin, its value will plummet. If more people start believing in Bitcoin, its value will continue to appreciate. Because Bitcoin’s value is sustained solely by people’s belief in it, it seems to me that any prudent investor who makes a bullish case for Bitcoin should seek to support this most basic underlying assumption which says that the overall belief in Bitcoin is growing and will continue to grow. That is the assumption which I have sought to support with this piece.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In closing, it is worth stating clearly that money has no real value other than that which people believe it does. As long as people believe Bitcoin is valuable, it will be. Today it seems evident that Bitcoin believers are quickly accumulating and scarcely abandoning the asset. So long as this continues to be the case, and it seems more probable that not that it will, Bitcoin’s value will rise.</p>

    <div>
        <p>Computers are cold and heartless. They don't lie, and they don't care if you scream and swear at them. You can abuse them all day long, and they'll still efficiently flip bits and push pixels.</p><p>But... people aren't. Behind every piece of software, there's at least one human. Who has a heart, and who cares what you think. Who has hopes, and dreams, and fears. Who feels.</p><p>This is something I've been wanting to write in one form or another for quite a while now, and I've been rewriting this post for a little too long.</p><p>Sometimes it seems like we forget about the humans. Either we forget that there's a human behind the software we build, or we forget that we're shipping software <em>for people</em>. </p><p>It seems to me that more and more, especially recently, nobody can share their work or their ideas without someone stepping in and criticising their ideas. Maybe they could have written it in a language that's faster, uses less memory, <em>something about bloat or native code.</em> Maybe it doesn't have a feature that another project does, so why the hell should anyone use it? &nbsp;</p><p>I remember earlier in my career, every time I opened a PR, I'd have a small feeling of anxiety. Was it good enough? What if I'm bad at programming? Would people hate it? What if I'm wrong? Fear of failure is one of the biggest obstacles to success, and all too often it stops people from sharing or achieving what they could. The feeling of "this isn't good enough to share" goes along with that.</p><p>Even while writing this, I couldn't help but feel like it isn't quite perfect, isn't quite good enough to share. But that's the point of my blog; I want to make myself put things out there, even if they're not 100%. </p><p>We should feel like it's ok to share work that isn't finished, that doesn't use the fastest, cleanest, most optimal approach. If I've made something for fun and want to share it, why not? If it doesn't use the technology you prefer, and you haven't paid me to build it, why would you shit all over someone else's work?</p><p>Better yet. If you care that much, make your own. Instead of pulling down something of someone else's', build your own thing up.</p><p>To some degree I understand people not being satisfied with professional software, that they have paid for, and that doesn't meet their expectations. But if it's open source, free, and available for all? Why would you ever complain about that? If it's not for you, just... move on.</p><p>Friends of mine won't share their blog posts to HN, Reddit, etc, because they feel like their words aren't good enough. Or like people there are going to tear them apart. Or because they might have made a small mistake somewhere.</p><p>The main thing I can see fuelling so many arguments is an inherent <em>need</em> to be right. It's been written about so many times before, but for some reason people can't bear the idea that <strong><a href="https://xkcd.com/386/">someone on the internet is wrong</a></strong>. </p><p>Except, when it comes to the preferences of which tools or technology someone wants to build something with, in their own time, can you really be wrong? </p><p>There's a stereotype held about people in tech, that we're all that super nerdy person who struggles socially, can't talk to people, and hide all day in the basement programming. And that somehow, this is excusable if you're <em>really good </em>at writing code. But is it? If you're writing code for people to use, and you're working on it with people, not having people skills isn't really an option. Much like technical skills, it isn't an innate quality - you can work on improving your people skills, much like you can your tech skills.</p><p>If you take anything at all from my post, hopefully it's this; if you really must say something, and you really feel like someone made the wrong choice, maybe think about your phrasing. Eg</p><blockquote>Hey! Nice work. I was curious though, why'd you pick &lt;tech&gt; over &lt;other tech&gt;?</blockquote><p>vs</p><blockquote>Ugh, this would be so much better if it just used &lt;tech&gt;. I hate the way modern tech is going</blockquote><p>Let's make our industry a much more friendly and welcoming place 💖</p>

    <p>(Live thread, will be updated with new visuals and polish over the next few days. Join <a href="http://eepurl.com/gl0BHL">the mailing list</a> to get updated when completed)</p>

<p>A trained language model generates text.</p>

<p>We can optionally pass it some text as input, which influences its output.</p>

<p>The output is generated from what the model “learned” during its training period where it scanned vast amounts of text.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/01-gpt3-language-model-overview.gif">
  <br>

</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Training is the process of exposing the model to lots of text. That process has been completed. All the experiments you see now are from that one trained model. It was estimated to cost 355 GPU years and cost $4.6m.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/02-gpt3-training-language-model.gif">
  <br>

</p>

<p>The dataset of 300 billion tokens of text is used to generate training examples for the model. For example, these are three training examples generated from the one sentence at the top.</p>

<p>You can see how you can slide a window across all the text and make lots of examples.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/gpt3-training-examples-sliding-window.png">
  <br>

</p>

<p>The model is presented with an example. We only show it the features and ask it to predict the next word.</p>

<p>The model’s prediction will be wrong. We calculate the error in its prediction and update the model so next time it makes a better prediction.</p>

<p>Repeat millions of times</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/03-gpt3-training-step-back-prop.gif">
  <br>

</p>

<p>Now let’s look at these same steps with a bit more detail.</p>

<p>GPT3 actually generates output one token at a time (let’s assume a token is a word for now).</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/04-gpt3-generate-tokens-output.gif">
  <br>

</p>

<p>Please note: This is a description of how GPT-3 works and not a discussion of what is novel about it (which is mainly the ridiculously large scale). The architecture is a transformer decoder model based on this paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.10198.pdf</p>

<p>GPT3 is MASSIVE. It encodes what it learns from training in 175 billion numbers (called parameters). These numbers are used to calculate which token to generate at each run.</p>

<p>The untrained model starts with random parameters. Training finds values that lead to better predictions.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/gpt3-parameters-weights.png">
  <br>

</p>

<p>These numbers are part of hundreds of matrices inside the model. Prediction is mostly a lot of matrix multiplication.</p>

<p>In my <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=mSTCzNgDJy4">Intro to AI on YouTube</a>, I showed a simple ML model with one parameter. A good start to unpack this 175B monstrosity.</p>

<p>To shed light on how these parameters are distributed and used, we’ll need to open the model and look inside.</p>

<p>GPT3 is 2048 tokens wide. That is its “context window”. That means it has 2048 tracks along which tokens are processed.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/05-gpt3-generate-output-context-window.gif">
  <br>

</p>

<p>Let’s follow the purple track. How does a system process the word “robotics” and produce “A”?</p>

<p>High-level steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Convert the word to <a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-word2vec/">a vector (list of numbers) representing the word</a></li>
  <li>Compute prediction</li>
  <li>Convert resulting vector to word</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/06-gpt3-embedding.gif">
  <br>

</p>

<p>The important calculations of the GPT3 occur inside its stack of 96 transformer decoder layers.</p>

<p>See all these layers? This is the “depth” in “deep learning”.</p>

<p>Each of these layers has its own 1.8B parameter to make its calculations. That is where the “magic” happens. This is a high-level view of that process:</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/07-gpt3-processing-transformer-blocks.gif">
  <br>

</p>

<p>You can see a detailed explanation of everything inside the decoder in my blog post <a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-gpt2/">The Illustrated GPT2</a>.</p>

<p>The difference with GPT3 is the alternating dense and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.10509.pdf">sparse self-attention layers</a>.</p>

<p>This is an X-ray of an input and response (“Okay human”) within GPT3. Notice how every token flows through the entire layer stack. We don’t care about the output of the first words. When the input is done, we start caring about the output. We feed every word back into the model.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/08-gpt3-tokens-transformer-blocks.gif">
  <br>

</p>

<p>In the React code generation example (https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1284421499915403264), the description would be the input prompt (in green), in addition to a couple of examples of description=&gt;code, I believe. And the react code would be generated like the pink tokens here token after token.</p>

<p>My assumption is that the priming examples and the description are appended as input, with specific tokens separating examples and the results. Then fed into the model.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/09-gpt3-generating-react-code-example.gif">
  <br>

</p>

<p>It’s impressive that this works like this. Because you just wait until fine-tuning is rolled out for the GPT3. The possibilities will be even more amazing.</p>

<p>Fine-tuning actually updates the model’s weights to make the model better at a certain task.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/10-gpt3-fine-tuning.gif">

July 27, 2020 | https://vadimdemedes.com/posts/ink-3 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://vadimdemedes.com/posts/ink-3">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><a href="http://term.ink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ink 3</a> is available today.
Ink lets you build command-line apps using React and have fun while doing so too.</p><p>Ink is a special project to me, because it's been surreal to watch how a tiny experiment grew into a full-featured command-line UI toolkit that's used by <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gatsby</a>, <a href="https://parceljs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parcel</a>, <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yarn</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terraform</a>, <a href="https://node-tap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tap</a>, <a href="https://www.prisma.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prisma</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-react/tree/master/scripts/splash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shopify</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/kyt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#whos-using-ink" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many others</a>.
I had no idea it had such a great future when I was just playing with React trying to make it render things to a string and output it in the terminal.</p><p>I'm excited to share all the updates with you, so let's dive right in to see what Ink 3 has to offer.</p><p>While it's not so much of a feature, I think it deserves a top spot.
People loved using React to declaratively build UIs for their command-line apps, but sometimes it ended up hurting their end performance.
For example, <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gatsby</a> noticed their build process slowed down, which is obviously not the tradeoff I want Ink's users to accept.</p><p>Ink 3 got rid of quite a few rendering bugs and in some cases I observed a 2x performance improvement when there's a high frequency of re-renders.
Text rendering and the whole support for Flexbox was rethinked from the ground up and rewritten.
It's also much simpler than it was before, which makes issues easier to debug, reproduce and solve.</p><p>Previous version of Ink had multiple hacky workarounds for various layout issues, so it didn't always render what you would expect.
Ink 3 should be a significant improvement in that area.</p><p>Previously you had to use a separate <code>&lt;Color&gt;</code> component for applying color to text.

Think of <code>&lt;Static&gt;</code> as a terminal-specific implementation for a <a href="http://www.reactvirtualized.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">virtual list</a> technique, where only necessary items are rendered.
<code>&lt;Static&gt;</code> renders all new items above the rest of your UI permanently, which means you can't update them once they are displayed.
This makes <code>&lt;Static&gt;</code> a perfect candidate for tools like Jest, where hundreds of completed tests could need to be logged.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Static</span><span> </span><span>items</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>[</span><span>'Test #1'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>'Test #2'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>'Test #3'</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  </span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>test</span><span>,</span><span> index</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span> </span><span>key</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>index</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>color</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>green</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>      Completed </span><span>{</span><span>test</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Static</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre></div><p>In Ink 3, <code>&lt;Static&gt;</code> is almost twice as performant as it was before and API has been simplified to match libraries like <a href="https://github.com/clauderic/react-tiny-virtual-list" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">react-tiny-virtual-list</a>.</p><p>Here's an example of a UI similar to Jest, where completed tests are rendered using <code>&lt;Static&gt;</code>.</p><video src="https://vadimdemedes.com/ink-3/static.mp4" muted="" autoplay="" loop="" playsinline="" width="500"></video><p>Learn more about <a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#static" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>&lt;Static&gt;</code> component</a>.</p><p>Yes, you read that right.
You can use React Devtools to inspect the output of your Ink app.
The magical bit is that you can actually change the props of any component and see your CLI update on the fly without having to restart it.</p><p><img src="https://vadimdemedes.com/ink-3/devtools.jpg" alt="Integration with React Devtools"><span>Integration with React Devtools</span></p><p>You don't need to make any changes to support it, just set <code>DEV=true</code> environment variable and open Devtools:</p><div><pre>$ DEV=true node examples/counter
$ npx react-devtools
</pre></div><p>When one of your components throws an error, React displays a quite verbose error message to the console and a long stack trace.
Most often that stack trace isn't super useful, because it points to React internals.</p><p>Ink 3 offers a simpler and cleaner solution to this problem by defining a global React <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">error boundary</a> and rendering a beautiful overview of the error.</p><p><img src="https://vadimdemedes.com/ink-3/errors.jpg" alt="Error handler UI"><span>Error handler UI</span></p><p>To improve developer UX further, Ink 3 intercepts calls to <code>console.log</code>, <code>console.error</code> and other methods to ensure logs are displayed correctly above your app's UI and not interfere with each other.
This is necessary, because Ink re-renders your UI all the time, which can overwrite the output from <code>console.log</code>.</p><p>If your app has more than one user input displayed at once, it can become tricky to detect which input has the focus and should receive data.
To make this easier, Ink offers two new React hooks:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#usefocusoptions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>useFocus</code></a> - Receive focus.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#usefocusmanager" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>useFocusManager</code></a> - Manage focus programmatically.</li></ul><p>When component calls <code>useFocus</code> hook, it notifies Ink that there's a new focusable component in the UI.
Each time user presses Tab, Ink is going to pass focus to the next focusable component in the queue.</p><div><pre><p><span>1 </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>First</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2 </span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>isFocused</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>useFocus</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>3 </span><span></span></p><p><span>4 </span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>5 </span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>6 </span><span>      </span><span>{</span><span>isFocused </span><span>?</span><span> </span><span>'First item is focused'</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'First item is not focused'</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>7 </span><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>8 </span><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>9 </span><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>Second</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>isFocused</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>useFocus</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span></span></p><p><span>14</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>15</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>16</span><span>      </span><span>{</span><span>isFocused </span><span>?</span><span> </span><span>'Second item is focused'</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'Second item is not focused'</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>17</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>18</span><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>19</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>20</span><span></span></p><p><span>21</span><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>Example</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>22</span><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>23</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>First</span><span> </span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>24</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Second</span><span> </span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>25</span><span>  </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>26</span><span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div><p>In the example above, as user presses Tab, focus will be passed back and forth between <code>First</code> and <code>Second</code> components.</p><p>When your app needs to manage focus manually, without waiting on user input, you can use <code>useFocusManager</code> hook.

Streaming is undoubtedly the future of entertainment.</p><p>But there is one problem — the problem I refer to as <strong>The Entertainment Loop</strong>. To understand the problem, we have to understand how Netflix (and similar services) make money. It's actually fairly simple.</p><h2 id="how-making-money-works-in-the-21st-century">How Making Money Works in the 21st Century</h2><p>In just one single word: Subscription. For a small monthly fee you, as a company, provide a good service to your customer. This has two main advantages over the old school "pay once and get something" sales tactic:</p><ol><li>Due to the relatively small fee you are able to reach a large customer audience in comparison to a high (one-time)-fee.</li><li>If you, as a company, are able to successfully bind the paying customer to your service, the monthly compounding fee outgrows the large "one-time-fee" that you could've charged instead.</li></ol><p>It is important to understand these two advantages and why companies decide for a monthly subscription business instead of a one-time-fee business. There are additional advantages in the subscription-based model, but we'll keep it simple for now.</p><p>These two advantages are the key to Netflix success. That's the good (probably awesome) part of the story. But here comes the story: These two advantages <strong>will cause damage </strong>to your company in the future.</p><p>To understand why, we'll have to understand, how Netflix makes money.</p><h2 id="how-netflix-makes-money">How Netflix Makes Money</h2><p>Netflix makes money by selling monthly subscriptions in exchange for unlimited movies and tv &nbsp;on their platform. That's it. It's that simple.</p><p>Let's think about the service in exchange for the monthly fee, to understand the problem: Unlimited streaming of movies and tv series.</p><p>Netflix main goal is to make the user stay and keep paying. For reach that ultimate goal, Netflix has to deliver value to the user. Every month — or he will leave and stop paying the monthly fee. That's why Netflix has to keep pushing new content for every users' own (movie-)taste. Once the user doesn't receive any new value from Netflix, he will stop paying for the service. And Netflix only way to provide value is to deliver movies and tv-series.</p><p>I'm pretty sure that you understood this, but let me try to clarify (and simplify) it with a flow chart:</p><figure><img src="https://jdstaerk.de/content/images/2020/07/Entertainment-Loop-1.png" alt=""></figure><p>Broken down to one line: <strong>Netflix will not earn any money, if they don't add new content.</strong></p><h2 id="how-netflix-can-solve-this-problem-and-why-it-isn-t-easy">How Netflix can solve this problem and why it isn't easy</h2><p>Netflix can solve this problem by adding new content (surprise!). But they will encounter a second problem, if they keep adding content: Costs.</p><p>Let's think it through. The loop goes like this:</p><ol><li>Netflix adds content</li><li>Costs increase</li><li>New (paying) subscribers join because of the new content</li><li>Existing subscribers are happy and keep paying</li><li>Newly added content gets old and boring</li><li>Less new (paying) subscribers</li><li>Existing subscribers get bored and start leaving</li><li>Netflix has to add new content</li><li>Go to #1</li></ol><p>That is the Entertainment Loop. And it is nearly impossible to break out of it.</p><p>And this is just the start of the problem. The key here is, that Netflix has to add more and more new content to make existing customers happy. But they not only need the existing customers, they will need new customers to cover the increasing costs. And the costs will increase because, you might already guess it, Netflix has to deliver value (content) to the existing customers to make them stay (and keep them happy).</p><p>But the number of new (paying) subscribers isn't increasing from month to month. It will flatten in decline. Reason for that is, that the number of potential new customers is finite. There are not (!) unlimited new possible subscriber.</p><p>The real trouble starts once Netflix approaches the limit of adding new subscribers. New and fresh money stops floating in like the year before, but the expectations for new value (new content) of the existing customers is not declining — it is staying at least the same or the expectation will even increase.</p><p>So Netflix will have to deliver even more new value in form of content like movies and tv series. And that increases the costs — again. And now Netflix is in a situation, where the costs keep increasing (or staying the same) but the money they earn from paying subscribers will not increase that much. And that is the Entertainment Loop.</p><h2 id="first-counterargument-against-this">First counterargument against this</h2><p>Actually, do the costs keep increasing? You might deny this question. Each month, Netflix need more or less the same amount of new movies and tv series to keep the subscribers happy and paying. So the costs stay more or less the same, don't they? The answer is yes... but actually, no.</p><p>The costs keep increasing. And that's why:</p><p>First of, the expectations for new content keeps increasing. That makes the production more expensive.</p><p>Second, Netflix' new subscribes are not <em>mainstream</em> subscribers. The "normal" subscriber who likes mainstream movies and tv series has already subscribed to Netflix. Netflix gains more and more subscribers who want to the <em>non-mainstream</em> content. That keeps increasing the costs as Netflix has to produce more and more of the <em>non-mainstream </em>content.</p><p>That keeps the costs increasing.</p><p>Of course, if a new subscriber joins, he'll be happy for some time, because he can watch all the content that Netflix added over the time when he wasn't a subscriber. But at some point, he'll run out of existing content to consume. Then Netflix has to deliver new content, to keep him happy and subscribing.</p><h2 id="second-counterargument-against-this">Second counterargument against this</h2><p>Netflix could just increase its prices for a subscription step by step. Increasing the costs, by, let's say 10%, would increase Netflix revenue immediately. And a 10% price increase wouldn't hurt the user.</p><p>Problem with that is, that Netflix cannot create a monopoly. Unlike famous companies like Apple, anyone could build a streaming business. The technology is fairly simple (I mean, it is very complicated, but if you hire a lot of good software engineers and product managers, it would be possible to create a streaming service like Netflix has). And it is very hard to bind users to the value Netflix delivers: Movies and tv series. Of course, there will be some people who want to see the next season of a Netflix Original. But different producers could also create a tv series which binds users to it. In addition, it isn't very profitable for a company to produce a large number of seasons for a tv series.</p><p>That's because every additional season of a tv series costs more money to a company than the previous one. Why? Because who wants to see the following season? Only the people who also watch the previous one. Or did you ever said "damn, I really want to see season 5 of the show x", without having watched season 1 to 4 of show x? Producing a new season of a tv series will not make a company more money than the previous one. That's why it is incredible hard to bind users to a movie/tv-series business. Creating good content is interchangeable.</p><h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2><p>This entertainment loop happens to every movie subscription company. I referred to Netflix as a practical example, because this company is the current #1 in the streaming-universe.</p><p>I have no business relation to Netflix or any of their competitors besides being invested in their stocks via global index funds (ETF).</p><p>And yes — I'm a happy customer of Netflix. As long as they deliver new content.</p><p>Thanks for reading.</p>

      <p>Quick challenge: Can you name all of the apps on your smartphone’s home screen without looking?</p>

<p>Now consider your living room - can you name most of the physical products?</p>

<p>If you’re like most of us, you probably have a television, a gaming console like a PS5, maybe an AppleTV or Roku, and if you’re into home fitness, a <a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/">Peloton</a> or <a href="https://www.mirror.co/">Mirror</a>. They sit on your media console. Next to your television. In the corner looking out the window. Waiting silently. Beckoning you to engage.</p>

<p>The typical silicon valley mantra over the past decade has been that hardware is hard and the margins are unforgiving. An industry best to be avoided. And by and large this belief was correct, until recently.</p>

<p>With the advent of internet connected devices and subscription business models, hardware is experiencing a renaissance through cloud connectivity.</p>

<p>Companies like Peloton, Mirror, as well as your AppleTV and your gaming console have all figured out ways to provide enhanced internet-enabled content &amp; community experiences using physical hardware as a trojan horse to infiltrate your living room.</p>

<p>When you consider the consistent presence of a beautifully designed physical product in a home - you almost can’t put a price tag on its marketing power. I’ve known people who purchase iMacs just because of the way they make a room <em>feel</em> - even though the computer is rarely used. You can’t tell me the Apple brand isn’t silently permeating that household.</p>

<p>Now that connected hardware is able to leverage high margin subscription business models, expect to see more innovation in connected, beautifully designed hardware around your home.</p>

<p>Many of the new exercise apps on the iPhone are missing an important opportunity to establish a type of “gravity” in the living room. They’re trying to leverage push notifications and instagram ads to get user attention - but most of us are so inundated with ads and push notifications, we’re never going to notice. <strong>They should be building hardware accessories that enhance application experiences and integrate naturally into our physical space.</strong></p>

<p>As we walk around the house, we can’t ignore the beautifully designed stationary bike. Or the well placed mirror on the wall, silently reminding us there are thousands of livestream classes and workout buddies available instantaneously.</p>

<p>Application developers need to be thinking beyond the screen and claiming physical space in our lives. It might cost more money to get into someone’s living room - but it’s also more difficult to get rid of a 60kg carbon steel stationary bike than it is to delete an application from your smartphone.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>I have contacted my broker about this privately, and asked them to confirm that they are not using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754">IEEE754 floating point numbers</a> for calculations involving money.
They refused to confirm that they are not using IEEE754 floating point numbers for calculations involving money.
They have also explicitly stated that "All entries on your account are rounded to the nearest cent." and they have made it clear that they do not see this as a problem.
I have also offered my services, as someone who has experience with getting things like this exactly right, but I did not get a response to that offer.</p>
<p>If you have only come here to get outraged about how my broker does not care about the correctness of their software and their accounting, you can stop reading now.
The rest of this blogpost will be a detailed explanation of the problems at hand and how to solve them.</p>
<h2>Problems with money</h2>
<p>Because computers are really good at doing computations, you might think that they must therefore be good at dealing with money.
However, money is a very complex subject.
There are all sorts of pitfalls, and <a href="https://gist.github.com/rgs/6509585">this list of falsehoods</a> is a good place to start learning about them.</p>
<h3>Money as a floating point value</h3>
<p>If you take away one thing from this blogpost, let it be this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You must NOT store monetary values as IEEE 754 floating point numbers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Corollary: Given that this is the only numeric format that JavaScript has, this implies that you must not use JavaScript for calculations with currency.</p>
<p>These are the primary reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculations involving floating point numbers usually have some amount of error.</li>
<li>Many floating point numbers do not make sense as a value of money.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Creating money out of thin air using floating point calculations</h3>
<p>Floating point number calculations usually have some error.
As an example, let us have a look at the value $0.1$, which cannot represented accurately using an IEEE754 floating point number.
You can tell this by looking at <code>0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1</code>:</p>
<pre><code>λ&gt; 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1
0.30000000000000004
</code></pre>
<p>This means that when you get a dime from a customer three times, and store it as a floating number, you will have effectively created <code>0.00000000000000004</code> USD out of thin air.
This might not seem like much (even though it does not need to be much, it is still wrong), but this error grows as the values in your calculations grow.
There is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis">an entire field of mathematics</a> dedicated to thinking about what happens to the errors depending on what types of calculations you are performing.</p>
<h3>Representing nonsense values of money</h3>
<p>The IEEE754 Floating point number spec defines <code>NaN</code>, <code>+Infinity</code> and <code>-Infinity</code>.
These make no sense when interpreting them as monetary values.
I have to mention this because these values form a real problem in practice.</p>
<p>You might be thinking: OK, but I take good care not to run into issues with these non-normalised floating point values.
You are still wrong, but let us assume you are not.
You will still run into the next problem</p>
<h4>Minimal quantisations</h4>
<p>The smallest denomination of US dollar that you can hold or transact is <code>0.01 USD</code>: a penny.
Any amount of US dollars more granular than that does not exist in coins and cannot usually be transacted.
(You can still potentially have more granular debts, as you will see below.)</p>
<p>Even worse: different currencies have different minimal quantisations.
In Switzerland, where I am using my broker, the smallest coin of a Swiss Frank is 5 "rappen": <code>0.05 CHF</code>.
The transaction granularity goes down to <code>0.01 CHF</code> in bank transactions but no lower than that either.</p>
<h2>Solutions</h2>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>In order to begin talking about solutions, let us clarify what needs to be possible in the system that we produce:</p>
<h4>Addition</h4>
<ol>
<li>We must be able to add up amounts of money.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is useful to keep a running balance, for example.</p>
<p>The additions must happen in such a way that the representation of the sum equals the sum of the representations.
Otherwise we might create or destroy money via addition.</p>
<p>For example, <code>0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1</code> must somehow equal <code>0.3</code> and not <code>0.30000000000000004</code>.</p>
<h4>Integral Multiplication</h4>
<ol start="2">
<li>We must be able to multiply amounts of money by an integer.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is useful to find out how much multiple units of an item would cost, in the case of integral multiples.</p>
<p>You will notice that if you can solve the problem of addition, then you have also solved the problem of correct integral multiplication
However, ideally, an integral multiplication would take up the same amount of time as a single addition, not a linear multiple of it.
We would like to have multiplication be efficient as well as correct.</p>
<p>For example, <code>3.33 x 3</code> must equal <code>9.99</code> and not <code>10</code>.</p>
<h4>Division by an integer</h4>
<ol start="3">
<li>We must be able to divide an amount of money by an integer.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is useful for dividing a payment into installments.
Here it is important that the sum of the installments equals the amount that was divided.</p>
<p>For example, <code>10 / 3</code> must be divided into three times <code>3.33</code> and an extra <code>0.01</code> somewhere: <code>3.34 + 3.33 + 3.33</code>.</p>
<h4>Fractional Multiplication</h4>
<ol start="4">
<li>We must be able to multiply amounts of money by a fraction.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is useful for calculating interest rates, taxes and dividends, for example.</p>
<p>It <em>should</em> happen in such a way that the representation of the product equals the product of the representations.
Failing that (because we'll see that this is impossible), it should at least not create or destroy money.</p>
<p>For example, <code>0.1</code> times <code>0.11 USD</code>, using a minimal quantisation of <code>0.01 USD</code>, should result in <code>0.01 USD</code>.
The representational error which mathematically equals <code>0.001</code> should be dealt with <em>somehow</em>.</p>
<h4>Accurate Accounting</h4>
<ol start="5">
<li>We must be able to accurately account for every smallest unit of currency.</li>
</ol>
<p>When earning or spending money, we must be able to account for every smallest unit of currency in play.
No such units be created or destroyed, and no amounts smaller than the smallest unit may be accounted for.</p>
<p>Note that you can choose a different minimal quantisation of currency in your accounting system than is used for bank transactions.
Even if banks use <code>0.01 CHF</code> as a minimal transaction value, you can still use <code>0.0001 CHF</code> as a minimal quantisation internally.
The only real constraints are correctness: you do not create or destroy money and storage size.
Dealing with more precise numbers requires more storage.</p>
<p>When you choose a different minimal quantisation of currency internally than the one you show to users, you have to somehow make that conversion.
When you do, it is important that you don't add any mistakes back in.</p>
<p>This is likely what my broker did wrong.
They probably used rounding from 4 decimals (a common standard) to 2 decimals and introduced rounding errors in the process.</p>
<h4>Granular pricing</h4>
<ol start="6">
<li>We must be able to make calculations with values smaller than the smallest unit of currency</li>
</ol>
<p>The utility of this requirement may not be obvious.
However, when dealing with an item of large volume and cost such as oil, we want to be able to reason about (and compete on) the (average) price of a small amount of it.
In such a case it may be necessary to reason about currency in units smaller than its minimal quantisation.</p>
<p>For example, if I want to rent out digital storage for $0.000023$ USD per kilobyte per month, that rate is like expressed in a more precise granularity then your system deals with.
In that case we must still be able to rent out $2'000'000$ kilobyte for a month for <code>46.00 USD</code>.</p>
<h3>Representation</h3>
<p>It is already clear that we must not represent currency as floating point numbers.
Instead, we must use a representation with infinite precision: integers.</p>
<p>For the purposes of all but the special case of 'granular pricing', we <em>must</em> use integers to represent currency.
For each individual currency we will represent an amount of it as an integral number of its smallest units.</p>
<p>For example, <code>1 USD</code> could be represented as <code>100</code> at a minimal quantisation of <code>0.01 USD</code> because <code>100 x 0.01 USD = 1 USD</code> and 1 CHF could be represented as <code>20</code> at a minimal quantisation of <code>0.05 CHF</code> because <code>20 x 0.05 CHF = 1 CHF</code>.
If you choose a smaller minimal quantisation, such as <code>0.0001 CHF</code>, then you would represent <code>1 CHF</code> as <code>1000</code> instead.
Given that the minimal quantisation is not obvious, make sure to document it well (and/or put it on the type-level).</p>
<p>In an ideal world you would use arbitrarily-sized integers, but often you may be forced to use bounded representations with fixed limits.
It is possible to accommodate such constraints but the trade-offs, as you will read next, are real and should be considered carefully.
In what follows we will continue by assuming you are using (bounded-size) integer numbers.</p>
<h3>Addition and integer multiplication</h3>
<p>Addition of integers is relatively simple and well supported.
However, most implementations of addition are not suitable for use with fixed-sized integer representations.
Indeed, most implementations of addition will just roll over around the bounds.</p>
<p>For example, consider a situation in which you are a bank and you store amounts of money as <code>int32</code>.
A very wealthy client of yours has about twenty million dollars.
You save this information as "this client has two billion cents".
A bit later, he earns another two million dollars, but when the money is sent to him, suddenly the system says that he is millions in of dollars in debt.
There are two big issues with this scenario: 1. The client has lost money and 2. The …</p></div></div>

					<p>#Noise #pollution is one of the main stressors in urban environments, having negative impacts on people’s quality of life and health. For some groups of citizens, such as school children, patients, and elders, there is a need to support them in finding pedestrian routes in noise polluted areas of cities. In<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9139350" target="_blank"> a new paper</a>, <a href="http://uni-heidelberg.de/gis" target="_blank">we</a> focus on the <strong>estimation of traffic noise</strong>, and present an approach to <strong>provide quiet routing services</strong>, <em>taking into account the estimated noise levels of roads</em>.</p>
<p>By combining Volunteered Geographic Information from OpenStreetMap (OSM), official socio-economic data, and open-access GPS trajectory data, we develop a set of traffic related variables, and apply machine learning methods to perform<strong> traffic volume estimations</strong>. Given the estimated traffic information, an existing traffic noise model is then employed to derive the noise polluted areas. For generation of quiet routes, a new routing algorithm is proposed. It minimizes the exposure of pedestrians to traffic noise pollution while taking into account the route distance constraint. We apply our quiet routing approach to the city of Heidelberg (Germany). The application results demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms in the generation of quiet routes customized to pedestrian preferences.</p>

<p>Also currently we started to <a href="http://k1z.blog.uni-heidelberg.de/2020/06/19/going-green-with-meingrun-today-app-launch-in-heidelberg-and-dresden/">test related approaches in Dresden and Heidelberg</a> in the context of the <a href="https://www.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/gis/meingruen_en.html" target="_blank">meinGrün</a> project.<br>

              <p>Hyperbolic Floors maps hundreds of floors across the world to tessellations in Hyperbolic space. The result is a novel way to look at floor tilings and their infinite nature.</p>

Hardly anybody I know of reads the physical newspaper – in fact the only people I know of are my parents and grandparents. What do the others do? The others open one of the news websites to stay updated with what’s happening. There may be many of us though, who don’t have a fixed website we like to read our news on, and generally open whichever we come across first. Have we ever stopped to think how much the news sites track readers?</p> <h2>Premise</h2><p>With the latest update of Snap Search, we’re now blocking more ads, trackers and analytics than ever before. To test the efficiency, we decided to try various news websites and see how these sites track readers.</p><p>To keep the competition fair, we picked 1 topic which all of them had written about – in this case about TV reporter Victoria Price who was diagnosed with cancer after a viewer emailed her to get a lump on her throat checked.</p><h2>Rules</h2><ol><li>The following list is not in any

pure numbers:</p><ul><li><strong>Most blocked resources:</strong> USA Today (46)</li><li><strong>Least blocked resources:</strong> BBC News (9) and The New York Times (9)</li><li><strong>Average over 15 websites:</strong> 23 Resources Blocked</li></ul><p>However, if you’re looking for an answer as to which one is the safest to read your news – I guess it would BBC or NYT <em>based on the numbers

A lot of people have their favourites and many simply don’t trust certain news platforms so in the end the decision is on you. Treat this only as a fair warning, or something which you should pay attention to.</p><p>I guess the real question isn’t which one is safe, it’s rather where is it safe. If you’re sure your browser is blocking enough of it, you don’t have much to worry about. You have very less chances of finding a website that does 0 tracking – so you should be equipped to protect yourself from those that do. If you’re an Android user, consider reading the news using <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cybersky.snapsearch">Snap Search 😁</a></p><p>Please remember this was completely out of curiosity while testing the latest version of <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cybersky.snapsearch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Snap Search</a>.

<p>Slack is awesome. It’s visually pleasing &amp; my not-technically-savvy friends have no trouble using it. It’s nice (or not nice?) to have one app that would handle personal messages and work conversations.</p>



<p>But I’ve been working strictly on my 15” Macbook Pro, without additional screen real estate, and it’s clear that Slack takes up much more screen area than it needs to do it’s job.</p>

<p>I’ve blurred out the messages/channels for privacy, but I don’t see any reason why the sidebar should be non-collapsible. Certainly, a lot of enterprise clients have enough screen space (2+ monitors) to not have a worry about thus, but at this point, with so many users and success, Slack should have the bandwidth to make their applications responsive.</p>



<p>If I want my Slack window to be non-intrusive, I should be able to shrink it and see something like this:</p>

<p>With the introduction of iOS apps running on Apple Silicon, at the least we’ll be able to run the Slack iOS app, which is very close to what I’ve sketched out.</p>

            <p>TORONTO -- 
	If there was any hope that a global pandemic would help slow down Toronto's booming housing market this new listing proves that’s not the case.</p>
<p>
	A tiny two-bedroom, one bathroom home on Euclid Street in Little Italy has just hit the market for $999,999.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The "rare detached bungalow located in the heart of Toronto" is advertised as being a "great size" with "loads of potential."</p>
<p>

	<a href="https://purplebricks.ca/on/toronto-york-region-durham/toronto/home-for-sale/hab-300-euclid-ave-ia4110230#description" target="_blank">The bungalow</a>, which has a detached garage, is just steps away from shops, restaurants, bars, parks, schools, and public transit, the listing says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Property taxes on the home will set you back $5,307 per year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	According to a report from the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board earlier this month, home sales in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) are rebounding from the COVID-19 pandemic and prices are on the rise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<img alt="House3" src="https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.5040287!/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/landscape_960/image.png"></p>
<p>
	The real estate board said there were 8,701 homes sold in June, down 1.4 per cent compared with the same month last year.</p>
<p>
	On a seasonally adjusted basis, sales in June were up 84 per cent compared with May.</p>
<p>
	The average selling price in the GTA was $930,869, up 11.9 per cent compared with June 2019.</p>

  <p><span>27 Jul 2020</span></p><p>Data produced by programs need to be stored somewhere for future reference, and
there must be some sort of organisation so we can quickly retrieve the desired
information. A file system (FS) is responsible for this task and provides an
abstraction over the storage devices where the data is physically stored.</p>

<p>In this post, we will learn more about the concepts used by file systems, and
how they fit together when writing your own.</p>

<h2 id="structuring-the-disk">Structuring the disk</h2>
<p>When data is stored in a hard-disk drive (HDD) or solid-state drive (SSD), it is
written in small units called sectors (or pages in the SSD case). The drives
don’t have any information about what that piece of data represents, for all it
is worth, the disk is just a giant array of sectors. It is the job of the file
system to make sense of it all.</p>

<p>A file system will divide the disk into fixed-sized blocks. The FS uses the
majority of these blocks to store user data, but some blocks are used to store
metadata that is essential for the file system operation.</p>

<p>The following figure gives an example of how a file system structures the
information on the disk:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://wiki.carlosgaldino.com/public/images/io_filesystem_blocks.svg" alt="">
    <figcaption>File system structure in a disk</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the next sections, we will understand what each type of block means.</p>

<h3 id="superblock-and-bitmaps">Superblock and bitmaps</h3>

<p>The superblock stores most of the metadata about the file system, such as the
following: block size, timestamps, how many blocks and files are in use and how
many are free, etc.</p>

<p>Bitmaps are one way of tracking which data blocks and inodes are free. An index
in the bitmap set to <code>0</code> indicates a free slot, and an index set to <code>1</code>
indicates an occupied slot.</p>

<h3 id="inode">Inode</h3>

<p>The inode is the structure that stores metadata about a file. Attributes such as
permissions, size, location of data blocks that form the file and more are saved
in an inode.</p>

<p>The inodes are stored in blocks that together form the <em>inode table</em> as the
following figure shows.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://wiki.carlosgaldino.com/public/images/io_inode_table.svg" alt="">
    <figcaption>Inode table (detailed view)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For each slot in the inode bitmap set to <code>1</code>, there will be a corresponding
inode in the table. The index of the slot is the same as the index in the table.
And this explains the name inode being a short name for <em>index node</em>.</p>

<h3 id="data-blocks">Data blocks</h3>

<p>As the name suggests, the data blocks are the blocks where the actual data
belonging to a file is written. These blocks are also used for different
purposes which we will see shortly.</p>

<h2 id="pointing-to-data">Pointing to data</h2>

<p>The inode needs to have a way of pointing to the data blocks that assemble the
file. The simplest way is to have <strong>direct pointers</strong>. In this case, each
pointer points to a block that has some of the file data. The problem is that
large files; where the size exceeds the number of direct pointers an inode can
have; are not supported in this mode. One way of overcoming this issue is to use
<strong>indirect pointers</strong>, which instead of storing user data they store pointers to
blocks that hold user data. For larger files, another layer of indirection is
added with <strong>double indirect pointers</strong>. And for even larger files, <strong>triple
indirect pointers</strong> are put to use.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://wiki.carlosgaldino.com/public/images/io_direct_pointers.svg" alt="">
    <figcaption>Inode multi-level index</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To give an idea of the largest file size that each level permit let’s run an
example considering that each block size is 4 KiB. Research has shown that the
majority of files are small [1] so 12 direct pointers would allow for files up
to 48 KiB. Considering that each pointer takes 4 bytes, a single indirect
pointer would then allow a file to be up to around 4 MiB:</p>

<pre>(12 + 1024) * 4 KiB
</pre>

<p>With the addition of double indirect pointers the size would jump to around 4
GiB:</p>

<pre>(12 + 1024 + 1024<sup>2</sup>) * 4 KiB
</pre>

<p>And finally, with triple indirect pointers the files could have a size of around
4 TiB:</p>

<pre>(12 + 1024 + 1024<sup>2</sup> + 1024<sup>3</sup>) * 4 KiB
</pre>

<p>This approach might not be very efficient for handling large files. For example,
a file of 100 MiB requires the allocation of 25600 blocks. The performance can
be severely impacted in case the blocks were fragmented over the disk.</p>

<p>Some file systems use <strong>extents</strong> to help with this situation. In this approach,
there is a single pointer and a length to tell that the data starts at the
address of the pointer and runs for the given range of blocks. In our example
above, describing the same file would use a single extent of size 100 MiB.
Multiple extents can be used to support larger files.</p>

<h2 id="directories">Directories</h2>

<p>You may have noticed that there isn’t a specific structure for directories. The
reason behind it is the fact that inodes represent both files and directories.
The difference is in what is stored in the corresponding data blocks.
Directories are simply a list of all files that it includes. Each entry has the
form of <code>(name, index number)</code> so when looking up a particular file (or another
directory), the system uses the <code>name</code> to find the corresponding inode.</p>

<p>Searching for a file can be slow if a directory contains a large number of
files. This issue can be mitigated by maintaining the list sorted and using
binary search, or instead of representing it as a list, a hash table or a
balanced search tree could also be used.</p>

<h2 id="access-paths">Access paths</h2>

<h3 id="read">Read</h3>

<p>When reading from a file, the file system needs to traverse the entire path,
visiting each inode along the way until reaching the inode for the desired file.
Assuming the user has permission to access the file, the file system consults
which blocks are associated with it and then read the solicited data from them.</p>

<h3 id="write">Write</h3>

<p>When writing to a file, the same process has to happen to find the corresponding
inode. If a new block is required for the write, the file system has to allocate
the block, update the associated information (bitmap and inode), and write to
the block. So one write operation requires five I/O operations: one read to the
bitmap, one write to mark the new block as occupied, two to read and write to
the inode, and one writing the data in the block. This number can increase when
creating a new file because now the associated information of the directory also
has to be read and written to reflect this new file, and operations to create a
new inode.</p>

<h2 id="gotenksfs">GotenksFS</h2>

<p>As a side project, I decided to write my own file system in Rust as I’m learning
the language. Some aspects are inspired by ext4 [2] (and family), and in this
section, you will learn more about it. The file system uses FUSE [3], and the
disk is represented as a regular file. The block size can be configured as 1
KiB, 2 KiB, or 4 KiB. Files can have a size of up to 4 GiB for block sizes of 4
KiB while the file system could theoretically be up to 16 TiB in size.</p>

<h3 id="mkfs"><code>mkfs</code></h3>

<p>The first step is to create the image itself with the configuration values for
the file system. This is achieved via the <code>mkfs</code> command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>./gotenksfs mkfs disk.img <span>-s</span> <span>"10 GiB"</span> <span>-b</span> 4096
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After running the command, the image is created with a total size of 10 GiB, and
each block in the file system has a size of 4 KiB.</p>

<p>In this step, the configuration values and other structures such as a root
directory are written to the image in the first block: the superblock. Its
corresponding bitmap entries, and data are also written. These values will be
necessary for the next step: mounting the file system.</p>

<h3 id="mount"><code>mount</code></h3>

<p>After creating the image, we need to mount it so we can start using it. The
<code>mount</code> command is used for this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>./gotenksfs mount disk.img gotenks
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And you can see some information about it:</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<h3 id="on-disk-structure">On-disk structure</h3>

<p>The superblock is written in the first 1024 bytes, and it holds the
configuration values provided in the <code>mkfs</code> command.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Superblock</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>pub</span> <span>checksum</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The next two blocks represent the data bitmap and inode bitmap. Then, a run of
<code>n</code> blocks are used for the inode table. And the blocks following that are the
ones where user data will be written.</p>

<p>The inode is defined as follows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Inode</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>mode</span><span>:</span> <span>libc</span><span>::</span><span>mode_t</span><span>,</span>

    <span>pub</span> <span>direct_blocks</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>u32</span><span>;</span> <span>DIRECT_POINTERS</span> <span>as</span> <span>usize</span><span>],</span>

    <span>pub</span> <span>checksum</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see above, inodes support double indirect pointers which means that
for a disk with a block size of 4 KiB, the maximum capacity of a file is 4 GiB.
The number of direct pointers is set to 12:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>const</span> <span>DIRECT_POINTERS</span><span>:</span> <span>u64</span> <span>=</span> <span>12</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When starting the FS for the first time, it will create the root directory using
the definition below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Directory</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>entries</span><span>:</span> <span>BTreeMap</span><span>&lt;</span><span>OsString</span><span>,</span> <span>u32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>checksum</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="block-groups">Block groups</h3>

<p>The inode bitmap has 4 KiB meaning that each bitmap block will have a capacity
for 32768 inodes. Suppose we round up the size of an <code>Inode</code> to 128 bytes; the
corresponding inode table will require 4 MiB of space. One of the ways for
structuring them would be to have many blocks dedicated to the bitmaps, then the
corresponding number blocks to store the inodes, and the remaining blocks for
user data.</p>

<p>Instead of doing that, we can create <em>block groups</em> that will always have one
block for the data bitmap and one for the inode bitmap. The next 1024 blocks
contain the inode table, and following that, 32768 blocks which are used for
user data.</p>

<!--
For a disk as in our case of 10 GiB, how many blocks should be dedicated to inode bitmaps?

Increasing the number of blocks to be inode bitmaps reduces the amount of available data blocks. And reducing the number of inode bitmaps restricts the total number of files supported by the system.

Since entire APIs and products are built on top of them, they inspire enough appreciation (or, more likely, fear of obsolescence!) to net a sustainable income from one-off or monthly donations.</p><p>But most OSS projects aren't big. The typical project on GitHub is better described as a <strong>utility</strong>. It's a small tool that does one thing really well. Over the course of building a complex application, you may end up using dozens of these utilities — and they'll save you hundreds of hours of development time. </p><p>Unfortunately, utilities like these rarely bring in a non-negligible amount of donations, no matter how widely used or beloved they are. Consider <a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router">react-router</a>. Even with 41.3k stars on GitHub, 3M weekly downloads from NPM, and nearly universal adoption in React-based single-page applications, it only brings in <a href="https://opencollective.com/react-router">~$17k</a> of donations annually. </p><p>The root of the problem is that open-source donations are made on a per-project basis. To support a project via GitHub Sponsors or OpenCollective, you must create <em>yet another</em> auto-renewing monthly subscription for <em>each and every</em> project you want to support. There's a major psychological cost associated with that. Moreover, at the moment of truth (<em>"I'm gonna sponsor X!"</em>) it's easy to "logic" yourself out of donating (<em>"But what if it gets replaced by some new hotness next week?!"</em>). In the end, only the projects that are massively, insanely, indisputably useful get funded. And those projects are usually the "big stuff" — frameworks, self-hostable software, etc. </p><p>A new model is needed; one that works for the small- and medium-sized projects, not just the huge ones. So I propose a novel(-ish) approach to OSS sustainability. </p><h2>Introducing "sponsor pools"</h2><ol><li>Every month, you donate some amount into a "wallet".</li><li>Your funds are then distributed to the projects in your "sponsor pool". Your sponsor pool is just the set of open-source projects you want to support. </li><li>Adding new projects to your pool should require <strong>one click</strong> —&nbsp;as easy as starring the repo on GitHub.</li></ol><p>That's it. It's hardly ingenious, which is why it's surprising that no major company or organization that has implemented it.</p> <p>This would achieve the holy grail of OSS sustainability: the one-click sponsorship. Once a person has funded their sponsorship pool, it would take <em>a single click</em> to financially support another project. <mark>The marginal cost — both psychological and financial — of supporting additional projects would drop to zero.</mark> That's a game changer.</p><h3>GitHub</h3><p>The best case scenario, in my opinion, is for GitHub to natively support this model as an extension of GitHub Sponsors. It's where the code lives (usually) so it is best positioned to create a zero-friction donation system like this.</p><p>Of course, if GitHub implemented something like this, they would likely divorce the donation mechanism from stars. Perhaps instead, users who have created and funded a sponsorship pool can be presented with an "Add to Pool" button in place of the current "Sponsor" button.</p><p><img alt="Add to pool button" src="https://vriad.com/add_to_pool.png"></p><p>GitHub has a financial incentive to switch to this approach — sort of. They're currently eating the cost of all processing fees for transactions on GitHub Sponsors. So if you sponsor a project at $1/mo, the maintainer gets $1/mo...and GitHub pays $0.30 to the credit card companies. Larger donation sizes means GitHub pays a proportionally smaller amount as fees.</p><p>Note that I said <em>proportionally smaller</em>. If more total donations are being processed (which is the goal of this proposal!), they may still end up paying more in total fees, even if the ratio of fees-to-donations is smaller. If the sponsorship pool concept is massively successful —&nbsp;say, cumulative donations of $1B annually — GitHub will be eating nearly $20M in card fees. I suspect that would ruffle some feathers at Microsoft.</p><p>As a final addendum —&nbsp;I'd love to see embeddable "badges" that are unlocked at different levels of donorship.&nbsp;Imagine a world where you see a "GitHub Sponsor Gold Badge" in the footer of someone’s website, indicating that they donate, say, $1000+ annually to open source. Clicking on this badge would bring you to a trusted site that lets you verify the claim. Here's my quick-and-dirty attempt at a badge design:</p><p><img alt="order of the gold octocat" src="https://vriad.com/gold_octocat.jpg"></p><p>Some may cry "virtue signaling" but approaches like this are a proven way to establish positive reinforcement loops that a) increase awareness and b) encourage more folks to donate to open source.</p><h3>Wrapping up</h3><p>This is a hard problem with a vast array of potential solutions. I don't mean to come off as critical of any funding platform mentioned; they've all done a lot for maintainers, including myself, and I don't mean to minimize that. This is merely a hypothetical exercise.</p><p><em>My name is Colin and like writing proposals like this one. There are lots of things that should exist in the world, and it's easier to describe them than to implement them! If you want to know when I publish new proposals, join <a href="https://vriad.com/newsletter">my mailing list</a> or follow me <a href="https://twitter.com/vriad">on Twitter</a>. ✌️</em></p></div></div>]]>

<p>When I started my career in development, my first job was a DBA. Back then, before AWS RDS, Azure, Google Cloud and the rest of them cloud services, there were two types of DBAs:</p>
<p><strong>The Infrastructure DBA</strong> was in charge of setting up the database, configuring the storage and taking care of backups and replication. After setting up the database, the infrastructure DBA would pop up from time to time and do some "instance tuning", things like sizing caches.</p>
<p><strong>The Application DBA</strong> got a clean database from the infrastructure DBA, and was in charge of schema design: creating tables, indexes, constraints, and tuning SQL. The application DBA was also the one who implemented ETL processes and data migrations. In teams that used stored procedures, the application DBA would maintain those as well.</p>
<p>Application DBAs were usually part of the development team. They would possess deep domain knowledge so normally they would work on just one or two projects. Infrastructure DBAs would usually be part of some IT team, and would work on many projects simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>I'm an Application DBA</strong></p>
<p>I never had any desire to fiddle with backups or tune storage (I'm sure it's fascinating!). Until this day I like to say I'm a DBA that knows how to develop applications, and not a developer that knows his way around the database.</p>
<p><strong>In this article I share some non-trivial tips about database development I gathered along the way.</strong></p>

<h2 id="update-only-what-needs-updating"><a href="#update-only-what-needs-updating">Update Only What Needs Updating</a></h2>
<p><code>UPDATE</code> is a relatively expensive operation. To speed up an <code>UPDATE</code> command it's best to make sure you only update what needs updating.</p>
<p>Take this query for example that normalizes an email column:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>UPDATE</span> <span>users</span> <span>SET</span> <span>email</span> <span>=</span> <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>);</span>
<span>UPDATE 1010000</span>
<span>Time: 1583.935 ms (00:01.584)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Looks innocent, right? the query updated emails of 1,010,000 users. But, did all rows really needed to update?</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>UPDATE</span> <span>users</span> <span>SET</span> <span>email</span> <span>=</span> <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>)</span>
<span><span>db-#</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>email</span> <span>!=</span> <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>);</span>
</span><span>UPDATE 10000</span>
<span>Time: 299.470 ms</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Only 10,000 rows needed to update. By reducing the amount of affected rows, the execution time went down from 1.5 seconds to just less than 300ms. Updating fewer rows also saves the database maintenance later on.</p>

<p>This type of large updates are very common in data migration scripts. So the next time you write a migration script, make sure to only update what needs updating.</p>

<h2 id="disable-constraints-and-indexes-during-bulk-loads"><a href="#disable-constraints-and-indexes-during-bulk-loads">Disable Constraints and Indexes During Bulk Loads</a></h2>
<p>Constraints are an important part of relational databases: they keep the data consistent and reliable. Their benefits come at a cost though, and it's most noticeable when loading or updating a lot of rows.</p>
<p>To demonstrate, set up a small schema for a store:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>DROP</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>IF</span> <span>EXISTS</span> <span>product</span> <span>CASCADE</span><span>;</span>

<span>);</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>product</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>price</span><span>)</span>
    <span>SELECT</span> <span>random</span><span>()::</span><span>text</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>random</span><span>()</span> <span>*</span> <span>1000</span><span>)::</span><span>int</span>

<span>);</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>customer</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span>

    <span>customer_id</span> <span>int</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>
<span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The schema defines different types of constraints such as "not null" and unique constraints.</p>
<p>To set a baseline, start by adding foreign keys to the <code>sale</code> table, and then load some data into it:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>sale</span> <span>ADD</span> <span>CONSTRAINT</span> <span>sale_product_fk</span>

<span>ALTER TABLE</span>

</pre></div>


<p>After defining constraints and indexes, loading a million rows to the table took ~15.4s.</p>
<p>Next, try to load the data into the table first, and only then add constraints and indexes:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>SALE</span> <span>(</span><span>created</span><span>,</span> <span>product_id</span><span>,</span> <span>customer_id</span><span>)</span>

<p>Loading data into a table without indexes and constraints was much faster, 2.27s compared to 15.4s before. Creating the indexes and constraints after the data was loaded into the table took a bit longer, but overall the entire process was much faster, 3.1s compared to 15.4s.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for indexes PostgreSQL does not provide an easy way of doing this other than dropping and re-creating the indexes. In other databases such as Oracle, you can <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf/ALTER-INDEX.html#GUID-D8F648E7-8C07-4C89-BB71-862512536558" rel="noopener">disable and enable indexes</a> without having to re-create them.</p>
<hr>

<p>When you modify data in PostgreSQL, the changes are written to the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-intro.html" rel="noopener">write ahead log (WAL)</a>. The WAL is used to maintain integrity, to fast forward the database during recovery and to maintain replication.</p>
<p>Writing to the WAL is often needed, but there are some circumstances where you might be willing to give up some of its uses to make things a bit faster. One example is intermediate tables.</p>
<p>Intermediate tables are disposable tables that stores temporary data used to implement some process. For example, a very common pattern in ETL processes is to load data from a CSV file to an intermediate table, clean the data, and then load it to the target table. In this use-case, the intermediate table is disposable and there is no use for it in backups or replicas.</p>

<p>The user <em>haki benita</em> registered twice, once with the email <code>ME@hakibenita.com</code> and again with <code>me@hakibenita.com</code>. Because we didn't normalize the emails when we inserted them into the table, we now have to deal with duplication.</p>
<p>To consolidate the duplicate users, we want to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify duplicate users by lower case email</li>
<li>Update orders to reference one of the duplicate users</li>
<li>Remove the duplicate users from the users table</li>
</ol>
<p>One way to consolidate duplicate users is to use an intermediate table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>CREATE</span> <span>UNLOGGED</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>duplicate_users</span> <span>AS</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>SELECT</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>normalized_email</span><span>,</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>min</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>convert_to_user</span><span>,</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>array_remove</span><span>(</span><span>ARRAY_AGG</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>),</span> <span>min</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>))</span> <span>as</span> <span>convert_from_users</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>FROM</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>users</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>normalized_email</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>HAVING</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>count</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>CREATE TABLE</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>duplicate_users</span><span>;</span>
<span> normalized_email  | convert_to_user | convert_from_users</span>
<span>-------------------+-----------------+--------------------</span>
<span> me@hakibenita.com |               2 | {3}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The intermediate table holds a mapping of duplicate users. For each user that appears more than once with the same normalized email address, we define the user with the min ID as the user we convert all duplicates to. The other users are kept in an array column, and all the references to these users will be updated.</p>
<p>Using the intermediate table, we update references of duplicate users in the <code>orders</code> table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>UPDATE</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>orders</span> <span>o</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>SET</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>user_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>du</span><span>.</span><span>convert_to_user</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>FROM</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>duplicate_users</span> <span>du</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>WHERE</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>o</span><span>.</span><span>user_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>ANY</span><span>(</span><span>du</span><span>.</span><span>convert_from_users</span><span>);</span>
<span>UPDATE 2</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now that there are no more references, we can safely delete the duplicate users from the <code>users</code> table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>users</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>WHERE</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>id</span> <span>IN</span> <span>(</span>
<span>db(#</span>        <span>SELECT</span> <span>unnest</span><span>(</span><span>convert_from_users</span><span>)</span>
<span>db(#</span>        <span>FROM</span> <span>duplicate_users</span>
<span>db(#</span>    <span>);</span>
<span>DELETE 1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Notice that we used the function <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-array.html#ARRAY-FUNCTIONS-TABLE" rel="noopener"><code>unnest</code></a> to "transpose" the array, that is, turn each array element into a row.</p>
<p>This is the result:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>u</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>u</span><span>.</span><span>email</span><span>,</span> <span>o</span><span>.</span><span>id</span> <span>as</span> <span>order_id</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>orders</span> <span>o</span> <span>JOIN</span> <span>users</span> <span>u</span> <span>ON</span> <span>o</span><span>.</span><span>user_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>u</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>;</span>
<span> id |       email       | order_id</span>
<span>----+-------------------+----------</span>
<span>  1 | foo@bar.baz       |        1</span>
<span>  1 | foo@bar.baz       |        2</span>

employer Facebook, or any of its subsidiaries or its affiliates.</em></strong></p>

<p>I have been spending a lot of time at home and doing a lot of readings on
distributed systems during the pandemic. Recently I noticed that the main
observation of Heidi Howard’s <a href="https://fpaxos.github.io/" target="_blank">Flexible Paxos (FPaxos)</a> work is applicable to Raft. Heidi
Howard already <a href="https://github.com/fpaxos/raft.tla" target="_blank">extended Raft’s TLA+ proof</a> for that. There is also a few
open source Raft implementations that mention FPaxos, but as far as I see nobody
has implemented the idea yet.</p>

<p>I analyzed the <em>simple quorums</em> and <em>improved majority quorums</em> settings of
FPaxos in the context of Raft consensus algorithm, and had a few interesting
findings. I wanted to present my findings in a concise way, so I wrote a short
paper for it.</p>

<p><strong><em>Improved Majority Quorums for Raft</em></strong></p>

<p><em>Raft has gained widespread adoption in the industry as a newcomer, thanks to
its pragmatic approach to the distributed consensus problem. Also, its
resemblance to Paxos allows it to benefit from decades of research on Paxos.
In this work, we study simple quorums and improved majority quorums of FPaxos in
the context of Raft consensus algorithm. Even-sized clusters are prone to a
greater risk of unavailability compared to odd-sized clusters because of the
majority quorum requirement. Our main finding, which applies equally to Raft and
Multi-Paxos, shows that even-sized clusters can employ improved majority quorums
to obtain the same degree of availability as odd-sized ones with one less
server. We also use improved majority quorums to simplify Raft cluster
membership changes. Our solution minimizes availability gaps during cluster
membership changes without any extra phase or voting state. We expect existing
Raft implementations to utilize our findings with quite small code changes.</em></p>

<p>(rebyC, Hard, 406 pts)</p>

<p>Author: Egor Zaytsev (@groke)</p>

<p>I created a simple service that encrypts flag (and your data) with RC4! I bet you can’t the extract flag from there :)</p>

<p>crcrcr-cybrics2020.ctf.su/</p>

<p>Source code: <a href="https://tcode2k16.github.io/blog/2020-07-27-cybrics-writeup/crcrcr.tar.gz">crcrcr.tar.gz</a></p>

<p>Hint at 20:00 — When I wanna know how Python objects are stored in memory, I can do:</p>

<pre><code>terminal1:
python3
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = b"qweqweqweqwe";
terminal2: gcore `pidof python3`
</code></pre>

<p>And then look at resulting core file, get xref to qweqweqeqwe, and try to find out how Python objects are stored in memory.</p>

<p>And I guess I will be happy to find cipher.S (rc4 state) in the coredump</p>



<p>The source code for this task is provided, so the logical first step would be to read it.</p>

<p>The server is made up of two components the flask part that handles user interaction and an encryption program named <code>cryptor.py</code>.</p>

<p>First, let’s look at the flask component:</p>

<pre><code>from flask import render_template, flash, redirect,url_for, request, session, send_file
from Crypto.Cipher import ARC4
from app import app
from app.forms import CreateForm
import hashlib
import os

root_dir = "/app"

@app.route('/')
@app.route('/index')
def index():
    form = CreateForm()
    return render_template('home.html', title='Make your try', form=form)

@app.route('/get_files', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    form = CreateForm()
    try:
        foldername = f"data/upload/{hashlib.sha1(os.urandom(32)).hexdigest()}"

        curr_dir = os.getcwd()
        os.mkdir(foldername)
        os.chdir(foldername)
        input_file = open("input", "w")
        input_file.write(form.user_data.data)
        input_file.close()
        os.system("echo 0x3f &gt; /proc/self/coredump_filter &amp;&amp; python3.8 %s/cryptor.py %s/flag.png &lt; input" % (curr_dir, curr_dir))
        os.system("rm input")
        files = filter(lambda x: os.path.isfile(x), os.listdir('.'))
        lst = [f"{foldername}/{x}" for x in files]        

    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
        os.chdir(root_dir)
        foldername = "Error!"
        return redirect(url_for('index'))
    os.chdir(root_dir)
    for i in lst:
        data_file = open(i, "rb")
        data = data_file.read()
        data_file.close()
        data_file = open(i, "wb")
        cipher = ARC4.new(app.config['RC4_KEY'])
        data = cipher.encrypt(data)
        data_file.write(data)
        data_file.close()
    return render_template('files.html', title='Link', fn = lst)


from flask import send_from_directory

@app.route('/data/&lt;path:filename&gt;')
def serve_static(filename):
    
    return send_file(os.path.join(root_dir,"data", filename))
</code></pre>

<p>The flask component has two important functionalities.</p>

<p>One, it takes the post data sent by the user, writes it to a file, and pipes it to <code>cryptor.py</code> through stdin.</p>

<p>Two, it performs a RC4 operation on all the resultant files produced by <code>cryptor.py</code> and serves them back to the user. One thing to note is that a new RC4 object is constructed for each file and the same key is used. We will come back to this point later.</p>

<p>Now, let’s take a look at <code>cryptor.py</code>:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
import os
import random
import ast

class RC4:
    def __init__(self, key):
        S = list(range(0x100))
        j = 0
        for i in range(0x100):
            j = (S[i] + key[i % len(key)] + j) &amp; 0xff
            S[i], S[j] = S[j], S[i]
        self.S = S
        self.keystream = self._keystream_generator()

    def crypt_file(self, data):
        res = []
        while (i := data.read(1)):
            res.append(ord(i) ^ next(self.keystream))
        return bytes(res)

    def crypt_string(self, data):
        res = []
        for i in data:
            res.append(ord(i) ^ next(self.keystream))
        return bytes(res)

    def _keystream_generator(self):
        x = y = 0
        while True:
            x = (x + 1) &amp; 0xff
            y = (self.S[x] + y) &amp; 0xff
            self.S[x], self.S[y] = self.S[y], self.S[x]
            i = (self.S[x] + self.S[y]) &amp; 0xff
            yield self.S[i]


if __name__ == "__main__":
    rc4_key = os.urandom(1024)
    cipher = RC4(rc4_key)
    del rc4_key
    data = open(sys.argv[1], "rb")
    res = cipher.crypt_file(data)
    f = open("res2.bin", "wb")
    f.write(res)
    f.close()
    del data
    K1 = [random.randrange(0, 256, 1) for i in range(256)] 
    K2 = [random.randrange(0, 256, 1) for i in range(256)] 
    K3 = [random.randrange(0, 256, 1) for i in range(256)] 
    K4 = [random.randrange(0, 256, 1) for i in range(256)] 
    K5 = [random.randrange(0, 256, 1) for i in range(256)] 
    K6 = [random.randrange(0, 256, 1) for i in range(256)] 
    user_input = input()
    enc_dict = ast.literal_eval(user_input)
    to_encrypt = enc_dict['to_enc']
    if enc_dict['need_enc'] == 1:
        output = open("user.enc", "wb")
        encrypted = cipher.crypt_string(to_encrypt)
        output.write(output)
        output.close()
    else:
        output = open("user.enc", "wb")
        output.write(to_encrypt)
        output.close()
</code></pre>

<p>This part also does two things.</p>

<p>One, it encrypts the flag using rc4 with 1024 bytes of randomness as key in contrast to the fixed key used in the flask component.</p>

<p>Two, it takes the user input, parses it into a dictionary using <code>ast.literal_eval</code>, and either writes it directly to disk or encrypts it with rc4 then writes to disk based on a flag.</p>



<p>The challenge code and the hint in the description clearly suggest us to obtain a coredump of the python process. So, we need to figure out a way to crash python by manipulating the input to <code>ast.literal_eval</code>.</p>

<p>A quick google search later, we found exactly <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/54763776/6711781">that</a>. As it turns out, the input <code>'()' * 1000000</code> causes the python parsing logic to go into multiple layers of recursion and will eventually lead to a crash.</p>

<pre><code>import requests

s = requests.Session()

# core dump
print s.post('http://crcrcr-cybrics2020.ctf.su/get_files',data={
  'user_data': '()' * 1000000,
  'submit': 'Get my files'
}).text
</code></pre>

<p>Part of the output that we care about:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h3&gt;
    &lt;a href=data/upload/cfae2f668f31fb0e4f6705f505c33e339a4f68f1/core&gt;core&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
    &lt;a href=data/upload/cfae2f668f31fb0e4f6705f505c33e339a4f68f1/res2.bin&gt;res2.bin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>coredump and the encrypted data</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now we have a coredump, time for reversing right?</p>

<p>Not so fast, remember from before both files are encrypted by the flask component. This in fact makes <code>res2.bin</code> doubly encrypted. So we need a way of defeating this first layer of encryption</p>



<p>Time to brush up on the basics of rc4 encryption. The process is quite simple. The key helps the algorithm initialize its internal state. Then the algorithm can start producing an infinitely long key stream. The encryption process would just be to xor this newly produced key stream with our input.</p>

<p>With this in mind, it is not hard to see why reusing the same key for multiple encryptions is a bad idea. The same key always leads to the same key stream. So if we encrypt an unknown file A with the key stream K to produce B and then encrypt a known file C with the same key stream K to produce D, we get the property below:</p>

<pre><code>C, B, and D are known
trying to find A

# encrypt
B = xor(A, K)
D = xor(C, K)

# decrypt
K = xor(D, C)
A = xor(K, B)
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, we can recover the full key stream by encrypting a known file, and with the key stream in hand, we can recover all other files encrypted by the same key.</p>

<p>This is precisely the scenario we have on hand. By turning off encryption on user input, <code>cryptor.py</code> allows us to write anything we want to disk and that will later be encrypted using rc4 by the flask component.</p>

<pre><code>import requests
import urllib
s = requests.Session()

additional_headers = {
  'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
}

# 75698176 is the size of the core dump

post_data ={
  'user_data': '{"need_enc":0, "to_enc":b"'+('a'*75698176)+'"}',
  'submit': 'Get my files'
}

print s.post('http://crcrcr-cybrics2020.ctf.su/get_files',data=urllib.urlencode(post_data), headers=additional_headers).text
</code></pre>

<p>Part of the output that we care about:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h3&gt;
    &lt;a href=data/upload/4861eb51e2c18861f5111b63c92cd809b924eea1/user.enc&gt;user.enc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>With this new <code>user.enc</code> file, we can xor it with its original content to recover the full key stream and decrypt the other files:</p>

<pre><code>from pwn import *

with open('./dumps/core', 'rb') as f:
  enc_core = f.read()
with open('./dumps/res2.bin', 'rb') as f:
  enc_bin = f.read()
with open('./dumps/user.enc', 'rb') as f:
  enc_user = f.read()

key_stream = xor(enc_user, 'a'*len(enc_user))

assert len(key_stream) &gt;= len(enc_core)
plain_core = xor(key_stream, enc_core)
with open('./dumps/plain_core','wb') as f:
  f.write(plain_core)

plain_bin = xor(key_stream[:len(enc_bin)], enc_bin)
with open('./dumps/plain_bin','wb') as f:
  f.write(plain_bin)
</code></pre>



<p>Now is finally time for some reversing. We need to extract <code>cipher.S</code> (rc4 state) from the coredump. The best way to approach this would be to look at some cpython source code and find out how the state would look like in memory.</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct _object {
    _PyObject_HEAD_EXTRA
    Py_ssize_t ob_refcnt;
    struct _typeobject *ob_type;
} PyObject;
</code></pre>

<p>They say sunlight is the best disinfectant.  I think about that every time I hear about another protest against a speaker or an idea.  If you really want to kill stupid ideas, you should actually let people discuss them publicly.  Otherwise, they get pushed to the far corners of the internet filled with other nutjobs*  There they get sympathy, not just for their idea, but for the fact that they were not allowed to speak publicly about it.</p>



<p>If someone wants to give a controversial talk, like to say that women are less intelligent than men, or that the Holocaust never happened, or that one race is genetically inferior to the other races, the best way to marginalize those ideas and highlight how stupid they are is to let them speak.  Don’t even waste time on protesting the speaker.  Don’t cancel them.  Shrug and say it’s not even worth your time to fight, or, if you do want to fight, go listen to the talk and write a summary online about how idiotic the talk was.</p>



<p>The way to defeat ideas you don’t like is to make them compete in the public domain of ideas, not to censor them.  When you censor them, you think you are squashing them out, but you are just giving them protected time and space to grow and find more supporters.</p>



<p>*<em>if you are reading this at some point in the future, it is quite possible that the term “nutjob” is politically incorrect for some reason, but as of the date I am writing this it is within the bounds of things you can say, so please don’t crucify me in 2035 for writing this in 2020.</em> </p>

<p>The number of ways you can setup a website/blog such as this can be overwhelming these days. In this post, I will talk about my requirements from my setup and an overview of how I solved them.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements<a href="#requirements">#</a></h2>
<p>I always wanted a small space for myself on the internet and I tried Blogger, WordPress and Twitter at various times to get there. (In fact, I <a href="https://ketanvijayvargiya.com/21-why-choose-wordpress-over-blogger/">once wrote</a> about how I preferred WordPress to Blogger and would stick with it <em>for long</em>!) Following are some of the factors that are important to me.</p>
<p><strong>Longevity</strong>: I’ve changed blog URLs so many times that I don’t want to do it again. I now want something for the long haul.</p>
<p><strong>Platorm lock-in</strong>: I want to avoid platform lock-in at all costs. And when any part of my system stopped working, I want the ability to switch to something else. A lot of platforms promise they don’t lock you in but the reality is more nuanced. For e.g., when I exported data from my older blog to move to the new setup, WordPress gave me a giant XML file. Sure, I have my data, but what do I do with it? I had to use some Python script on GitHub to create (half-baked) Markdown files out of it.</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: Why can’t you just buy a custom domain on WordPress (or something) and call it a day? Well, all blogging websites come with either restrictions on their free tiers - for e.g., media storage limits, inability to opt out of ads that they control or paywalls for your readers - or recurring monthly or yearly subscriptions. While I understand their need to monetize, I am fairly technical myself and wanted to see how I can setup something the way I like without spending a lot of money.</p>
<h2 id="custom-domain">Custom domain<a href="#custom-domain">#</a></h2>
<p>In the past, I’ve tried <em>clever</em> names such as Thought Graffiti, Flag Unfurled (from High Hopes by Pink Floyd) etc. but such names stop being clever after awhile. This time, as you can see, I went with a boring domain name, one that contains my 1.5 mile long last name.</p>
<p>I bought it from <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a> because they were the cheapest at $8.88 per year. I also realized that such domain registration websites usually charge less for the first year but higher for renewals. Since I wanted something for a long time, I paid for 10 years upfront to save money.</p>
<p>Security is important on a website from where you purchase your domain name, so don’t forget to setup 2-factor authentication on your account.</p>
<p>An alternative to buying a custom domain is to use the free one that Netlify gave me: <a href="https://ketanvijayvargiya.netlify.app/">https://ketanvijayvargiya.netlify.app</a>. (See below for more on Netlify.) However, I didn’t want to be locked into Netlify.</p>
<h2 id="website-creation">Website creation<a href="#website-creation">#</a></h2>
<p>I love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> for writing content because it is simple, yet powerful. Therefore, I went with a static site generator because it allows me to manage content in Markdown and takes care of converting the content into HTML and CSS. The resultant website is also simple that doesn’t contain any server-side components.</p>
<p>As expected, there are numerous SSGs out there.</p>
<p><strong>Gatsby</strong>: I first spent a few days with <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a>. Since my recent-most experience with web technologies is more than 7 years old - back when I dabbled with <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> and vanilla JavaScript in <a href="https://www.snapdeal.com/">Snapdeal</a> - I thought Gatsby, a React-based framework, would give me an opportunity to learn about modern tech.</p>
<p>I eventually gave up on Gatsby primarily because of the way its themes work.</p>
<ol>
<li>Gatsby themes are somewhat coupled with website content. For e.g., each theme can have different assumptions about how the content is organized. So, if you wanted to change your theme in future, be prepared to re-do some of your current customizations.</li>
<li>If the theme you use gets updated upstream, for e.g., if the theme maintainers add a new feature, Gatsby doesn’t provide a good way for you to pull in those changes.</li>
<li>Gatsby themes are bloated. For e.g., look at the huge number of dependencies of <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen/">gatsby-starter-lumen</a> and <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/panr/gatsby-starter-hello-friend/">gatsby-starter-hello-friend</a>, the two themes I liked the most. (Ironically, the former is supposed to be <em>minimal</em>.) Moreover, when built locally, <em>npm</em> calls out a bunch of these dependencies as deprecated and I have no idea how to fix those warnings or what are its security implications.</li>
</ol>
<p>While I didn’t know at the time, Gatsby is painfully slow. I only realized that when I moved to Hugo after using Gatsby for a few days.</p>
<p><strong>Jekyll</strong>: I immediately discarded <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> because I didn’t want to deal with Ruby.</p>
<p><strong>Hugo</strong>: I finally went with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> which solved all the problems I mentioned earlier. Its approach to content management is uniform across themes and decoupled from them, so I can update themes independently.</p>
<h2 id="code-repository">Code repository<a href="#code-repository">#</a></h2>
<p>I preferred GitLab to GitHub as my <a href="https://gitlab.com/ketan-vijayvargiya/personal-website">code repository</a> because it offers more storage per repository (10 GB vs 1 GB). I wanted higher storage because I plan on storing static assets, such as images, in the same repository.</p>
<p>I also realize that Git isn’t a great choice for static content, so I setup Git LFS on GitLab to hold that.</p>
<h2 id="website-hosting">Website hosting<a href="#website-hosting">#</a></h2>
<p>I choose <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> to host my website. It is reliable and its free tier will be more than sufficient for me.</p>
<p>Some of its best features are the following: 100 GB/month bandwidth (which is a lot for a website that hardly anyone will visit!), 300 minutes/month build time (again, a lot for a Hugo website) and automated build+deploy the moment I do a <code>git push</code> on my computer. On security front, enabling HTTPS was straightforward and Netlify will take care of certificate renewal for me. And all these features are available on the free tier!</p>
<p>On the flip side, while I can enable analytics for $9 a month, I wish Netlify included a basic version of that in the free tier. Nothing fancy, just a daily counter of visits would suffice.</p>
<p>Side note: I changed the DNS nameservers for my domain to point from Namecheap to Netlify.</p>
<h2 id="email">Email<a href="#email">#</a></h2>
<p>I setup email on my domain through Zoho’s <a href="https://www.zoho.com/mail/zohomail-pricing.html">Forever Free plan</a> which gave me 5 GB storage (again, enough for me). The initial setup was cumbersome, with a lot of manual configurations, but that wasn’t because of Zoho. That’s just how emails on custom domains work. If you mess up, you could face issues while sending or receiving emails or your emails could land in your recipient’s spam folder. So, be careful!</p>
<p>I setup a catch-all rule on Zoho, so that any emails sent to <em>&lt;WHATEVER&gt;@ketanvijayvargiya.com</em> land in my one inbox. That allows me to create email addresses on the fly, so I have an infinite number of them.</p>
<p>An alternative to Zoho was a (free) email forwarding service such as <a href="https://improvmx.com/">ImprovMX</a> with my GMail or ProtonMail account underneath. However, Zoho seemed simpler.</p>
<p>Side note: Don’t forget to setup 2-factor authentication on your email account.</p>
<h2 id="other-optional-enhancements">Other (optional) enhancements<a href="#other-optional-enhancements">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Medium</strong>: While I won’t write on Medium so as to avoid platform lock-in, I will occasionally use their <a href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214550207-Import-a-post">import feature</a> to mirror my posts there. This will allow me to reach more people while still maintaining full ownership of the content.</p>
<p><strong>Forestry</strong>: I imported my website into <a href="https://forestry.io/">Forestry</a> today so that I can manage content through their web interface. I don’t fully know if I need it though, since I will be the sole contributor. I guess I’ll find out in sometime. (Note: an open-source alternative to Forestry is <a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/">Netlify CMS</a>.)</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>As you can see above, the entire setup is free except for the custom domain. And even that is pretty cheap.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>For those who are new to the shell, we've covered a lot. In this chapter we'll slow down the pace of new commands a bit and instead focus on a core skill which you will already be familiar with from Graphical User Interfaces - using the clipboard.</p><p>You have probably already been using the clipboard with the shell, copying and pasting commands and their outputs. However, there's a lot more we can do with the clipboard. Now we'll look at how to take this to the next level.</p><p>We'll also briefly introduce introduce <em>aliases</em> and <em>pipelines</em>, which will be covered in a lot more detail in later chapters.</p><h2 id="the-clipboard-essentials">The Clipboard Essentials</h2><p>I wouldn't be surprised if the keyboard shortcuts to access the clipboard are already firmly locked into muscle memory for almost all readers, but just in case, here's a reminder of the shortcuts across different systems:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Command</th><th>Windows Shortcut</th><th>Linux Shortcut</th><th>MacOS Shortcut</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cut</td><td><code>Ctrl</code> + <code>X</code></td><td><code>Ctrl</code> + <code>X</code></td><td><code>⌘</code> + <code>X</code></td></tr><tr><td>Copy</td><td><code>Ctrl</code> + <code>C</code></td><td><code>Ctrl</code> + <code>C</code></td><td><code>⌘</code> + <code>C</code></td></tr><tr><td>Paste</td><td><code>Ctrl</code> + <code>V</code></td><td><code>Ctrl</code> + <code>V</code></td><td><code>⌘</code> + <code>V</code></td></tr></tbody></table><p>In the shell, you may find that these commands don't run as expected. For example, in the screenshot below I have tried to use <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>V</code> a few times to paste into terminal on Ubuntu:</p><p><img src="https://effective-shell.com/docs/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/4-clipboard-gymnastics/images/ctrl-v-on-ubuntu.png" alt="Screenshot: Ctrl + V on Ubuntu"></p><p>Instead of the contents of the clipboard being dropped into the shell, we see the text <code>^V</code>. Why is this?</p><p>Well, some of this is historical (the shell has been around for a long time so we'll see this answer a lot!). The reason the <code>Ctrl</code> key is <em>called</em> the <em>Control Key</em> is that it is used to send <em>control sequences</em> to the computer. When we're using the Control Key, the characters we send are not plain text, they're used to perform actions. This is something that is probably pretty familiar. For example, <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>P</code> is almost universally used as a shortcut for the ‘Print’ command.</p><p>We tend to think of these commands as <em>shortcuts</em> to save us from finding the appropriate command in a menu or on a toolbar. But of course most shells and command-line interfaces pre-date graphical user interfaces. They needed a way to differentiate between a user entering plain old text, and a user wanting to execute a certain command.</p><p>Even modern shells tend to follow the conventions around control sequences which were established by earlier ones to ensure a consistent experience for users who are used to working with shells. Shells have a whole bunch of control sequences which actually pre-date the graphical user interface, the clipboard itself, and even screens!</p><p>Some of the control sequences used in the shell you might already be familiar with. For example, if you have a program running and want to cancel it, you might be used to using <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>C</code>. This actually sends a <em>signal</em> to the program and typically the program responds by closing. We'll see signals again and again as we go through the book.</p><p>The <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>C</code> combination terminates the current program. What about <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>V</code>? This is the grand-sounding “<em>Verbatim Insert</em>” command. It tells the shell to write out the <em>next</em> keystroke you give it. This allows you to write out ‘special’ characters like the escape key, left or right keys, or even the <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>V</code> combination itself.</p><p>So if you type <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>V</code> twice, the shell writes out the text <code>^V</code>. The hat symbol <code>^</code> represents <code>Ctrl</code>. The first command tells the shell to write out the following command, the second is then written out directly. You can try writing out some different sequences. You'll see various odd looking symbols drawn, which represent things like the <code>Alt</code> key and other special keys.</p><p>So why do we need to care? Well the shell already has a command for <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>C</code> and <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>V</code>, so we're going to need to work around this to use our familiar ‘copy’ and ‘paste’ commands.</p><p>How this works varies across platforms. Follow the instructions below for the platform you are using.</p><p><strong>Windows</strong></p><p>If you are using a <em>Command Prompt</em>, then the usual shortcuts will work fine. However, most of the time we will be using Bash. In this case the shortcuts will <em>not</em> work. Instead, select the <em>Use Ctrl+Shift+C/V as Copy/Paste</em> option from the properties menu:</p><p><img alt="Screenshot: Use Ctrl+Shift+C/V as Copy/Paste on Bash on Windows" src="https://effective-shell.com/docs/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/4-clipboard-gymnastics/images/windows-bash-options.png" width="380px"></p><p>You can now use <code>Ctrl+Shift+C</code> for copy and <code>Ctrl+Shift+V</code> for paste. You can also copy text by just dragging the cursor over it with the right mouse button.</p><p><strong>Linux</strong></p><p>On most Linux systems you'll be using the Gnome terminal, which means that you can use <code>Ctrl+Shift+C</code> for copy and <code>Ctrl+Shift+V</code> for paste. You can also right click on text with the cursor to select it.</p><p><strong>MacOS</strong></p><p>Mac users can just use <code>⌘ + C</code> for copy and <code>⌘ + V</code> for paste. The shell doesn't use the special Mac Command character <code>⌘</code>, which means the default keyboard mappings on MacOS work fine in a shell as they do not clash with anything.</p><p>Now that we've got the basics out of the way, and learnt far more than we probably wanted to about control keys, we can look at more ways to use the clipboard.</p><h2 id="preparing-the-clipboard-commands">Preparing the Clipboard Commands</h2><p>Copying and pasting text to and from the clipboard is useful, but there's a lot more we can do. With a couple of basic commands we can hugely expand what we can do with the shell and make a whole set of everyday tasks far easier to accomplish.</p><p>There is one small complexity we'll need to work through before we continue. The complexity is that the clipboard is accessed in different ways on Windows, Linux and MacOS. I'll first show you how to deal with this, just follow the instructions for the platform you are working on.</p><p>To make things easier for the reader I'm going to assume you have created the <code>pbcopy</code> and <code>pbpaste</code> commands by following the instructions below. I am creating these commands so that regardless of the platform you are using the tutorials will work in the same way!</p><p><strong>Windows</strong></p><p>Assuming you are using WSL, you will need to run the following two commands. By the time this book is published there <em>may</em> be a cleaner way, but for now this is a workaround for some limitations on the WSL system:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sh">alias pbcopy<span>=</span><span>"clip.exe"</span>
alias pbpaste<span>=</span><span>"</span><span>powershell.exe -command 'Get-Clipboard' | sed -e 's/\r\n</span>$<span>//g'</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Don't worry about how these commands work - by the time you've gone through the book it should make perfect sense. For now you just need to know we're adding two new commands to our toolkit - <code>pbcopy</code> and <code>pbpaste</code>, which will work in Bash on Windows.</p><p><strong>Linux</strong></p><p>Hopefully if you are Linux user the commands below will seem familiar. They install the <code>xclip</code> program and create shortcuts to copy and paste. You absolutely don't need to do this if you prefer to call <code>xclip</code> directly, these commands are just setup so that across all platforms the tutorial looks the same.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sh">sudo apt install -y xclip
alias pbcopy<span>=</span><span>"xclip -selection c"</span>
alias pbpaste<span>=</span><span>"xclip -selection c -o"</span>
</code></pre></div><p><strong>MacOS</strong></p><p>Nothing is required on MacOS - <code>pbcopy</code> and <code>pbpaste</code> are built in.</p><p><strong>Making these changes permanent</strong></p><p>We've used the <code>alias</code> command to create <code>pbcopy</code> and <code>pbpaste</code>. In Bash (and most shells) an <code>alias</code> is something you can configure as a shortcut to avoid having to type longer commands. There's a whole chapter on commands in Section 2.</p><p>These instructions will need to be repeated when you re-open your terminal. In a later chapter we'll see how to make permanent customisations to our shells so that we don't have to repeat this setup.</p><p>We'll also see later on how to create configuration which works across many different platforms, so that you can use the same configuration regardless of what platform you are working on. This is very useful if you work across multiple machines or operating systems!</p><h2 id="copy-and-paste-basics">Copy and Paste Basics</h2><p>Now that we've created these commands, we can use them to access the clipboard. For example, if I copy the following text:</p><pre><code>Kirk Van Houten
Timothy Lovejoy
Artie Ziff
</code></pre><p>Then I can paste it into the shell with the following command:</p><p>And we'll see something like this:</p><p><img src="https://effective-shell.com/docs/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/4-clipboard-gymnastics/images/pbpaste.png" alt="Screenshot: pbpaste in action"></p><p>Copying is just as straightforward. If you have downloaded the Effective Shell ‘playground’ folder you can see we have a list of characters from “The Simpsons” in the file <code>playground/text/simpsons-characters.txt</code>. Now we <em>could</em> use the <code>cat</code> command to show the contents of the file, and then manually select the text and copy it. Even easier though is to just <em>pipe</em> the contents of the file to the <code>pbcopy</code> command:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sh">cat ~/playground/text/simpsons-characters.txt | pbcopy
</code></pre></div><p>The output will look similar to the below (I've included the output of <code>cat</code> for reference as well):</p><p><img src="https://effective-shell.com/docs/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/4-clipboard-gymnastics/images/pbcopy.png" alt="Screenshot: pbcopy in action"></p><p>The vertical bar <code>|</code> is the <em>pipe</em> operator. It tells the shell to take the output from the command on the left and send it straight to the <em>input</em> of the program on the right. We're going to see a <em>lot</em> more of the pipeline operator as we continue. For now it's enough to know you can use it to ‘chain’ commands together.</p><p>This might not seem super useful so far - but if the text file was a lot larger then it would be much harder to <code>cat</code> it out, use the mouse to select all of the text (scrolling up through the window) and then copy it. And if you didn't have a mouse, it would be even more tricky. We're aiming to be as effective as possible when using the shell so being able to use the keyboard quickly for common tasks is critical.</p><p>Now we can see some real world examples of how these commands can be useful in daily tasks!</p><h2 id="removing-formatting">Removing Formatting</h2><p>Don't you hate it when you have to copy formatted text and don't have an easy way to paste it as <em>unformatted</em> text? Here's an example, I want to copy this Wikipedia page on ‘bash’, and paste it into a Word document:</p><p><img src="https://effective-shell.com/docs/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/4-clipboard-gymnastics/images/strip-formatting-before.png" alt="Copying and pasting with formatting"></p><p>Many programs have a shortcut to paste the contents of the clipboard (such as ‘command + shift + v’) but if you are like me you might find yourself pasting <em>into</em> a plain text editor just to copy <em>out</em> the plain text.</p><p>If you just run the command <code>pbpaste | pbcopy</code>, you can easily strip the formatting:</p><p><img src="https://effective-shell.com/docs/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/4-clipboard-gymnastics/images/strip-formatting-after.png" alt="Stripping formatting from the clipboard"></p><p>We're just piping out the clipboard (which ends up as plain text, cause we're in a terminal!) and then piping that plain text <em>back into the clipboard</em>, replacing the formatted text which was there before.</p><p>This little trick can be very useful. But we can use the same pattern to quickly manipulate the contents of the clipboard in more sophisticated ways.</p><h2 id="sorting-text">Sorting Text</h2><p>Because we can <em>pipe</em> the contents of the clipboard to other programs, that means we can easily use the huge number of tools available …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div>
<p>Cloud-native applications are on the rise thanks to the scalability and flexibility they provide. However, this type of architecture has its own challenges. Implementing a CI/CD pipeline will solve most of them, like <strong>defining delivery procedures, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://microtica.com/cracking-the-continuous-deployment-code/" target="_blank">delivering applications independently</a>, and gaining observability of the numerous building blocks in a system</strong> are some of them.</p>



<p>A CI/CD pipeline is the key to <strong>automating the steps of the software delivery process</strong>. This includes initiating code builds, running automated tests, and deploying to a testing or production environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One CI/CD <strong>pipeline</strong> consists of multiple steps executed one after another or in parallel. There are two known pipeline syntaxes — <strong>Scripted </strong>and <strong>Declarative</strong>. The key difference between them is their flexibility. </p>



<p>Although both syntaxes are based on Groovy DSL, the <strong>Scripted Pipeline Syntax</strong> is less restrictive. It also allows almost anything that can be done in Groovy. This means that the script can easily become hard to read and write.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, the <strong>Declarative syntax </strong>is more restrictive and provides a well-defined structure, which is ideal for simpler CI/CD pipelines. This syntax supports the “pipeline as code” concept. Therefore, you can write in a file that can be checked into a source control management system like Git. </p>



<p>In order to make it more convenient for developers to set up a CI/CD pipeline, <strong><a href="https://www.microtica.com/">Microtica</a> supports the Declarative syntax to define build procedures along with the source code</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Declarative CI/CD pipelines</strong></h2>



<p>For the pipeline process to work, each component/microservice should have a file named <strong><em>microtica.yaml </em></strong>on the root level in its source code. This file contains the specification of the build process. </p>



<p>During the build process, Microtica extracts the specification from the code. Then, it creates a state machine to drive the defined process.</p>



<blockquote><p>In order to ensure a single source of truth for pipeline specification, Microtica does NOT allow changes in the Build pipelines from the UI. Changes will only take effect from the YAML file provided in each source code repository. We find this very helpful in avoiding possible confusion of definition, maintenance, and, most importantly, debugging problems in the process.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<h2><strong>Define a CI/CD pipeline</strong></h2>



<p>There are no limitations to the steps of the build pipeline that you can define. Here is one example of a <strong><em>microtica.yaml </em></strong>file that defines a <strong>build pipeline for NodeJS application</strong>. This pipeline executes three particular commands defined in the <em>commands </em>section.</p>



<pre><code>Pipeline:
 StartAt: Build
 States:
   Build:
     Type: Task
     Resource: microtica.actions.cmd
     Parameters:
       commands:
       - npm install
       - npm test
       - npm prune --production
       sourceLocation: "$.trigger.source.location"
       artifacts: true
     End: true</code></pre>



<ul><li><strong><em>Pipeline</em></strong><em> — </em>is the root key which defines the start of the pipeline section</li><li><strong><em>StartAt</em></strong><em> — </em>defines the first action of the pipeline</li><li><strong><em>States</em></strong><em> — </em>defines a list of states for the particular pipeline</li><li><strong><em>Type</em></strong><em> — a </em>type of pipeline action. Always set it to <em>Task</em>.</li><li>Resource — an action that the engine will use. Currently, we support <em>microtica.actions.cmd</em>, an action that executes bash scripting.</li><li>Parameters — a set of parameters that are given to the action<ul><li><strong><em>commands</em></strong><em> — </em>a list of bash commands. Here, you define your custom scripts for build, test, code quality checks, etc.</li><li><strong><em>sourceLocation</em></strong> — the location where the action can find the source code. You should NOT change this. Once pulled from the Git repository, Microtica stores the artifacts on a location specified by the user for the particular component/microservice. <em>$.trigger.source.location</em> defines that location.</li><li><strong><em>artifacts</em></strong> — a value that defines that this build will produce artifacts which will be stored in S3 and used during deployment. Set this value should to <em>false</em> in case the artifact of the build is Docker image</li></ul></li><li><strong><em>End</em></strong><em> — </em>defines that this is the last action in the pipeline.</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://www.microtica.com/">Microtica</a> supports bash commands for the execution action. In the future, we are planning to allow developers to define their own custom actions.</p>



<h2>Getting a Docker image ready for deployment</h2>



<p>Let’s create an extended pipeline from the example above, adding an additional step to prepare a Docker image for deployment:</p>



<pre><code>Pipeline:
  StartAt: Build
  States:
    Build:
      Type: Task
      Resource: microtica.actions.cmd
      Parameters:
        environmentVariables:
          pipelineId: "$.pipeline.id"
          version: "$.commit.version"
        commands:
        - echo Starting build procedure...
        - npm install
        - npm test

        - echo Logging in to Amazon ECR...
        - $(aws ecr get-login --region $AWS_REGION --no-include-email)

        - echo Checking if repository exists in ECR. If not, create one
        - repoExists=`aws ecr describe-repositories --query "repositories[?repositoryName=='$pipelineId']" --output text`
        - if [ -z "$repoExists" ]; then aws ecr create-repository --repository-name $pipelineId; fi

        - awsAccountId=$(echo $CODEBUILD_BUILD_ARN | cut -d':' -f 5)
        - artifactLocation=$awsAccountId.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/$pipelineId

        - echo Build Docker image...
        - docker build -t $pipelineId .
        - docker tag $pipelineId $artifactLocation:$version
        - docker tag $pipelineId $artifactLocation:latest

        - echo Push Docker image
        - docker push $artifactLocation
        sourceLocation: "$.source.location"
        artifacts: false
      End: true</code></pre>



<p>In this example, we first inject environment variables in the step runtime with <em>environmentVariables</em> parameter (<em>$.pipeline.id</em> and <em>$.commit.version</em> are both provided by Microtica).</p>



<p>The CI/CD pipeline in the latest example starts by executing necessary instructions to build and test the code. Once this is done, Microtica creates an ECR repository if it doesn’t already exist.</p>



<p>Once we have the ECR repository in place, the last step is to build a new Docker image and then push it in the repository.</p>

<p>After you define the <strong><em>microtica.yaml </em></strong>file with the build pipeline, you can <strong>automate</strong> your build process in Microtica when you create the component or microservice with the wizard in the portal. This option will add a webhook to your repository. </p>



<p>A webhook is a listener that triggers a build process whenever you <strong>push new code to your repository branch</strong>. This way, you can be sure that you’re always working with the newest changes.</p>



<p>Building the docker image gave us an artifact so we can deploy it in a Kubernetes cluster.&nbsp;<strong>You can do this from&nbsp;<em>Microservice details — Add to Cluster</em>, or in the<em>&nbsp;Kubernetes Dashboard — Microservices — Deploy.</em></strong></p>

<p>When you deploy your microservice in a Kubernetes Cluster&nbsp;you can select the scaling options. Moreover, you can also set up <strong>continuous delivery</strong> for your microservice.</p>

<p>Once you trigger a build manually or automatically, follow the build process in the portal and see the events in real-time. If the build fails, it will mark it with red on the screen and it will show the error in the logs.</p>



<p>Follow all the pipelines for your components and microservices in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://portal.microtica.com/pipelines" target="_blank">Pipelines overview page</a> and track their status. Microtica will mark a pipeline as not healthy if there are several failed builds detected. </p>



<p>From this page, you can access any build in the history of your project. More importantly, you can also and inspect the logs to find the problems.</p>

<p>We are strong advocates for automated pipelines as they <strong>remove manual errors.</strong> Moreover, they are crucial for reliable and sustainable software delivery. </p>



<p>They make software developers <strong>more productive,</strong> releasing them from the need to perform pipeline steps manually. Most importantly, they reduce the stress around new product releases.</p>

What if you could debug type errors with a simple compile time print statement? Write highly flexible systems by being able to introspect into types at compile time? Pre-calculate large portions of your programs for great efficiency? Typed functional programming is a great and fun way to write resilient software, and as type systems have become more and more expressive in recent years, we are able to program sophisticated and useful properties at the type level for even better compile time safety. Just one problem: It is very difficult, requires advanced knowledge of the type system, the syntax is convoluted, the error messages are impenetrable, and it is nearly impossible to debug. This talk will dive into why we should steal static introspection from languages like Nim, and D, state-of-the-art imperative programming languages which can solve all these issues, make type systems much more approachable without losing any expressive power, and offer new design possibilities for functional programs.</em></p><p id="bf8b"><em>Join us on Zoom: </em><a href="https://zoom.us/j/95139644343" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>https://zoom.us/j/95139644343</em></a></p><p id="f699"><em>Join us on YouTube: </em><a href="https://youtu.be/yGq0KnkqOgI" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>https://youtu.be/yGq0KnkqOgI</em></a></p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1440/0*Koxyxq-wrBx9iGfe" width="720" height="405" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*Koxyxq-wrBx9iGfe 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*Koxyxq-wrBx9iGfe 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*Koxyxq-wrBx9iGfe 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*Koxyxq-wrBx9iGfe 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*Koxyxq-wrBx9iGfe?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="31bb"><em>Many things are being said about Deep Reinforcement Learning, but sometimes it is really hard to know where to start.

We will showcase how this feature is not only what makes standard Julia code as fast as C or Fortran, but also allows Julia to eschew the traditional idea of â€œmachine learning frameworksâ€� and instead have machine learning directly work on the standard functions and libraries of the whole Julia programming language. This language-wide differentiable programming then builds a foundation where existing climate models, helicopter simulations, and efficiency simulators for battery-powered airplanes can be instantly composed with new tools for machine learning, and we will demonstrate how this has changed the way that researchers in Julia do science.</em></p><p id="c5ec"><em>Join us on Zoom: </em><a href="https://zoom.us/j/94906592252" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>https://zoom.us/j/94906592252</em></a></p><p id="a3b3"><em>Join us on YouTube: </em><a href="https://youtu.be/fbKHLdoG7wA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>https://youtu.be/fbKHLdoG7wA</em></a></p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1440/0*2EbV5-0r03R6aPYH" width="720" height="405" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*2EbV5-0r03R6aPYH 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*2EbV5-0r03R6aPYH 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*2EbV5-0r03R6aPYH 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*2EbV5-0r03R6aPYH 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*2EbV5-0r03R6aPYH?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="8dae"><em>A tour of the last 3 years of my career where Iâ€™ve productionized 3 different machine learning projects on kind-of-a-big-company (Despegar).

    <section>
        <p>Mom would be ashamed of you if you wrote a function like</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a><span>const</span> nameOfLandlordsDog <span>=</span> person <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2"></a>  <span>const</span> landlord <span>=</span> <span>person</span>.<span>landlord</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3"></a>  <span>if</span> (<span>!</span>landlord) <span>return</span> <span>null</span></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4"></a>  <span>const</span> dog <span>=</span> <span>landlord</span>.<span>dog</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5"></a>  <span>if</span> (<span>!</span>dog) <span>return</span> <span>null</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a href="#cb1-6"></a>  <span>return</span> <span>dog</span>.<span>name</span></span>
<span id="cb1-7"><a href="#cb1-7"></a><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>For one thing, it’s Javascript. The neighbors might begin to talk if they found out about your double life as a Javascript enthusiast. What’s more, there’s too much <em>plumbing</em> in this function, too much <code>if (blah) return null</code>. Wouldn’t it be much better if you wrote something like</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>const</span> nameOfLandlordsDog <span>=</span> person <span>=&gt;</span> person<span>?</span>.<span>landlord</span><span>?</span>.<span>dog</span><span>?</span>.<span>name</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>?.</code> optional chaining operator is still technically “plumbing”. But the business logic here is much more apparent; moreover, this is significantly less Javascript, maybe even little enough to quell the growing rumors of your Javascriptian proclivities.</p>
<p>You don’t really want to write this, either:</p>

<span id="cb3-13"><a href="#cb3-13"></a><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This, too, is rife with plumbing. A <code>callback</code> parameter in every function call? An <code>if (err) return callback(err)</code> in every corner? Revolting! Do you kiss your mother with that Javascript?</p>
<p>It would be far more pleasant if you wrote:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a><span>const</span> bookMeeting <span>=</span> <span>async</span> (participants<span>,</span> room<span>,</span> details) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span>

<span id="cb4-9"><a href="#cb4-9"></a><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Again, “await” is plumbing, but much more succinct plumbing. Mom will forgive you, this once.</p>
<p>She is, however, a real stickler for transactionality. I wouldn’t be surprised if she asked you for a version of <code>bookMeeting</code> that rolls back if an operation is not successful.</p>

<p>It’s a monstrosity! It is littered with <code>try</code> and <code>catch</code>. That <code>for</code> loop is obscene! Show that to Mom, and she’ll have a lawyer over by lunch time to draw up her will, just so she can write you out of it.</p>
<p>You’re better off with something like:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1"></a><span>const</span> bookMeeting <span>=</span> (transaction<span>,</span> participants<span>,</span> room<span>,</span> details) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2"></a>  <span>room</span>.<span>calendar</span>.<span>addMeeting</span>(transaction<span>,</span> details)</span>
<span id="cb6-3"><a href="#cb6-3"></a>  <span>participants</span>.<span>map</span>(participant <span>=&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb6-4"><a href="#cb6-4"></a>    <span>participant</span>.<span>calendar</span>.<span>addMeeting</span>(transaction<span>,</span> details)</span>
<span id="cb6-5"><a href="#cb6-5"></a>  )</span>
<span id="cb6-6"><a href="#cb6-6"></a>  <span>participants</span>.<span>map</span>(participant <span>=&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb6-7"><a href="#cb6-7"></a>    <span>sendEmail</span>(transaction<span>,</span> <span>participant</span>.<span>email</span><span>,</span> <span>meetingEmail</span>(details)</span>
<span id="cb6-8"><a href="#cb6-8"></a>  )</span>
<span id="cb6-9"><a href="#cb6-9"></a>  <span>return</span> transaction</span>
<span id="cb6-10"><a href="#cb6-10"></a><span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb6-11"><a href="#cb6-11"></a><span>// And then the caller can do e.g.</span></span>
<span id="cb6-12"><a href="#cb6-12"></a></span>
<span id="cb6-13"><a href="#cb6-13"></a><span>const</span> tx <span>=</span> <span>newTransaction</span>()</span>
<span id="cb6-14"><a href="#cb6-14"></a><span>bookMeeting</span>(tx<span>,</span> participants<span>,</span> room<span>,</span> details)</span>
<span id="cb6-15"><a href="#cb6-15"></a><span>await</span> <span>tx</span>.<span>run</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You have to implement the right <code>newTransaction</code> and the right <code>.run</code>, and lug this magical “transaction” object around, and implement <code>addMeeting</code> and <code>runMeeting</code> to interact with the transaction correctly, but in the end it’s worth it, the plumbing is much reduced. Explicit praise from Mom might be too much to hope for, but perhaps a half-smile, laced with the merest hint of approval? That could go a long way.</p>
<p>If we’re really going to lock in that half-smile, though, we’re going to have to do more.</p>
<p>We addressed one type of plumbing with <code>?.</code>, another type of plumbing with <code>async/await</code>, and another type of plumbing with a handcrafted <code>transaction</code> object. What if there were some single abstraction that captured this idea of “plumbing” more generally? Wouldn’t it be incredible?</p>
<p>Good news! It is incredible – and the antecedent of “it”, as you may have guessed, is “Monads.”</p>
<p>What are monads, exactly? Don’t worry about that, for now. That’s kind of like asking “what is TCP, exactly?” You can use TCP to reliably send messages over a network, and that’s really all you need to know to get started. Sure, one fine morning you’ll wake up to servers crashing down around your ears for reasons involving something called <code>TIME_WAIT</code>, and on that day you’ll begin to tackle the remainder of what there is to know about TCP, but the inevitability of that day shouldn’t prevent you from living a happy, carefree life in the meanwhile. Similarly, all you need to know about monads to get started – as far as I am concerned, anyway – is that you can use them to define the “plumbing” inside your code separately from defining those sequences of operations that your “plumbing” connects. Where “plumbing” can be anything from “short-circuit when an operation returns a null”, or “short-circuit when an operation returns an error”, or “short-circuit when an operation returns an error and roll back all the previous operations”, or even “when an operation returns multiple results, feed each of those results separately into the next operation”</p>
<p>So let’s recap all the examples in this blog post, but do it in Haskell, which has good support for monads. Don’t worry if you’re not familiar with Haskell – the point isn’t that you will follow and understand every statement, but that you can see the “before” and “after” of Monads removing the “plumbing” from the implementations.</p>
<p>Here is <code>nameOfLandlordsDog</code> again, without monads, but in Haskell:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1"></a><span>nameOfLandlordsDog ::</span> <span>Person</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2"></a>nameOfLandlordsDog person <span>=</span> </span>
<span id="cb7-3"><a href="#cb7-3"></a>  <span>case</span> landlordOf person <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb7-4"><a href="#cb7-4"></a>    <span>Nothing</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Nothing</span></span>
<span id="cb7-5"><a href="#cb7-5"></a>    <span>Just</span> landlord <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> dogOf landlord <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb7-6"><a href="#cb7-6"></a>      <span>Nothing</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Nothing</span></span>
<span id="cb7-7"><a href="#cb7-7"></a>      <span>Just</span> dog <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> nameOf dog <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb7-8"><a href="#cb7-8"></a>        <span>Nothing</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Nothing</span></span>
<span id="cb7-9"><a href="#cb7-9"></a>        <span>Just</span> name <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Just</span> name</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Even more plumbing-ridden than <code>if (!blah) return null</code>, right? Luckily, because <code>Maybe</code> is a monad, you can instead write:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1"></a>nameOfLandlordsDog person <span>=</span> nameOf <span>=&lt;&lt;</span> dogOf <span>=&lt;&lt;</span> landlordOf person</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Where <code>=&lt;&lt;</code> is like Javascript’s <code>?.</code>. It is the (reverse) monadic “bind” operator that combines operations together, according to the particular “plumbing” of the monad they are in. For the <code>Maybe</code> monad, the plumbing behavior is “short circuit on Nothing”.</p>
<p>Using <code>=&lt;&lt;</code> (or its twin <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>) is a good way to succinctly string together simple sequences of operations that return <code>Maybe</code> or other monads. But Haskell has a special notation called “do notation” that is often more readable when you have to combine the results of operations in a more complicated way than simple sequencing. So here is <code>nameOfLandlordsDog</code> with do notation:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1"></a><span>nameOfLandlordsDog ::</span> <span>Person</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2"><a href="#cb9-2"></a>nameOfLandlordsDog person <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb9-3"><a href="#cb9-3"></a>  landlord <span>&lt;-</span> landlordOf person</span>
<span id="cb9-4"><a href="#cb9-4"></a>  dog <span>&lt;-</span> dogOf landlord</span>
<span id="cb9-5"><a href="#cb9-5"></a>  nameOf dog</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This isn’t as succinct as the <code>=&lt;&lt;</code> version, but it is still pretty cool. The equivalent in Javascript would be if there were this magical “plumbing” keyword that let you write e.g.:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1"></a><span>const</span> nameOfLandlordsDog <span>=</span> (person) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2"><a href="#cb10-2"></a>  <span>plumbing</span> (shortcircuit_nulls) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb10-3"><a href="#cb10-3"></a>    <span>const</span> landlord <span>=</span> <span>person</span>.<span>landlord</span></span>
<span id="cb10-4"><a href="#cb10-4"></a>    <span>const</span> dog <span>=</span> <span>landlord</span>.<span>dog</span></span>
<span id="cb10-5"><a href="#cb10-5"></a>    <span>return</span> <span>dog</span>.<span>name</span></span>
<span id="cb10-6"><a href="#cb10-6"></a>  <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb10-7"><a href="#cb10-7"></a><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>and then you can just write your code so you just don’t have to worry about short-circuiting on nulls.</p>
<p>So now let’s move on to the next example: <code>bookMeeting</code>. Here it is in Haskell, written with callbacks (or in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style">“continuation-passing style”</a>, which is the fancy way to say “callbacks”). You wouldn’t write Haskell with callbacks in typical circumstances, but for the sake of the example here it is (<a href="https://repl.it/@twitchard/MomAndMonads#bookMeetingCallbacks.hs">full example</a>):</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1"></a><span>bookMeeting ::</span> [<span>Person</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Room</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Details</span> <span>-&gt;</span> (<span>Either</span> <span>String</span> () <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> r) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> r</span>
<span id="cb11-2"><a href="#cb11-2"></a>bookMeeting participants room details callback <span>=</span> </span>
<span id="cb11-3"><a href="#cb11-3"></a>  addMeeting details (calendarOf room) <span>$</span> \result <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> result <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb11-4"><a href="#cb11-4"></a>    <span>Left</span> err <span>-&gt;</span> callback (<span>Left</span> err)</span>
<span id="cb11-5"><a href="#cb11-5"></a>    <span>Right</span> () <span>-&gt;</span> forEach participants </span>
<span id="cb11-6"><a href="#cb11-6"></a>      (\p <span>-&gt;</span> addMeeting details (calendarOf p)) <span>$</span> \results <span>-&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb11-7"><a href="#cb11-7"></a>        <span>case</span> results <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb11-8"><a href="#cb11-8"></a>          <span>Left</span> err <span>-&gt;</span> callback (<span>Left</span> err)</span>
<span id="cb11-9"><a href="#cb11-9"></a>          <span>Right</span> _ <span>-&gt;</span> forEach participants (\p <span>-&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb11-10"><a href="#cb11-10"></a>            sendEmail details (emailOf p)) callback</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Again, the plumbing here is out of control. Mom is irate! If you’re going to write code like this, why don’t you just do in it Javascript, or dance on her grave?</p>
<p>Luckily for us, Haskell has a monad that captures “callbacks that short-circuit on error”. This monad is called <code>ExceptT Error (ContT r IO)</code>, and the reason it has such a confusing name is because it’s actually a combination of three monads: <code>Except String</code>, which is the monad that captures short-circuiting on errors (specifically, errors of type String), <code>Cont</code>, which is the monad that captures sequential execution of functions that accept callbacks, and <code>IO</code>, which is the monad that lets you do IO – access the network and the operating system and stuff.</p>
<p>So first, with a bit of boilerplate, we can wrap the callbacky <code>addMeeting</code> and <code>sendEmail</code> operations in this monad:</p>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1"><a href="#cb12-1"></a><span>addMeeting ::</span> <span>Details</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Calendar</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>ExceptT</span> <span>String</span> (<span>ContT</span> r <span>IO</span>) ()</span>
<span id="cb12-2"><a href="#cb12-2"></a>addMeeting details calendar <span>=</span></span>
<span id="cb12-3"><a href="#cb12-3"></a>  <span>ExceptT</span> <span>.</span> <span>ContT</span> <span>.</span> Callbacks.addMeeting details <span>$</span> calendar</span>
<span id="cb12-4"><a href="#cb12-4"></a></span>
<span id="cb12-5"><a href="#cb12-5"></a><span>sendEmail ::</span> <span>Details</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Email</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>ExceptT</span> <span>String</span> (<span>ContT</span> r <span>IO</span>) ()</span>
<span id="cb12-6"><a href="#cb12-6"></a>sendEmail details email <span>=</span></span>
<span id="cb12-7"><a href="#cb12-7"></a>  <span>ExceptT</span> <span>.</span> <span>ContT</span> <span>.</span> Callbacks.sendEmail details <span>$</span> email</span></code></pre></div>
<p>then we can implement <code>bookMeeting</code> …</p></section></article></div></div>

<p>Our spunky little Honda Fit is now 13 years old, and although it has served us well, we have begun to outgrow it.</p>

<p>I started researching minivans, and one particular online-only auto seller seemed to have an attractive inventory.</p>

<p>So I decided to create an account with them and set up some filters and alerts.</p>

<p>But creating an account was harder than it appeared.</p>

<p>I entered my email address on their sign-up page.  The input field immediately turned red, and the page informed me that my email address was invalid.</p>

<p>I encounter this problem occasionally, because I use subaddressing in my email address.</p>

<p>A normal email address looks like this: <code>username@domain.com</code>.</p>

<p>When you use subaddressing, you tack on a little extra bit between your username and the @ sign: <code>username+subaddress@domain.com</code>.</p>

<p>When the site emails you, the subaddress gets ignored for the purpose of routing the message to you, 
   but it shows up in the "To" field of the email address.  That can be tremendously useful.  It allows
   you to set up filters to always allow or always deny messages that include a specific subaddress,
   and it can sometimes be used to determine whether a site has had a data breach or sold your contact
   information to spammers.</p>

<p>Although subaddressing is widely supported by email service providers, including Google's Gmail, it continues to trip up sites
   that perform email address validation using regular expressions, also known by the abbreviation regex.</p>
   
<p>Regex allows site developers to specify what a valid email address looks like.  
   It can determine whether an email address contains invalid characters, or whether it's missing an @ sign.</p>
   
<p>The problem is, valid email addresses come in many forms, and many regular expressions used to validate email addresses
   are not able to recognize the full range of valid formats.</p>
   
<p>In the case of the auto seller's form validation, I was able to inspect their Javascript code.
   The portion of the email validation regex that deals with the username (the part before the @ sign)
   looks like this:</p>
   
<p><code>^[_a-zA-Z0-9-]+(\.[_a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*</code></p>

<p>The key thing about this regex snippet is that the only characters that are considered valid are
   alphanumeric characters, hyphens, underscores, and periods.</p>
   
<p>If a plus sign is present, as when using subaddressing, it treats the email address as invalid, even though it is perfectly valid
   — and has been for years.</p>
   
<p>While it's frustrating that many sites continue to reject email addresses that use subaddressing, I have a Plan B.</p>

<p>I instead use a secondary email address without subaddressing, which is associated with <a href="https://newlywed.science/">newlywed.science</a>,
   a domain I use to promote my book <i>Experiments for Newlyweds</i>.</p>
   
<p>I entered that email address into the sign-up form, but again I was informed that it was invalid.</p>

<p>I took another look at the email validation regex and discovered an even stupider issue.</p>

<p>Here is the portion of their email validation regex that deals with the domain (the part after the @ sign):</p>
   
<p><code>[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*(\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4})$</code></p>

<p>The relevant part of this snippet is at the very end.  It says that the top-level domain (TLD) must be between two and four letters long.</p>

<p>The most well-known TLDs, such as .com, .org, .net, .edu, and .gov, tend to have three letters.  
   Country-specific TLDs, such as .uk or .de, tend to have two letters.</p>
   
<p>But starting around the turn of the century, more and more new TLDs came into use.  
   For instance, .museum became active in June 2001, and .travel began accepting registrations in January 2006.</p>
   
<p>So TLDs that exceed four letters in length have been around for quite a while.</p>

<p>Yet anyone with an email address associated with such a TLD is locked out of creating an account with this auto seller because of this regex.</p>

<p>It's frustrating that major websites continue to rely on such shoddy email address validation, and this time I decided to make my frustration known.</p>

<p>I searched around for a contact email address on the site, but the best I could find was a Live Chat feature.</p>

<p>So, at 2 p.m. Eastern, I opened a Live Chat session and encouraged them to fix their terrible regex.</p>

<p>A robo-responder informed me that unfortunately, my message could not be handled, because Live Chat is only available between 8 a.m. and 8:45 p.m. Eastern.</p>

<p><em>Thet Lynn Han, known as Ricky Thet, is the 36-year-old founder and CEO of Bagan IT. The Myanmar-based development company has been operating since 2010, when Thet moved back to Myanmar from Singapore. Bagan’s products include a local-language keyboard, an e-bookstore, and a fortune-telling service.</em></p>



<h3><strong>Are we coders or phone fixers?</strong></h3>



<p>When my <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-16546688">country began to change</a> in 2010, to open up, I knew I wanted to be part of building the new Myanmar. But, at that time, there was none of the basic infrastructure the rest of the world takes for granted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My parents wanted me to be a doctor, but I loved computers. I couldn’t study computer science in Myanmar when I graduated from high school in 2000, so I left for Singapore to study and then stayed there to work.</p>



<p>During the ten years I was&nbsp;living in Singapore, I wanted to read books in Burmese, but back then, almost none of them were digitized. You had to have a hard copy. So when I came back,<strong> </strong>I<strong> </strong>wanted to put Burmese-language books online.&nbsp;</p>



	




<p>In 2012, when we launched our first apps, very <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IT.NET.USER.ZS?locations=MM">few people were online</a> in Myanmar, and data was very expensive. People would often turn off their data when they weren’t using it. That meant it was almost impossible to get user insights about what wasn’t working for users, and digital literacy was very low.</p>



<p>We began working with the mobile phone technicians at the local tuck shops where people buy and fix their phones. Often, when customers had issues with their phones or just didn’t know how to use certain features, they’d come back to the shops where they had purchased them and have the technicians help. We’d show these guys how to use our apps so they could answer a customer’s question about our products. If we were releasing something new, we’d let the technicians know, so they could tell their customers.</p>



<p>We had whole relationship teams who would travel around the country to meet with mobile shop owners, collect their insights, and show them how to use our latest applications.</p>



	




<h3><strong>One product at a time</strong></h3>



<p>Our first product was a Burmese-language keyboard. The most common Burmese font, Zawgyi, is not compatible with Unicode, the international standard for encoding fonts, and the background processing is based on the English language. This was especially an issue, because between 40% and 50% of the phones in Myanmar are Chinese phones made for the Chinese domestic market. All of these obstacles combined meant there were a lot of rendering issues and limitations for the Burmese font.</p>

<p>Google didn’t launch its Burmese-language keyboard in Myanmar until a few years ago, but we were here first. We could see what the Burmese people needed. Our keyboard currently has 10 million monthly active users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the Burmese keyboard, we tackled books. The publishers were suspicious of digitizing books at first, and it took years of building relationships with them to get the 10,000 books we have online now. Same thing with our fortune-telling app, Min Thein Kha, <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20200425-online-mystics-cash-in-during-myanmar-virus-lockdown">which has 50,000 daily active users</a>. Once the payments for the e-bookstore were running, it was a proof of concept we brought to the family of Min Thein Kha, the most famous Burmese fortune teller. They saw that the fortune tellers they worked with could get paid if they put their services on an app.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the biggest challenge was payments. Less than 2% of people in Myanmar have<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/sg/Documents/consumer-business/sea-cb-myanmar-consumer-survey-2020.pdf"> access to a credit card</a>, and <a href="https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/sites/globalfindex/files/countrybook/Myanmar.pdf">75% </a>are unbanked. We needed to find a different way to bill them.</p>



<p>The local telecom companies are the only entities that cover the whole population. We persuaded them to let us charge users for app-based purchases on their telephone bills, but we had to be very deliberate when designing to make it clear to people that that’s what they should expect. Even that was not a perfect solution; a credit card might charge you an extra 5% on top of your purchase. With the telecom companies, it could be anywhere from 45% to 60% in additional charges and fees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to partner with the telecom companies for billing, we needed to be able to ensure a minimum guaranteed revenue, so it was, and still is, very important that everything we built be attractive to our users. And we needed to demonstrate that we had the capacity to handle all of the customer support.</p>



<h3><strong>Building everything yourself</strong></h3>



<p>In other countries, these kinds of payment and customer-service systems&nbsp;would already be set up. Things are changing quickly here in Myanmar — mobile money is becoming more popular — but even now, I’d say only 30% of our work is building the apps, whereas 70% is dealing with these kinds of infrastructure issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, as things are progressing and more, and Burmese people are coming online and getting phones, we can call customers directly to get insights. We’re also getting some data using Facebook, but more than anything else, we rely on calling people for feedback.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the early years, we had an automatic refund policy —&nbsp;if someone said they were charged incorrectly, we’d give the money back, no questions asked. It’s an important way to build trust with people who are using apps like these for the first time. If we didn’t get it right, how would users ever trust something like mobile money?&nbsp;</p>



<p>We saw it as an investment in our users and in our future.</p>

			<p>APIs are everywhere within your organization. Many may be internal, but we’re willing to bet there are many third-party web services and APIs that your business depends on too. Keeping track of them all, and ensuring that your team chooses the best APIs for their needs can be a challenge. In some cases, your organization may be using an API they don’t even know about. The solution to this “web of APIs” is to apply the concept of API governance to your API dependencies.</p><h2 id="what-is-api-governance">What is API Governance?</h2><p>Before we go into applying the concept to third-party APIs, we should look at what API governance is.</p><p>API governance is a set of policies and procedures that act as <strong>guidelines for how your organization uses APIs</strong>. Governance is all about security and reliability. It can take many shapes, but it helps with things like:</p><ul><li>Establishing criteria for choosing APIs.</li><li>Defining any shared standards, like security, that APIs will share.</li><li>Aids in the discovery of existing APIs in the organization.</li><li>Laying out plans for usage, versioning, etc.</li></ul><p>This process makes a lot of sense when a good part of your stack is dedicated to providing APIs, but what about the external APIs that your organization consumes? Can you apply a similar approach to the APIs you depend on, even if you don’t have control over them?</p><h3 id="applying-the-idea-of-governance-to-third-party-apis">Applying the idea of governance to third-party APIs</h3><p>As your organization grows, there’s a high likelihood that every API consumed won’t be known. Development teams working on different products and services may have some overlap, but what are the chances of two teams signing up for the same API? What about choosing two differing APIs that serve the same purpose?</p><figure><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/06/blog-diagrams---governance.jpg" alt="Governance over APIs" srcset="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/blog-diagrams---governance.jpg 600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/blog-diagrams---governance.jpg 1000w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/blog-diagrams---governance.jpg 1600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w2400/2020/06/blog-diagrams---governance.jpg 2400w"></figure><p>For third party APIs, the governance process can lead to two key artifacts: an <strong>API catalog</strong> and a <strong>set of guidelines for choosing APIs</strong>. Let’s look at some API governance best practices, but applied to third-party API dependencies.</p><h2 id="api-catalogs">API Catalogs</h2><p>When we onboard new customers to Bearer, some often discover that their organization is using APIs they didn’t know about. This isn’t unique to giant organizations either. Even small teams can run into this problem. An API catalog can be a valuable way to centralize details about all the services and APIs that your organization uses. The format this catalog takes can change with the needs of your organization, but the benefits can directly affect your development teams as well as your business strategy. Let’s look at a few benefits, and things you may want to include in your own API catalog.</p><h3 id="increased-discoverability">Increased Discoverability</h3><p>By collecting details about each API, your team can create a centralized location for the whole organization. This allows teams to discover which SaaS providers you already have a relationship with, and which services are currently available. </p><p>This is also a great way to avoid duplication across teams, and avoids the selection of similar APIs that serve the same purpose.</p><h3 id="sla-tracking">SLA Tracking</h3><p>Service-level Agreements (SLA) are a contract between your organization and the API provider. It can often be hard to keep track of expectations at a high level. A central catalog of APIs offers a place for all SLA details to be stored.</p><p>You can take this a step further by incorporating monitoring to ensure that services are meeting their requirements, and even tie this directly into the catalog for at-a-glance oversight.</p><h3 id="centralized-test-coverage">Centralized Test Coverage</h3><p>While it may not be feasible or even possible to incorporate testing directly into an API catalog, it can be an excellent place to store coverage statistics. How are, or perhaps in the dark, are you about the last time tests were run on a particular API endpoint? Is it possible there is a rarely used API in your stack that has been down for a while, unbeknownst to your team? Bring the results into your API catalog.</p><h3 id="usage">Usage</h3><p>Are you paying for service that you no longer use? By tracking API usage across an entire organization, you can examine areas such as:</p><ul><li>Which teams are currently using an API?</li><li>Is the organization on the most cost-effective plan?</li><li>Are there multiple, similar APIs in use when a single one could suffice?</li><li>On <em>pay-as-you-go</em> plans where you pay for each call, are you often over budget?</li></ul><h3 id="knowledge-base">Knowledge Base</h3><p>The centralized test coverage portion covers part of this benefit, but your API catalog can act as a central knowledge base for every API in your organization. This can include things like:</p><ul><li>Internal documentation related to an API (like a Postman collection).</li><li>Links to status pages, official documentation, and examples.</li><li>Locations of credentials.</li><li>Points of contact for API consumers in each department.</li></ul><p>You can use an existing solution to create the catalog, though the space is mostly filled with API management platforms designed around providing internal APIs to your teams. Alternately, you can build your own solution or add the functionality to a tool you already use. This catalog is essentially a content management system (CMS) that stores the necessary information about each API as mentioned earlier.</p><p>Make the process of registering APIs to the catalog easy—or even automatic—for developers, as it will increase the adoption of the centralized hub.</p><h2 id="defining-api-selection-guidelines">Defining API Selection Guidelines</h2><p>How does your organization select which APIs to implement? Does each team—or developer—make decisions on their own? Is there an approval process? Are there restrictions on what kinds of APIs makes it into production? What about SLA requirements?</p><p>These questions, and others like them, are the foundation for defining a set of API selection guidelines. In many cases, you will be starting from a point of existing API dependencies. This is a good time to assess the landscape. Poll your teams, collect the data, and organize it. While existing APIs can be excluded from a selection policy, it is good to at least compare them to the guidelines you set. Start by defining the criteria that new APIs will need to meet. These criteria can include:</p><ul><li>A minimum set of SLA requirements (uptime guarantees, time to response, etc.).</li><li>Deprecation timelines and versioning details.</li><li>Cost vs. Value: Are there alternatives at lower costs? Is it worth it to build instead of buy?</li><li>Cross-team impact: Will an API be useful to more than one part of the organization.</li><li>Support availability: Does the price come with reliable support, both for the development with and management of the API?</li><li>Stack compatibility: What stacks have SDKs, and what would it take to continue using the API if your stack changes?</li><li>Ease of use and depth of documentation.</li><li>Data policy: Whether handling GDPR compliance or HIPPA laws, an API’s data policy has a direct impact on your own data management.</li></ul><h2 id="enforcing-governance-and-adding-value-to-your-organization">Enforcing governance and adding value to your organization</h2><p>With a catalog set up, and guidelines in place, enforcement keeps the process going. It’s important to establish a set of processes that doesn’t limit your teams ability to experiment and work efficiently, but also protects your organization from the shadow APIs that suddenly appear in your stack. Make sure the approval cycle is low-friction and the monitoring of new and existing APIs makes it easy to track usage.</p><p>Governance is a way to bring structure to your organization’s dependence on APIs, but it shouldn’t be yet another piece of technical debt. The good news is you don’t need to dive all-in right away. Simply starting to monitor API usage and performance across the organization as a whole is an excellent first step. At <a href="https://www.bearer.sh/">Bearer</a>, part of our offering helps with this by automatically monitoring API calls and organizing them in a central dashboard. This is one way to quickly view which APIs you are using effectively and monitor them from a performance, SLA, and anomaly standpoint. Explore ways to tie governance into your existing processes. The catalog can even live in your team’s internal knowledge base.</p><p>Take the first step toward adding more observability and oversight to the APIs that your organization uses. Set up a policy and implement the appropriate tooling to control and enforce the policy. This will help build a culture around scrutinizing and monitoring API dependencies and improve the overall resilience of your applications.<br></p>

		<div>

			
<p>For <a href="https://github.com/LeaVerou/css-almanac/issues/10">some of the statistics</a> we are going to study for this year’s Web Almanac we may end up needing a list of CSS shorthands and their longhands. Now this is typically done by <a href="https://github.com/LeaVerou/prefixfree/blob/gh-pages/prefixfree.js#L298">maintaining a data structure by hand</a> or <a href="https://github.com/LeaVerou/prefixfree/blob/gh-pages/prefixfree.js#L298">guessing based on property name structure</a>. But I knew that if we were going to do it by hand, it’s very easy to miss a few of the less popular ones, and the naming rule where shorthands are a prefix of their longhands <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Apr/0155.html">has failed to get standardized</a> and now has even more exceptions than it used to. And even if we do an incredibly thorough job, next year the data structure will be inaccurate, because CSS and its implementations evolve fast. The browser knows what the shorthands are, surely we should be able to get the information from it  …right? Then we could use it directly if this is a client-side library, or in the case of the Almanac, where code needs to be fast because it will run on millions of websites, paste the precomputed result into whatever script we run.</p>



<p>There are essentially two steps for this:</p>



<ol><li>Get a list of all CSS properties</li><li>Figure out how to test if a given property is a shorthand and how to get its longhands if so.</li></ol>



<p>I decided to tell this story in the inverse order. In my exploration, I first focused on figuring out shorthands (2), because I had coded getting a list of properties many times before, but since (1) is useful in its own right (and probably in more use cases), I felt it makes more sense to examine that first.</p>



<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> I’m using <code>document.body</code> instead of a dummy element in these examples, because I like to experiment in <code>about:blank</code>, and it’s just there and because this way you can just copy stuff to the console and try it wherever, even right here while reading this post. However, if you use this as part of code that runs on a real website, it goes without saying that you should create and test things on a dummy element instead!</em></p>



<h2>Getting a list of all CSS properties from the browser</h2>



<p>In Chrome and Safari, this is as simple as <code>Object.getOwnPropertyNames(document.body.style)</code>. However, in Firefox, this doesn’t work. Why is that? To understand this (and how to work around it), we need to dig a bit deeper.</p>



<p>In Chrome and Safari, <code>element.style</code> is a <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSStyleDeclaration">CSSStyleDeclaration</a></code> instance. In Firefox however, it is a <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSS2Properties">CSS2Properties</a></code> instance, which inherits from <code>CSSStyleDeclaration</code>. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSS2Properties"><code>CSS2Properties</code></a> is an older interface, defined in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSS2Properties">the DOM 2 Specification</a>, which is now obsolete. In the <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom/#the-cssstyledeclaration-interface">current relevant specification</a>, <code>CSS2Properties</code> is gone, and has been merged with <code>CSSStyleDeclaration</code>. However, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1290786">Firefox hasn’t caught up yet</a>.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lea.verou.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-2.png" alt=""><figcaption>Firefox on the left, Safari on the right. Chrome behaves like Safari.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Since the properties are on <code>CSSStyleDeclaration</code>, they are not own properties of <code>element.style</code>, so <code>Object.getOwnPropertyNames()</code> fails to return them. However, we can extract the <code>CSSStyleDeclaration</code> instance by using <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/proto">__proto__</a></code> or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/getPrototypeOf">Object.getPrototypeOf()</a>, and then <code>Object.getOwnPropertyNames(Object.getPrototypeOf(document.body.style))</code> gives us what we want! </p>



<p>So we can combine the two to get a list of properties regardless of browser:</p>



<pre><code>let properties = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(
	style.hasOwnProperty("background")? 
	style : style.__proto__
);</code></pre>



<p>And then, we just drop non-properties, and de-camelCase:</p>



<pre><code>properties = properties.filter(p =&gt; style[p] === "") // drop functions etc
	.map(prop =&gt; { // de-camelCase
		prop = prop.replace(/[A-Z]/g, function($0) { return '-' + $0.toLowerCase() });

		if (prop.indexOf("webkit-") &gt; -1) {
			prop = "-" + prop;
		}

		return prop;
	});</code></pre>



<p>You can see a <a href="https://codepen.io/leaverou/pen/eYJodjb?editors=0010">codepen with the result here</a>:</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2>Testing if a property is a shorthand and getting a list of longhands</h2>



<p>The main things to note are:</p>



<ul><li>When you set a shorthand on an element’s inline style, you are essentially setting all its longhands.</li><li><code>element.style</code> is actually array-like, with numerical properties and <code>.length</code> that gives you the number of properties set on it. This means you can use the spread operator on it:</li></ul>



<pre><code>&gt; document.body.style.background = "red";
&gt; [...document.body.style] 
&lt; [
	"background-image", 
	"background-position-x", 
	"background-position-y", 
	"background-size", 
	"background-repeat-x", 
	"background-repeat-y", 
	"background-attachment", 
	"background-origin", 
	"background-clip", 
	"background-color"
]</code></pre>



<p>Interestingly, <code>document.body.style.cssText</code> serializes to <code>background: red</code> and not all the longhands.</p>



<p>There is one exception: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/all">The <code>all</code> property</a>. In Chrome, it does not quite behave as a shorthand:</p>



<pre><code>&gt; document.body.style.all = "inherit";
&gt; [...document.body.style]
&lt; ["all"]</code></pre>



<p>Whereas in Safari and Firefox, it actually returns every single property <em>that is not a shorthand</em>!</p>



<figure><img src="https://lea.verou.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-1.png" alt=""><figcaption>Firefox and Safari expand <code>all</code> to literally all non-shorthand properties.</figcaption></figure>



<p>While this is interesting from a trivia point of view, it doesn’t actually matter for our use case, since we don’t typically care about <code>all</code> when constructing a list of shorthands, and if we do we can always add or remove it manually.</p>



<p>So, to recap, we can easily get the longhands of a given shorthand:</p>



<pre><code>function getLonghands(property) {
	let style = document.body.style;
	style[property] = "inherit"; // a value that works in every property
	let ret = [...style];
	style.cssText = ""; // clean up
	return ret;
}</code></pre>



<h2>Putting the pieces together</h2>



<p>You can see how all the pieces fit together (and the output!) in <a href="https://codepen.io/leaverou/pen/gOPEJxz?editors=0010">this codepen</a>:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>How many of these shorthands did you already know? </p>

 <div>
  
  <p><label>Posted on <strong>26 July 2020</strong></label></p><p><strong>Background</strong><br>
Near the end of 2019 I stumbled across this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMbK7PYQux4&amp;t=6m57s">talk</a> by procedural generation researcher <a href="https://www.anastasiaopara.com/">Anastasia Opara</a>. In the talk she presents a novel algorithm for example based texture synthesis. The goal of example based texture synthesis is to take one or more example textures and synthesize a new visually similar output texture.    </p>
<p>Here's an example from the project README:
  </p><p>
    <img src="http://peterstefek.me/images/texture-optimization/readme-example.jpeg" width="70%"> 
</p> 
<p>I was really curious about this algorithm and wanted to see if I could make it run faster as an exercise in profiling.  </p>
<p><strong>Embarking on a Journey</strong><br>
While I'm not going to go into great detail about how the algorithm works (see Anastasia's talk if you're curious!) it's helpful to understand the basic idea.  </p>
<p>
    <img src="http://peterstefek.me/images/texture-optimization/synthesis-diagram.png" width="80%"> 
</p>

<div><p>We start with an empty output image and seed it with a few random pixels from our example images.<br>
Then repeat the following procedure until the output image is filled: </p><p> 
1. Choose an empty pixel in the output image. We will call this the center pixel.<br>
2. Find the k closest non empty pixels to the center in the output image. Note in the first few steps there might be fewer than k pixels in the entire output image. The locations of these k pixels relative to the center pixel define a neighborhood.<br>
3. Come up with a list of the most promising neighborhoods in the example image(s)<br>
4. Compare the most promising candidate neighborhoods in the example image(s) to the neighborhood around the center pixel and pick the most similar one.<br>
5. Fill the center pixel in the output image with the color of the center pixel in the best matching neighborhood.  </p></div>
<p>One last important detail is that the algorithm works on filling multiple empty pixels in parallel to take full advantage of multi core cpus.  </p>
<p><strong>Missteps and Micro optimizations</strong><br>
Now it was time to optimize. The first thing I did was to run the program on a few sample inputs with the xcode instruments profiler (partly because it was new to me). I even found a cool <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/b20eca/introducing_cargoinstruments_zerohassle_profiling/">library</a> which made it easier to use instruments with rust. Using instruments I was able to see how much each instruction contributed to the overall runtime of the program.  </p>
<p>Being able to see time per instruction was perfect for me because I was looking for micro optimizations. I'm using the term micro optimization here to mean a very small change which has a relatively large impact compared to its size. Even though they are not always a good idea, micro optimizations seemed like the best place to start because they would be less of an investment on my end. I also didn't know if the project maintainers would be excited about large code changes.  </p>
<p>Looking at the profiler output I was drawn to this line which looked like an unnecessary array resize operation nested within our once per pixel loop.  </p>
<p>
    <img src="http://peterstefek.me/images/texture-optimization/first-profile.png" width="90%"> 
</p>

<p>An important note about interpreting the numbers above is that this algorithm runs in several passes and is divided among multiple threads. The image above only shows one pass which accounts for about 12.6% of the runtime of the entire program. However each pass contains the highlighted instruction and behaves similarly. To get a rough estimate of the true impact of this instruction these percentages should be multiplied by a factor of about 8 (100/12.6). So the highlighted instruction really accounts for about 9.5% of the total program runtime.</p>
<p>After I eliminated the unnecessary array resize instruction I ran the program through the profiler again which seemed to confirm that it had gotten about 10% faster which I figured was pretty good for a first try. Of course, the profiler adds some overhead to the program, so to truly confirm that my optimization worked I needed to run it on a couple of examples without any profiling. When I did this I was shocked to see no improvement. </p>
<p>So what was happening? It turns out the cargo-instruments command I was running compiled the program in <a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/t/why-does-cargo-build-not-optimise-by-default/4150">debug mode by default</a> which turned off significant optimizations. When I built the program in release mode the unnecessary array resize was automatically removed. I learned two very important lessons from this: First, of all when you benchmark you have to think carefully about what exactly you're benchmarking. Secondly, the compiler is smart and makes some micro optimizations for you.  </p>
<p>A little embarrassed and somewhat defeated, I went back to the drawing board.  </p>
<p>I grabbed a couple more profiles making sure this time to use release mode. After poking around some more I found that a significant amount of time was being spent loading pixels from the source images into intermediate buffers which were later used for neighborhood comparisons step of the algorithm.  </p>
<p>
    <img src="http://peterstefek.me/images/texture-optimization/second-profile.png" width="90%"> 
</p>

<p>Again using the same runtime adjustment from the last profiling section this function seemed to take about 37.6% of the total runtime. I suspected cache misses were a significant contributor here, but regardless of the actual problem source I knew that reading the neighborhood pixels for each candidate was expensive.   </p>
<p>Of course the algorithm still needed to do the candidate neighborhood comparisons so I couldn't completely eliminate reading each candidate's neighborhood pixels. Luckily for me there was already a related optimization in the project,</p>
<p>This related optimization targeted the actual comparison step when finding a best candidate neighborhood. In the comparison step each candidate neighborhood was assigned a score by summing up the differences (always positive) between it's pixels and the target's neighborhood pixels. It turned out that often you could stop summing up these differences early if you already knew this current candidate's score was going to be higher than the best candidate's score so far.   </p>
<p>Once I understood this I just extended the idea to avoid reading the pixels needed for the unnecessary comparisons by removing the intermediate buffers and reading pixels only as they were needed which seemed to greatly reduce the average number of reads. I tested my optimization on a few different laptops with several output sizes using references images from the repository as inputs. It seemed like I had improved performance by around 15-25% depending on the output texture size, reference images and the computer I was using.  </p>
<p>Quantifying performance impact was a lot harder than I thought it would be. There were so many different parameters to the program that could affect performance: size of the reference image(s), size of the output images, number of threads. Hardware differences were also a huge factor. If I were really being rigorous I would have tried to put together a large collection of images and output sizes to benchmark off of. Due to time and budget constraints I did not assemble a super rigorous benchmark but my appreciation for the problem of performance testing has grown tremendously.  </p>
<p>Once I was confident that my micro optimization worked I made my <a href="https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/texture-synthesis/pull/69">first pull request</a>. It was accepted but to my surprise the performance gains that the reviewers saw were not nearly as good as the ones I did. When one of them benchmarked it on an AMD Threadripper (with 64 virtual cores) the speed up was so small it might have just been noise.  </p>
<p><strong>Blocking And Locking</strong>  </p>
<p>At this point I decided to use some Google Cloud free trial credits I had lying around to spin up some larger machines to test on. Using a 64 core machine I noticed that just like on the thread ripper I didn't see much of a performance improvement from my micro optimization. I tried multiple tests with different numbers of threads (from 0 up to 64) and saw that as the number of threads increased the performance gain from my optimization dropped.  </p>
<p>So in my mind there were two explanations. First was that my optimization didn't save as much time when there were multiple threads. Second was that there was another source of latency which increased with the number of threads and that simply got so big it drowned out any noticeable effects of my optimization. It turned out this second explanation was correct.  </p>
<p>The additional source of latency turned out to be thread contention. To get the k nearest neighbors for each candidate pixel the algorithm was using a data structure called an r*tree. An r*tree provides a way to efficiently store points for nearest neighbor lookups. Exactly how an r*tree works is not actually super important here. The problem was that there was only one r*tree shared across the entire image. To prevent race conditions the r*tree had been wrapped in a read-write lock. This type of lock allows parallel reads but writes must happen in series. Reads also cannot occur while a write is in progress. With large numbers of threads, writing became a large bottleneck. Looking at a graph of program runtime versus number of cores also helps illustrate this effect.  </p>
<p>
    <img src="http://peterstefek.me/images/texture-optimization/before-graph.png" width="50%"> 
</p>

<p>What I realized is that after a few pixels had been filled in the chance that one of the k nearest neighbors would be super far away from the candidate pixel was negligible. So I broke the images in to a grid of r*trees. The basic idea was that writes in two close cells could still block but writes in two far away cells could now be done in parallel. More details can be dound in <a href="https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/texture-synthesis/pull/70">my second pull request</a>. To see the improvement from this change we can look at this graph below of synthesis speeds before / after:</p>
<p>
    <img src="http://peterstefek.me/images/texture-optimization/after-graph.png" width="50%"> 
</p>

<p>An important note here is that the improved version does not scale linearly either. In an ideal world maybe it would but there are several complicating factors that are at play here. First of all the program has some initialization costs as well as having to synthesize the first few pixels in series. Both of these steps cannot be parallelized. Secondly contention is complicated and can crop up in many places. I believe I did eliminate a large source of contention but I'm sure there is more that could be done. Finally this algorithm is not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel">embarrassingly parallel</a> and will ultimately have to have some amount of informtion shared between threads.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>So far we always used shaders to render with a fixed pipeline into textures, but modern graphics card can do way more than just that (sometimes they’re also referred to as GPGPU for “general purpose graphics processing unit”). To do things that arent in the fix pipeline we’re using so far we have to use compute shaders.</p>

<p>If you’re asking yourself why we’d do that, the CPU is performant enough, especially once we use multithreading then I’m here to tell you that you’re 100% correct. You don’t need the GPU for you non graphics tasks. Using it will give you way more confusing error behaviour. The debugger wont give you as nice information and you can’t have breakpoints. Optimizing is weirder since you always have to think about what data you’re pushing around. The paralell nature of the GPU forces you to think way differently… If you don’t need compute shaders, especially when you’re not experienced, think about why you want to and if it’s making your more work than its worth.</p>

<p>If you’re still here, lets get going. In Unity you can check whether your GPU supports compute shaders by checking <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/SystemInfo-supportsComputeShaders.html">SystemInfo.supportsComputeShaders</a>.</p>

<h2 id="basic-compute-shader">Basic Compute Shader</h2>

<p>We can get a simple compute shader by just doing <code>rclick&gt;Create&gt;Shader&gt;Compute Shader</code>. The default shader does a few calculations to write a pattern into a texture, but for this tutorial I want to go one step simpler and just write positions into an array.</p>

<p>In compute land an array we can write into is a <code>RWStructuredBuffer</code> with a certain type (<code>StructuredBuffer</code> is a array we can only read from). This type can be next to any type including vectors or structs. In our case we’ll use a float3 vector.</p>

<p>The function that calculates stuff is called the kernel. We have to add a <code>numthreads</code> attribute in front of the kernel and the kernel takes in one argument which tells us which iteration of the kernel we’re in. In our case we define the number of threads as 64 threads in the <code>x</code> dimension and 1 in both <code>y</code> and <code>z</code>. Those values should work for most platforms that support compute shaders and its in 1 dimension so we dont have to do any rethinking when writing to our 1d array. The input argument is also 3d for that reason but for now we only care about the x part. We do have to mark it as <code>SV_DispatchThreadID</code> though so the correct value is assigned to it.</p>

<p>To tell unity which functions are just regular functions that are called from somewhere else and which ones are the kernel functions we add a pragma statement, so <code>#pragma kernel &lt;functionname&gt;</code>. Its possible to have multiple kernels per shader file.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Each #kernel tells which function to compile; you can have many kernels</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As a starting point I’ll just let the program write a id,0,0 positions in the buffer we set up.</p>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="executing-compute-shaders">Executing Compute Shaders</h2>

<p>Unlike graphics shaders compute shaders can’t just be assigned to a material and via that to a object. Instead we trigger the execution ourselves from c# code.</p>

<p>In the C# component we create we reference our compute shader via a variable of the type <code>ComputeShader</code>. We also create a integer to store the identifier of our kernel after getting it once in the start method. To get the kernel identifier we call the <code>FindKernel(&lt;kernelname&gt;)</code> function on our compute shader. And after getting the kernel identifier we can use it to get the size of each thread group (thats equal to our <code>numthreads</code> in the shader). We store the x size in a variable and discard the others by passing in <code>_</code> as a output variable.</p>

<p>Lets also make the length of the buffer we’re filling a public property so we can change that in the future. With that information available we can also create the gpu array we’ll write to as a <code>ComputeBuffer</code>. Its constructor takes in the amount of elements as the first parameter and the size of its content as the second parameter. Since we’re using float3 on the shader side, we can get the size(in bytes) of a float with the <code>sizeof</code> function and multiply the result by 3(getting the size of a Vector3 or a float3 of the new mathematics lib is also possible, but only in a unsafe context and that sounds scary(it isn’t really, but whatever)). Paralell to the ComputeBuffer lets also create a regular Vector3 array of the same size, we’ll use it later to copy the data back to the ram where we can use it. If we want to write clean code (we kinda do) we should also call <code>Dispose</code> on our buffer when the component is destroyed so unity can do garbage collection, so lets add that to the OnDestroy method.</p>

<p>With all of that set up we can use the shader in the update method. First we declare set the buffer of the shader to be our buffer, this buffer is set per kernel so we also have to pass in our kernel identifier.
To dispatch the shader we first calculate how many threadgroups we need, in our case we want the amount of threads to be the length of the array, so the thread groups should be that amount divided by the thread size rounded up. When dealing with integers the easiest way of doing a division and getting the rounded up result is to add the divisor minus one before the division, that adds 1 to the result unless the dividend is a exact multiple of the divisor.
After thats done we can dispatch the shader and tell it how many thread groups it should run (the amount we just calculated in <code>x</code>, and 1 in <code>y</code> and <code>z</code>). And then we can already get the data out of the buffer into ram we can work with in C# with the aptly named <code>GetData</code> function.</p>

<p>Now we have the data but we can’t see it. There are ways of rendering the buffer directly on the GPU, but this is not the tutorial for that, instead I decided to instantiate a bunch of prefabs and use them for visualisation. The instanced transforms are saved in a private array which is created and filled with new prefab instances in the start method. The length of the array is the same length of the buffer.</p>

<p>In update method we then copy the positions from the output struct to the local position of the objects.</p>

<h2 id="a-tiny-bit-more-complex-compute-shader">A tiny bit more complex Compute Shader</h2>

<p>The rest of this is just to make stuff look nice, its just plain hlsl like in all my other tutorials.</p>

<p>In the Compute Shader I first include the functions from <a href="https://www.ronja-tutorials.com/2018/09/02/white-noise.html">my tutorial on randomness</a> and add a new variable called time.
In the kernel function I get a random vector(based on the kernel index), normalize it and get it to a random length between 0.1 and 1 (if I let it go too short bad math can happen too easily and some points become NaN). Then I generate a new vector thats orthogonal to that one by taking the cross product between the vector and a different random vector(this isn’t guaranteed to work, if the vectors are paralell the cross product is <code>(0,0,0)</code> and can’t e normalized, but it works well enough) and give its length the same treatment to make it be between 0.1 and 0.9. The random looking numbers I add to the inputs are to avoid some of the symmetry so not all random functions return the same result. Then I get a time variable by multiplying the time by 2(that 2 could be a uniform value if you want to adjust the speed manually) and give it a offset by a random value multiplied by some big-ish odd number.</p>

<p>Those values can then be combined by multiplying one of the vectors by the sine of the time and the other by the cosine of the time and adding the 2 results. I then also multiplied it by 20 to make it bigger, but you should also consider using a property settable from outside here(do as I say not as I do).</p>

    <p>Words are powerful, and the way we use them can have a tremendous impact on the people who hear us speaking.</p>
<p>But it is not only negative words that can harm us. Sometimes even the use of positive words can have a totally unexpected effect on people.</p>
<h2 id="an-experiment">An Experiment</h2>
<p>Claudia M. Mueller and Carol S. Dweck of Columbia University did a series of experiments<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> that measured how the type of feedback children receive affects their behavior and motivation. Across six studies, they gave three sets of tasks to children (fifth graders):</p>
<ul>
<li>set #1 was easy, and each kid was told they had &gt;= 80% correct answers regardless of their actual performance;</li>
<li>set #2 was hard (appropriate to seventh graders), and each kid was told they had &lt;=50% correct answers irrespective of their actual performance;</li>
<li>set #3 was easy;</li>
</ul>
<p>After the first set, children were praised in one of the following three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Praise on ability: “You did very well, you must be smart at these problems.”</li>
<li>Praise on effort: “You did very well, you must have worked hard at these problems.”</li>
<li>Neutral praise: “You did very well.” (this was the control group)</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, after the first set of problems, kids were given a choice to select some tasks to work on after the experiment. Unbeknownst to them, those tasks embodied different goals: 3 types of tasks represented variations of performance goals (by doing them, kids could showcase their abilities), and one job represented a learning goal (by doing which kids would learn something rather than display how smart they are).</p>
<p>After the second set of problems, all kids were informed they have performed “a lot worse.” They were asked then to rate their desire to persist on the tasks, their enjoyment of the problems, the quality of their performance, and why they think they have failed.</p>
<p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/ability-vs-effort.png" alt="Praise on ability vs. praise on effort"></p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>What scientists found out is incredible. The gist of experiments is that children praised for intelligence had lower levels of persistence, enjoyment, and performance on the more difficult tasks. They viewed their failure as something out of their control (“I’m just not smart enough”). Conversely, children praised for effort showed higher engagement levels and persisted more when they encountered harder tasks. More importantly, they viewed their failure as something they have control over (“I didn’t work hard enough”), and they did not appear to consider intelligence to be determined from any single performance like their ability praise counterparts did. And children in the control group were in the middle—their response was worse than those praised for effort but better than those praised for intelligence.</p>
<p>Among other interesting findings are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Children praised for intelligence after success chose problems that allowed them to continue to exhibit good performance (allowing them to show off their abilities). In contrast, children praised for hard work chose problems that promised increased learning.</li>
<li>Children praised for intelligence preferred to learn about the performance of others on the tasks rather than learn about new strategies for solving the problems. On the other hand, children praised for effort demonstrated their continued interest in mastery by preferring to receive strategy-related information.</li>
<li>Children praised for intelligence showed a greater tendency to misrepresent their scores on the problems than those praised for effort, even though their reports were anonymous and were not seen by the experimenter.</li>
<li>Children praised for ability saw failure as an invalidation of their intelligence more than the other groups.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-does-it-mean">What Does It Mean</h2>
<p>The implications of this are tremendous. It means children who are praised for ability have lower motivation and are not inclined to continue to learn more since, for them, intelligence is something you either have or not. Moreover, the tasks they choose usually aim at showcasing their existing talents, rather than attempting to learn something new.</p>
<p>Considering how ubiquitous praising for ability is in the modern world, it might explain to some degree why so many people refuse to learn continuously and only seek to validate their skill set by choosing tasks they cannot get wrong, and that make them look good.</p>
<p>It also shows that alongside the importance of the education system, everyday communication within the family is critical as well. The family and friends have maybe even a more considerable significance. If scientists managed to get that kind of behavior from children after offering feedback two times only, imagine how potent is the (sometimes misleading) self-perception of those kids after reinforcing their smartness over decades by parents who (sometimes unmeritedly) are saying their kids are the best.</p>
<p>Finally, it is not only about the younger generation. Adults were all children in the past and went through the same thing. The only difference is that while you still can do something about how kids get treated and how they perceive themselves, it is extremely hard (and in some cases impossible) to make a grown-up review their self-perception.</p>

<p>A team lead’s main concerns are team performance, interactions with other teams, and delivering projects on time.</p>



<p>Team leads should not be a bottleneck. You shouldn’t assign the most important and/or most complex tasks to yourself. You shouldn’t tie all processes to yourself.</p>



<p>Trust and acceptance of failures is the best way to eliminate yourself as a bottleneck. You should allow teammates to make mistakes, but it’s also important to be in control of how crucial mistakes will be.</p>



<p>As a team lead, you should trust your teammates and give them challenging and meaningful tasks. They need to feel their importance. By challenging them, you create growth opportunities. No one wants to be bored with tedious tasks all the time.</p>



<p>Look for a balance. Tasks that are too challenging can make the programmer question their confidence. Too many challenges will put them under unhealthy constant stress.</p>



<p>With self-doubts and stress, a member of your team will work on their tasks exponentially slower than they could with confidence and a good mood.</p>



<p>You can offer help when you notice that your teammate is struggling. Watch for signs from their mood. The simple question “How are things going?” is a tool to spot the problems.</p>



<p>By listening to your colleagues about their troubles and obstacles, you help them relieve their tension and regain their feeling of confidence. And if you can offer advice on how to solve the problem, that’s even better!</p>



<p>Pairing up with a colleague in trouble is another way to unblock the project.</p>



<p>By not burdening yourself with important projects with tight deadlines, you create time. Use this time to:</p>



<ul><li>Be conscious of the current state of your team members</li><li>Be available to offer help</li><li>Think about processes, what is working, and what is not</li><li>Think about current, upcoming, and past projects</li></ul>



<p>A good team lead does the following:</p>



<ul><li>Assigns important, challenging projects to teammates</li><li>Assigns blocking tasks to teammates</li><li>Is available to listen and offer help to teammates</li><li>Has time to be aware of the current state of team members</li><li>Has time to reflect on processes and projects</li></ul>

<p>One fun aspect of building a 3D renderer in R (and more generally, building anything in a programming language with a REPL) is the lack of friction between your code your results: rather than constructing a 3D scene by hand using a GUI, you can generate your scene directly from data or purely from logic. For traditional 3D rendering, this isn’t particularly useful, but for visualizing data and procedurally-generated systems, this close link allows for fast iteration and reproducibility.</p>
<p>Rayrender was built around this idea: instead of trying to integrate an external renderer into the R ecosystem (which is difficult for many reasons, primarily CRAN requirements), it made sense to build a 3D renderer designed specifically for R. There’s one big hurdle you encounter when writing your own software, however: in the beginning, there is no one but you who knows how to use it! “If you build it, they will come” is not a viable strategy for software. Regardless of how useful you think your package/application is, few people are going to take the time to learn it unless they’re presented with motivating examples. So, with that in mind, I’m always on the lookout for interesting and novel visualization ideas that will give people a better idea of what rayrender is capable of, and hopefully inspire them to experiment with the software.</p>
<p>What does all this have to do with 3D trees? Back in April, <a href="https://twitter.com/djnavarro">Danielle Navarro</a> released an the <a href="https://github.com/djnavarro/flametree">flametree</a> package, which produces procedural 2D trees using a stochastic L-system, and I thought: I think these would look really cool in 3D! So I dove into her code. It wasn’t too difficult to generalize it to 3D, write a layer that translated the resulting data structure into rayrender’s tibble-based scene format using rayrender primitives, and package it all up for easy installation. And that brings us to…</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/tylermorganwall/raybonsai">raybonsai</a> package! A package that creates and renders procedural 3D trees in R. Installation is easy: just use the <code>remotes</code> package to install from Github:</p>
<pre><code>remotes::install_github("tylermorganwall/raybonsai")</code></pre>
<p>There are currently only two user-facing functions in raybonsai: <code>generate_tree()</code> and <code>render_tree()</code>. <code>generate_tree()</code> generates a tree that follows a certain set of constraints that you set and returns a rayrender scene describing the tree. <code>render_tree()</code> automatically adds ground, sets up lighting, and sets up the camera so the tree is in frame, but is otherwise just a light wrapper around rayrender’s <code>render_scene()</code> function.</p>
<p>Let’s try it out, with the default settings:</p>
<pre><code>library(raybonsai)

generate_tree() %&gt;% 
  render_tree()</code></pre>
<center><img src="https://www.tylermw.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/smallunnamed-chunk-2-1.jpg" width="800"></center>
<center></center>
<p>A tree! Let’s customize it. The growth of the tree is controlled primarily using five inputs: the number of branches at each branching point <code>branch_split</code>, the horizontal branching angle <code>branch_angle</code>, the vertical branching angle <code>branch_angle_vert</code>, the scaled length of each subsequent branch <code>branch_scale</code>, and (most appropriately named, given the use case) the random seed <code>seed</code>. Let’s first start by generating a bunch of different plants, each with the same settings but different seeds.</p>
<pre><code>par(mfrow=c(3,3))
for(i in 1:9) {
  generate_tree(seed = i) %&gt;% 
    render_tree()
}</code></pre>
<div><img src="https://www.tylermw.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/smallunnamed-chunk-3-1.jpg" width="2400"></div>
<center><div>Figure 2: Collection of different trees, varying the random seed.</div></center>

<p>Each tree is different, but they all appear to come from the same “species.” And that’s because they’re all generated using the same “DNA”: the branch angles and scaling factors. Let’s change that DNA by specifying a new set of rules. Here, we cut the potential angles the branches can make from -45 and 45 degrees in half:</p>
<pre><code>par(mfrow=c(3,3))
for(i in 1:9) {
  generate_tree(seed = i, branch_angle_vert = seq(-45,45,by=5)/2, leaf_color = "pink") %&gt;% 
    render_tree()
}</code></pre>
<div><img src="https://www.tylermw.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/smallunnamed-chunk-4-1.jpg" width="2400"></div>
<center><div>Figure 3: Varying the vertical branching angle.</div></center>

<p>These are visually quite distinct from the previous batch and have a similar appearance to each other. But look closely and compare these trees with the first batch: you’ll see that they actually have the exact same branching structure, just with less pronounced branching angles (note the trees than lean left/right in the first batch still lean that way in the second). This is because the random choice whether to branch left or right is controlled by the random seed, which is identical between the two batches. The only variable that’s different is the branching angle itself.</p>




<p>What happens when we add an addition angle into the mix? Here, one directly in the center. Now, each branch can either go left, right, or continue in the same direction as the source branch. We can see this results in some trees developing “trunks" and some longer straight branches:</p>
<pre><code>par(mfrow=c(2,3))
for(i in 1:6) {
  generate_tree(seed = i, branch_angle_vert = c(-20,0, 20), leaf_color = "red") %&gt;% 
    render_tree()
}</code></pre>
<div><img src="https://www.tylermw.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/smallunnamed-chunk-5-1.jpg" width="2400"></div>
<center><div>Figure 4: Adding the possibility of growing a branch in the same direction as the previous.</div></center>

<p>The next variable we can control is increase the branching depth of the tree. By default, we generate 6 branch layers. The number of branches grows exponentially with each layer, so we’ll just increase it to 8. This will increase the visual complexity of our tree.</p>
<pre><code>par(mfrow=c(2,3))
for(i in 1:6) {
  generate_tree(seed = i+1000, branch_depth = 8, leaf_color = "purple") %&gt;%

<p>By default, raybonsai only adds leaves to the last layer, but we can start growing them on earlier layers to fill in our tree:</p>
<pre><code>par(mfrow=c(1,2))

generate_tree(seed = 1234, branch_depth = 8, leaf_color = "orange") %&gt;% 
  render_tree()

generate_tree(seed = 1234, branch_depth = 8, leaf_color = "orange", leaf_depth_start = 5) %&gt;%
  render_tree()</code></pre>

<center><div>Figure 6: Filling in our tree with additional leaves.</div></center>

<p>Up to this point, we’ve kept the trees symmetric by setting a matching negative angle for every positive angle. We can also make asymmetric trees by increasing the probability that we’ll select one angle over another. Here each branch has a 5x probability of turning one way versus the other, implemented by duplicating one angle 5x in the branching vector.</p>
<pre><code>par(mfrow=c(1,2))
generate_tree(seed = 2020, branch_angle_vert = c(-10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10),
              branch_depth = 8, leaf_color = "magenta", leaf_depth_start = 5) %&gt;% 
  render_tree()
generate_tree(seed = 2021, branch_angle_vert = c(10,-10,-10,-10,-10,-10),
              branch_depth = 8, leaf_color = "magenta", leaf_depth_start = 5) %&gt;%
  render_tree()</code></pre>
<div><img src="https://www.tylermw.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/smallunnamed-chunk-8-1.jpg" width="1600"></div>
<center></center>

<p>We can also create asymmetric trees by ensuring the average angle is negative or positive, without repeating individual angles. This works because on average, the tree favors one direction over the other.</p>
<pre><code>par(mfrow=c(1,2))
generate_tree(seed = 4321, branch_angle_vert = seq(-10,20,by=1),
              branch_depth = 8, leaf_color = "yellow", leaf_depth_start = 5) %&gt;% 
  render_tree()

generate_tree(seed = 4321, branch_angle_vert = -seq(-10,20,by=1),
              branch_depth = 8, leaf_color = "yellow", leaf_depth_start = 5) %&gt;% 
  render_tree()</code></pre>

<center><div>Figure 8: More tree bending.</div></center>

<p>Another variable we can control is the scaling factor <code>branch_scale</code>, which defaults to <code>c(0.8, 0.9)</code> (meaning each branch is either 80% or 90% the length of the previous layer). If we decrease or increase this, the resulting tree will be dramatically different:</p>
<pre><code>par(mfrow=c(1,3))
generate_tree(seed = 10, branch_angle = c(-30,0, 30), branch_scale = c(0.6,0.7),
              branch_depth = 7, leaf_color = "green", leaf_depth_start = 5) %&gt;% 
  render_tree()

generate_tree(seed = 11, branch_angle = c(-30,0, 30), branch_scale = c(0.9,1),
              branch_depth = 7, leaf_color = "green", leaf_depth_start = 5) %&gt;% 
  render_tree()

generate_tree(seed = 12, branch_angle = c(-30,0, 30), branch_scale = c(1.1,1.2),
              branch_depth = 7, leaf_color = "green", leaf_depth_start = 5) %&gt;% 
  render_tree()</code></pre>
<div><img src="https://www.tylermw.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/smallunnamed-chunk-10-1.jpg" width="2400"></div>
<center><div>Figure 9: Varying the branch width.</div></center>

<p>Each tree so far has been grown with the “midpoint” method: rather than growing each branch from the end of the previous branch, the default behavior extends the branch in the previous branches direction until it reaches the halfway point, and only then extends a branch to the endpoint. We can turn off this feature and by setting <code>midpoint = FALSE</code>: This results in a structurally identical tree with a slightly different appearance. And for fun, let’s also play around with the ground color and the branch color:</p>
<pre><code>par(mfrow=c(1,2))
generate_tree(seed = 20, branch_angle = c(-30,0, 30), branch_scale = c(0.9,1), midpoint = TRUE,
              branch_depth = 7, leaf_color = "chartreuse4", 
              leaf_depth_start = 5, branch_color = "tan") %&gt;% 
  render_tree(ground_color1 = "darkgoldenrod4", ground_color2 = "chocolate4")

generate_tree(seed = 20, branch_angle = c(-30,0, 30), branch_scale = c(0.9,1), midpoint = FALSE,
              branch_depth = 7, leaf_color = "chartreuse4", 
              leaf_depth_start = 5, branch_color = "tan") %&gt;% 
  render_tree(ground_color1 = "darkgoldenrod4", ground_color2 = "chocolate4")</code></pre>
<div><img src="https://www.tylermw.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/smallunnamed-chunk-11-1.jpg" width="1600"></div>
<center><div>Figure 10: Two different methods of growing branches. Left: midpoint. Right: not midpoint.</div></center>

<p>The lighting here is automatically set up by <code>render_tree()</code>, but we can turn it off and set up our own lighting using rayrender. We’ll also set <code>branch_split = 3</code> here for a denser tree with more branches:</p>
<pre><code>library(rayrender)

par(mfrow=c(1,1))
generate_tree(seed = 222, branch_angle = c(-20, 20), branch_scale = c(0.8,0.9), branch_split = 3,
              branch_depth = 6 , leaf_color = "chartreuse4", 
              leaf_depth_start = 5, branch_color = "tan") %&gt;% 
  add_object(sphere(x=5,y=1,radius=1,material=light(color="magenta",intensity = 30))) %&gt;%
  add_object(sphere(x=-5,y=1,radius=1,material=light(color="dodgerblue",intensity = 30))) %&gt;%
  raybonsai::render_tree(lights = FALSE, ground_color1 = "grey50",ground_color2 = "grey50", …</code></pre></div></article></section></div></main></div></div></div>

<p><strong>Can Audio Deepfakes Really Fake a Human?</strong></p>
<p>Audio deepfakes are the new frontier for business compromise schemes and are becoming more common pathways for criminals to deceptively gain access to corporate funds. Nisos recently investigated and obtained an original attempted deepfake synthetic audio used in a fraud attempt against a technology company. The deepfake took the form of a voicemail message from the company’s purported CEO, asking an employee to call back to “finalize an urgent business deal.” The recipient immediately thought it suspicious and did not contact the number, instead referring it to their legal department, and as a result the attack was not successful.</p>
</div>

<p>Nisos investigated the phone number the would-be attacker used and determined it was a VOIP service with no owner registration information. It was likely simply acquired and used as a “burner” for this fraud attempt only. While there was no actual voicemail message associated with the number, we made no attempt for live contact with the owner of the phone number for legal reasons.</p>

<p><strong>Deepfake Audio Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Nisos analyzed the deepfake voicemail audio recording with an audio spectrogram tool called Spectrum3d. Looking to detect any anomalies, we immediately noticed the highs spiking repeatedly in the spectrogram (see graphic below). We initially suspected the deepfake creator used audio playing over on multiple channels to help mask the voice.</p>

<p>We additionally noticed the audio was very choppy and not consistent with a similar human voice recording. When we altered the audio speed and played back at 1.2 speed, the audio then sounded more like a standard text to speech system. Most interesting, when we amplified the sound to detect any background noise we were unable to find any traces, which further indicated this was manipulated audio.</p>
<p>We then compared the deepfake spectrogram analysis with results of a "normal" human voice on a similar recording. We can immediately see how the pitch and tone is more smoothed out, as well as the ability to detect faint background noise.</p>
<p><strong><i><img src="https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/unnamed%20(4).png?width=351&amp;name=unnamed%20(4).png" alt="unnamed (4)" width="351" srcset="https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/unnamed%20(4).png?width=176&amp;name=unnamed%20(4).png 176w, https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/unnamed%20(4).png?width=351&amp;name=unnamed%20(4).png 351w, https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/unnamed%20(4).png?width=527&amp;name=unnamed%20(4).png 527w, https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/unnamed%20(4).png?width=702&amp;name=unnamed%20(4).png 702w, https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/unnamed%20(4).png?width=878&amp;name=unnamed%20(4).png 878w, https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/unnamed%20(4).png?width=1053&amp;name=unnamed%20(4).png 1053w" sizes="(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px"></i></strong><strong><i>Graphic 2: Spectrogram analysis of ‘normal’ human voice, displaying more consistent pitch and tone.</i></strong></p>
<p>We were unable to determine the exact software or voice model used to create this deepfake as we would have required access to a large enough sample of the attacker’s other deepfake audio files (we would likely need tens if not hundreds of files, and this assumes the attacker made more than just this one). However, we note several complicating factors an actor would have to overcome to create a more realistic deepfake audio:</p>
<ol>
<li>Capturing high quality audio with little to no background noise.</li>
<li>Staging the call for audio delivering in a realistic scenario (tone of the person talking, background noise and reason for the call) in which the person wouldn’t feel the need to call the person back.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Finding a way to leave a message, so they can avoid an in-person conversation.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is likely the attacker in this scenario above utilized a feature most cell/VOIP service providers offer, which is the ability to bypass the ring option and go straight into the voice mail using the `#` key.</p>

<p><strong>Has This Happened Before?</strong></p>
<p>The most famous use of deep fake synthetic audio technology in criminal fraud was a September 2019 incident involving a British energy company. The criminals reportedly used voice-mimicking software to imitate the British executive’s speech and trick his subordinate into sending hundreds of thousands of dollars to a secret account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The managing director of this company, believing his boss was on the phone, followed orders to wire more than $240,000 to an account in Hungary.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Symantec security researchers reported in February on three cases of audio deepfakes used against private companies by impersonating the voice of the business’s CEO.<sup>2 </sup>The criminals reportedly trained machine learning engines from audio obtained on conference calls, YouTube, social media updates and even TED talks, to copy the voice patterns of company bosses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They created audio deepfakes replicating the CEO’s voice and called senior members of the finance department to ask for funds to be sent urgently. There was no additional reporting on which companies these were, whether the techniques were successful, or whether Symantec was able to obtain recordings of the deepfakes themselves.</p>
<p>Without actual digital capture of the audio, and additional forensics analysis, it is unclear whether these attempts were in fact deepfake synthetic manipulated audio. Regardless, the ability to generate synthetic audio extends an e-criminal’s toolkit and the criminal at the end of the day still has to effectively use social engineering tactics to induce someone into taking an action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Criminals and potentially broader nation state actors also learn from each other, so as these high-profile cases gain more notoriety and success, we anticipate more illicit actors trying them and learning from others who have paved the way.</p>
<p>Additionally, as deepfakes become easier to create or purchase, and the quality of synthetic manipulation -both audio (and video)- increases, we anticipate wider deployment of these e-crime exploits. If a fraud operation requires the use of a completely fake doctored video or audio for maximum impact, and it is worth the money and resources, it will be used. However, Nisos researchers have not seen the ability to easily outsource this type of deepfake for single individual or mass production.</p>
<p>Our researchers have contact with a few deepfake channels where we asked about this type of attack vector and participants were unsure something like this would be possible in the near future. The central issue with audio deepfakes has to do with capturing not only the person’s tone but also specific speech mannerisms. Future scenarios will likely materialize, however, where tools similar to a Yandex reverse image search (but for voice) could be used to gather numerous samples and then build and train a model that could help convert the source voice into the target voice.</p>

<p><strong>What Can Be Done?</strong></p>
<p>The most immediate action an employee can take, if they sense something suspicious in a voicemail (or any audio) instruction, is to call the person back directly using a known number and get them on the line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deepfake technology is not sophisticated enough to mimic an entire phone call with someone. Additionally, the company can exercise a series of ‘challenge questions’ using information that is not publicly known or conversation points that an actor could not readily answer, to vet the identity of the individual on the line.</p>
<p>This fraud scheme is a form of a business email compromise (a more sophisticated and AI-developed version) where typically the attacker will pretend to be a senior executive at a company and get a more susceptible ‘lower-level’ employee to send money to a bank account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would anticipate a deepfake audio would be the first step in a series of social engineering attempts to get an employee to wire money to a specific location. Phishing emails, additional phone calls, or even deepfake videos purporting to authorize an action could be used in furtherance of the criminal scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deepfake audio may also be used for reasons ancillary to the ones listed above. For example, criminals can leave fake messages instructing employees to provide network or physical access to the company, allowing attackers to easily compromise the network or physical assets of the company.</p>
<p>The availability of this nascent but rapidly-emerging technology emphasizes the criticality with which companies must develop security practices that encompass these measures. Any time an unusual incident occurs, and certainly when large financial transactions are involved, employees should be trained to ask challenge questions to senior executives.</p>

  <p>I happen to develop a pet project of mine on a Linux desktop, while actually targeting an <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> server. Thus I searched for a scriptable way to install OpenBSD on the <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a> virtual machine manager, such that I could automate a local integration test against OpenBSD running on Linux.</p>
<p>As expected, OpenBSD has a remarkably straightforward unattended installation solution. During a normal, interactive installation, you answer a series of questions like what timezone you are in or which file sets to install. At the end of the installation, the installer sends a recorded list of those questions along with your answers to the root user’s mail box. You can then adapt this so-called <em>response file</em> to your needs and feed it to the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.7/autoinstall">autoinstall(8)</a> command to perform an unattended installation.</p>
<p>In the remainder of this post, I will show how to auto-install OpenBSD/amd64 6.7 on the QEMU PC system emulator 5.0.0. In the end, I will present a simple yet <a href="https://www.skreutz.com/files/autoinstall-openbsd-on-qemu.sh">complete POSIX shell script</a> to get the job done. The script is intended to run on Linux, though. If you already have a running OpenBSD installation, you should consider to use OpenBSD’s own hypervisor <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.7/vmm">vmm(4)</a> instead of QEMU as described in the <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq16.html">OpenBSD FAQ</a> and in this <a href="http://eradman.com/posts/autoinstall-openbsd.html">blog post</a> by Eric Radman.</p>
<p>We will perform the following steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Install several prerequisites</li>
<li>Setup a local OpenBSD mirror</li>
<li>Configure the installation</li>
<li>Setup a network boot environment</li>
<li>Install the virtual machine</li>
<li>Log in to the virtual machine</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>We will use the following tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a>, a data transfer tool (and library)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.openssh.com/">OpenSSH</a>, a remote login tool</li>
<li><a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a>, a virtual machine monitor (or hypervisor)</li>
<li><a href="https://rsync.samba.org/">rsync</a>, an incremental file transfer tool</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aperezdc/signify">signify</a>, a cryptographic signature tool<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/">socat</a>, a successor of the infamous TCP/IP Swiss Army knife <a href="https://nc110.sourceforge.io/">netcat</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Chances are that your Linux distribution of choice packages these tools. For example, the following command installs them on Arch Linux:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo pacman -S curl openssh qemu rsync signify socat</code></pre>
<h2 id="local-openbsd-mirror">Local OpenBSD mirror</h2>
<p>To begin with, we setup a partial, local <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/ftp.html">OpenBSD mirror</a>.</p>
<p>First, we create the relevant part of the <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/ftp.html#layout">directory layout</a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ mkdir -p mirror/pub/OpenBSD/6.7/amd64</code></pre>
<p>Second, we fetch the base public key from the official HTTPS mirror using <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html">curl(1)</a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl \
    --output mirror/pub/OpenBSD/6.7/openbsd-67-base.pub \
    https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/6.7/openbsd-67-base.pub</code></pre>
<p>Third, we fetch the kernel, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Preboot_Execution_Environment&amp;oldid=955913424">PXE</a> bootstrap program, and the file sets from an untrusted <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/ftp.html#rsync">rsync mirror</a> using <a href="https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/rsync.1">rsync(1)</a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ rsync --archive --files-from=- --verbose \
    rsync://ftp.halifax.rwth-aachen.de/openbsd/6.7/amd64/ \
    mirror/pub/OpenBSD/6.7/amd64 \
    &lt;&lt; EOF
SHA256.sig
base67.tgz
bsd
bsd.mp
bsd.rd
comp67.tgz
game67.tgz
man67.tgz
pxeboot
xbase67.tgz
xfont67.tgz
xserv67.tgz
xshare67.tgz
EOF</code></pre>
<p>Fourth, we verify the fetched files using <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.7/signify">signify(1)</a> and the previously fetched base public key:<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<pre><code>$ ( cd mirror/pub/OpenBSD/6.7/amd64 &amp;&amp; signify -C \
    -p ../openbsd-67-base.pub \
    -x SHA256.sig \
    -- bsd bsd.* pxeboot *67.tgz )</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we serve the local mirror at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/">http://127.0.0.1:8080/</a>. Feel free to use your web server of choice. Chances are, that your Linux distribution comes with Python’s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html">http.server</a> module:</p>
<pre><code>$ python3 \
    -m http.server \
    --directory mirror \
    --bind 127.0.0.1 8080</code></pre>
<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
<p>First, we create a response file for <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.7/autoinstall">autoinstall(8)</a> at <code>mirror/install.conf</code>:<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<pre><code>Change the default console to com0 = yes
Which speed should com0 use = 115200
System hostname = openbsd
Password for root = *************
Allow root ssh login = no
Setup a user = puffy
Password for user = *************
Public ssh key for user = ssh-rsa AAAAB3N... alex@example
What timezone are you in = UTC
Location of sets = http
HTTP Server = 10.0.2.1
Unable to connect using https. Use http instead = yes
URL to autopartitioning template for disklabel = http://10.0.2.1/disklabel
Set name(s) = site67.tgz
Checksum test for site67.tgz failed. Continue anyway = yes
Unverified sets: site67.tgz. Continue without verification = yes</code></pre>
<p>Take care to insert your own public SSH key here, for example, the contents of <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code>.</p>
<p>Note that we effectively disable password-based authentication here by assigning the conventional 13 asterisks as encrypted passwords for both users, <code>root</code> and <code>puffy</code>, see <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.7/passwd.5">passwd(5)</a>. Instead, we enable the user <code>puffy</code> to login using the given SSH key. Besides, we will later permit the user <code>puffy</code> to run any command as root without entering his password using <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.7/doas">doas(1)</a>.</p>
<p>Note also that we will later instruct QEMU to redirect port 80 on the virtual network address 10.0.2.1 to port 8080 on the local host.</p>
<p>Next, we create a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.7/disklabel">disklabel(8)</a> template at <code>mirror/disklabel</code>:</p>
<pre><code>/            2G
swap         8G
/tmp         1G
/var         1G
/usr         2G
/usr/X11R6 500M
/usr/local   4G
/usr/src     1M
/usr/obj     1M
/home        4G</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we create an optional site-specific file set. This way, we can run some commands at the end of the installation. Here, we reset the OpenBSD mirror server used by <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.7/pkg_add">pkg_add(1)</a> and other commands.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Moreover, we permit the user group <code>wheel</code> — and thus the user <code>puffy</code> — to run any command as the user <code>root</code> without entering their password using <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.7/doas">doas(1)</a>.</p>
<p>Create the file <code>site/install.site</code>:</p>
<pre><code>#! /bin/ksh
set -o errexit
echo "https://cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD" &gt; /etc/installurl
echo "permit nopass keepenv :wheel" &gt;&gt; /etc/doas.conf</code></pre>
<p>Then, make the file executable, package the file set, and add it to the local OpenBSD mirror:</p>
<pre><code>$ chmod +x site/install.site
$ ( cd site &amp;&amp; tar -czf ../mirror/pub/OpenBSD/6.7/amd64/site67.tgz . )
$ ( cd mirror/pub/OpenBSD/6.7/amd64 &amp;&amp; ls -l &gt; index.txt )</code></pre>
<h2 id="network-boot-environment">Network boot environment</h2>
<p>We create a dedicated directory to serve the OpenBSD kernel and PXE bootstrap program over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trivial_File_Transfer_Protocol&amp;oldid=959587822">TFTP</a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ mkdir tftp
$ ln -s ../mirror/pub/OpenBSD/6.7/amd64/pxeboot tftp/auto_install
$ ln -s ../mirror/pub/OpenBSD/6.7/amd64/bsd.rd tftp/bsd.rd</code></pre>
<p>Furthermore, we create a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.7/man8/amd64/boot.8">boot(8)</a> configuration file at <code>tftp/etc/boot.conf</code>:</p>
<pre><code>stty com0 115200
set tty com0
boot tftp:/bsd.rd</code></pre>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>First, we create a copy-on-write disk image using <a href="https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/tools/qemu-img.html">qemu-img(1)</a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ qemu-img create -f qcow2 disk.qcow2 24G</code></pre>
<p>Then, we start a virtual machine — and thus the unattended installation of OpenBSD — off this disk using <a href="https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/qemu-manpage.html">qemu-system-x86_64(1)</a> and <a href="http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/doc/socat.html">socat(1)</a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ qemu-system-x86_64 \
    -enable-kvm \
    -smp "cpus=4" \
    -m 4G \
    -drive "file=disk.qcow2,media=disk,if=virtio" \
    -device e1000,netdev=n1 \
    -netdev "user,id=n1,hostname=openbsd-vm,tftp-server-name=10.0.2.1,tftp=tftp,bootfile=auto_install,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22,guestfwd=tcp:10.0.2.1:80-cmd:socat STDIO TCP4:127.0.0.1:8080" \
    -nographic</code></pre>
<p>Let’s break this last command down. The <code>-enable-kvm</code> option enables the Linux <a href="https://www.linux-kvm.org/">Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM)</a> support. The <code>-smp</code> option instructs QEMU to simulate a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Symmetric_multiprocessing&amp;oldid=951686602">symmetric multiprocessing (SMP)</a> system. The <code>-m</code> option sets the amount of virtual memory. The <code>-drive</code> option attaches the previously created copy-on-write disk image as a <a href="https://wiki.libvirt.org/page/Virtio">Virtio</a> disk drive. The <code>-device</code> option attaches a standard network adapter. The <code>-netdev</code> option configures a virtual network <code>10.0.2.0/24</code> where <code>10.0.2.2</code> and <code>10.0.2.15</code> point to the QEMU host and guest respectively. Moreover, we instruct QEMU to (a) run an embedded TFTP server at <code>10.0.2.1</code>, (b) redirect port 2222 on the host to port 22 on the guest, and (c) redirect port 80 on the virtual host address <code>10.0.2.1</code> to port 8080 on the host. The former port redirection enables us to log in to the guest using <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.7/ssh">ssh(1)</a>, and the latter port redirection frees us from binding to the privileged port 80 on the host.<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Finally, the <code>-nographic</code> option turns QEMU into a command-line application that redirects the emulated serial port to the console. Press <code>C-a x</code> to stop the virtual machine, or <code>C-a h</code> to show other options.</p>
<h2 id="login">Login</h2>
<p>Once the virtual machine has booted, you can log in as the user <code>puffy</code> using <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.7/ssh">ssh(1)</a>:</p>
<pre><code>ssh \
  -o "StrictHostKeyChecking no" \
  -o "UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null" \
  -o "Port 2222" \
  puffy@127.0.0.1</code></pre>
<p>Here, we use the <code>StrictHostKeyChecking</code> and <code>UserKnownHostsFile</code> options to keep the presumably temporary virtual machine’s host key out of our known hosts file.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We auto-installed OpenBSD/amd64 6.7 on the QEMU PC system emulator 5.0.0 by means of several command-line tools. First, we setup a partial, local OpenBSD mirror using <a href="https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/rsync.1">rsync(1)</a> and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.7/signify">signify(1)</a>. Second, we prepared a response file for <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.7/autoinstall">autoinstall(8)</a>, a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.7/disklabel">disklabel(8)</a> template, and a site-specific file set. Third, we setup a standard network boot environment. Fourth, we actually installed OpenBSD on a QEMU guest machine. Finally, we logged in to the virtual machine using <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.7/ssh">ssh(1)</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, you can automate the whole process. For example, I use a simple, yet <a href="https://www.skreutz.com/files/autoinstall-openbsd-on-qemu.sh">complete POSIX shell script</a> to auto-install OpenBSD on QEMU. In fact, I have written another script to install and test the said pet project of mine as well. But this is out of scope here.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>It’s easier to manage 4 people than it is to manage one person. The primary reason for this is the inherent over-reliance in the relationship between a manager and a single report. Let’s dive deeper.</p>

<p>It’s not uncommon for a first-time manager to get a single direct report. Try it out. See how it goes. Here’s what this ends up looking like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The new manager is over-reliant on making sure their single report likes them and is doing well. If they give feedback that their manager stinks, that’s 100% bad feedback from your reports. If the report doesn’t do well, that’s 100% of your reports that aren’t succeeding.* If the report quits, you just lost your whole team.</li>
  <li>The manager’s over-reliance on the direct report’s success and happiness leads to risk-averse behavior, like not giving critical feedback or overcompensating. It also regularly leads to micromanagement.</li>
  <li>The single report is isolated. They don’t have any peers on the team to reach out to for help. If their manager is bad, they don’t have any corroborating voices. Anything that goes wrong is a they-said I-said debate. Any debate inside of the team is a faceoff with your manager.</li>
  <li>No one in this relationship has the ability to get context. With more reports, a manager gets clearer signals when they’re wrong. A report could look to teammates to corroborate or dissuade their ideas. With one report, disagreements have little additional evidence, so people have to either approach the situation with a supreme lack of ego, or they can just assume it’s the other person’s fault. Guess which option happens most.</li>
</ul>

<p>To further the problematic conditions, the single report will often be a very junior hire. This compounds the issue. Straight-from-college hires don’t have great context for what it means to be in industry, to have a manager, to work a job with no end-of-semester in sight. And hires aren’t expected to have as much autonomy in their formative early years. With these variables, the requirements on the manager are higher than average.</p>

<p>It’s not uncommon for these relationships to turn sour. The manager makes mistakes as they always do. The report makes mistakes as they always do. Fingers are pointed. Times are dire. If you ever hear someone call their manager a “first-time manager”, you know the relationship has reached a special level of hell.</p>

<p>To avoid this situation, consider doing the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Avoid having first time managers have a team of 1 individual contributor for a prolonged amount of time. That team size is an <a href="https://staysaasy.com/management/2020/06/21/goldilocks-management-structure.html">anti-pattern</a> for more reasons than just this one.</li>
  <li>Try and make sure the manager of a team with 1 individual contributor is also an expert in the domain area. Sometimes managers are explicitly not the domain expert by design, but when you have 1 report, a lack of domain expertise is one of the sure-fire ways to make mistakes and a sure-fire way for your report to get the idea that you’re no good.</li>
  <li>Avoid at all costs the combination of: new manager, 1 report, report is new-to-industry, manager is not a subject-matter expert.</li>
</ul>

<p>* Note: mangers should be very invested in their report’s success. But when the manager is <em>over-invested</em> it leads to all sorts of unsavory things, some of which are called out above. Another example is when a report is doing well-enough, but because the manager is <em>over-reliant</em> on their performance, they try to push the report beyond what they can or want to do.</p>

<p>In today’s post we’re going to talk about latencies in a common distributed
system architecture: The root-leaf, or parent-child, fanout architecture. We’ll
try to gain an intuition for what drives tail latency, derive a formula for
tying together the parent and child latency distributions, and provide a useful
interactive visualization to help understand tail latency in these systems.</p>

<h3 id="root-leaf-fanout-architecture">Root-Leaf Fanout Architecture</h3>

<p>When dealing with distributed systems, it’s a common pattern to have a root
aggregator node that fans-out requests to many leaf nodes that do work in
parallel, then send back their response to the root node to aggregate and
create a final response. Usually the API of the system is exposed through the
root-aggregator nodes, so the latency of these root nodes is what matters.</p>

<p>As seasoned distributed system developers, we know that latency (and
performance) is a
<a href="https://medium.com/lightstephq/performance-is-a-shape-not-a-number-a3c1a9ae19cc">shape not a number</a>.
What this means is that we shouldn’t concern ourselves solely with what the
average latency of a service is – we care about the full latency distribution
– and at the very least we should care about the tail. Usually people settle on
monitoring the $90^{th}$ or $99^{th}$ percentile (p90 or p99), and maybe use a
heatmap to visualize the whole latency distribution.</p>

<p>In the case of our parent-aggregator and many children setup, if we’re going to
concern ourselves with its p99 latency, it’d be nice to know for a given fanout,
how fast do our children nodes have to be to get a certain p99 parent
latency. This is also useful when debugging, but in reverse. If I see a p95
latency spike for the parent node, what percentile latency on the children nodes
do I need to care about? How does this change with the fanout size?</p>

<h3 id="defining-the-problem">Defining the Problem</h3>

<p>Before we analyze the problem any further, we should first define exactly what
problem we’re analyzing. In its simplest form, the parent-child system has two
defining properties:</p>

<ol>
<li>Parent latency for a request is greater than or equal to the max of all the children latencies, since the parent must wait for all child responses.</li>
<li>Child latency inevitably has a long tail.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<p>These two properties mean that as we fan out to more children, our parent
latency will get worse, because we’re more likely to hit a long tail latency
event. And conversely if we can reduce our fanout or reduce the variance in our
child latency we’ll be able to drive down our overall latency.</p>

<p>What’s not immediately obvious though is the magnitude of the effect of reducing
fanout or improving child latency variance is. To try to gain some
understanding, let’s consider a situation where the child latency follows a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution">log normal distribution</a>
with $\mu = 3$ and $\sigma = 0.2$ and consider the latency distributions of the
child, and parents who fan out to varying number of children per request: 10,
100, 1000.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Now we’ll visualize the reconstructed
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function">probability density functions</a>
based on observations from generated data, for both the children and the parents:</p>

<p><img src="https://paulcavallaro.com/images/fanouts-child-parent-pdfs-density-plot.png" title="Density plot of child and parent latency probability density functions"></p>

<p>What’s immediately obvious is that as the fanout increases, the parent latency distribution gets worse and worse, and is dominated by the tail latency of the children. By the time we’re fanning out to 1000 children, the parent latency distribution looks almost completely unrelated to the child latency distribution. While we could have predicted this, hopefully this visualization helps build up our intuition of the problem.</p>

<h3 id="deriving-a-closed-form-solution">Deriving a Closed Form Solution</h3>

<p>We began this adventure trying to answer a question, and now it is time to return to it: <em>What child latency percentile drives a given parent latency percentile?</em></p>

<p>Although the problem is pretty simple, I wrestled with it a bit until a friend
pointed out that you can think of a percentile latency as not describing a point
in the latency distribution but instead as a <em>probability</em> that a request
finishes in a given amount of time. So if the p90 latency is 10ms, we can
reframe this as saying that the probability a request finishes within 10ms is
$90\%$.</p>

<p>When we combine this insight with the fact that a parent request only finishes
once all its children requests finish, we can derive a closed form solution to
our problem.</p>

<p>Since the parent request finishes only after all $N$ children requests finish,
then the probability the parent request finishes in time $t$, is the probability
that all $N$ children finish in time $t$. Assuming all children latencies are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables">independent and identically distributed</a><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>
then we can calculate the parent probability as:</p>

<p>$$
P_{parent\ finishes\ in\ t\ secs} = (P_{child\ finishes\ in\ t\ secs})^N
$$</p>

<p>which when we solve for child latency percentile gives us the following formula:</p>

<p>$$
P_{child} \approx \sqrt[N]{P_{parent}}
$$</p>

<p>Now that we have a formula for our problem, we can begin inspecting some
secnarios. If we cared about the $90^{th}$ percentile latency of the parent,
and the fanout was to 2 children, then we would need to care about the
$94.86^{th}$ percentile at the children, since $\sqrt{0.9} \approx 0.9486$.</p>

<p>One thing about this formula that can be surprising, is how quickly the child
percentile we have to care about grows as we increase the fanout. Even fanning
out to 20 children, and monitoring the $90^{th}$ percentile latency of the parent,
we need to care about the $99.47^{th}$ percentile latency of the children!</p>

<p>The graph below shows how quickly $50^{th}$, $90^{th}$, and $99^{th}$ parent
percentile latency converges to being driven by the $100^{th}$ percentile child
latency as fanout size grows.</p>

<p><img src="https://paulcavallaro.com/images/fanouts-parent-latency-percentile.png" title="Graph of Child Percentile Latency vs. # of Children in Fanout"></p>

<p>Here is a zoomed-in view focusing on the $90^{th}$ percentile and above:</p>

<p><img src="https://paulcavallaro.com/images/fanouts-parent-latency-percentile-zoomed.png" title="Graph of Child Percentile Latency vs. # of Children in Fanout Zoomed"></p>

<p>We can see that if we’re monitoring the p90 latency of the parent, by the time we fan out to 10 children, we’ll have to start caring about the p99 latency of the children.</p>

<h3 id="trust-but-verify-and-visualize">Trust, but Verify (and Visualize)</h3>

<p>Although the formula makes sense, and the intuition behind it sounds reasonable<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>, I often find it helpful when confronted with a formula to verify its correctness by simulation. So I below is a little simulation and visualization to do just that. <strong>The main spiffiness comes when you hover over a bar in either distribution</strong>, as the visualization will highlight both the percentile in its distribution as well as highlight the corresponding percentile in the other distribution:</p>






<p>The above is an example visualization generated from a generalized tool, simulating 3000 requests to a parent fanning out to 20 children, where the child latency distribution is a log normal distribution with $\mu = 3.4$ and $\sigma = 0.3$. The tool itself is <a href="https://paulcavallaro.com/standalone/fanouts.html">hosted here</a>, and the code is in this <a href="https://github.com/paulcavallaro/fanouts-and-percentiles">github repo</a>.</p>

<p>Now we can use this visualization to confirm our formula empirically. If we hover over the bar that correlates with the p95 latency in the parent distribution, our formula predicts that the child latency it corresponds to should be $\sqrt[20]{0.95} \approx .9974$ or p99.74, which is roughly what I get.</p>

<h3 id="bach-s-fanout-variations">Bach’s Fanout Variations</h3>

<p>While we now have a nice way to reason about and visualize the simplest version
of the problem, there are still many variations that would be useful to understand.</p>

<p>Here are some things we might want to do to our system to improve the overall latency:</p>

<ul>
<li>What happens if we drop the slowest child request?</li>
<li>What happens if we retry the slowest child request if it takes “too long”?</li>
<li>What happens if we send every child request to two children instead and just use the fastest response?</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m not the first person to think about this, lots of the ideas in this section
are stolen directly from the
<a href="https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub40801">Tail at Scale</a>, as well as things
I’ve observed in the wild.</p>

<p>This is a pretty rich topic, so hopefully in the future I can revisit it and
update the visualization to take account of these subtleties.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><div><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The repositories of distributions such as <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> and <a href="https://nixos.org/nixpkgs/">Nixpkgs</a> are among the
<a href="https://repology.org/repositories/statistics/newest">largest</a> collections of open source (and some unfree) software. They
are complex systems that connect and organize many interdependent packages.
Interestingly, these systems grow out of the individual design choices of
thousands of contributors but few of them have larger design goals in mind.</p>
<p>Is it possible to capture the large scale features of such a repository in an
image? Are there common design choices of the contributors? Did they lead to
any emergent structure?</p>
<p>Plenty of studies (e.g. <a href="https://www2.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/pubs/jrnl/2008-TOSEM-PowerLaws/html/LSV08.pdf">here</a>,
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0904.0087.pdf">here</a>, or
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0305575.pdf">here</a>) have examined these questions
from different viewpoints and for various software ecosystems. In this blog
post I’ll try to shed some light on them from the perspective of Nixpkgs,
mostly with visualizations of its complete dependency graph but also with a
very short examination of its statistical properties (its degree distribution).
But wait, you might think: “visualizing a graph with 50000 nodes and 300000
edges? - All you are going to see is black!“. Well, it turns out that this is
not the case because large scale structures appear when we look at the graph in
the right way.</p>
<h2>An overview of the Nixpkgs dependency graph</h2>
<p>Before explaining in detail what I did, let’s start with a teaser. Check out
the structure in this fascinating image where each little dot represents a
single software package in the Nixpkgs repository:</p>

<p>What looks remotely like the section of a mouse brain actually represents
around 46000 software packages. Each dot in this image corresponds to a
different one, more precisely to a Nix derivation in the Nixpkgs repository.
Each package is invisibly linked to those that it depends on (ingoing
dependencies) or those that depend on it (outgoing dependencies). These
packages are the nodes, and their invisible links the incoming and outgoing
edges of the directed dependency graph of Nixpkgs.</p>
<p>The total number of dependencies that a node has is called the node’s <em>degree</em>.
It is subdivided in the <em>in degree</em> which counts the number of ingoing
dependencies and the <em>out degree</em> which counts the number of outgoing
dependencies. I have colored and sized the nodes in the above image by their in
degree: a brighter larger node means that more derivations depend on it (high
in degree) than on a darker smaller node (low in degree). Size and color are
scaled non-linearly and should only be interpreted qualitatively. We will see
later from the distribution of these degrees why this makes sense.</p>
<p>The graph was laid out and visualized with the program <a href="https://gephi.org/">gephi</a> using a
<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0098679">force simulation algorithm</a> to project each node to a display
positions in the image. This force model consists of attractive and repulsive
forces that drag the nodes into their final positions that you can see in the
image.</p>
<p>The attractive force pulls nodes towards their dependencies. Therefore nodes
with similar dependencies end up close to each other. Looking back at the
image, we see the effect of this force in the form of node clusters with
visible gaps between them. The repulsive force pushes nodes away from
dependencies that have high degree. High degree nodes therefore appear with a
lot of space around them. Low degree nodes, on the other hand, are tightly
packed.</p>
<p>As a final addition, a gravitational force keeps the whole graph together and
squeezes it into roughly circular form. Check out the appendix at the end of
this post for a detailed explanation, including the code and the data that are
required to reproduce this image yourself.</p>
<p>The following image of the dependency graph was laid out in the same way, but
shows the package name of each node explicitly. As before, the package names
are scaled non-linearly with the in degree of the node. The names of the
largest nodes - we’ll call them hub nodes - are well readable but to read the
labels of the smaller nodes you should click on the image and use your browsers
zoom functionality.</p>

<p>Most central to the Nixpkgs repository are the primary hub nodes <em>bash</em> and the
Nix <em>stdenv</em> derivation. Unsurprisingly, most derivations depend on them - at
least at build time - because <em>bash</em> is one of the most commonly used Unix
shells and <em>stdenv</em> is a nix package that groups very fundamental build
dependencies such as GNU make. Both are used as default environments in Nix.</p>
<p>Slightly smaller secondary hub nodes can also be identified:
<em>curl</em> and <em>mirrors-list</em> seem to be central to the upper part of the graph and
indicate that it has something to do with the internet. On the right side,
<em>Python2.7</em> and <em>Python3.6</em> are visible as distinct clusters and grouped around
a central <em>hook</em> derivation that is used by Nix to setup a Python environment.
On the left side, different versions of Perl can be seen. In the bottom, the
Linux library manager tool <em>pkg-config</em> forms a little aura that matches its
importance for the open source ecosystem.</p>
<p>The hub nodes indicate that some clusters in this graph correspond to the
environments of different programming languages. Naturally packages in these
environments will have a common set of dependencies and therefore appear close
to each other in the graph.</p>
<h2>Ego networks: exploring hub node environments</h2>
<p>Let’s dive further into this. A hub node forms a little subgraph together with
its ingoing and outgoing dependencies that is sometimes called its <a href="http://www.analytictech.com/networks/egonet.htm"><em>ego network</em></a>
(this term seems to originate in studies of social networks). In the following
plot, the ego networks of a few selected hub nodes are colored in green. The
corresponding hub node’s name is indicated above each subplot. It illustrates
nicely how clusters form around a compiler, an interpreter or just an important
tool:</p>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>The ego networks confirm our previous intuition that some clusters correspond
to different programming languages. They also provide basic orientation on this
graph. Here is a short description of the different ego networks:</p>
<p>Most of the upper part of the graph is dominated by <em>curl</em>. Closer inspection
shows that most of these derivations are archives such as <em>.tar.gz</em> files or
language specific archives such as <em>.gem</em> files. These archives are downloaded
from the internet before other packages are derived from them. Another large,
but less tightly packed region is the <em>pkg-config</em> zone. It dominates the
bottom of the graph and it is characterized by lots of smaller hub nodes
indicating that <em>pkg-config</em> organizes many packages that are important for
other packages. The ego network of <em>cmake</em> is mixed into a similar region of
the graph.</p>
<p>Python2.7 and Python3.6 form neat clusters with three central hub nodes that
correpond to the python interpreter, the package management tool <em>pip</em>, and the
build and installation tool <em>setuptools</em>. Python2.7 is used more often by
packages outside of its cluster than Python3.6. In contrast to Python, Perl has
only a single hub node for each specific version but it forms similarly dense
clusters. From the different Perl versions, <em>Perl-5.28.0</em> is reused most outside
of its own cluster by a lot of other packages in the <em>pkg-config</em> zone. This
indicates that the specific version of the Nixpkgs repository that I have
evaluated uses this particular Perl version as the default for other packages.</p>
<p>Lisp (sbcl), Haskell (ghc), Ruby, OCaml, Go, and Rust derivations also
accumulate in tight clusters around their respective compiler.</p>
<p>Ego networks can only give a glimpse into the structure of the graph of
Nixpkgs. Not all environments are organized around a central hub. Some packages
are self-contained and independent. For example, the Go
packages form a tight independent group because they <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26217488/what-is-vendoring">often include copies of third party packages that they depend on</a>.
There are also many smaller clusters that correspond to particular tools such
as terraform, maven or even the vim plugins. If you have time and patience, you
can try to find them in the labelled graph image above.</p>
<h2>The degree distribution of the Nixpkgs dependency graph</h2>
<p>Another perspective on the global properties of the Nixpkgs repository is the
degree distribution of its nodes. It shows how many nodes exist with a certain
in or out degree (as a reminder: the in degree is the number of packages that
depend on the node; the out degree is the number of packages that the node
depends on). Certainly there are a lot more nodes with low in degree than with
high in degree. More interesting is how the number of nodes with a
certain degree changes between the extremes.</p>
<p>A whole bunch of studies (for example
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0904.0087.pdf">here</a>,
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0305575.pdf">here</a>) have found that the in degree
distribution of software repository dependencies follows a power-law
distribution, similar to the degree distributions of networks in Geology,
Biology, Economics, or the Internet
(<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/courses/2006/cmplxsys899/powerlaws.pdf">here is a short introduction on power-laws</a>).
Such a power-law distribution can be generated by several mechanisms. The
hottest candidate mechanism in the case of software repositories seems to be
<em>preferential attachment</em>, a.k.a. “the rich get richer”. In other words, a new
package is more likely to depend on existing packages with a lot than on
packages with few dependencies. Other mechanisms such as <em>self-organized criticality</em>
<a href="https://sail.cs.queensu.ca/Downloads/ICSM-ICSME2007_EmpiricalEvidenceForSOCDynamicsInSoftwareEvolution.pdf">might also play a role</a>.</p>
<p>The (complementary) cumulative in and out degree distributions show how many
packages exist above a certain degree. Looking at the cumulative distribution
is typically better than looking at its derivative, the degree distribution. As
an integral, the cumulative distribution has a better behavior when the density
of packages gets low at high degrees. We plot it here for the in and
out degrees in log-log scale such that a power-law is just a straight line:</p>

<p>The cumulative in degree distribution is a very clean power-law decay with an
exponent of -0.9. The in degree distribution itself has an exponent of -1.9,
because it is the derivative of the cumulative distribution. The value that we
observe falls in the range of values that have been …</p></div></div></div></section></div>

<p>Yesterday I gave a talk at the EuroPython 2020 Online Edition with title <a href="https://www.paulox.net/2020/07/23/europython-2020/#europython-2020/">“A pythonic full-text search”</a> which is now available here on my&nbsp;blog.</p>
<p><em>In the last few years I gave a lot of talks in various tech conferences in Europe, but it was my first talk in an online conference, so I decided to share some thoughts about this&nbsp;experience.</em></p>
<p>The EuroPython team did a great job organizing everything. They made a list of tips and a complete guide for speakers that I suggest, to organizers and speakers of other conferences, to&nbsp;read.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/europython-2020-social-online-card.jpg" title="Tips for Speakers — EuroPython 2020 Online · 23-26 July 2020" alt="Tips for Speakers — EuroPython 2020 Online · 23-26 July 2020"></p>
<p>ep2020.europython.eu/events/tips/</p>

<p>Besides reading the guide and attending the rehearsal session, I’ve spent a lot of time trying to have a good setup. I copied from other conference speakers, and to have a working virtual background in zoom, I used my two external monitors as light&nbsp;panels.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-00.jpg"></p>
<p>Attending an online conference is a new experience , but giving a talk remotely is way more strange than in a regular conference. There’s nobody around to speak with, smiles at or asking to take a picture, so I shoot by myself some pictures of me during the&nbsp;talk.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-01.jpg"></p>
<p>At the same time, I was able to capture some screenshots of myself giving the talk from the live Youtube channel, so I have a picture of me from the other side of the screen in the exact moment of the above&nbsp;picture.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-02.png"></p>
<p>In the speakers guide there was this suggestion: “Throw in some jokes. Even bad jokes. Even a really bad pun.”. I tried to make a joke about synchronization problems in full-text search, a very dangerous thing to do, but here I’m laughing at my own joke during the&nbsp;talk.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-03.png"></p>
<p>Another suggestion from the organizers was to use “Pictures instead of bullet points in slides. Pictures are great. Everyone loves cats.” so I&nbsp;used:</p>
<ul>
<li>an elephant (the logo of&nbsp;PostgreSQL)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-04.jpg"></p>
<ul>
<li>a famous guitaris (Django Reinhardt from whom the Django web framework takes its&nbsp;name)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-05.jpg"></p>
<ul>
<li>some&nbsp;books</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-07.jpg"></p>
<ul>
<li>a picture of me at EuroPython 2017 during the sprint on&nbsp;Django</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-06.jpg"></p>
<p>In an online conference people are more interactive and free to do other things watching your talk, so I published in advance a post on my blog with the slides and other information about the talk, and I shared a <span>QR</span>-code linked to it and also all my other&nbsp;contacts.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-08.png"></p>
<p>Giving online talks is a stressful thing, but answering questions is way more difficult, you are not able to see who is asking the question and its expression. In these pictures I was at the end of the talk after a few questions, waiting for an&nbsp;applause.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-09.jpg"></p>
<p>This was my first time giving a talk in an online conference, it was a very challenging experience but I enjoyed it. I learnt a lot of new stuff, also how to take a picture of myself after the talk, to share it&nbsp;online.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-10.jpg"></p>
<p>I’ll gave other talks this year, I listed them on my talks&nbsp;page:</p>

<p><strong>See you at the next&nbsp;conference!</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>For as long as I can remember, I’ve had a sense that time is running out. When I was in college, I felt like I only had a few years to make an impact on the world. Now that I’m 27, and my early 20s have turned into my late 20s, this sense of urgency has only accelerated.</p>

<h3 id="invictus">Invictus</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51642/invictus">I am the master of my fate. I am the captain of my soul.</a> At least that’s what I tell myself. But life is comprised of both decisions that you make and other things that…just happen to you. The more I go through life, the more I realize that what happens to you has a greater impact than the decisions that you make. All we can try to do is shift the relative weights of that equation a little bit.</p>

<p>As a kid, I felt that the future was full of infinite possibilities. I had a million things to learn, books to read, places to travel, and experiences to rack up. I felt like I could be anything I wanted – a theoretical physicist, a musician, an athlete – if only I would dedicate myself to one pursuit.</p>

<p>I still feel like most of my life is ahead of me. But with each day that goes by, the universe of options that I have is quickly shrinking. Every day I decide to continue down my current path, countless other doors are closed off to me.</p>

<p>I started boxing last year. I really love it; it’s the first time I’ve felt dedicated to a sport since I played football in high school. But I will never be an elite boxer. That door has already closed. My athletic peak will probably occur in the next 5 years, if it hasn’t already. I could choose to train as hard as I could at boxing and devote myself to the sport, but even so, my ceiling would be a few amateur bouts. And the opportunity cost of going down that path is high.</p>

<p>You can’t have it all. Life is a series of tradeoffs. That truth, while simple, is hard to accept. It’s difficult to escape the feeling that your 20s is just a series of doors closing to you. Most people don’t even realize that those doors exist; their lives are lived by default. I wonder how much I fall into that camp. How much have I missed out on because I skated by on raw intelligence and didn’t challenge myself for the majority of my life?</p>

<p>When I was 10 years old, I thought that at this point in my life I’d be a pro athlete or a paleontologist. When I was 15, I thought that I’d be running a non-profit in Africa. When I was 20, I thought that I’d be a successful startup founder.</p>

<p>Now I fear that I’m not living up to my potential. By not diving deep into any one area, I’ve had an amazing breadth of experiences, but also worry that I’ve fallen victim to the <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/5/25/desai-commencement-ed/">Optionality Trap</a>. Did I work hard enough over the past 10 years? Did I study the right things? Did I make the right choices?</p>

<p>There is so much I want to learn, experience, and accomplish in life. Despite my best efforts, I’ll only ever do a fraction of those. Life is short and I don’t have the time to do it all. I’m not sure if this feeling goes away with time, or if you just learn to live with it.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/mountain.jpg" alt="Man soul-searching on mountain"></p>

<h3 id="the-four-burners-theory">The Four Burners Theory</h3>
<p>James Clear talks about the <a href="https://jamesclear.com/four-burners-theory">Four Burners Theory</a>: there are tradeoffs among the different areas of your life. If your life is represented as a stove, every time you decide to invest time in one of the four burners – family, friends, health, and work – you necessarily lower the heat on your other burners. To be successful, you have to cut off one of your burners. To perform at an elite level, you need to cut off two.</p>

<p>I’ve felt this acutely. I’m trying to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Perform well at work</li>
  <li>Get a <a href="https://cadena.coffee/">coffee roasting business</a> off of the ground</li>
  <li>Read and write regularly</li>
  <li>Be a good boyfriend, son, and brother</li>
  <li>Work out hard and reach my athletic potential</li>
  <li>Improve my technical skillset – I’m currently working on a few Coursera classes and have applied for a Masters program in Computer Science</li>
</ul>

<p>Many days, I feel like I’m barely treading water. By trying to do everything, I excel at nothing.</p>

<p>How to combat this? For me, it’s a combination of:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Introducing constraints</li>
  <li>Short-term immersion; long-term balance</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="introducing-constraints">Introducing Constraints</h3>
<p>I am not entirely happy with the final draft of this blog post. If I had worked on it for a few more hours, it would be better. But is the marginal benefit worth the marginal cost? (For those who don’t think in economic terms: Is the juice worth the squeeze?)</p>

<p>I’ve always been a procrastinator. I file an extension for my tax return every year. I’ve written every paper I was assigned in school the night before it was due. So I have tangibly experienced two truths:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Work will fill the time allotted for it (Parkinson’s Law).</li>
  <li>“Done” is always better than “perfect…but not yet launched”.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think often of the story of the clay pots, from the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0042JSQLU/">Art &amp; Fear</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/clay_pot.jpg" alt="Clay pot"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality. His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the “quantity” group: fifty pound of pots rated an “A”, forty pounds a “B”, and so on. Those being graded on “quality”, however, needed to produce only one pot – albeit a perfect one – to get an “A”. Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the “quantity” group was busily churning out piles of work – and learning from their mistakes – the “quality” group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By time-boxing tasks and letting go of the pursuit of perfection, I can produce both a greater quantity <em>and quality</em> of work.</p>

<p>The overarching constraint in life is time. The clock is ticking: we will all die. Without this constraint, we wouldn’t have the motivation to do anything. Paradoxically, embracing constraints can lead to better long-term results.</p>

<h3 id="short-term-immersion-long-term-balance">Short-term Immersion; Long-term Balance</h3>
<p>I’ve found that intense learning over short periods of time is superior to casual learning over longer periods of time. I took Spanish from second grade through college, but I only improved dramatically when I studied abroad for a semester in Buenos Aires. Those first few weeks in Argentina, I struggled, but by pushing through the pain period I was able to become functionally fluent. Since then, my Spanish abilities have declined, but I can <a href="https://tim.blog/2007/09/20/how-to-resurrect-your-high-school-spanish-or-any-language-plus-be-on-the-cbs-early-show/">reactivate my Spanish</a> when necessary.</p>

<p>Likewise, to make substantial progress in any area of my life I need to get into a flow state, a period of obsession where all I’m thinking about is <a href="https://paranoidenough.com/">this blog</a> or <a href="https://cadena.coffee/">Cadena Coffee</a>. Today, I worked on this blog post and spent time with family. I didn’t make any progress in my health or work-related goals. That’s okay.</p>

<p>By diving deep and solely focusing on 1-2 burners for a burst of a week, month, or quarter, I can make drastic progress in those areas – progress that I wouldn’t be able to make in the same number of hours spread out over a period of time. So while my life may not have balance at any single point in time, over the long-run I can make progress in all of the areas that I care about.</p>

    <p>Getting stuck really sucks. It can be soul-crushing.</p>
<p>As developers, what do we do when we are stuck?
We have a process for code review, unit testing and deployment.</p>
<p>What is your process for when I get stuck though?</p>
<p><img src="https://sebthecat.com/images/stuckcat.jpg" alt="https://unsplash.com/@tomastuma?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"></p>

<p>I ran into a really frustrating problem during my live stream and after <em>hours</em> of struggling with it I just had to call it a day.</p>
<p>Speaking with a friend that evening, they asked me how the stream had gone and I lamented my getting stuck.</p>
<p>Their response inspired me to write this post.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You stream to help people learn, right? Maybe watching a professional work through hard problems is more useful to your audience than seeing you do everything as if by magic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They were right.</p>
<p>The next day, instead of the previous feeling of dread at facing my own inadequacies, I felt inspired to build a strategy for when I was stuck, publish it, and ask for feedback and improvements from the broader development community.</p>
<p>So here we are. Please suggest additional steps in the comments!</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="https://sebthecat.com/images/backtrace.jpg" alt="https://unsplash.com/@maxchen2k?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"></p>
<h2 id="step-1-collect-information">Step 1: Collect Information</h2>
<p>This seems like the obvious place to start.</p>
<p>Collect everything you can about the issue and put it in a file. I use a simple markdown editor to take notes while I work or stream.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Copy the error</strong>
<br>
Copy <em>the exact</em> error into your file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Read the error carefully</strong>
<br>
Like <em>actually</em> read it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Investigate and record the backtrace</strong>
<br>
If you have a backtrace, step through it and read the surrounding code. If anything looks suspicious, copy it into your file too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Re-read documentation</strong>
<br>
Go through any documentation around the code or tool in question.
Copy links or documentation into your file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Look for code examples</strong>
<br>
Search the documentation for relevant examples and stick them into your document as well.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><img src="https://sebthecat.com/images/googlesearch.jpg" alt="https://unsplash.com/@nathanareboucas?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"></p>
<h2 id="step-2-ask-google">Step 2: Ask Google</h2>
<p>You may be surpised that a Google search wasn’t step 1. Let’s be honest, you probably did a Google search before you even considered yourself <strong>“stuck”</strong>.</p>
<p>There is a reason this is step 2. Without the previous step (collecting information), you would be jumping into an ocean of information without arming yourself with some of your own.</p>
<p>Google is infamously good at solving programming problems, until when it isn’t. Then you’re really fucked. So do your research first. It’s too easy to get lost in pages of results otherwise.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Search the exact error</strong>
<br>
This should be your beginning point.
<br>
<code>Uncaught TypeError: fs.existsSync is not a function at getElectronPath</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Add quotes in appropriate places</strong>
<br>
If you don’t know how to use quotes in Google searches,
<a href="http://www.googleguide.com/quote_operator.html">I’d suggest learning them here</a>.
You should look at which parts of the error should always be considered together.
<br>
<code>Uncaught TypeError: "fs.existsSync is not a function" at getElectronPath</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Search the error without project-specific terms</strong>
<br>
Try and remove terms which are specific to your particular implementation. In the example, “uncaught” is probably not too relevant and <code>getElectronPath</code> may not be the only context which triggers the error. So let’s strip that out.
<br>
<code>TypeError: fs.existsSync is not a function</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Search for “what you are trying to achieve” instead</strong>
<br>
Maybe you’re trying to do the thing you’re trying to do in the wrong way. This is a good way to sanity check.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, if you find any possible solutions, record them in your document!</p>

<h2 id="step-3-ask-a-human-asynchronously">Step 3: Ask a Human Asynchronously</h2>
<p>Depending on your company culture, this step may come earlier or later.
I <strong>do</strong> think it’s important to ensure that you reach out asynchronously first.</p>
<p>I believe people should consider their colleagues’ time and attention to be the most precious resource in any organization.</p>
<p>This means Slack, Microsoft Teams or god forbid E-mail.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="https://sebthecat.com/images/frustration.jpg" alt="https://unsplash.com/@punttim?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"></p>
<h2 id="step-4-reproduce-the-error-in-a-simplified-manner">Step 4: Reproduce the Error in a Simplified Manner</h2>
<p>This is a technique I often forget, but can prove invaluable in your quest for answers.</p>
<p>The basic idea is this: reduce the problem space.</p>
<p>This means either commenting out or removing parts of your system until you can’t remove anything else.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can try and work in the opposite direction and try and <em>build</em> the minimum amount of surface area before you run into your issue. This strategy often means starting an entirely fresh project and rebuilding a tiny subsection of functionality in isolation.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="https://sebthecat.com/images/stackoverflow.jpg" alt="https://stackoverflow.com"></p>
<h2 id="step-5-stack-overflow">Step 5: Stack Overflow</h2>
<p>Stack Overflow doesn’t hold the highest reputation for friendliness, but this is usually because people who ask questions there have been lazy and not done the appropriate work to prepare their question.</p>
<p>That’s why you should <em>always</em> search for your question first. Be considerate.</p>
<p>Ask on Stack Overflow, but make sure to use your handy document (there was a reason to record all of this after all!) for reference. Post context, be descriptive, be polite.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="https://sebthecat.com/images/typing.jpg" alt="https://unsplash.com/@glenncarstenspeters?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"></p>
<h2 id="step-6-irc--gitter--reddit">Step 6: IRC / Gitter / Reddit</h2>
<p>Now we’re getting desperate.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you’ll often find that particular libraries and ecosystems have their own IRC channels. Yeah. IRC. Remember that?
<a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/">Check out FreeNode IRC here.</a></p>
<p>Barring that, check out <a href="https://gitter.im/">Gitter</a>. If you’re not familiar, Gitter is a instant messaging platform that plugs into Github and other coding tools to build communities around particular software libraries.</p>
<p>If you get really desperate, try checking your programming language’s subreddit.
<a href="https://sebthecat.com/2020/07/reddit.com/r/javascript">For instance, here is the Javascript one.</a></p>
<hr>
<p><img src="https://sebthecat.com/images/github.jpg" alt="https://unsplash.com/@lukechesser?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"></p>
<h2 id="step-7-github-issue">Step 7: GitHub (Issue)</h2>
<p>Okay. Maybe you’re not the problem. Maybe it’s a bug in <strong>someone else’s code</strong>. <strong>GASP</strong>. I know, you certainly didn’t think that before now right? ;)</p>
<p>So, let’s use the same principles of considerate detail that we used with Stack Overflow here.</p>
<p>Let’s create a GitHub issue. <strong>But before you do</strong>, re-read the documentation <em>again</em>.
And while you’re here, you may as well read the source code and look at more recent versions of the software that might already contain the fix you need!</p>
<p>Create a Git issue in the library you believe to be the cause.</p>
<p>Be polite and don’t assume they are wrong. You’re probably doing something stupid.
I’ve been doing this shit for over 2 decades and I do <em>incredibly</em> stupid things in my code almost hourly.</p>

<h2 id="step-8-can-we-do-it-better">Step 8: Can we do it better?</h2>
<p>Can you implement what you want to do in an <em>even</em> better way?</p>
<p>Stop. Think about it.</p>
<p>What if you could achieve what you’re trying to do without using this tool, or method, or class?
Could you do this thing in an <em>even better</em> way, that circumvents this whole problem entirely?</p>

<h2 id="step-9-can-we-get-it-working-worse">Step 9: Can we get it working, worse?</h2>
<p>We’re getting to the end of our metaphorical tether. Okay. Deep breath.</p>
<p>What could we do to get this working “quick and dirty”?</p>
<p>What that be enough? Is there a “lo-fi” or “low-tech” solution here that allows us to dodge this issue?</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="https://sebthecat.com/images/rubberduck.jpg" alt="https://unsplash.com/@jlcruz_photography?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"></p>
<h2 id="step-10-rubber-ducking">Step 10: Rubber Ducking</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">The ancient Chinese art of “Rubber Ducking”</a>.</p>
<p>This is a technique where you talk to an inanimate object like a lunatic. It actually works.
Go find some private place (unless you already have a reputation for psychotic breaks).</p>
<p>Speak through your problem out loud. Externalizing the problem usually helps us approach it from a new perspective.</p>

<h2 id="step-11-ask-a-colleague-synchronously">Step 11: Ask a Colleague Synchronously</h2>
<p>Okay, by now your colleague should have responded to your earlier request. If they haven’t, they are ignoring you because they can detect your terror.</p>
<p>At this point you have my permission to interupt their ass. If they complain, send them my way. Really. I could use the publicity.</p>
<p><strong>Pair on the problem.</strong></p>
<p>Don’t just ask them questions. Get them looking at the code. Run them through it.</p>
<p>Your goal here <strong>is not to share your pain</strong>, it’s to <strong>share your understanding of the problem</strong>. Remember this.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, show them the massive document you’ve prepared with everything you’ve found out and tried.</p>

<p>When you find your solution don’t just forget the process and dump all of your good work.</p>
<p>You’ll probably encounter this problem again, and if you won’t, someone else will.</p>
<p>Take your notes and write them up. Post them on your company’s development wiki. Even better, post them on a blog somewhere. Share the love brah. Please!</p>

<p>This was just what I came up with.</p>
<p>If you have any recommendations… additional steps, reordering or improvements <strong>please comment</strong>!
I’d love to add to this. :) Getting stuck <em>really sucks</em>. It can be soul-crushing.</p>
<p>So. Share the love. &lt;3</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                
    <span>Jul 2020</span>

    

    <p>Letâ€™s just skip the intro and get to the good stuff. Mmkay? Kay.</p>
<h2>1) Move â€œFind Allâ€� To The Bottom</h2>
<p>When you hit <em>Cmd+Shift+F</em> VS Codeâ€™s â€œFind Allâ€� panel shows up.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s a super powerful feature. Itâ€™s one of the niceties that originally drew me away from Sublime Text in the first place.</p>
<p>WHY IN THE WORLD IS IT SCRUNCHED IN THE SIDEBAR!!??!</p>
<p><img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/1470600526.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The bottom panel thingy (where the terminal sits) is a much better place for â€œSearchâ€�.</p>
<p>This actually used to be the default in VS Code, and there was a setting to customize it yourself.</p>
<p>Now, they changed the default AND they removed the setting completely.</p>
<p>What are we to do?</p>
<p>Welp, turns out you can just drag it. Take a gander:</p>
<p><img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/1353159485.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>There we go. One annoyance down. Four to go.</p>
<h2>2) Better New Window Sizing</h2>
<p>This one might just be me, but when I open a new VS Code window, I expect it to be the same size as the previously opened one.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s what opening a new window in VS Code looks like with an existing window already opened by default:
<img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/3312027563.png" alt="">
Now, admittedly, this actually looks kind of cool, but nonetheless, it would make so much more sense if VS Code just used the last known window size as a reference.</p>
<p>To make this happen, we can add the following configuration to our <em>settings.json</em> file.</p>
<p>To open <em>settings.json</em>, search for â€œsettings jsonâ€� in the command palette (<em>Cmd+Shift+P</em>):
<img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/3815150.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now, you can add the following line:</p>
<pre><code>"window.newWindowDimensions": "inherit",</code></pre>
<p>Hereâ€™s what opening a new window will look like now:
<img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/3355376318.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You might also prefer to keep the same dimensions, but â€œoffsetâ€� the new window. You can do that with the following setting:</p>
<pre><code>"window.newWindowDimensions": "offset",</code></pre>
<p>Now, the new window will be â€œoffsetâ€�:
<img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/32369233.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>3) Snippet Suggestions At The Top</h2>
<p>Snippets in VS Code are a powerful way to auto-fill repetitive boilerplate text. If you donâ€™t already use them, you can read more about them <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets">here</a>.</p>
<p>I donâ€™t know about you, but if I registered a trigger for a snippet, I want to see that snippet at the top of my autocomplete list. Otherwise, SNIPPETS ARE USELESS.</p>
<p>Snippets have to be fast and easy to trigger, and out of the box THEY ARE NOT.</p>
<p>Take the following example GIF of a <code>console.log</code> snippet with a trigger of <code>con</code>.</p>
<p>When I type <code>con</code> I should be able to hit <em>Enter</em> and fill <code>console.log</code>.
This is not the case: </p>
<p><img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/2858044731.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>To remedy this, we can add a new setting to our <em>settings.json</em> file:</p>
<pre><code>"editor.snippetSuggestions": "top",</code></pre>
<p>Now, when I type <code>con</code>, my suggestions are more sensible:</p>
<p><img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/4146687846.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Ugh, VS Codeâ€¦</p>
<h2>4) GitHub-Style Inline Diffs</h2>
<p>I LOVE VS Codeâ€™s diff viewer.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s a great way to get a glimpse of your changes before a commit, or easily resolve a merge conflict.</p>
<p>However, the default diff viewer is â€œSide by Sideâ€�. Meaning there are two panels with two different versions of the same file open side by side:</p>
<p><img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/595731340.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I much prefer the way GitHub renders diffs inline:</p>
<p><img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/1762674115.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We can easily achieve this in VS Code with the following setting:</p>
<pre><code>"diffEditor.renderSideBySide": false,</code></pre>
<p>Now take a look at the diff editor in VS Code:
<img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/2616479419.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Wehoo, love it ðŸ‘ŒðŸ�»</p>
<h2>5) Disable â€œPeekâ€� Previews</h2>
<p>Previews panels in VS Code are the most annoying thing ever.</p>
<p>So ugly and so useless.</p>
<p>I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever wanted to see a tiny preview of a file instead of just viewing the file itself. The previews are always too constrained anyways.</p>
<p>Look at this horribleness:
<img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/597353947.png" alt=""></p>
<p>With a few settings we can improve our world and never see those disgusting things again!</p>
<pre><code>"editor.gotoLocation.multipleReferences": "goto",
"editor.gotoLocation.multipleDefinitions": "goto",
"editor.gotoLocation.multipleDeclarations": "goto",
"editor.gotoLocation.multipleImplementations": "goto",
"editor.gotoLocation.multipleTypeDefinitions": "goto",</code></pre>
<p>Ah, there we go, now we will actually go to the file itself right away. Much better.</p>
<p><img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/1392694127.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>VS Code has so many powerful features. Iâ€™m a happy user of it. However, there are lots of tiny little details it gets wrong.</p>
<p>If you dig these short little tips, I have an entire course FULL of them.</p>
<p>In the course, weâ€™ll completely overhaul your VS Code workflow and make you fast and efficient. Along the way weâ€™ll also make VS Code look and behave better.</p>

      <section itemprop="text">
        
        <p>These days I turn to <a href="https://sharpend.io/recreational-programming-with-serverless/">recreational programming</a> more often than usual. Solving fun problems makes me feel less confused and helpless about the pandemic. It’s a coping mechanism and a good one at that.</p>

<p>One thing has been an especially surprising source of joy for me: <em>Rust</em>. Surprising because I’ve been known to have an on-off relationship with the programming language since its 1.0 release. I quit Rust more than once – both professionally and personally – mainly out of frustration with a subpar development experience and general lack of libraries.</p>

<p>Looking back, I’m thrilled that I gave Rust another chance this year.</p>

<h2 id="that-was-then">That was then</h2>

<p>Back in 2017, <a href="https://sharpend.io/every-day-we-must-sweep/">I wrote</a> that “Rust lets you control almost everything, but as a beginner, it’s also hard to compile <em>anything</em>. As a result, Rust continues to make me look bad.” I was disappointed. Again.</p>

<p>At the time, I was working for a chaos engineering startup that chose Rust for simulating common server problems such as high CPU load, increased network latency, or random application crashes. A reasonable choice if your goal is to inject low-level faults in a predictable way, right? After all, Rust is said to be <a href="https://thenewstack.io/microsoft-rust-is-the-industrys-best-chance-at-safe-systems-programming/">our best chance at safe systems programming</a>. That may very well be true.</p>

<p>However, back then, I didn’t think Rust was the best option for the client side of the product. The main reason was productivity – or rather the lack thereof.</p>

<p>In 2017, my day-to-day Rust experience boiled down to the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Writing code in Vim with bare-bones syntax highlighting</li>
  <li>No code completion and no “go to definition” (the Rust Language Server was still in its infancy)</li>
  <li>Effectively no code formatting, since <code>rustfmt</code> just gave up whenever a line was too long (seriously)</li>
  <li>Docs were hard to find or non-existent</li>
  <li>The same goes for high-quality code examples</li>
  <li>No official Rust Docker images, homegrown CI pipelines only</li>
  <li>Compile times were noticeably slow, resulting in long <a href="https://sharpend.io/fast-feedback-is-everything/">feedback loops</a></li>
  <li>Speaking of feedback, Rust’s borrow checker made it difficult to understand why it rejected a piece of code and how to fix it</li>
</ul>

<p>All these drawbacks add up, but what really bothered me was the immature crate ecosystem. To give you one example, when we implemented the ability to inject faults into containers, we couldn’t find any usable Rust client library to talk to the Docker API, let alone Kubernetes. As a result, we were forced to reinvent the wheel several times (and sometimes ended up with a flat tire, in typical startup fashion).</p>

<p>In the face of these obstacles and despite my appreciation for its language design, I often found it challenging to get real work done with Rust.</p>

<p>At least, that was then.</p>

<p><img src="https://sharpend.io/assets/images/rust-gegenueber.jpg" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="this-is-now">This is now</h2>

<p>Today, three years later, I’m happy to report that <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/05/15/five-years-of-rust.html">Rust has changed a lot</a>, and for the better! That became apparent to me when I recently had some extra time between freelance contracts and decided to <a href="https://sharpend.io/7-things-i-learned-from-porting-a-c-crypto-library-to-rust/">port a crypto library from C to Rust</a> (because that’s what I do to get out of the cloud consulting bubble once in a while).</p>

<p>I realized that the release of the <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/12/06/Rust-1.31-and-rust-2018.html">2018 edition</a> is particularly noteworthy. It made the language much more productive in several ways: simpler syntax, a smarter borrow-checker, an improved module system, enhanced tooling (both <code>rustfmt</code> and Clippy, Rust’s linter, hitting 1.0), and a host of other features. Add to that IDE support, incremental compilation, excellent documentation, and immensely helpful error messages, and what you now get is nothing short of remarkable.</p>

<p>Thanks to Rust’s soaring popularity – it has been <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/01/20/what-is-rust-and-why-is-it-so-popular/">Stack Overflow’s most loved language</a> for four years in a row – finding a particular crate or tool has become easier (though still not necessarily easy). There are more and more <a href="https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust">open source projects</a> to explore. There’s a growing list of third-party cargo subcommands (<a href="https://github.com/rust-secure-code/cargo-geiger">cargo-geiger</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gnzlbg/cargo-asm">cargo-asm</a> being two of my favorites). There’s even <a href="https://github.com/google/evcxr">a decent REPL</a>. CI/CD <a href="https://actions-rs.github.io/">is a breeze</a>, and so is <a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross">cross compilation</a> to dozens of platforms. In short, there’s a lot to love here.</p>

<p>Given these advances, it’s no wonder that learning Rust is also quite different now. The tonari blog <a href="https://blog.tonari.no/why-we-love-rust">captured it well</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A year after switching over to Rust, we onboarded our fourth engineer to the team, who didn’t have much prior experience in either Rust or systems engineering. While the learning curve is undeniable (borrow checker, my old friend), we’ve found that Rust is incredibly empowering for those new to lower-level programming.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Empowering</em> is the perfect word to describe Rust in 2020. What used to be a rough adventure with many pitfalls has turned into something beautiful, something that can lift your spirit. At least, that’s what it did for me.</p>

<p>I encourage you to immerse yourself in a little Rust project today. You might be in for a pleasant surprise.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Howdy there, and welcome to the wild web rodeo! As always, we’re riding in an effort to become better frontend developers. This week we’re taking a developer’s glance at Figma, a spectacular design tool.</p><p>As a frontend designer we’re dealing with design on a daily basis, and being comfortable with Figma opens up so many possibilities. By learning a bit of Figma you could:</p><ul><li>Handle small design tasks at work</li><li>Mock up a personal website or side project</li><li>Make blog post images</li><li>Create share images for Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram</li><li>Create logos</li><li>Meme coworkers (at your own risk)</li></ul><p>If you don’t consider yourself a designer, don’t worry! This issue is written <strong>for web developers</strong>, so I’ll be using terms we’re familiar with. I won’t waste your time with things that are only useful for designers.</p><h4 id="why-figma"><a href="#why-figma" aria-label="why figma permalink"></a>Why Figma?</h4><p>Why <em>this</em> design tool over all the others? Figma has a ton of features and perks, but these are the big ones:</p><ul><li>Cross platform &amp; web based</li><li>Free (except for medium to big companies)</li><li>Live collaboration</li><li>Version control &amp; single source of truth</li></ul><p><strong>Note</strong>: I have no association with Figma and they did not pay for any part of this newsletter. I just think it’s a super useful tool for web developers.</p><h4 id="our-resident-expert"><a href="#our-resident-expert" aria-label="our resident expert permalink"></a>Our Resident Expert</h4><p>I’m by no means a Figma expert, so I reached out to someone who knows much more than me, <a href="https://ryan.warner.codes/">Ryan Warner</a>. Ryan is a software engineer and interface designer, and has put up with more of my Figma questions than I’d like to admit.</p><p>There’s one problem when you come into a field like design and a new tool like Figma: <em>What should I learn? What’s going to provide the most value for me?</em></p><p>I asked Ryan to give us the <strong>few Figma skills</strong> that would give developers the <strong>greatest rewards</strong>. That’s what we’ll be learning today, so let’s get to it!</p><h2 id="multiplayer-collaboration"><a href="#multiplayer-collaboration" aria-label="multiplayer collaboration permalink"></a>Multiplayer Collaboration</h2><p>One key aspect of Figma is that the files don’t live on your desktop, but instead in the cloud. Whenever you make a change, everyone with access to the file can see it in real time. I asked Ryan what the biggest benefit was for cloud-based design:</p><blockquote><p>Enabling team communication is the biggest benefit. It has never been easier for developers to be included in the design process from the beginning. Gone are the days of passing around files in Slack or Dropbox and asking questions or commenting on designs in disparate locations. With Figma, anyone can start a discussion about a specific part of a design that is open and available for the whole team to see.</p></blockquote><p>Ryan touches on a lot here. Let’s break down each point.</p><h4 id="early-involvement"><a href="#early-involvement" aria-label="early involvement permalink"></a>Early Involvement</h4><p><strong>Getting developers involved early on and throughout the design phase can save a team from headaches later on.</strong> The nature of Figma encourages this kind of collaboration, where developers, project managers, and other stakeholders can be involved from the jump.</p><h4 id="comments-and-discussions"><a href="#comments-and-discussions" aria-label="comments and discussions permalink"></a>Comments and Discussions</h4><p>The comment feature in Figma lets conversations happen alongside designs. You can create a thread, tag users, and have open discussions that involve the whole team.</p><h4 id="pair-designing"><a href="#pair-designing" aria-label="pair designing permalink"></a>Pair Designing</h4><p>If there’s one killer feature for Figma, it’s being able to work together in real time. Similar to Google Docs, you can see who has the file open and what they’re working on. Click on their name and you get to see what they’re seeing and follow their mouse.</p><p>Ryan says:</p><blockquote><p>Pair designing is another huge reason I love Figma and the multiplayer feature. My teammates and I can be working together in the same file in real time.</p></blockquote><p>In a time where so many people are working remotely, the feeling of designing alongside someone is more important then ever.</p><h4 id="side-projects"><a href="#side-projects" aria-label="side projects permalink"></a>Side Projects</h4><p>I designed a website for <a href="https://www.newhaven.io/">my local tech meetup</a>, and it was great to have my collaborators jump into the Figma file and suggest changes and improvements. Pair designing and live feedback made the project more fun and the result much better.</p><p>I also made all the designs and images for Frontend Horse in Figma. It allows me to ask friends for feedback on designs as I’m making them.</p><p>Figma is the perfect tool for side projects. There’s zero cash investment, and you can learn new skills without the pressure that a job typically brings.</p><h2 id="github-for-design"><a href="#github-for-design" aria-label="github for design permalink"></a>GitHub for Design</h2><p>I think of Figma as design’s GitHub. It’s not a <em>perfect</em> analogy but hear me out.</p><h4 id="version-control"><a href="#version-control" aria-label="version control permalink"></a>Version Control</h4><p>Figma has version control, both through autosaves and optional manual save points. You can roll back to a previous version, and see who made what changes, just like with git.</p><h4 id="single-source-of-truth"><a href="#single-source-of-truth" aria-label="single source of truth permalink"></a>Single Source of Truth</h4><p>Just like a shared repository, you’ve got a single source of truth. Even if visual ‘merge conflicts’ arise, <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/">Figma will intelligently diff changes in real time</a>. You always know that you’re looking at the latest designs.</p><p>Figma also has a new community feature that allows for Figma files to be published similar to public repos. <a href="https://www.figma.com/@RyanWarner">Check out Ryan’s community page</a>:</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>Like looking through a GitHub repo, I can check out the files Ryan decided to share with the community: some <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/820337605519256142">Social Branding Templates</a>, and the design mocks for <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/824810955262478067">his personal site</a>.</p><p>Like forking a repo, you can “Duplicate” any community file, and now you can edit your own version however you wish.</p><p>The best part? You don’t need to use any commands like with git. It all just works.</p><p>Just like Ryan’s Social Branding Templates, there are tons of other free resources open to the community. There’s wireframe kits, Storybook add ons, iPhone mockups, and lots more. <a href="https://www.figma.com/resources/">Check it out</a>.</p><h2 id="components-and-systems"><a href="#components-and-systems" aria-label="components and systems permalink"></a>Components and Systems</h2><p>Figma takes a few great ideas from modern web development like components, color variables, text styles, and design systems. Getting the hang of these is so helpful for working on your own or with designers.</p><h4 id="components"><a href="#components" aria-label="components permalink"></a>Components</h4><p>In web development we often use components to build larger things from smaller pieces. Those small pieces, like buttons, can be reused throughout the site over and over. If the button needs to be changed, you only need to change it in one place, not in every place it’s used throughout the project.</p><p>Figma has components, and it works in much the same way. You can create a button component, and then every clone you make of that button will become a duplicate of the original.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>The original is called the “Main” component, and all duplicates become “Instances.” Any changes to the Main affects the instances, but changes to the instances don’t affect the main.</p><p>This button component can be nested inside other components, just like how you might build a React or Vue app.</p><p>With a few components you can make designing in Figma easier and more consistent.</p><h4 id="color-styles"><a href="#color-styles" aria-label="color styles permalink"></a>Color Styles</h4><p>On the web, it’s common to define colors as variables with SCSS or CSS custom properties. We can do the same in Figma with “Color Styles.”</p><h4 id="text-styles"><a href="#text-styles" aria-label="text styles permalink"></a>Text Styles</h4><p>Text styles in Figma allow you to define typographic properties like for headings, body text, button labels, and whatever else you want.

But as Ryan will tell us, making a style guide isn’t the place you should start.</p><h2 id="to-improve-design-skills-start-small"><a href="#to-improve-design-skills-start-small" aria-label="to improve design skills start small permalink"></a>To Improve Design Skills, Start Small</h2><p>If you feel like your design skills are limited, Ryan has some great advice.</p><blockquote><p>You don’t need to be a great designer to start visually communicating your ideas. My advice for anyone interested in getting better at design is to open Figma and start putting things on the screen. Don’t worry about it looking good. Don’t worry about your color palette or style guides. Draw some rectangles, type some text, and start externalizing your ideas. The rest will come with time.</p></blockquote><p>Ryan’s right. Just starting with <em>anything</em> is better than nothing. You’ve gotta trot before you gallop.</p><p>When starting a design, keep it black and white. It’ll stop you from spending hours picking the <em>perfect</em> shade of blue before you’ve actually designed anything.</p><p>Get your ideas on the screen first, then work to add polish to them. The first version will be bad, the second a bit better. You see where I’m going with this.</p><p>If you’re interested in design tips for developers let me know and we can cover it specifically in a future issue!</p><h2 id="from-comps-to-code"><a href="#from-comps-to-code" aria-label="from comps to code permalink"></a>From Comps to Code</h2><p>As a developer we’re often tasked with turning design comps or layouts into actual HTML and CSS. I asked Ryan  <strong>what’s the best way to turn Figma designs into code? Does Figma make the design to dev pipeline easier?</strong></p><blockquote><p>There’s no single best way, but Figma does set us (developers) up for success. Most of the styling tools in Figma map intuitively to CSS. For example, the values for drop shadows map 1-to-1 to CSS box-shadow, x, y, blur, and color. Figma even has a code tab that generates CSS you can copy and paste into your code editor.</p></blockquote><p>The code tab makes going from design mocks to code a lot easier, but there are a couple things to watch out for. Let’s just use this square and its code output as an example.</p><p><span>
      <a href="https://frontend.horse/static/ae2721c8eb959abef231f445a7f47324/92e00/code-example.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

  </a>
    </span></p><p>The positioning values you’re given are often useless unless you’re using some of Figma’s advanced layout features.</p><p>I’m using my brand Color Styles on this square, so when I export the code, it adds comments for “Peach” and “Eggplant” above the colors. That helps me swap those out with SCSS variables or something similar when I bring it into my code.</p><h4 id="measuring-and-spacing"><a href="#measuring-and-spacing" aria-label="measuring and spacing permalink"></a>Measuring and Spacing</h4><p>The above CSS is great for styling that individual element, but often you need to know how far components are from one another. With one object selected, hold <code>alt</code> and mouse over other objects to find out how far apart they are. Mousing over the frame shows the distance from the edges.</p><p>This one key will help you with a lot of your layout CSS.</p><p><span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s been a global shift toward data-driven business. But, in many cases, the data just under the surface is dirty, and it’s failing modern companies.</p><p>In their<a href="https://www.edq.com/globalassets/white-papers/2020-global-data-management-research.pdf"> <em>2020 Global data management research</em></a> report, Experian estimated that many businesses aiming for agile, data-driven approaches believe almost a third of their data to be inaccurate.</p><blockquote><em>“While the business wants to be agile and informed by data, this level of distrusted data often leads leaders to fall back on making decisions by gut instinct rather than by informed data insight.” Experian Global Managing Director of Data Quality Mike Kilander</em></blockquote><p>That doesn’t just mean a large chunk of the data the companies have isn’t working for them. It means their data is working <em>against </em>them—costing them money, frustrating their employees, and getting in the way of opportunities.</p><p>If you don’t take an active role in your data governance, your dirty data will snowball, picking up crud as it rolls forward. If left uncleaned, it can tarnish up to<a href="https://econsultancy.com/blog/64612-the-cost-of-bad-data-stats"> 70% of your data after one year</a>. This data erosion will directly impact your bottom line--as it does for<a href="https://www.edq.com/globalassets/uk/papers/global-research-2015_20pp-ext-apr15.pdf"> 83% of companies</a>--and cost you an average of<a href="https://www.edq.com/globalassets/uk/papers/global-research-2015_20pp-ext-apr15.pdf"> 23% of your revenue</a>.</p><p>Mature data governance is no longer a wish list item for modern companies. It’s table stakes, so much so that, according to the<a href="https://go.profisee.com/2019-state-of-data-management-report"> 2019 State of Data Management Report</a>, governance is one of the top five strategic initiatives for global companies.</p><p>To stop throwing your time and money out the window and make your data clean up and grow up, you need a mature, enterprise-wide data governance model.</p><p>These maturity models help companies ensure the data in their system is accurate, well understood, and supported by employees with the skill sets needed to turn numbers into narrative.</p><h2><strong>What Exactly Is Data Governance Maturity and Why Should You Care?</strong></h2><p>Data governance maturity refers to the level of data management process and optimization you have built into your business.</p><p>At a company with mature data governance, clean and formal data management is at the core of everything they do. Each employee, team lead, and department knows the best practices they’re supposed to follow, and the company’s projects are regularly measured and optimized using the data produced. This gold standard of a data-driven company actively optimizes its processes using the <strong>three main components of data governance:</strong></p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Rules </strong>that dictate the creation and maintenance of data</li><li><strong>Enforcement </strong>that outlines how you ensure rules are followed throughout the company</li><li><strong>Management </strong>practices that are carried out by data stewards and employees in accordance with enforcement</li></ol><p>In its infancy, data governance maturity looks like reactive data management, ad-hoc data practices, a lack of formally defined best practices, and a kind of free-for-all approach to how data is collected, cleaned, and pruned. In short: it looks like chaos, where data is a byproduct of your company instead of the fuel behind its actions.</p><p>If you aren’t taking a proactive role in your data governance by measuring its maturity, you’re letting an information toddler run through an operational china shop—a dirty-data toddler that can wreck your company, leaving errors, inconsistencies, and security risks in its path.</p><p><em>“Poor data is often entangling entire organizations with crippling effects, preventing timely decision-making and negatively impacting customer experience.” — Experian 2020 Global data management research report</em></p><p>However, there’s no “one size fits all” approach to data governance, so you’ll have to work with your leaders and systems architects to tailor the framework that fits your use case and goals.</p><h2><strong>Which Data Governance Maturity Models Should You Use?</strong></h2><p>Data governance maturity models help you measure and understand how well you manage your data. When you have a clear understanding of your data governance, you’re better able to understand how you are or are not meeting goals, what steps you need to take to improve data management overall, and how you need to tailor data approaches to each team and project.</p><p>There are almost as many data governance maturity models as there are use cases for data. If you already use a maturity model to measure your data capabilities, it’s best to adjust that framework and apply it to your data governance to keep things consistent.</p><p>If, however, you’re starting from the ground level, you can choose from one of the many maturity assessments published by reputable vendors, each of which features a slightly different emphasis:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/data/sw-library/ii/whitepaper/LIW14003USEN.pdf"><strong>IBM</strong></a><strong> &amp;</strong><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/bg/en/pages/technology/articles/Data-management-maturity-self-assessment.html"><strong> Deloitte</strong></a> focus on process characterization across projects and enterprise levels and use the CMMI Institute’s Data Management Maturity (DMM) model.</li><li><a href="https://www.lightsondata.com/data-governance-maturity-models-dataflux/"><strong>DataFlux</strong></a> focuses on people, risk, process, reward, technology adoption, and business capabilities.</li><li><a href="https://dattamza.org/dattamza-blog/data-governance-and-the-maturity-assessment-model"><strong>Dattamza</strong></a> focuses on process, technology capabilities, managed risk, financials, and people management.</li><li><a href="https://edmcouncil.org/page/aboutdcamreview"><strong>EDM Council</strong></a> focuses on the maturity of an organization’s structure, its policies and guidelines, and funding.</li><li><a href="https://www.lightsondata.com/data-governance-maturity-models-kalido/"><strong>Kalido</strong></a><strong> </strong>focuses on the value of data as an enterprise asset and the risks and rewards of how it’s managed.</li></ul><p>All of the above feature some version of the level 1-5 system to rate the development stage of a company’s data governance.</p><p>For this article, we’ll focus on the IBM model, as the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) framework that underpins it is one of the most popular—and oldest—ways of thinking about data governance maturity.</p><p>The Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) was developed in 2006 by the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University based on the earlier Capability Maturity Model (CMM). The CMM was originally developed to improve software dev processes, and its successor took its original principles and made them more broadly applicable to any enterprise using data.</p><h2><strong>IBM Data Governance Maturity Model</strong></h2><p>The IBM Data Governance Maturity Model is one of the most widely used models around for measuring the maturity of data governance. Drawing from the creation of the CMMI in 2006, IBM released this model in 2007 to provide a clear, easy-to-understand, and tailored framework for measuring data maturity.</p><p>The IBM Data Governance Maturity Model focuses on measuring 11 domains—such as value creation, policy, stewardship, information lifecycle management, and data architecture—using a maturity scale of 1-5. Most companies start out by focusing on the handful that are most relevant and important to them and then building out as their core domains become more mature.</p><h3><strong>The 5 levels of maturity</strong></h3><p>For each domain a company focuses on, the IBM Data Governance Maturity Model outlines five levels of maturity.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec440af46599341a9a10225/5f0630497ff87413654faabe_T2hZFW0T8EQNecms1z_IAs21zOeWR0GH86WjVAcxXzg-5mPW3etCgX8mjOkAIZGTVKtdKlIbEwbztZ2aF1lXTEDJcd_dMEwru420NjwMZ1UaX4iU1uOXYPHzNJLBv_GgN255gqOL.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Below, we’ll take a look at what exactly maturity at each level means and how you can level up to the next stage based on your current data governance practices.</p><h3><strong>Level 1: Initial</strong></h3><p>Companies with level 1 data governance have little to no data management processes in place, are reactive to data management, and have no formalized tracking plan.</p><p><strong>How to Uplevel</strong>: In order to move beyond level 1, system architects should audit information flow and develop a plan for managing it with stakeholders and IT managers.</p><h3><strong>Level 2: Managed</strong></h3><p>Companies that achieve level 2 data governance have slightly more processes in place, some automation integrated, and more awareness of data. This is where most companies start their data governance journey.</p><p><strong>How to Uplevel</strong>: To upgrade your data governance maturity to level 3, focus on developing data regulation and documentation guidelines. Your system architects should begin to do this by building models of core infrastructure and documentation needs.</p><h3><strong>Level 3: Defined</strong></h3><p>Level 3 data governance means that there are some defined policies in place, you’re regularly leveraging technology for data management, you’ve developed a road map for integrating data, and best practices are more widely understood across the company.</p><p><strong>How to Uplevel: </strong>As you move into level 4, continue to implement data stewardship by assigning and implementing policies and rules of data management. This policy framework will underpin regular risk assessments and help you create a central program for educating teams on data best practices.</p><h3><strong>Level 4: Quantitatively Managed</strong></h3><p>By level 4, your company should have a clear, enterprise-wide data governance structure with projects that follow your set rules and principles and models that are well documented and regularly reviewed. You should have a well-defined policy framework that outlines frequent risk assessments and methods for educating enterprise teams on the company’s data management best practices.</p><p><strong>How to Uplevel</strong>: Now that your framework has been created and implemented, focus on defining and setting performance measurement metrics for each process. To do this, create a plan for maintaining data models and check that each project follows your data best practices to avoid dirtying data down the line.</p><h3><strong>Level 5: Optimizing</strong></h3><p>Level 5 is the holy grail of data governance. 🏆 At this point, data governance should be streamlined, and processes should be automated. Data governance is at the core of how you do business.</p><p>This means that data governance is no longer an afterthought or detour on the way to how you do business. Instead, all teams and employees should know how to follow data best practices, and every project you do should follow these rules and principles to create and utilize clean data.</p><p>Since this is the ultimate level of data governance, there is no upleveling from here. Instead, if you reach level 5, focus on continuously measuring and analyzing ROI for all projects, so you keep your data integrity.</p><h2><strong>Make Better Decisions with Better Data</strong></h2><p>Your data governance is only as mature as the data underneath it is good. To become truly data-driven, you must ensure you have a single, high-quality source of truth to work with.</p><p>Avo helps you create this single source of truth and make the right data-driven decisions to move your business by allowing you to prioritize, inspect, analyze, and future-proof your tracking to create reliable data now …</p></div></div>

But its multiple components have been around for a while. Thing is that it took a while for business to realize they needed more than just a marketer and a UX designer to ramp up their marketing outcomes.</p><p>Specifically, companies noticed an increased need for professionals who were able to successfully juggle marketing, creativity-based tasks, data science, and even coding.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Because these professionals understand the business market in its entirety. We’re talking UX designers who can see the value behind marketing and digital marketers who realize that data science and AI can only aid their projects and campaigns. No more award-winning website designs that can’t bring in leads or loads of data rusting in your archives because you don’t know how to use it.</p><p>For this reason, growth means different things to different companies and is present in multiple departments. If you will, growth hacking should be the overarching guiding force of all your business attempts.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="89df34e" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>But if growth hacking implies so many things, does this mean a growth hacker does everything?</p><p>Kind of.</p><p>I’ve analyzed over 200 recent listings on Glassdoor to see what the current expectations for this role are.</p><p><strong>Here are the top responsibilities of a growth hacker:</strong></p><ul><li>Own, define, and lead strategies for growing the user base</li><li>Measure the effectiveness of user growth initiatives and track KPIs/core metrics for all campaigns and communication strategies</li><li>Improve customer funnels</li><li>Find and create opportunities for organic and paid customer acquisition</li><li>Make recommendations for new product, pricing, and packaging strategies to improve UX</li><li>Be in charge of market research to establish new social media opportunities and analyze competitiveness</li><li>Conduct user research and define/refine the user profiles and personas</li><li>Implement and track A/B testing</li><li>Build valuable marketing strategies with the purpose of acquiring new customers through both online and offline channels</li><li>Communicate with the other teams to exchange ideas and make recommendations based on your own research</li><li>Manage budgets for different marketing channels and track ROI</li><li>Keep up with the latest changes in marketing and UI/UX as well as other industry trends and news</li><li>Initiate new projects to attract prospects, convert them into leads, and close sales</li></ul><p><br>These responsibilities will differ from one company to another.</p><p>In smaller teams, growth hackers can partially take over the duties of missing team members to help with someone else’s workload. This means you’ll also see them in charge of other tasks such as content writing, customer communication, and even sales from time to time. But overall, creativity and problem solving are the two main traits that define a growth hacker.</p></div></div></div><section data-id="7d7095e" data-element_type="section" data-settings="{&quot;background_background&quot;:&quot;classic&quot;}"><div><div><div data-id="96fbefb" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="a719b8d" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><p>Subscribe to our newsletter to download</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><div data-id="ebe7b57" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Getting Started With Growth Hacking<br></h2></p></div><div data-id="ace5e86" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>Before you jump into A/B testing and adding dozens of pop-ups on your website, you need to clearly think this through and establish what growth means to you.</p><p>For some companies, growth is strictly a matter of marketing, others get all of their teams involved, bringing in UX, support, sales, and development into the whole growth hacking picture.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="365d954" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h3>Researching and defining your goals</h3></p></div><div data-id="d187796" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>I know a marketing audit doesn’t sound like the funnest part of growth hacking, but it’s certainly the healthiest first thing you can do. <br>If you’re just getting started, a full market analysis and customer research will do.</p><p>Already been around for a while?

This might be because they all encounter the same problems, come from a similar area, hail from the same socioeconomic background, or are used to a particular industry.

All you have to do is find the relevant websites and tactics to be present on based on your ideal audience.</p><p>Let’s say you’re selling a book on software development.

The most common tactic for this is to get them to share their email with you and willingly accept to receive regular updates and newsletter from your company.</p><p>The process works much like a purchase. You give them access to unique content or offers and, in return, they pay by offering you their contact details.</p><p>Beyond this exchange, you’re also going to focus on nurturing your leads so you can help them make decisions.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Lately, I’ve been revisiting concepts and algorithms that I got stuck on when I was learning to code. One of them is the boids flocking simulation.</p>
<p>We’ll look at how this program can be written in Go and delivered via WebAssembly. You can find all the source code for this article, as well as the <a href="https://healeycodes.github.io/boids/">WASM demo</a>, on <a href="https://github.com/healeycodes/boids">healeycodes/boids</a>.</p>

</center>
<p>A boid is a simulated bird-like object, a bird-oid. Each boid looks at their local flockmates and uses three rules to respond to their behavior — <em>separation</em>, <em>alignment</em>, and <em>cohesion</em>.</p>
<p>This artificial life program was first developed by Craig Reynolds. In <a href="http://www.red3d.com/cwr/papers/1987/boids.html">Flocks, Herds, and Schools: A Distributed Behavioral Model</a> he describes it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The simulated flock is an elaboration of a particle system, with the simulated birds being the particles. The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is created by a distributed behavioral model much like that at work in a natural flock; the birds choose their own course.</p>

<p><a href="https://ebiten.org/">Ebiten</a> is well documented and has a lively community (<code>#ebiten</code> channel in <a href="https://blog.gopheracademy.com/gophers-slack-community/">Gophers Slack</a>). I started learning it by extending the <a href="https://ebiten.org/examples/">example programs</a> to get used to the API.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the overall structure of our program.</p>
<p>When you build a game with Ebiten, you must implement the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten#Game">ebiten.Game</a> interface. We define a <code>Game</code> struct to store our flock of boids as well as the methods required by Ebiten to run our game. <code>Update</code> is called every tick to handle the game logic, <code>Draw</code> is called every frame to draw the screen, and <code>Layout</code> is used to define the game’s screen size (which can be ‘stretched’ to fit the window).</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>type</span> Game <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    flock  Flock
    inited <span>bool</span>
<span>}</span>

<h3 id="game-loops"><a href="#game-loops" aria-label="game loops permalink"></a>Game Loops</h3>
<p>Almost every game that you’ve played uses a programming pattern called a <a href="https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/game-loop.html">Game Loop</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A game loop runs continuously during gameplay. Each turn of the loop, it processes user input without blocking, updates the game state, and renders the game. It tracks the passage of time to control the rate of gameplay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The frequency of a game loop is sometimes referred to as the tick rate of a game. A single iteration of the loop is a <em>tick</em>.</p>
<h2 id="simulation-logic"><a href="#simulation-logic" aria-label="simulation logic permalink"></a>Simulation Logic</h2>
<p>In our program, a boid has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Position — the coordinates of the boid in the world</li>
<li>Velocity — how fast and in what direction the boid is moving</li>
<li>Acceleration — we change the velocity by this value during the next tick</li>
</ul>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>type</span> Boid <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    imageWidth   <span>int</span>
    imageHeight  <span>int</span>
    position     Vector2D 
    velocity     Vector2D
    acceleration Vector2D
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Every tick, we need to handle three things for every boid in our flock:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check edges — check if the boid has gone off the edge of the screen</li>
<li>Apply rules — using the three rules, set every boid’s acceleration</li>
<li>Apply movement — apply acceleration to the boid’s velocity</li>
</ul>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>type</span> Flock <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    boids <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>*</span>Boid
<span>}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>(</span>flock <span>*</span>Flock<span>)</span> <span>Logic</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> boid <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> flock<span>.</span>boids <span>{</span>
        boid<span>.</span><span>ApplyEdges</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
        boid<span>.</span><span>ApplyRules</span><span>(</span>flock<span>.</span>boids<span>)</span>
        boid<span>.</span><span>ApplyMovement</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To handle boids hitting the edge of the screen, we wrap them around by swapping their position to the opposite side. Their velocity means they keep flying in the same relative direction.</p>
<p>After we’ve figured out the boid’s acceleration by applying the three rules, we need to update its position and velocity, and reset acceleration.</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>(</span>boid <span>*</span>Boid<span>)</span> <span>ApplyMovement</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    boid<span>.</span>position<span>.</span><span>Add</span><span>(</span>boid<span>.</span>velocity<span>)</span>
    boid<span>.</span>velocity<span>.</span><span>Add</span><span>(</span>boid<span>.</span>acceleration<span>)</span>
    boid<span>.</span>velocity<span>.</span><span>Limit</span><span>(</span>maxSpeed<span>)</span>
    boid<span>.</span>acceleration<span>.</span><span>Multiply</span><span>(</span><span>0.0</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>By adding acceleration to the boid’s existing velocity, and then limiting it by a maximum speed, we get smooth movement that tends towards the desired direction and speed. Velocity can be thought of as momentum and acceleration as steering.</p>
<h2 id="the-three-rules"><a href="#the-three-rules" aria-label="the three rules permalink"></a>The Three Rules</h2>
<p>In the following code excerpts, you may notice that the logic is not very optimized. This is to make it easier to understand. On every tick, every boid considers the position of every other boid. We would say that the asymptotic complexity is <code>O(n^2)</code>.</p>
<p>Different rules use different ‘inclusion’ zones. Whether another boid is <em>local</em> to another boid depends on which rule we are applying.</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>maxForce             <span>=</span> <span>1.0</span>
maxSpeed             <span>=</span> <span>4.0</span>
alignPerception      <span>=</span> <span>75.0</span>
cohesionPerception   <span>=</span> <span>100.0</span>
separationPerception <span>=</span> <span>50.0</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The last three values are really fun to play with and greatly affect the shape and contortions of a flock of boids. <code>maxForce</code> limits the steering of a boid and <code>maxSpeed</code> is the ultimate speed limit.</p>
<p>I’ve expanded some of Craig Reynolds’ low-resolution diagrams to help explain the three rules that define a boid’s behavior.</p>
<h3 id="separation"><a href="#separation" aria-label="separation permalink"></a>Separation</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Steer to avoid crowding local flockmates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The closer another boid is to us, the more motivated we are to move away from it. The white circle represents <code>separationPerception</code>. Boids outside of this area are not considered. This rule encourages boids to move into free space.</p>

<p>To be a <em>cohesive</em> boid, one must head towards the center of the clump. This may seem at odds with <em>separation</em> but these two rules work together to let boids arrange themselves equally within a space. Although, the reality of this <em>arranging</em> can look quite chaotic!</p>

<h2 id="building-and-deploying"><a href="#building-and-deploying" aria-label="building and deploying permalink"></a>Building And Deploying</h2>
<p>It’s time to get this simulation in front of users! Lucky for us, Ebiten supports many platforms. (The Nintendo Switch is even on the <a href="https://ebiten.org/blog/roadmap2020.html#Ebiten_2.1_-_March,_2021">roadmap</a>.)</p>
<p>The current release (v1.11.4), supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows, macOS, Linux, FreeBSD</li>
<li>Android, iOS</li>
<li>
<p>Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge)</p>
<ul>
<li>via WebAssembly or GopherJS</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will be compiling to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly">WebAssembly</a>. With WebAssembly as a compilation target, we can deliver our Go program to anyone running a modern browser. I’m currently hosting it on <a href="https://healeycodes.github.io/boids/">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
<p>What are the benefits of WebAssembly? In brief:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast, efficient, and portable</li>
<li>Executes at ‘near-native’ speed</li>
<li>Runs in a secure sandbox</li>
</ul>
<p>To get our Boid program ready for users, we build the <code>.wasm</code> file.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o dist/boids.wasm github.com/healeycodes/boids</code></pre></div>
<p>We set the build’s target operating system to <code>js</code> as well as setting the architecture to <code>wasm</code>. If you’re setting this up from scratch, you’ll need a copy of <code>wasm_exec.js</code> from the Go source — you can copy it locally from your machine or get it from <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/misc/wasm/wasm_exec.js">golang/go</a>.</p>
<p>To display the simulation in a browser, we use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WebAssembly/instantiate">WebAssembly.instantiate</a>. Here’s what our index page looks like:</p>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>main</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span> <span>id</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>loading<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>

<h2 id="where-to-go-from-here"><a href="#where-to-go-from-here" aria-label="where to go from here permalink"></a>Where to go from here?</h2>
<p>We looked at how to create an Ebiten game, the emergent behavior of the Boid program, and delivering a Go program via WebAssembly. But there’s still more to explore!</p>
<p>Expand this solution with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Field of vision support (boids shouldn’t look behind 👀)</li>
<li>QuadTree optimization</li>
<li>Different <code>maxSpeed</code>/<code>maxForce</code> for each boid</li>
<li>Graphical interface for live-editing of values</li>
</ul>
<p>Or use a different language:</p>
<ul>
<li>JavaScript/p5.js with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhjuuHl6qHM&amp;vl=en">Daniel Shiffman</a></li>
<li>C#/Unity with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqtqltqcQhw">Sebastian…</a></li></ul></section></div>

                                        An Azure subscription is linked to a single account, the one that was used to create the subscription. It's used for billing entity and security boundary.<br>
                                        Azure subscriptions manage resources, limits, and provide the charges billed to the account owner.

                                        An Azure AD directory can be associated with multiple subscriptions, but a subscription is always tied to a single directory.<br>
                                        Azure subscriptions can only trust a single directory, but multiple subscriptions can be associated to a single Azure AD instance.

                                        True. While a single directory is created for the organization initially, more can be created to divide the security across boundaries.

<p>Hordak is inherently aimed at software developers as it provides core
functionality only. Friendly interfaces can certainly be built on top of it, but
if you are here there is a good chance you are a developer.</p>
<p>If you are learning about accounting as developer you may feel – as I did – that
most of the material available doesn’t quite relate to the developer/STEM mindset. I
therefore provide some resources here that may be of use.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>According to this <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23964513">Hacker News discussion</a>, some of what follows may be either incorrect
or abhorrent to those with a good knowledge of accounting practices. I still
feel the following is useful, and that taken as a whole it describes a working
double entry accounting system.</p>
</div>

<div id="in-a-little-more-detail">
<h2>In a little more detail<a href="#in-a-little-more-detail" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I found <a href="http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/accounting/tutorial.html">Peter Selinger’s tutorial</a> to be very enlightening and is less terse than the functional description above.
The first section is short and covers single entry accounting, and then shows how one can expand that to create double
entry accounting. I found this background useful.</p>
</div>
<div id="examples">
<h2>Examples<a href="#examples" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You live in a shared house. Everyone pays their share into a communal bank account
every month.</p>
<div id="example-1-saving-money-to-pay-a-bill-no-sign-flipping">
<h3>Example 1: Saving money to pay a bill (no sign flipping)<a href="#example-1-saving-money-to-pay-a-bill-no-sign-flipping" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You pay the electricity bill every three months. Therefore every month you take £100
from everyone’s contributions and put it into Electricity Payable account (a liability
account) in the knowledge that you will pay the bill from this account when it eventually arrives:</p>
<p>These accounts are income &amp; liability accounts, so neither balance needs to be flipped (flipping
only applies to asset &amp; expense accounts). Therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Balances before:<ul>
<li><em>Housemate Contribution</em> (income): £500</li>
<li><em>Electricity Payable</em> (liability): £0</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Transaction</strong>:<ul>
<li>£100 from <em>Housemate Contribution</em> to <em>Electricity Payable</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Balances after:<ul>
<li><em>Housemate Contribution</em> (income): £400</li>
<li><em>Electricity Payable</em> (liability): £100</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This should also make intuitive sense. Some of the housemate contributions will be used to pay the electricity
bill, therefore the former decreases and the latter increases.</p>
</div>
<div id="example-2-saving-money-to-pay-a-bill-with-sign-flipping">
<h3>Example 2: Saving money to pay a bill (with sign flipping)<a href="#example-2-saving-money-to-pay-a-bill-with-sign-flipping" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>At the start of every month each housemate pays into the communal bank account. We
should therefore represent this somehow in our double entry system (something we ignored in
example 1).</p>
<p>We have an account called <em>Bank</em> which is an asset account (because this is money
we actually have). We also have a <em>Housemate Contribution</em> account which is an
income account.</p>
<p>Therefore, <strong>to represent the fact that we have been paid money, we must create a transaction</strong>.
However, money cannot be injected from outside our double entry system, so how do we deal with this?</p>
<p>Let’s show how we represent a single housemate’s payment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Balances before:<ul>
<li><em>Bank</em> (asset): £0</li>
<li><em>Housemate Contribution</em> (income): £0</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Transaction:</strong><ul>
<li>£500 from <em>Bank</em> to <em>Housemate Contribution</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Balances after:<ul>
<li><em>Bank</em> (asset): -£500 * -1 = <strong>£500</strong></li>
<li><em>Housemate Contribution</em>  (income): £500</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the bank account is an asset account, we flip the sign of its balance.
<strong>The result is that both accounts increase in value.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-url="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/git-linters-and-sourcelevel-how-tools-enable-a-more-inclusive-language-and-diverse-culture" data-title="Git, Linters and SourceLevel: how tools enable a more inclusive language and diverse culture"><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Are terminologies meaningful in software development? Yes, a lot! As developers, we’re continually writing code, and we do that by passing messages. Each message carries a lot of context and semantics. Therefore we’re always evolving how to do it in a better way.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">There is this vastly known anecdote that says that there are only&nbsp;</span><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">two hard things in Computer Science</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">: caching invalidation and&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">naming</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;things.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Terminology is in the roots of communication, and therefore is as vital for writing quality code as writing User Stories, documentation, and even naming branches.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you care a lot about communicating effectively, I think we must use an&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">inclusive language</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;to do so.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Inclusive writing is the usage of the language with neutrality. Inclusiveness has a positive impact on our lives, as they don’t offend interlocutors based on abilities/disabilities, age, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, religion, etc.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It would be best to read</span> <a href="https://content-guide.18f.gov/inclusive-language/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">this content guide</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;that describes how to be more inclusive when writing. The impact of fostering more inclusive writing implies changes in how we write software. Besides, sooner or later, we see that it affects many aspects of everyday life communication. 🌱</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Some time ago,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/7/4/229" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">a proposal</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;regarding the <code>master</code>&nbsp;branch name in </span><a href="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/tag/git" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Git</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> came up. I got pleased that the concern of an inclusive language arrived in the <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/category/development-tools">tool I use every day for development</a>. The proposal addresses replacing the master branch name by a more inclusive one, <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=49decddd39e5f6132ccd7d9fdc3d7c470b0061bb">such as <code>main</code>, <code>primary</code>, or <code>principal</code></a>.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">At SourceLevel, we have opted for using <code>main</code>&nbsp;as the default branch name. Did you know you can change the default branch in your Git repositories? You can do it by both </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">GitLab</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;(</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Project Settings &gt; Repository</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">) and&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">GitHub</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;(</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Repository Settings &gt; Branches</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">).</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Changing the default branch of your repositories may break some tools. In the case of SourceLevel, we already support the custom default branch, and it synchronizes with GitHub and GitLab. Changing on those tools automatically replicates in our tool.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Steps for changing your default branch</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In the examples below, I rename the <code>master</code>&nbsp;branch to <code>main</code>. You should discuss with your team and find the name that better suits you.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Firstly, we need to rename it locally:</span></p>
<pre><span data-preserver-spaces="true">$ git branch -m master main
</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">$ git push origin main -u</span></pre>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">And you’re done! These two commands rename your local <code>master</code>&nbsp;branch and then push it to the remote server. It’s a secure way to start, once the commands don’t delete the remote <code>master</code>&nbsp;branch.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Note that after changing the name to main, everyone who clones the repository gets the new default branch set. However, people who had previously cloned the repository are still pointing to the master branch.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To move forward with the change, everyone in your team needs to run a <a href="https://twitter.com/xunit/status/1269881005877256192">few commands</a>. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For a complete guide, I strongly recommend reading </span><a href="https://dev.to/damcosset/replacing-master-in-git-2jim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Damien Cosset’s blog post</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Using SourceLevel as an Inclusive Language watchdog</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Now that we have a more inclusive branch name, there may be references to other terms that we should avoid. They may appear in variables, methods, or even comments.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">So, we need to look for them the whole codebase. This part can demand lots of hard work, depending on the size and terminology used throughout codebases.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Changing the existing code doesn’t prevent you or your team from using exclusive language again. What if a bot could notify you when a contravention appears? You can use the <a href="https://docs.sourcelevel.io/engines/grep/"><code>grep</code> linter </a></span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">as a watchdog!</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Configure your <code>.sourcelevel.yml</code> file adding rules that look for exclusive language and suggest more appropriate terms for each Pull or Merge Requests using SourceLevel’s <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/automated-code-review">automated code review</a> feature. It should look something like this:</span></p>
<pre>engines:
  grep:
    config:
      patterns:
        allowlist:
          pattern: "/white[_\\-]?list/i"
          annotation: Do not use 'Whitelist'. Prefer the term 'Allowlist'
          categories: Style
          path_patterns:
          - "**/*.ex"
          - "**/*.exs"
        blocklist:
          pattern: "/black[_\\-]?list/i"
          annotation: Do not use 'Blacklist'. Prefer the term 'Blocklist'
          categories: Style
          path_patterns:
          - "**/*.ex"
          - "**/*.exs"
    enabled: true</pre>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">After pushing it to the main branch, SourceLevel can help you achieve a more inclusive language throughout the codebase!</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In short</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Using an inclusive language is crucial for fostering a diverse culture. Git has changed the naming conventions to be more language-inclusive, and so you should change. Our development tools, like GitHub and GitLab, already supports the change.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SourceLevel deals very nicely with repositories that changed the <code>master</code>&nbsp;branch to a more appropriate word. Besides, you can use the <code>grep</code>&nbsp;linter the look for exclusive terms contained in the source code.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As the inclusive language gap may happen in other aspects of our lives, have you already thought about them?</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Raise the discussion in your team and use the tools to favor a more inclusive world 💚!</span></p>

        <div>
            <div>
                <div>
                    <p>Approximately a week ago, I started on the journey to rebuild one of my side projects in Node.js. It was originally built in asp.net core mvc. There was nothing wrong with how it was built, it wasn't misbehaving or anything like that, but I needed to make some changes, add a feature that has been requested dozens of times now, and the code base was stale and packages needed updating, etc.</p>
<p>So I opened the project in Visual Studio, and started re-familiarizing myself with the codebase. After an hour it was painfully clear, I wasn't going to add any more code to this project, at least not as it currently existed. So I decided to just do a Node/Express/MongoDB application since it was already using MongoDB for it's backend.</p>
<h3 id="a-few-hours-later">A Few Hours Later</h3>
<p>I was exhausted. I tried to do everything the right way, the way my code-forefathers would have expected, but the code was starting to pile up, and I hadn't even rendered the homepage yet. It made me miss the days of just creating an index.php page and shit just rendering. The amount of boilerplate code I was writing was getting very annoying, so I decided that THIS is the project I was going to tackle first.</p>
<p>I contemplated code generation for the boilerplate, but that is fraught with edge cases and constantly needing to be tweaked. Then I thought, why not just abstract it all away in a tiny package, and get it out of my way so I can just build my routes and my views, but also make it feel more like the asp.net mvc world I come from.</p>
<h3 id="a-new-web-framework-is-born">A new web framework is born</h3>
<p>I decided to follow a little bit of the MVC pattern, or at least the pattern than asp.net mvc tutorials have always followed, which is more like Controllers, Views, View-Models, but Microsoft can call that MVC, I will call my web framework MVC as well.</p>
<p>The basic concept is the library sets up everything you could need (so long as what you need is MongoDB, sessions, and mustache for views), and then it gets out of your way for you to create your Controllers (which is really just a route handler with some nice helper methods) anyway you wish (all in one file, highly structured, it doesn't matter to SimpleMVC.js).</p>
<p>The first project I decided to build with the framework was a little example blog. Total code is around 45 lines (excluding the JSON data source), and for about 20 more lines, you could have blog backed by a MongoDB collection, or even straight from the file system. In fact, this blog is built using SimpleMVC.js, and the code including admin and supporting comments (though I have them turned off) is under 200 lines.</p>
<p>You can see the sample blog in <a href="https://github.com/jeremyaboyd/simplemvcjs/tree/master/examples/simpleblog">the repository</a>, and you can use that to get started. I'm still writing the full documentation, but it is a pretty simple framework to get started with. You can install it <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/simplemvcjs">from npm today</a>, but it is <strong>still a beta</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="why-use-it">Why use it?</h3>
<p>SimpleMVC.js was made to get you setup quickly to start building your next web application in a structured way without all the excess boilerplate that typically comes with an MVC project in other frameworks.</p>
<p>The framework has 4 built in classes.</p>
<ol>
<li>SimpleMVC.App - the main service, this is what runs your application</li>
<li>SimpleMVC.Controller - this is a class you will new up for every set of routes you want to use</li>
<li>SimpleMVC.Membership - this service has a handful of helper methods for CRUDing users and their profiles</li>
<li>SimpleMVC.SMTP - this service is basically just a wrapper for a preconfigured <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer">nodemailer</a> transport</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="hello-world">Hello World</h4>
<p>As is typical with all new libraries, here is Hello World:</p>
<pre><code>const SimpleMVC = require('simplemvcjs');

const homeController = new SimpleMVC.Controller("/", {
    "": function() {
        return this.content("hello world");
    }
});

const app = new SimpleMVC.App();
app.initDbConnection();
app.addControllers(homeController);
app.listen();</code></pre>
<p>The code can get more complicated from here, but it doesn't have to. A simple dynamic website that doesn't need much user interaction, can really be only a few routes and a database lookup.</p>
<h3 id="where-it-goes-from-here">Where it goes from here</h3>
<p>I have a handful of additional helper methods I want to add to the Controller class, along with supporting all of the HTTP verbs (it currently only supports POST and GET), and then I'd like to finish the Example SaaS project which will use all of the features of the framework, and can be used as a testbed for further development.</p>

<p>By using crypto signals, traders can determine the best way to manage their capital, the way to be able to prevent losses, the way to establish and change targets to reach the biggest profit potential. Crypto signal providers are an excellent source of information that is otherwise hard to come by. It takes a level of knowledge and also a reliable strategy to create a profit from any sort of trading, including crypto trading. Not everyone has that understanding, and not everyone can create those strategies. </p>



<p>Crypto signals are essentially the cryptocurrency version of insider information and stock market tips. Providers analyze the market to predict the trades to create. Please note, however, these predictions are the result of evaluation and rarely come from real insider information on the current market even if some providers claim they do. </p>



<h2>What are Cryptocurrency Signals? </h2>



<p>It is well worth investing in crypto signals, whether you’re a new dealer or have years of experience. These signals are certain to improve your trading activity. They provide new investors the chance to construct their portfolio and earn money as they learn the principles of trading. These recommendations generally involve purchasing or selling a particular crypto coin, making investments in new ICO projects, and taking part in a pump and dump strategy(which we don’t do). </p>



<p>Remember that not all signal suppliers are created equal. Do just a little due diligence in to finding the best provider, which means you don’t lose more money than you’re making. </p>



<p>Free trials are ending soon, want to test us out? Do so by the 1st of August 2020<br>Go for it, worst case scenario, you learn something new .<br>Go ahead,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://t.me/sublime_signals_payment_bot" target="_blank"><strong>👉interact with our bot</strong></a></p>



<p>These cryptocurrency signals can allow you to learn more about various coins and how they are performing, in addition to offer advice on whether to buy and sell coins to the most profit. Crypto signals are similar to the insider information people use on the stock exchange. These signals are based on research and analysis performed by men and women that have a profound comprehension of the crypto marketplace. </p>



<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/GetMonero-bitcoin-btc-mmtg-QuspXi6Va6Scge0PB7">via GIPHY</a></p>



<p>This demand for help is the reason behind crypto trade signals, which are designed to help people understand — and master — cryptocurrency trading. Here is more information about cryptocurrency signals and their function in gambling. There’s more to crypto signals than that, though. </p>



<p>There’s more to those signals than just the knowledge they offer. Providers can use these groups to maximize their gains. By finding the right signal providers and cooperating together, beginners and experts alike can find the best buy and sell positions. There’s much more to trading cryptocurrency than the trading process — it takes an efficient trading strategy. </p>



<p>Beginners, and even some professionals, rely on outside assistance to make profitable trades. Crypto signals are easy to use and offer better results from trading at less time. They provide a level of flexibility and advantage for traders looking to benefit from the limitless possibility of the cryptocurrency trading market. There’s always some commerce waiting to be produced on this broad market, so being able to receive tips on the most recent and biggest trades is worth your time. Even strategy, like alternating between long-term investments and traders, doesn’t apply to everybody. </p>



<p>There is still the matter of deciding on the ideal coins to trade and which ones to avoid. Where trading signals come into play, this is. The Function of in trading cryptocurrency signals. Possibly the most significant job of signals in trading is that they facilitate trading. Beginners may use signals to get started with their trades and learn more about trading. Signals offer valuable understanding about cryptocurrencies and are an excellent learning resource. </p>



<p>These signals are the result of lots of analysis of their market scenario. Signals can help traders to make the choice on a trade. Some dealers can misunderstand the marketplace when seeking to develop with these predictions themselves. Crypto signals assist traders and prevent the issue of analysis paralysis. When traders get so caught up in contemplation and evaluation they don’t act in time. It’s among the biggest problems preventing individuals from becoming successful. Signal providers do all of the work for you so you do not get caught inside your head, wondering in the event that you should make the trade. </p>



<h2>Conclusion </h2>



<p>The short and long of this is that crypto trading signals offer users the opportunity to make and learn all at precisely the same moment. Provided that you choose the ideal supplier, you’re certain to make some profit by following their guidance. Given these providers offer you clear, detailed information about their signals, you will also have the opportunity to learn from them and create the right system and strategy all your own.</p>

				<p>Remember the Ubuntu Unity spin edition that popped up a few months ago? Well, the same young developer behind that product is at it again. In a cryptic new Twitter post of only the words <em>“Coming soon! Stay tuned!”</em> from the new handle of <a href="https://twitter.com/ubunweb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubuntu Web</a>, Rudra Saraswat has my attention.</p>
<p>The Twitter bio for this new account is really all we have to go on at this point, but color me intrigued. It seems to be positioned as an alternative to Chrome OS. Ironically, the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-secret-origins-of-googles-chrome-os/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project that became Chrome OS</a> was originally running a modified Firefox UI.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“<span>Ubuntu Web combines the power of Ubuntu &amp; Firefox to give you a powerful, open source web OS.</span>“</em></p></blockquote>
<p>As we move more and more to a cloud-focused future, the combination of Ubuntu running <a href="https://rappingpenguin.com/new-years-resolution-try-using-firefox-full-time-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox</a> in a dedicated UI could make for a pretty powerful mashup. And as someone who is already concerned with web standards moving towards a world of only tech surrounding the Chrome browser, it’s a welcome alternative.</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Coming soon! Stay tuned!</p>
<p>— Ubuntu Web (@ubunweb) <a href="https://twitter.com/ubunweb/status/1285993537499095040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2020</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While this isn’t the first time we’ve seen cloud-first distros in the world of Linux, I hope the team at Ubuntu Web can really find some traction. Rudra’s previous work with <a href="https://rappingpenguin.com/my-three-weeks-with-the-system76-lemur-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unity</a> could lay a decent groundwork. Unity had many cloud elements built into the interface that with some tweaking may be able to leverage new hooks powered by Firefox.</p>
<p>We wish the Ubuntu Web team luck in this new venture and we’ll keep a close eye on any progress of this intriguing project.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>You know what really sucks? Breaking bones. I’d been watching too many mountain biking videos on YouTube and after the first jump on a ride at my local bike trails, I came to realise that my enthusiasm and confidence far outweighed my skill. After over-jumping the jump, hitting a tree, flying over the bars and landing directly on my left shoulder 4 metres down the trail, I now have a broken clavicle (collar bone).</p>

<p>Living in the UK, we have public health care, so my brother drove me straight to Accident and Emergency. An x-ray soon confirmed that I’d snapped my collar bone in two, but apparently there’s not very much to be done. They gave me a sling, told me I’d need to take some pain killers for a few days, and booked me in at the fracture clinic for the following day. At the fracture clinic I go through the x-rays with a specialist doctor while he tells me about the next ten weeks of my life are going to be like. At this point I can barely move my arm. My shoulder’s the size of a water melon and turning yellow. Ten weeks like this. Shit.</p>

<p>I work as a software developer. Mainly ASP.NET and C# stuff. This means I live in Visual Studio… all day, everyday. Have you ever tried to work in VS one handed? Give it a try. It can be done but it’s not easy. One of the hardest things are keyboard shortcuts. Alt+Enter especially. I’ve got big hands, but even I struggle with that one using only my right hand. Luckily most functionality is available through context menus or through other parts of the UI.</p>

<p>A fantastic thing about VS is that nearly all keyboard shortcuts are remappable. I’d never thought of this as an accessibility feature before, but it really is. I’ve resisted changing anymore keyboard shortcuts than strictly necessary, as I’m intending to start using both arms again one day, but it’s fantastic that this is available in a tool that I rely on to work and pay the bills.</p>

<p>The majority of my work as a developer is web based, so when considering accessibility I tend to think about making things accessible for those with visual impairments; the blind and the partially sighted. Ensuring that the site works with screen readers and making sure controls and text have sufficient size and contrast is where a lot of accessibility effort is generally focused. There’s also things like not making tap targets not too close together, which is as much a mobile friendliness consideration as an accessibility consideration.</p>

<p>As most of my work is for the web, I don’t develop very many piece of software that utilise keyboard shortcuts extensively. If any of my future work does incorporate keyboard shortcuts, I’m certainly going to be considering how people with physical restrictions will be able to use them.</p>

<p>I don’t know what the “official” guidelines for keyboard shortcut accessibility are (or whether there are any guidelines!), but during the last few weeks of convalescence I’ve thought about the guidelines that I’d appreciate.</p>

<h2 id="accessibility-guidelines-for-keyboard-shortcuts">Accessibility guidelines for keyboard shortcuts</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Single handed shortcuts:</strong> Prefer shortcut keys that can be reached with a single hand. Most shortcuts are comprised of a modifier key (Shift, Alt, Ctrl, Win, Cmd) along with another “normal” key. Try to keep the “normal” key within reasonable reach of the modifier. Shift and Ctrl <em>usually</em> have keys on both sides of the keyboard, so more keys can be paired with these. Note that although Alt appears on both sides of the space bar, the right hand key is AltGr. They are actually two different keys, so keep that in mind when mapping shortcuts.</li>
  <li><strong>Remappable:</strong> It’s not always reasonable to make all the default keyboard shortcuts single-handed. It’s also likely that for able bodied users, some single handed shortcuts may actually be less comfortable or convenient than shortcuts that require both hands. That’s fine, and it’s a good idea to cater to your primary demographic. It’s also a good idea to allow users to remap these shortcuts. It’s not simply an accessibility feature, it’s great for the types that love to customise everything.</li>
  <li><strong>Provide alternatives:</strong> Providing an interface to allow users to remap their keyboard shortcuts isn’t always feasible. Maybe there’s no budget, or the scope of the project simply doesn’t allow for it. In these cases it’s simple and quick to provide alternatives to more complex or finger-stretching shortcuts. It doesn’t have to be every shortcut, but for commonly used shortcuts that are more comfortable with two hands, consider adding single-handed alternatives.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s it. Nothing fancy or too technical. If in doubt about whether a keyboard shortcut complies with these guidelines, just try it with one hand! Imagine having to do that every time you require that shortcut… you’ll soon figure out whether it’s accessible or not.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">

<p>Floating-point formats are not the most glamorous or (frankly) the important
consideration when working with deep learning models: if your model isn’t working well,
then your floating-point format certainly isn’t going to save you! However, past a
certain point of model complexity/model size/training time, your choice of
floating-point format can have a significant impact on your model training times and
even performance.</p>
<p>Here’s how the rest of this post is structured:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#floating-point-in-my-deep-learning">Why should you, a deep learning practitioner,
care</a> about what floating-point format your
model uses?</li>
<li><a href="#floating-point-formats">What even <em>is</em> floating-point</a>, especially these new
floating-point formats made specifically for deep learning?</li>
<li><a href="#advice-for-practitioners">What practical advice is there</a> on using floating-point
formats for deep learning?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="floating-point-in-my-deep-learning">Floating-Point? In <em>My</em> Deep Learning?</h2>
<p><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/6052-its-more-likely-than-you-think">It’s more likely than you
think!</a></p>
<p>It’s been known for quite some time that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02551">deep neural networks can
tolerate</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02551">lower numerical
precision</a>. High-precision calculations turn out not
to be that useful in training or inferencing neural networks: the additional precision
confers no benefit while being slower and less memory-efficient.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, some models can even reach a higher accuracy with lower precision, which
recent research attributes to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00095">regularization effects from the lower
precision</a>.</p>
<p>Finally (and this is speculation on my part — I haven’t seen any experiments or papers
corroborating this), it’s possible that certain complicated models <em>cannot converge</em>
unless you use an appropriately precise format. There’s a drift between the analytical
gradient update and what the actual backward propagation looks like: the lower the
precision, the bigger the drift. I’d expect that deep learning is particularly
susceptible to an issue here because there’s a lot of multiplications, divisions and
reduction operations.</p>
<h2 id="floating-point-formats">Floating-Point Formats</h2>
<p>Let’s take a quick look at three floating-point formats for deep learning. There are a
lot more floating-point formats, but only a few have gained traction: floating-point
formats require the appropriate hardware and firmware support, which restricts the
introduction and adoption of new formats.</p>
<p>For a quick overview, Grigory Sapunov wrote a great <a href="https://medium.com/@moocaholic/fp64-fp32-fp16-bfloat16-tf32-and-other-members-of-the-zoo-a1ca7897d407">run-down of various floating-point
formats for deep
learning</a>.</p>
<h3 id="ieee-floating-point-formats">IEEE floating-point formats</h3>
<p>These floating-point formats are probably what most people think of when someone says
“floating-point”. The IEEE standard 754 sets out several formats, but for the purposes
of deep learning we are only interested three:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-precision_floating-point_format">FP16</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format">FP32</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format">FP64</a> (a.k.a.
half-, single- and double-precision floating-point formats)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Let’s take FP32 as an example. Each FP32 number is a sequence of 32 bits,
. Altogether, this sequence represents the real number</p>

<p>Here,  (the <em>sign bit</em>) determines the sign of the represented value.</p>
<p> through  determine the magnitude or scale of the represented value
(notice that a change in any of these bits drastically changes the size of the
represented value). These bits are called the <em>exponent</em> or <em>scale bits</em>.</p>
<p>Finally,  through  determine the precise value of the represented
value. These bits are called the <em>mantissa</em> or <em>precision bits</em>.</p>
<p>Obviously, the more bits you have, the more you can do. Here’s how the three formats
break down:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>&nbsp;</th>
<th>Sign Bits</th>
<th>Exponent (Scale) Bits</th>
<th>Mantissa (Precision) Bits</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>FP16</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FP32</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>23</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FP64</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>11</td>
<td>53</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>There are some details that I’m leaving out here (e.g. how to represent NaNs, positive
and negative infinities), but this is largely how floating point numbers work. A lot
more detail can be found on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic#IEEE_754:_floating_point_in_modern_computers">Wikipedia
page</a>
and of course the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8766229">latest revision of the IEEE standard
754</a> itself.</p>
<p>FP32 and FP64 are widely supported by both software (C/C++, PyTorch, TensorFlow) and
hardware (x86 CPUs and most NVIDIA/AMD GPUs).</p>
<p>FP16, on the other hand, is not as widely supported in software (you need to use <a href="http://half.sourceforge.net/">a
special library</a> to use them in C/C++). However, since
deep learning is trending towards favoring FP16 over FP32, it has found support in the
main deep learning frameworks (e.g. <code>tf.float16</code> and <code>torch.float16</code>). In terms of
hardware, FP16 is not supported in x86 CPUs as a distinct type, but is well-supported on
modern GPUs.</p>
<h3 id="google-bfloat16">Google BFloat16</h3>
<p>BFloat16 (a.k.a. the Brain Floating-Point Format, after Google Brain) is basically the
same as FP16, but 3 mantissa bits become exponent bits (i.e. bfloat16 trades 3 bits’
worth of precision for scale).</p>

</figure>
<p>When it comes to deep learning, there are generally three “flavors” of values: weights,
activations and gradients. Google suggests storing weights and gradients in FP32, and
storing activations in bfloat16. However, in particularly gracious circumstances,
weights can be stored in bfloat16 without a significant performance degradation.</p>
<p>You can read a lot more on the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/bfloat16-the-secret-to-high-performance-on-cloud-tpus">Google Cloud
blog</a>,
and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12322">this paper by Intel and Facebook studying the bfloat16
format</a>.</p>
<p>In terms of software support, bfloat16 is not supported in C/C++, but is supported in
TensorFlow (<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf#bfloat16"><code>tf.bfloat16</code></a>) and
PyTorch (<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf#bfloat16"><code>torch.bfloat16</code></a>).</p>
<p>In terms of hardware support, it is supported by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Lake_(microarchitecture)">some modern
CPUS</a>, but the real
support comes out in GPUs and ASICs. At the time of writing, bfloat16 is supported by
the NVIDIA A100 (the first GPU to support it!), and <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/260344/future-amd-gpu-architecture-to-implement-bfloat16-hardware">will be supported in future AMD
GPUs</a>.
And of course, it is supported by Google TPU v2/v3.</p>
<h3 id="nvidia-tensorfloat">NVIDIA TensorFloat</h3>
<p>Strictly speaking, this isn’t really its own floating-point format, just an overzealous
branding of the technique that NVIDIA developed to train in mixed precision on their
Tensor Core hardware<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>An NVIDIA TensorFloat (a.k.a. TF32) is just a 32-bit float that drops 13 precision bits
in order to execute on Tensor Cores. Thus, it has the precision of FP16 (10 bits), with
the range of FP32 (8 bits). However, if you’re not using Tensor Cores, it’s just a
32-bit float; if you’re only thinking about storage, it’s just a 32-bit float.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/tf32-Mantissa-chart-hi-res-FINAL.png" alt="Diagram illustrating the number and type of bits in an NVIDIA TensorFloat">
<figcaption>The number and type of bits in an NVIDIA TensorFloat. Source: <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/">NVIDIA blog</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>One distinct advantage of TF32 is that they’re kind of like FP32. To quote from the
NVIDIA developer blog,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Applications using NVIDIA libraries enable users to harness the benefits of TF32 with no
code change required. TF32 Tensor Cores operate on FP32 inputs and produce results in
FP32. Non-matrix operations continue to use FP32.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can read more about TF32 <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/">on the NVIDIA
blog</a>, and
about its hardware support in the Ampere architecture on <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-ampere-architecture-in-depth/">the NVIDIA developer
blog</a>.</p>
<p>TF32 is not in the C/C++ standard at all, but is supported in <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/cuda-11-features-revealed/">CUDA
11</a>.</p>
<p>Hardware-wise, the NVIDIA A100 is the first GPU (and, at the time of writing, the only
device) supporting TF32.</p>
<h2 id="advice-for-practitioners">Advice for Practitioners</h2>
<p>The first thing to say is that floating-point formats are <em>by no means</em> the most
important consideration for your deep learning model — not even close. Floating-point
formats will most likely only make a difference for very large or complex models, for
which fitting the model on GPU memory is a challenge, or for which training times are
excruciatingly long.</p>
<p>The second thing to say is that any practical advice has to be heavily dependent on what
hardware you have available to you.</p>
<h3 id="automatic-mixed-precision-amp-training--a-good-default">Automatic mixed precision (AMP) training — a good default</h3>
<p>Most deep learning stacks support mixed-precision training, which is a pretty good
default option to reap some of the benefits of low-precision training, while still
reasonably avoiding underflow and overflow problems.</p>
<p>TensorFlow supports <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/mixed_precision">mixed-precision training
natively</a>, whereas the <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex">NVIDIA Apex
library</a> makes automatic mixed precision training
available in PyTorch. To get started, take a look at NVIDIA’s <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/automatic-mixed-precision">developer guide for
AMP</a>, and <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/performance/mixed-precision-training/index.html">documentation for
training in mixed
precision</a>.</p>
<p>It’s worth going over the gist of mixed precision training. There are basically two main
tricks:</p>

<li><em>Loss scaling:</em> multiply the loss by some large number, and divide the gradient
updates by this same large number. This avoids the loss underflowing (i.e. clamping
to zero because of the finite precision) in FP16, while still maintaining faithful
backward propagation.</li>
<li><em>FP32 master copy of weights</em>: store the weights themselves in FP32, but cast them to
FP16 before doing the forward and backward propagation (to reap the performance
benefits). During the weight update, the FP16 gradients are cast to FP32 to update
the master copy.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can read more about these techniques in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03740">this paper by NVIDIA and Baidu
Research</a>, or on the accompanying <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/mixed-precision-training-deep-neural-networks/">blog post by
NVIDIA</a>.</p>
<h3 id="alternative-floating-point-formats--make-sure-itll-be-worth-it">Alternative floating-point formats — make sure it’ll be worth it</h3>
<p>If you’ve already trained your model in mixed precision, it might not be worth the time
or effort to port your code to take advantage of an alternative floating-point format
and bleeding edge hardware.</p>
<p>However, if you choose to go that route, make sure your use case really demands it.
Perhaps you can’t scale up your model without using bfloat16, or you really need to cut
down on training times.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don’t have a well-informed opinion on how bfloat16 stacks up against
TF32, so “do your homework” is all I can advise. However, since the NVIDIA A100s only
just (at the time of writing) dropped into the market, it’ll be interesting to see what
the machine learning community thinks of the various low precision options available.</p>

I’ve gone through the most common frameworks below, and how they differ for biotech companies. </p><p>I’m defining a tech startup here as a company whose product is largely based off of code. I am not including in my arbitrary categorization ‘deep tech’ (e.g., autonomous trucks, satellite startups, etc), which often face similar challenges as biotech companies. </p><p>Biotech here is a startup developing a drug. </p><p><em>These are generalizations, and many exceptions exist. </em></p><h2><strong>Risks and Finding Product Market Fit</strong></h2><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Significant market and execution risks<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Minimal market risk, a lot of technical risk</strong></p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_605840"><div><p>In tech, the company often uses a standard software stack and applies it in a novel way (a new product). The question is usually not ‘can this thing be built’, but ‘does anyone want this thing we made’?</p><p>In biotech, this is flipped. The market (a disease) is well established, but the ability to develop a product (a drug) that addresses this market is the core risk. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_607921"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Rolling derisking, early signs of product-market fit<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Derisking comes in bursts over years (biological milestones), early signals less reliable</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_617219"><div><p>In tech, you want the ‘up and to the right’ chart, showing exponential increase of some core metric of the company. Adoption, revenue, and other metrics derisk the company and give early signs of PMF. Early signs can be highly predictive of the company’s eventual success.</p><p>In biotech, derisking the company is predominantly tied to specific biological milestones. These come in bursts, with long periods of waiting in-between. Additionally, early milestones (such as the drug working in mice) aren’t 1-to-1 predictive of eventual success (the drug working in people).</p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_619233"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Iterate to product-market-fit<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Product (drug) finalized years before on market</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_631626"><div><p>In tech, the product is constant iterates and improves from customer feedback to find the exact product that people want. </p><p>In biotech, due to the extensive regulation, the final product (the drug) is finalized years before it first goes into people. If the drug doesn’t work in people, there is no iterating. If you want to modify the product, you need to restart the entire process over again. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_633705"><div><h2><strong>Founders &amp; Market</strong></h2><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Founders often bring insight around a market<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Founders often bring insight around key biology</strong></p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_651094"><div><p>In tech, a prototypical founder often worked at the incumbent company or realized a market opportunity by being that market themself. The insight around the market opportunity itself is a core value of the company. </p><p>In biotech, the insight of the founder is around a new or better way to develop a drug for the disease, or a discovery that was made in the laboratory (and the relevant patents around it). </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_665620"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Founders often younger, ‘youth wunderkinds’ widely accepted <br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Founders often older due to scientific training or are a professional CEO, rarer to have very young founders </strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_678110"><div><p>In tech, the 18-year-old drop-out is lauded and mystified. If anything, older founders may be subconsciously discriminated against in favor for younger founders. </p><p>In biotech, the prototypical founder is older, often a career CEO or exec coming out of a Big Pharma company. At minimum, the founders almost always have significant scientific training - a PhD can take 6-8 years, and post-docs 2-3 years each. It is less common to see founders in their 20s and you almost never see ‘youth wunderkinds’. This is in part due to the conservatism of the industry and in part because extensive scientific training is generally necessary to have enough biological insight to correctly identify an opportunity. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_420694"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Can create a new market<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Markets are diseases and therefore public domain</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_422265"><div><p>In tech, some of the most successful companies created or defined their market - a classic example being ride sharing. Once a new market is validated, other companies/copycats/fast-followers flow in. </p><p>In biotech, the market opportunities are diseases. New markets can somewhat be created (e.g., nootropics, elective medicines, Viagra) but generally speaking the markets are well known. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_423860"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Markets are winner-take-all<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Many winners</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_458802"><div><p>In tech, investors often bet on a specific horse with the hope that the horse will win the race (and all the earnings). Bifurcated markets can be especially dangerous as companies compete on pricing and ‘race to the bottom’.</p><p>In biotech, the markets are <em>so </em>large, and the unmet need so high, that there can and often are many winners in one market (disease). The classic example here are statins, which in 2020 had over $1 trillion in sales across seven market approved statins, with the best-selling Lipitor having peak sales of $12B in the mid-2000s. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_456236"><div><h2><strong>Product Strategy</strong></h2><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Often develop one product at a time, focus is key <br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Portfolio approach is encouraged to de-risk company, exception is one-asset, repurposing plays</strong></p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_482826"><div><p>Focus is crucial for any startup. However, in biotech the most successful and valuable companies often take a portfolio approach to product development - developing multiple products simultaneously. In tech, companies generally focus around one product or core offering, only differentiating once they have earned the right to do so by finding PMF with their first product.</p><p>A significant reason for this is to derisk the company against biological randomness. Instead, focus in a biotech company is usually around a core competency - e.g., a method of discovering drugs, or a way of delivering the drug - and then diversified within this core competency. For example, gene therapy company Spark Therapeutics had a core competency of AAV-based gene therapy (a virus loaded with DNA to treat a genetic disease) but leverages this competency simultaneously across multiple diseases. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_484564"><p><strong>﻿</strong><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Outsourcing product development or engineering unadvisable<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Common to use contractors for key experimental work</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_497310"><div><p>In tech, not having someone technical on the founding team is a classic ‘no no’. You generally should have the ability to build (and therefore rapidly iterate on and improve) your core product within the team. </p><p>In biotech, it is common and often preferred to use contract research organizations (CROs) for much of your experimental work. Some experiments can only be done by specialized CROs, and they often have advantages from scale that a startup cannot hope to replicate. Building and staffing a laboratory, including the multiple six-figure machines necessary, is impracticable and unnecessary for most companies. </p><p>Virtual biotechs - companies with distributed leadership and all research outsourced to CROs - have been popular long before it became the tech zeitgeist.</p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_499137"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Fast-followers and copycats a significant risk<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Strong patent protection </strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_570610"><div><p>In tech, being the first/best product to a new market is so important because once you validate a market’s need for a specific product, it is easy for others to copy and chip at your market share. This is especially common in traditional D2C brands, for example the many bed-in-a-box companies. </p><p>In biotech, patents are king. If you hold the key patent it is impossible for your drug to be copied. Once patents expire, however, there is a whole industry (generics) around copying drugs and selling them cheaper than the branded product. Because of the hundreds of millions it takes to develop a drug, it is almost impossible to commercialize a drug that is not able to be protected by patents, regardless of its efficacy. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_568710"><div><h2><strong>Raising, Spending, and Making Money</strong></h2><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Primary burn usually people costs <br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Primary burn R&amp;D</strong></p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_725052"><p>Biotech companies’ biggest line item is undoubtedly R&amp;D spend - funding to do research experiments necessary to find and develop their drug.

                  I set up a procedural content creation pipeline that imports <a href="http://stinaflodstrom.com/projects/osm/www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> data into Unity and uses the Houdini Engine to create realistic cityscapes based on real world locations. The goal was to have an as automated process as possible for generating environments based on real cities. The buildings and the roads are generated from OSM building shapes and road splines using a procedural system for building type and prop placing. Traffic lights, Crossings and Trees also get their positions from OSM. Values and procedural parameters can be tweaked in Unity making it possible to create endless variations.

                  </p><p>The project was developed with the simulation team in one of the bigger automotive companies as a proof of concept for creating syntetic data for AI and render out annotated images. The environmant is complete with tags for segmentation.

		<p>Every time we have a sort of financial crisis that has something to do with settlement, and collaterals, and weird instruments, people start questioning why more instruments are not traded on exchanges. They cite the example of equities, which world over are exchange traded, centrally settled, and whose markets function rather efficiently.</p>
<p>After the 2008 Financial Crisis, for example, there was a move to take Credit Default Swaps (CDS) to exchanges, rather than letting the market go over the counter (OTC). Every few years, ideas are floated about trading bonds on exchanges (rather than OTC, like they are now), and the blame falls on “greedy bankers who don’t want to let go of control”.</p>
<p>There is an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-16/odd-lots-podcast-under-the-rusty-hood-of-the-8-trillion-corporate-bond-market">excellent podcast by Bloomberg Odd Lots</a> where Chris White, a former Goldman Sachs banker, talks about how the equity markets went electronic in the 1970s with NASDAQ, and how the “big bang” in the UK markets propelled equities into electronic trading everywhere.</p>
<p>A lot of these ideas have also been discussed in <a href="https://www.amazon.in/dp/B074WC3FFX">my book on market design</a>.&nbsp;<a href="http://noenthuda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-05-at-10.30.33-PM.png"><img data-attachment-id="9010" data-permalink="https://noenthuda.com/blog/2017/12/05/bond-market-liquidity-and-selection-bias/screen-shot-2017-12-05-at-10-30-33-pm/" data-orig-file="https://noenthuda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-05-at-10.30.33-PM.png" data-orig-size="1188,1336" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Screen Shot 2017-12-05 at 10.30.33 PM" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://noenthuda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-05-at-10.30.33-PM-267x300.png" data-large-file="https://noenthuda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-05-at-10.30.33-PM-911x1024.png" src="https://noenthuda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-05-at-10.30.33-PM-911x1024.png" alt="" width="840" height="944" srcset="https://noenthuda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-05-at-10.30.33-PM-911x1024.png 911w, https://noenthuda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-05-at-10.30.33-PM-133x150.png 133w, https://noenthuda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-05-at-10.30.33-PM-267x300.png 267w, https://noenthuda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-05-at-10.30.33-PM-768x864.png 768w, https://noenthuda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-05-at-10.30.33-PM.png 1188w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"></a></p>
<p>In any case, I think I have the perfect explanation of why bond trading on exchanges hasn’t really taken off. To understand this, let’s look at another market that I discussed extensively in my book – the market for relationships (that <a href="https://www.livemint.com/Sundayapp/SQmnAdsSW71Iu9M9qhKchP/Binders-full-of-women.html">chapter has been extracted</a> in Mint).</p>
<p>The market for relationships is in the news thanks to this Netflix documentary called Indian Matchmaking. I started watching it on a whim on Saturday night, and I got so addicted to it that yesterday I postponed my work to late night so that I could finish the show instead.</p>
<p><span><iframe width="840" height="473" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aZS2KbLAy5Y?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span></p>
<p>Marriage can be thought of as a sale of “<a href="https://noenthuda.com/blog/2009/02/12/50-stake-sale/">50% of the rest of your life</a>“, paid for by 50% of the rest of someone else’s life.</p>
<p>There are two ways you can go about it – either “over the counter” (finding a partner by yourself) or “exchange traded” (said exchange could be anything from newspaper classifieds to Tinder to Shaadi.com). Brokers are frequently used in the OTC market – either parents or friends (who set you up) or priests.</p>
<p>The general rule of markets is that the more bespoke (or “weird” or “unusual”) an instrument is, the better the likelihood of finding a match in the OTC markets than on exchanges. The reason is simple – for an exchange to exist, the commodity being traded needs to be a commodity.</p>
<p>Read any literature on agricultural markets, for example, and they all talk about “assaying” and “grading” the commodities. The basic idea is that all goods being traded on a marketplace are close enough substitutes of each other that they can be interchanged for each other.</p>
<p>Equity shares, by definition, are commodities. Equity and index derivatives are commodities as well, easy enough to define. Commodities are, by definition, commodities. Bond futures are commodities, since they can be standardised on a small number of axes. We’ll come to bonds in a bit.</p>
<p>Coming back to relationship markets, the “exchanges” work best if you have very few idiosyncrasies, and can be defined fairly well in terms of a small number of variables. It also helps you to find a partner quicker in case many others in the market have similar attributes as you, which means that the market for “your type of people” becomes “liquid” (this is a recurring theme in my book).</p>
<p>However, in case you are either not easily describable by commonly used variables, or in case there are few others like you in the market, exchanges are likely to work less well for you. Either of these conditions makes you “illiquid”, and it is not a great idea to list an illiquid asset on an exchange.</p>
<p>When you list an illiquid asset on an exchange, unless you are extremely lucky, it is likely to sit there for a long time without being traded (think about “bespoke exchanges” like eBay here, where commodification is not necessary). The longer the asset sits on an exchange, the greater the likelihood that people who come across the asset on the exchange think that “something is wrong with it”.</p>
<p>So if you’re listing it on an exchange, its value will decay exponentially, and unless you are able to trade soon after you have listed it, you are unlikely to get much value for it.</p>
<p>In that sense, if you are “illiquid” for whatever reason (can’t be easily described, or belong to a type that few others in the market belong to), exchanges are not for you. And if you think about each of the characters in Indian Matchmaking who come to Sima aunty, they are illiquid in one way or another.</p>
<ul>
<li>Aparna has entered the market at 34, and few other women of her age are in the market. Hence illiquid.</li>
<li>Nadia belongs to a small ethnicity, Indian-Guyanese-American, which makes her illiquid.</li>
<li>Pradhyuman has quirky interests (jewelry and fashion), which his parents are trying to suppress as they pass him off a liquid “rich Maadu boy”. Quirky interests mean he’s not easily describable. Hence illiquid.</li>
<li>Vyasar, by Indian-American standards, doesn’t have a great job. So not too many others like him. Illiquid, even before you take his family situation into account.</li>
<li>Ankita is professionally ambitious. Few of those women in the Indian arranged marriage market. Illiquid.</li>
<li>Rupam is divorced with a child. Might be liquid by conventional American markets, but illiquid in an Indian context. And she is, rather inexplicably, going the Indian way despite being American.</li>
<li>Akshay is possibly the most liquid (characterless except for an overly-dominating mom), and maybe that’s why he’s shown getting engaged.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these people will be wasting themselves listing themselves on exchanges. And so they come to a matchmaker. Now, Sima Auntie is both a broker and a clearinghouse (refer to <a href="https://www.amazon.in/dp/B074WC3FFX">Chapter 3 of my book 😛</a>). She helps find matches for people, but only matches within her own inventory (though she decided Ankita has no matches at all in her own inventory, so connected her with another broker-clearinghouse).</p>
<p>This makes it hard – first of all you have illiquid assets, and you are trying to fulfil them within limited inventory. This is why she is repeatedly showing saying that her candidates need to “compromise” (something that seems to have triggered a lot of viewers). <strong>By compromise, she is saying that these people are so illiquid that in case they need to get a deal in her little exchange, they need to be willing to accept an “illiquidity discount” in order to get a trade.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Back to bonds, why is trading them on an exchange so difficult? Because each bond is so idiosyncratic. There is the issuer, the exact date of expiry and the coupon, and occasionally some weird derivatives tacked on. The likelihood that you might find someone quickly enough to take the other side of such a deal is minuscule, so if you were to list your bond on an exchange, its value would drop significantly (by being continuously listed) before you could find a counterparty.</p>
<p>Hence, people trade this uncertain discount to a certain discount, by trading their bonds with market makers (investment banks) who are willing to take the other side of the deal immediately.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, market making is not a viable strategy when it comes to relationship markets. So what do you do if you can either be not defined easily in a few parameters, or if there are few others like you in the arranged &nbsp;marriage market? You basically go Over The Counter. Ditch the market and find someone for yourself, or ask people you know to set you up. Or <a href="https://marriagebrokerauntie.com/">hire a matrimonial advisor</a> who will tell you what to do.</p>
<p>If this doesn’t convince you on why matchmakers are important, then may be you should read <a href="https://shapelygal.substack.com/p/indian-matchmaking"><strong>what my other half has to say</strong></a>. If she’s the better half or not, you figure.</p>

If that’s on my tombstone I failed. [13]</h2></blockquote><blockquote><h2><em>Put your money where your mind is.</em></h2></blockquote><p>Best investing attitude is contrarian, patient, informed optimism. As @m2jr says, “non-consensus and right.”&nbsp; [11]</p><p>The biggest gains in investing come when you bet against a gloomy crowd, on the upside. The low price already bakes their opinion in. Your losses are limited to 1x, and your gains are uncapped.&nbsp; [11]</p><p>Venture and value investors outperform via patience. Active trading is just another get-rich-quick scheme, with the same results.</p><p>I was trained on the efficient markets hypothesis, and yet every market that I've seen up close has been anything but. [11] </p><blockquote><h2><em>You get paid for being right first, and to be first, you can’t wait for consensus. </em></h2></blockquote><p>— </p><blockquote><h2><em>Investing is one of the few professions where you can objectively improve every day until the day that you die. </em></h2></blockquote><p><strong>What are some of your biggest successes in the investing world?</strong></p><p>I’ve thrown a lot of darts.</p><p>I don't necessarily take credit for it. Some people might say they were very thoughtful and did a lot of diligence. You know, some of it was luck. A lot of it was luck.&nbsp;</p><p>I was a first round investor in Twitter when it was first getting started. I was first investor in Uber, when it was getting started. Thumbtack, Wanelo, Flipagram. I was probably the first real investor in Postmates, after they got out of an incubator.</p><p>There's a bunch of them that goes on and on, it's hard for me to draw the full list. The fund I ran is on track to return 10-20x the capital it raised. And my individual portfolio is up by something like dozens of times. [6]</p><p>Angel bets and venture bets are great because they have nonlinear outcomes in the positive, but on the downside you can only lose 1x (where x is your investment). On the upside, you can make 10,000x.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve tried to rig the game. Basically, I try and set up good systems and then the individual decisions don’t matter that matter much. I think our ability to make individual decisions is actually not great. For example, as an investor, my system is: I want to see 10,000 companies and I want to pick 500 that have a shot of being huge. Then I want the option to double down on the five winners. I don’t want to just look at 100 companies and pick 10 that I think are winners and go all in on those. I don’t think I have that capability. [4]</p><blockquote><h2><em>Raising funding for good businesses is (slowly) getting easier. But picking good businesses is getting harder.</em></h2></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, at least in the technology business, there’s a lot of luck required. Right place, right time, market forces, timing, regulatory action against or pro. There’s a lot of things that control where the platforms are shifting, what open source efforts show up. You can never predict the outside successes. What you can predict is the failures.&nbsp;</p><p>You can say, “This person doesn’t know this field at all. They’re way out of their depth. This person, they’re a short-term thinker. They’re not going to last the game. They’re not going to go as far as needed.” [4]&nbsp;</p><blockquote><h2><em>Highly recommend that every would-be investor start a company first. It's hard to understand pain in the abstract. </em></h2></blockquote><p><strong>What are the things that you look for in founders, or the red flags that disqualify an investment or a founder?</strong></p><p>Number one, intelligence; you’ve got to be smart, which means you have to know what you’re doing, to some level. That’s a fuzzy thing but you talk to people and you kind of get a sense of do they know what they’re doing or not. Do they have insight, do they have specific knowledge? Have they thought about the problem deeply? It’s not about the age. It’s not how many years they’ve spent but just how deep is their understanding of what they’re about to do.”</p><p>So intelligence is key. Energy, because being a founder is brutally difficult. It takes a long time and in the long run, the people who succeed are just the ones who persevere. So if someone runs out of energy or if they’re doing this in some hesitating, preliminary way where they’re looking for constant positive feedback, or if they’re easily thrown off course, then they’re not going to make it to the end, especially in the highly competitive startup context.</p><p>And finally is integrity. Because if you have someone who is high intelligence and high energy but they’re low integrity, what you’ve got is a hard working, smart crook. [31]</p><blockquote><h2><em>Investing time/money behind someone?</em></h2><h2><em>- Do you like them?</em></h2><h2><em>- Can they teach you something you want to learn?</em></h2><h2><em>- Good economics?</em></h2><h2><em>If so, invest.</em></h2></blockquote><p>I co-founded AngelList because I was tired of saying no to entrepreneurs. I wanted to say instead, “yes, we can help you get funded.”</p><p>So, it’s especially disappointing when we get promising startups pitching on AngelList from remote locations. Some we’ve managed to get funded – including ones in Canada and Europe. Others are harder – especially in Russia, Latin America, and Asia.&nbsp;</p><p>The problem, as I’ve come to realize, is that funding markets develop in reverse.</p><p>In any given geographic region, the first companies that get funded are the ones that least need funding. They have strong operating histories, auditable financials, predictable cash flows, etc.. Funding these companies is less risky, and so a secondary, and then a primary, market forms around them. Call these the public markets.</p><p>After the public markets come the mezzanine investors, investing just before a company goes public. And because the mezzanines now exist to pick up risk, late stage private investors start forming behind them. And so on and so forth until you end up with Seed incubators and Angel investors.</p><p>Essentially, the single biggest risk you have as an investor is “downstream financing risk.” The risk that the company won’t be able to raise more money once it has spent all of your cash.</p><p>This explains the apparent paradox that in less mature innovation cities, you’ll have an easier time finding VCs who will invest $10M in a mature business, than Angels who’ll invest $100K in a raw startup.</p><p>It’s a measure of the incredible strength of the Silicon Valley ecosystem that Y Combinator has chosen it as its hometown. YC and its brethren can only exist because of the rich Angel ecosystem. Paul Graham was smart enough to realize that his graduates couldn’t function without a rich Angel ecosystem, and went to great pains (such as AngelConf) to foster it.</p><p>Similarly, the true evidence that the NY Angel market has finally blossomed is that TechStars and a number of other seed combinators are choosing to do business there.</p><p>As an entrepreneur choosing your base of operations, take a careful look around. If you don’t see many VCs, you’re not likely to find many Angels either. Even though the VCs invest more money, they actually take less risk.</p><p>Angels should realize how this whole pyramid functions. Investing in companies that won’t have access to Venture is incredibly risky. Investing at Venture valuations in Angel-stage companies means that your portfolio will likely generate negative returns. [22]</p><blockquote><h2><em>Made lots of bad investments, but even when they lose, I never seem to regret the ones with hardcore techies doing difficult things.</em></h2></blockquote><p>In startup financings, each new investor brings new information but doesn't move the price. Ergo, following the herd is rational. [11] Startup financings exhibit herd mentality because there's no pricing. If first movers paid *a lot* less, financings would be rational. [11]</p><p><strong>You've probably seen more entrepreneurs before and after success than just about anybody ever. Of all the people who made it, how many could you tell five minutes after you met them “this one's gonna make it” and it doesn't even matter what the idea was?</strong></p><p>It's hard to tell which businesses are going to work because a lot of businesses fail. And a lot of good entrepreneurs chasing bad businesses fail. But the entrepreneurs themselves don't fail over a long period of time. When you meet the entrepreneurs who can be winners, they will be a winner, the question is just how many times. You may have to back them a few times. [73]</p><blockquote><h2><em>Asking a startup founder, "What's the Business Model?" betrays a lack of imagination. </em></h2></blockquote><p><strong>What are some of the mistakes you’ve made investing?</strong></p><p>I passed on Twilio very early on. Jeff Lawson is a great founder, and he gave me every chance to invest.&nbsp;</p><p>I passed on Pinterest, Ben Silberman gave me every chance to invest. We'd helped Ben a little bit with AngelList, although not a lot, we were just getting started. He was raising money for Pinterest. And I saw the numbers going up month to month to month. I had a chance to invest the first time, the second time, third time. He kept offering it to me. I was sitting in bed next to my fiance, and she was obsessively using Pinterest. She said, ‘I think you should do this.’ I was like, ‘I don't get it, it’s images, who's going to use that, how is it going to make money.’ So I passed on Pinterest. I've got a lot of stupid ones like that.</p><p>I could have been an Advisor YouTube in the early days. I helped them out, but didn't take any stock, even though they were kind enough to offer it.&nbsp;</p><p>There's lots and lots of misses. Square, I could have done the first round, and I thought it was too expensive. Even Twitter where I did my piece I did a much smaller piece than I was allocated, just because I thought it was too expensive. [6]</p><p><strong>What are the things that lead to you make bad investments, overriding your rules or intuition?</strong></p><p>I don't actually dwell on the bad investments much. In the startup world, you're betting that 90% of these companies will go to zero, or just return your money and the remaining 10% are going to post huge multiples. The Twitter investment is probably up 400x, Uber is probably up around 4,000x. So the returns of the winners …</p></div></div></div></div></div></main></div></div>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>Welcome to the Build Your Own Heroku on Kubernetes series! Our goal is to build a self-hosted Heroku platform on Kubernetes because Heroku is expensive. <a href="https://www.stevennatera.com/heroku-sucks-kinda-how-their-pricing-pushed-me-to-ask-questions/">In the previous post</a> I told you I made a working prototype of our platform. Today you will learn how I used <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> to create the cluster for our platform. I’ll share with you terraform files, conventions, and the system design choices I made for the cluster.</p><h2 id="three-ways-to-create-a-gke-cluster">Three ways to create a GKE cluster</h2><p>You can create a Kubernetes cluster on Google Cloud three ways. You can click through the cloud console. When you want to create a one-off cluster for experiments, the console is the best option. You can create a cluster using the <code>gcloud-cli</code> tool. The command line tool is great for scripting tasks.</p><p>When you want to declaratively provision resources Terraform is your best option. With Terraform, you can declare or write the infrastructure you want in a configuration file, version control the file with Git, and then provision the resources from the configuration file. If you forget what you provisioned, you can review the configuration file. You don’t need to click around in the console to inventory infrastructure.</p><h2 id="let-s-organize-our-infrastructure-project">Let’s organize our infrastructure project</h2><p>Terraform is a simple tool. Most of the time you use the <code>init</code>, <code>plan</code>, <code>apply</code>, and <code>destroy</code> commands. The most difficult task is choosing the proper folder structure and file organization. </p><p>Disorganization will cause rewrites. Chances are high your rewrites will break state management in Terraform and your files won't be reachable by the cli tool. There are ways to recover from an incomplete state but you can minimize those possibilities with a setup that grows with infrastructure requirements.</p><p>I have yet to find the best guides on project structure but I’ve managed to find a convention that works well for a solo developer projects. The convention is <strong><code>infra/PROVIDER__PROJECT-NAME__SERVICE/RESOURCE-NAME/*.tf</code></strong>. </p><p>First, you create an infrastructure directory for terraform. Then, create a folder with the provider name, the project name within the provider, and the product I’m using from their service catalog. Then, create a folder to represent an instance of the service resource. In that folder, I’ll place my terraform files. </p><p>In in practice the convention looks like, <code>/infra/gcp__labs__gke/micro</code>. From the path you know, you're on Google Cloud Platform, in a GCP project called <code>labs</code>, and a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine">Google Kubernetes Engine</a> cluster named <code>micro</code> exists. It’s not the best approach but it's been good enough for side projects. I'm a fan of this format because it's readable, double underscores prevent extensive nesting, and can be extended to include multiple providers. If you organize your Terraform project a different way, tweet me <a href="https://twitter.com/stevennatera">@stevennatera</a> and let's chat!</p><h2 id="how-to-write-terraform-files">How to write Terraform files</h2><p>The following patterns are personal preferences. Even though we have multiple files, behind the scenes Terraform concatenates all your files before making infrastructure changes. If you wanted, you could put everything in single file. However multiple files prevent accidental changes other infrastructure components. Credentials are stored locally during iterations; we’ll figure out a better solution for production in later posts.</p><figure><img src="https://www.stevennatera.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-25-at-9.17.47-AM.png" alt="Image of our Terraform project structure." srcset="https://www.stevennatera.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-25-at-9.17.47-AM.png 600w, https://www.stevennatera.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-25-at-9.17.47-AM.png 1000w, https://www.stevennatera.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-25-at-9.17.47-AM.png 1600w, https://www.stevennatera.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-25-at-9.17.47-AM.png 1780w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Image of our Terraform project structure.</figcaption></figure><p>In <code>definitions.tf</code> you’ll find the declaration of variables we want to use within our configuration files. The <code>env.tf</code> file contains meta information needed for our resources. You’ll find the providers of our resources and the required Terraform version. </p><p>The <code>main.auto.tfvars</code> contains the values we want to assign to our variables. The values in files ending in <code>*.auto.tfvars</code> are automatically assigned to declared variables. The <code>main.tf</code> file contains all the resources we want to provision. Here you’ll find the cluster and node pool configurations.</p><figure><pre><code># main.tf

###############################################
# Node pool
###############################################

resource "google_container_node_pool" "micro" {
  name     = var.gke_node_pool_name
  location = var.gke_location
  cluster  = google_container_cluster.micro.name

  # 1 node per zone
  initial_node_count = 1

    auto_upgrade = true
  }

  node_config {
    preemptible  = var.gke_node_is_preemptible

    disk_size_gb = var.gke_node_disk_size

    metadata = {
      disable-legacy-endpoints = "true"
    }

    oauth_scopes = [

  maintenance_policy {
    daily_maintenance_window {
      start_time = "03:00"
    }
  }
}</code></pre><figcaption>Detail view of main.tf</figcaption></figure><p>The Kubernetes control plane, where the master nodes reside, is declared in <code>google_container_cluster</code>. The data plane, a separately managed node pool for our workloads, is declared in <code>google_container_node_pool</code>. When we create our cluster with a separate node pool, instead of using the default one, we can maintain each resource independently.</p><p>A file not shown is <code>terraform.tfstate</code>. This file contains the current state of your infrastructure. If you delete this file, Terraform won’t be able to manage the declare resource. I save these files locally for prototypes. in production we should use a GCS bucket to store the state in a remote location. Now, let’s take a closer look at the values we specified.</p><figure><pre><code># main.auto.tfvars
### Variables to be automatically substituted

core_project_id = "YOUR_PROJECT"
core_region = "us-central1"
core_zone = "us-central1-a"

gke_location = "us-central1-a"
gke_node_types = "e2-standard-4"
gke_node_disk_size = 60
gke_node_is_preemptible = true

gke_autoscaling_min = 0
gke_autoscaling_max = 1

gke_cluster_name = "micro"
gke_node_pool_name = "micro"
gke_version = "1.16"
gke_node_locations = [
  "us-central1-b",
]</code></pre><figcaption>Values defined in main.auto.tfvars file.</figcaption></figure><p>Since I won’t know resource requirements until the completion of our project, I want to iterate on infrastructure for cheap. I started with the least expensive options, then worked my way up until the cluster could install all the components without crashing.</p><p>With these values a single node zonal cluster was created. You can tell the cluster master nodes are zonal by the value at <code>gke_location</code>. The value in <code>gke_node_locations</code> tells us we want 1 node per zone in the list. To save money, we use preemptible nodes. Preemptible nodes shut down after 24 hours of use, but have discount pricing up to 80% off on-demand instance prices. </p><p>The single worker node is of type <code>e2-standard-4</code> and runs Kubernetes version <code>1.16</code>. I chose a node type with 4 CPUs and 16GB of RAM to make sure the platform has enough compute resources. When the platform is stable, we might downsize the requirements, and add better autoscaling limits. With these values I’ve been able to iterate on the infrastructure for less than $1!</p><h2 id="provision-your-infrastructure">Provision your infrastructure</h2><p>To follow along, you can download these files from <a href="https://github.com/nodox/heroku-on-kubernetes-series">Github</a>. Create <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">a free GCP account</a> if you don’t have one. Install the <code><a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud">gcloud-cli</a></code>, and <code><a href="https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html">terraform-cli</a></code>. Create service account credentials for Terraform. The credentials must have the roles <code>Compute Viewer</code>, <code>Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin</code>, and <code>Service Account User</code>. Rename your credentials as <code>core.secret.json</code>. Then follow the bash commands in the <code>README.md</code> file. The <code>README.md</code> has the steps above in more detail.</p><h2 id="what-s-next">What’s next</h2><p>In our next post we'll install a serverless container runtime with <a href="https://knative.dev/">Knative</a> and configure <a href="https://istio.io/">Istio</a> as our ingress gateway to receive traffic. Join the mailing list to stay updated with the series!</p><h2 id="additional-reading">Additional Reading</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.stevennatera.com/heroku-sucks-kinda-how-their-pricing-pushed-me-to-ask-questions/">Part 1: Heroku sucks, kinda.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Lately, in the tech world, no-code systems have been getting immense attention, and for good reasons. These types of systems allow the user to develop software with a much easier drag and drop interface, as opposed to the traditional coding using programming languages.<br></p><p>No-code systems have been gaining popularity because they provide a long list of advantages among which less manpower, less time, and an easier development process are the most significant ones. Some really popular examples of no-code systems are web design tools like WordPress, Webflow, and software development tools like Airtable, Nintex, Appy Pie, etc.<br></p><p>These days, no-code systems are turning out to be more and more advanced. And they are already being developed for more advanced technologies like AI and blockchain. In this blog, we will dive into the world of recommendation systems and why no-code recommendation systems are the future of AI. Let’s get started!</p><h2>Non-programmer friendly</h2><p>We know that building a recommendation system, or any system for that matter is not a one-man job. Programmers, non-programmers, business specialists, and executives are involved when it comes to that. It is not necessary that everyone knows how to code. In fact, in many cases, only a few members will know the actual programming portion.&nbsp;<br></p><p>No-code recommendation systems are advantageous in such cases because people who have access to the data will be able to use the system when the tech guys are not available or working on something more important. For example, in the case of <a href="https://caboom.ai/why-us">Caboom</a>, any executive, business owner, or product manager who has access to the data can use the system for testing the feasibility of the recommendation system without anyone’s help.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The process which traditionally would require some manpower, more time, and additional expenses, will be done much faster with the help of a UI tool.</p><h2>AI Democratization</h2><p>AI democratization is a heavy term with a simple meaning: making AI accessible to everyone in an organization. AI is a revolutionary tool, and it <em>should</em> be accessible to anyone, specially non-AI people who are involved in a primarily AI-focused organization. The no-code recommendation system is the ultimate next step towards this.<br></p><p>This kind of simple UI application will make sure that the power of AI is being utilized to its full potential with every techie and non-techie working hand in hand with it.</p><h2>Efficiency and Productivity</h2><p>No-code systems are much more efficient than the traditional methodologies because of their simplicity and easy drag and drop features. If you have the basic knowledge, you will be able to design, develop, or test your recommendation system in much less time as well as less cost and manpower.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Along with that, a small team will be able to build your application using a no-code platform and smaller skill set, while more resources can be focused on bigger more complex ML projects at hand. Thus, it is more efficient as well as increases the productivity of the whole team.</p><p>AI is not just about technology and engineering, but also about art and nuance. People have to go through a lot of heavy lifting to understand the technical aspects. The goal of such no-code recommendation systems is to do that heavy-lifting for you so that you can just focus on the art and nuances of AI.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>While the whole concept of the no-code recommendation system is still in its infancy, it does show a promising future. We can expect more advanced no-code AI systems in the future and soon, it will be possible to build AI systems with a lot less effort, cost, and other resources.</p></div></div>]]>

Question: Tell me more about Bastille Networks</b></h3><p><b>Bob Baxley: <a href="https://www.bastille.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Bastille</span></a><span> is the leader in enterprise threat detection through software-defined radio. Bastille provides full visibility into the known and <a href="https://secureblitz.com/risks-of-cryptojacking-in-mobile-devices/">unknown mobile</a>, wireless, and <a href="https://secureblitz.com/secure-your-iot-devices/">Internet of Things devices</a> inside an enterprise’s corporate airspace–together known as the Internet of Radios. Through its patented software-defined radio and machine learning technology, Bastille senses, identifies, and localizes threats, providing security teams the ability to accurately quantify risk and mitigate airborne threats that could pose a danger to network infrastructure.</span></b></p><h3><b>2. Question: What’s unique and different about Bastille than other solutions/companies?</b></h3><p><span><strong>Bob Baxley</strong>: Until Bastille, there was no way to apply network security mechanisms and countermeasures to RF-enabled IoT devices. IT security professionals couldn’t buy a security service like </span><a href="https://www.bastille.net/product/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Bastille Enterprise</span></a><span> until we invented it.</span></p><h3><strong>3. Question: Can you dive into radio frequency security and why it’s essential for enterprises?</strong></h3><p><span><strong>Bob Baxley:</strong> Corporate airspaces are under attack from invisible threats operating on Radio Frequencies (RF). Enterprises are often crucially reliant on wireless protocols, some that they don’t even know they’re using (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, BLE, Zigbee, Z-Wave, etc.). </span></p><p><span>These protocols are used in building controls and building access, for employee communications, IT, for employees. The exploitation of vulnerable wireless devices is growing increasingly common. Sophisticated attacks use compromised RF devices as their entry points into government and corporate networks. Foreign governments, competitors, and cybercriminals are conducting radio-based attacks on enterprises to access intellectual property and sensitive information.</span></p><h3><strong>4. Question: Can you discuss the importance of why enterprises need to implement and enforce more nuanced electronic device policies to accurately distinguish between approved and unapproved electronic devices in secure areas?</strong></h3><p><span><strong>Bob Baxley:</strong> RF-enabled devices are everywhere: According to Statistica, there are 4.7 billion Cellular phones, 8.4 billion Bluetooth devices, and 9 billion Wi-Fi devices, added to this is the increasing use of “wearables” such as FitBits and other personal devices with embedded radios, with a variety of audio/video capture, pairing and transmission capabilities.</span></p><p><span>Current policies are outdated: While some government and commercial buildings have secure areas where no cell phones or other RF-emitting devices are allowed, detecting and locating radio-enabled devices is largely based on the honor system or one time scans for devices. Bad actors do not follow the honor system and one time scans are, just that, one time and cannot monitor 24×7.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>New solutions for a new age:</span><span> Bastille</span><span> enables security teams to differentiate between </span><b>approved and unapproved devices, and </b><span>accurately places </span><b>dots on a floor-plan map </b><span>for device location and sends alerts when a device is found where it should not be or doing what it should not do.</span> <span>Bastille</span><span> Networks also integrates with existing security systems such as Splunk, MDM, and camera systems.</span></p><h3><b>5.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>I</span> didnâ€™t really understand the word â€˜graceâ€™ until I swam with manta rays. These placid members of the shark family are the embodiment of grace; winged fish <a href="https://www.mantatrust.org/mobula-alfredi" target="_blank">14 feet</a> across who swoop and somersault with such precision that a manta scooping up plankton at speeds of up to <a href="https://www.deepseanews.com/2013/08/the-superhero-like-swimming-of-manta-rays/" target="_blank">22 miles per hour</a> can graze the hair of a SCUBA diver without touching her head. And as I experienced while diving in Hawaii, if you sit quietly on the ocean floor, theyâ€™ll do it not just once but again and again before disappearing into the blue abyss, as ephemeral as a cloud.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>For both their grace and their sheer otherworldly coolness, people love manta rays. The animals generate $50 million a year from tourists like me who want to swim or dive with them. But given how popular they are, much about mantas remains a mystery. They're truly wild creatures, too big for most aquariums and too far-ranging to easily study. Their life history and migration patterns are little known.&nbsp;No one has ever seen a manta give birth in the wild; we have no idea where they do so.&nbsp;And&nbsp;until&nbsp;recently, scientists thought there was only one kind of&nbsp;manta. It wasnâ€™t until 2009 that&nbsp;the more transient oceanic mantas (<em>Mobula birostris</em>) were recognized as a distinct species from the slightly smaller reef mantas (<em>Mobula alfredi</em>).<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>â€œThere are these big, intelligent creatures roaming around and we just donâ€™t know much about them,â€� says&nbsp;Sammy&nbsp;Andrzejaczek, a shark scientist with the&nbsp;Hopkins Marine Station at Stanford University.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Studies have shown that <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237067445_Trends_in_sightings_and_environmental_influences_on_a_coastal_aggregation_of_manta_rays_and_whale_sharks" target="_blank">overfishing</a> has <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3770565/" target="_blank">reduced</a> some manta populations by <a href="https://saveourseas.com/project-leader/lauren-peel/" target="_blank">80 percent</a>, and the IUCN Red List classifies both species as <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/195459/68632178" target="_blank">Vulnerable</a> and declining. Scientists are now trying to gather the basic information that could help the animals survive. In the process,&nbsp;they're learning that&nbsp;manta rays&nbsp;are more complex and fascinating than anyone imagined—bestowing their grace not just on humans lucky enough to swim with them, but on entire ecosystems.</p>
<blockquote>The mere fact that we share a planet with manta rays is its own grace.</blockquote>
<p>One way mantas shape marine environments is by traveling regularly between the deep ocean and coral reefs. Lauren Peel, a biologist with the Manta Trust and Save Our Seas Foundation, explains that in doing so, mantas move nutrients through the ocean. They eat a certain type of zooplankton that only lives offshore, for example, then return to coral reefs and defecate, depositing a suite of nutrients not otherwise available in the shallow seas.&nbsp;â€œTheyâ€™re essentially fertilizing coral reefs,â€� says Peel, who published a <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.190599" target="_blank">2019 study</a> on the discovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peel and her colleagues believe this fertilization may <a href="https://saveourseas.com/reef-manta-rays-may-promote-the-growth-of-coral-reefs-in-seychelles/" target="_blank">boost reef growth</a>, which not only leads to a greater biodiversity of corals and sponges but also supports the invertebrates, fish, mammals and reptiles that call reefs home. By analyzing tissue samples from 50 reef mantas and 20 different types of fish in the Seychelles, Peel also found that mantas are the only animals performing this essential fertilization. â€œOn top of being able to move such large distances and access different zooplankton sources, theyâ€™re consistently feeding, so theyâ€™re able to supply a larger amount of nutrients over a larger period of time over a larger spatial scale," Peel says.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>Still, the realization that protecting mantas benefits entire coral communities isnâ€™t enough to save the species. Unlike some other imperiled fish, mantas are not targeted by an organized fishery that will grudgingly adhere to conservation measures like bag limits. Instead, mantas are killed by small local fisheries, poachers who sell their gills for traditional Chinese medicine, and commercial fishermen who accidentally take mantas as bycatch. That means the best way to protect them might be through refuges where no fishing is allowed at all.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, keeping poachers out of vast, open marine protected areas (MPAs) is its own challenge. Thatâ€™s one reason why Andrzejaczek analyzed the movement of reef mantas in the British Indian Ocean Territory MPA. By showing where mantas hang out, <a href="https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v639/p137-153/" target="_blank">her data</a> are helping patrol boats better target their policing.</p>
<p>To create adequate marine refuges, scientists must also to figure out how far mantas roam. A <a href="https://mbr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41200-019-0173-6" target="_blank">2019 study</a> showed that one reef manta swam a whopping 714 miles—hundreds of miles farther than the previous known record. Andrzejaczek, on the other hand, found that all 33 tagged mantas in her study stayed within the <a href="http://www.mpatlas.org/mpa/sites/7707499/%252523:~:text=On%252525201st%25252520April%252525202010,%25252520the,unrivalled%25252520in%25252520scale%25252520and%25252520significance." target="_blank">200-mile span</a> of the British Indian Ocean Territory MPA. Perhaps, she theorizes, some reef mantas migrate long distances while others stay local to a particular reef.</p>
<p>Manta raysâ€™ charisma could play a role in saving them, too. After a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0065051" target="_blank">2013 study</a> showed that a live manta can bring $1 million in tourism revenue in over its lifetime, compared to $500 dead, <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/02/21/indonesia-hopes-cash-manta-ray-tourism.html" target="_blank">Indonesia joined</a> Australia, Ecuador, the European Union, Mexico, New Zealand, the Philippines, Yap, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Hawaii and Florida in banning manta ray fishing. The Manta Trust is also creating guidelines for sustainable manta ray tourism,&nbsp;like instructing divers to stay calm and let mantas guide the encounter.&nbsp;</p><p>â€œItâ€™s understandable that people get excited,â€� says Annie Murray, a marine biologist with the Manta Trust. â€œBut unfortunately that can lead to people swimming really fast, chasing the manta to try to get the best selfie, and thatâ€™s going to disturb them, especially when theyâ€™re feeding.â€�&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/oceans_aa7e40c628a36f3002fd99c31b2755ad.jpg" alt="Manta from below"><figcaption><span><strong>Manta from below </strong>No two mantas have the same pattern of underbelly spots, making these invaluable for identifying individuals. </span><br><span>Guy Stevens | Manta Trust</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Murray herself has swam with dozens of mantas, each with distinct personalities. Without prompting, she, Peel and Andrzejaczek each described the animalsâ€™ curiosity and intellect with an awe thatâ€™s rare among scientists.&nbsp;â€œWhen you swim with mantas, itâ€™s an interaction between the two of you,â€� says Murray. â€œThatâ€™s what got me in the beginning. But from a more scientific point of view, Iâ€™m fascinated not only by how they interact with humans, but with each other.â€�<br></p>
<p>Manta rays have the largest brain-to-body ratios of any fish; <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10164-016-0462-z" target="_blank">evidence suggests</a> they might also recognize themselves in mirrors, widely considered a hallmark of human-like self-awareness. She and others are studying how manta raysâ€™ clear intelligence manifests through social behaviors, and whether animals long considered solitary oceanic wanderers actually operate within social networks or hierarchies. While the social research is too new to draw conclusions from, itâ€™s within the realm of possibility that mantas form lifelong social bonds.</p>
<p>Indeed, the more we learn about mantas, the more it calls to mind another definition of grace—â€œthe&nbsp;free and unmerited favor of God, as manifested in the salvation of sinners and the bestowal of blessings.â€� The mere fact that we share a planet with manta rays is its own grace, a salve that can make even the most cynical scientist weep into her dive mask over the wonder that remains in this wild world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>1&nbsp;The mantas I swam with in&nbsp;Hawaii were reef mantas, which have a wingspan of up to 14 feet. Oceanic, or giant, mantas can be nearly 23 feet across.&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the last few years I’ve been developing predominantly on Apple
MacBooks. Recently I built myself a
<a href="https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/bestelkosten/2370528">new</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/borkdude/status/1280852700612177922">PC</a> with a fast
processor and lots of memory. I wanted to move some of my development tasks to
that machine. I still like the freedom that laptops give me to work from
wherever I want. Be it from the couch in my own home or from a random coffee
place in the city where I live, I just like to change environment every few
hours and not sit behind my desk all day long. I hadn’t used Windows as my
primary OS for almost 10 years. But since Windows 10 (still) comes with RDP,
which is better than VNC in terms of performance, and with WSL2, which offers a
“real” and well integrated linux experience, I was curious if I could create a
setup for remotely working on the new machine. It also would give me an
environment to debug Windows specific problems on, which should come in handy
for my side projects like <a href="https://github.com/borkdude/babashka">babashka</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo/">clj-kondo</a>. If it didn’t work out, I
could always go dual boot with Ubuntu as the primary dev OS and use VNC if I
needed to do anything graphical. For what it is worth, here is a report of
setup process I went through.</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The pristine smell and beauty of a new PC contrasted with the chaotic reality of my home. <a href="https://t.co/3zLIzYg4XB">pic.twitter.com/3zLIzYg4XB</a></p>— (λ. borkdude) (@borkdude) <a href="https://twitter.com/borkdude/status/1280852700612177922?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2020</a></blockquote>




<p>Because I had no other Windows machines in my home, I tried creating a USB
Windows installation drive in macOS based on
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-make-a-windows-10-usb-using-your-mac-build-a-bootable-iso-from-your-macs-terminal/">this</a>

Windows <a href="https://twitter.com/borkdude/status/1280943718363734016">would complain</a> with</p>

<blockquote><p>Windows installation encountered an unexpected error. Verify that the

<p>A good friend offered help and created an installation drive using
<a href="https://rufus.ie/">Rufus</a> on his Windows Home installation, which did work.</p>

<p>Once Windows was installed, I <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/remote-desktop-allow-access">enabled RDP</a> and installed
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">WSL2</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9n6svws3rx71">Ubuntu 20.04</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">Windows Terminal</a>
and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/">Docker Desktop for WSL2</a>.</p>

<p>To be able to run WSL2, I had to enable a virtualization option in my BIOS
first.</p>

<p>I intend to use Ubuntu WSL2 as my primary dev environment on this machine, so it
made sense to tweak the <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1456511/is-there-a-way-to-change-the-default-shell-in-windows-terminal">Terminal configuration</a>
to open Ubuntu by default, instead of PowerShell. I found it annoying that
Ubuntu in Terminal starts in the Windows home directory (<code>/mnt/c/Users/borkdude</code>), so I set <code>"startingDirectory":
"//wsl$/Ubuntu-20.04/home/borkdude"</code> in my Ubuntu profile.</p>

<p>I use zsh as my default shell on macOS and wanted that in WSL2 as well so I
installed that using <code>sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install zsh</code> followed by <code>chsh -s $(which
zsh)</code>. I also installed <a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh">ohmyzsh</a> and enabled the
only two plugins I use on a daily basis: <code>git</code> and <code>jump</code>.</p>

<p>Then I started porting the dev setup I use for work on my MacBook, mainly
consisting of Docker images, a couple of Clojure projects, knitted together with
some bash scripts. I use a couple of shell scripts to set all my development
environment variables and aliases for easily setting up ssh tunnels. These
worked after only making a few tweaks (for example, the ethernet card is called
differently in macOS and Ubuntu in WSL2). Of course I needed to install <code>git</code> to
clone my work projects. To run Clojure projects I installed OpenJDK version 8
and 11 via <code>apt</code>. I use <a href="https://blog.michielborkent.nl/2020/07/26/remote-wsl2-clojure/jenv.be">jenv</a> to manage Java versions on a project
basis, which worked perfectly:</p>

<figure><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span>
<span>2</span>
</pre></td><td><pre><code><span>sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
</span><span>jenv add /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64/
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>


<p>Also I installed <a href="https://boot-clj.com/">boot</a>, a Clojure build tool and the
<a href="https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli">Clojure CLI</a> which are all well
supported in linux.</p>

<p>Before running my work projects, I wanted to copy over a PostgreSQL database and
other data from my MacBook using <code>rsync</code>. Before I could do that, I needed to
enable <code>ssh</code> in Ubuntu. I found out I could do this by running <code>sudo service ssh
start</code> but I still could not log in from my MacBook. It turns out you also have
to forward and open up the port in the Windows Firewall. I found
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4150#issuecomment-504209723">this</a>
PowerShell script that lets you do that. As the comment suggests, I also created
a scheduled task that runs this script upon Windows login. I did the same thing
for running the <code>ssh</code> service using <code>wsl -u root sudo service ssh start</code>. Be
sure to select <code>Run using the highest privileges</code>. I’m sure there is a better
way to do this via <code>systemd</code> in WSL2, but this works for me. So now I could
<code>rsync</code> my the data from macOS to WSL2. I started the Docker containers, the
Clojure projects and it worked! We have a fairly I/O intensive process as part
of our stack, which seems to perform well in WSL2.</p>

<p>Enabling SSH in WSL also lets me use Emacs from my laptop and edit files on the
remote machine using <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TrampMode">tramp mode</a>. I
ran into one issue with this. Since I use a non-standard prompt in zsh, emacs
tramp could not parse the output from the remote shell. So I added this hack to
my <code>~/.zshrc</code>:</p>

<p>Emacs sets <code>TERM</code> to <code>"dumb"</code> when opening files using <code>tramp</code>. When this is the
case, I just invoke <code>bash</code> instead of continuing with <code>zsh</code>. There may be a
better solution, but this works.</p>

<p>Of course I also wanted to be able to run Emacs on the machine itself. I first
tried to run Emacs in Windows <a href="https://github.com/m-parashar/emax64">natively</a>,
but I read somewhere that editing WSL2 files directly from Windows is not
recommended. Also you might run into the line ending differences between Windows
and linux/macOS. I decided to play it safe and install emacs inside WSL2 using
<code>apt</code>. If you do decide to use the Windows-native Emacs and have trouble finding
where emacs expects configuration files, you can find this using <code>M-x
describe-variable user-init-file</code>. On my machine that was
<code>C:\Users\borkdude\AppData\Roaming\.config\emacs\init.el.</code>. To get a graphical
UI for the emacs started from WSL2, I needed to install an X-server on
Windows. There are plenty of free and open source solutions to choose from, but
I chose to buy
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/x410/9nlp712zmn9q?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">X410</a>
on sale for $9.99 instead of $49.99. It seems to be actively worked on and has
<a href="https://x410.dev/cookbook/wsl/using-x410-with-wsl2/">good documentation</a>. To
automatically start X410 on Windows startup I followed
<a href="https://x410.dev/cookbook/automatically-start-x410-on-login/">these</a>
instructions. When started, in the tray there is an X icon where you can modify
settings for X410. I have enabled Windowed Apps, Allow Public Access, DPI
Scaling (High Quality) and Shared Clipboard. To export the right <code>DISPLAY</code> value
for GUI applications in WSL2 I have this in my <code>.zshenv</code>:</p>

<figure><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span>
</pre></td><td><pre><code><span><span>export </span><span>DISPLAY</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>cat /etc/resolv.conf <span>|</span> grep nameserver <span>|</span> awk <span>'{print $2; exit;}'</span><span>)</span>:0.0
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>


<p>and then run emacs using <code>setsid emacs</code> from a zsh session (I created an alias
for this in my <code>.zshenv</code>).</p>

<p>I’m using the exact same emacs config I use on macOS, which is based on
<a href="https://twitter.com/bbatsov">@bbatsov</a>’s
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">prelude</a>. It looks and feels the same as on
macOS, although now I probably have to learn the “real” emacs keybindings for
copying (<code>M-w</code>) and pasting (<code>C-y</code>) instead of using the macOS keybindings,
which may be in fact a nice side effect of this experiment.</p>

<p>Even connecting to an nREPL server with <code>cider-connect</code> works seemlessly from my
laptop, provided that I forward and open up the port in Windows Firewall like
described above.</p>

<p>Some closing tips.</p>

<p>There is a known <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4166">issue</a> with
memory usage of WSL2. Since linux uses non-allocated memory for filesystem
caching, Windows thinks this memory is really used. As time goes by, Windows
could end up allocating all your system’s memory to WSL2. To put a limit to
this, I use this config in <code>C:\Users\borkdude\.wslconfig</code>:</p>

</span><span><span>memory</span><span>=</span>92GB
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>


<p>My PC has a whopping 128GB of memory so this still leaves 36GB of memory to
Windows.</p>

<p>As I will mainly use this PC for work, I turn it off at night and during the
weekends. To get back where I left, without restarting all my development
processes from scratch, I use the
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/920730/how-to-disable-and-re-enable-hibernation-on-a-computer-that-is-running">Hibernate</a>
setting.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> to set up a VPN between my laptop and
Windows machine so I can connect through RDP, emacs tramp and/or nREPL when I go
outside of my home.</p>

<p>For RDP I use <a href="https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12">Microsoft Remote Desktop.app</a>. Since I have a Retina screen, I enabled the “optimize for Retina displays” setting which gives a better resolution.</p>

<p>As a bonus I can re-use some licenses I already owned for apps I am using on
macOS: Beyond Compare and Acronis True Image.</p>

<p>I’m pleasantly surprised with WSL2, the Terminal app and Docker
integration. I’ve only been using this setup for week but so far so good.</p>

    <p>Last week, I talked about <a href="https://sketch.nono.ma/repetition-automation-organization-disconnection">repetition, automation, organization, and disconnection</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Ever since I started the podcast, I've had to prepare, manually, multiple texts in order to release each episode in various podcast providers—Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Overcast—on the Getting Simple website, and on the newsletter.</p>
<p>Each text was slightly different and editing them by hand wasn't pleasing. I've released dozens of episodes this way.</p>
<p>I've completed a round of code edits I've been working on over the past months to automate most of the tedious work required each time I publish a new episode, and released <a target="_blank" href="https://gettingsimple.com/podcast/latest">a new podcast page layout and audio player</a>.<sup id="fnref:work-or-walk-new-layout"><a href="#fn:work-or-walk-new-layout" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Behind the scenes, I have individual text boxes for each component of the episode notes, including the episode summary, description, links, credits, release date, duration, and more.</p>
<p>I can now create new episodes with ease and preview the content that will show up on podcast providers, the website, and the newsletter, with the satisfaction of having made it possible on my own instead of relying on other platforms.</p>
<hr>
<p>After more than thirty episodes, repetition removed friction from my podcast-releasing workflow. Yet I won't ever be faster than an automatic system that apart from freeing my time reduces potential human error.</p>
<p>The system I have in place makes my entire episode library highly organized, helping me focus on new content and reducing stress.</p>
<p>Altogether, automated systems such as this one can let us disconnect and reclaim time to be humans.</p>
<p>Whether you continue working or go for walk in the time you get back is on you.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>Join the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23981563">HN discussion</a>!</p></blockquote><p>Existing open source funding models don't work for small projects.</p><p>Big projects —&nbsp;think operating systems, frameworks, CMSs, or fully self-hostable applications — are in a privileged position to extract more value from their users, especially corporate ones. Since entire APIs and products are built on top of them, they inspire enough appreciation (or, more likely, fear of obsolescence!) to net a sustainable income from one-off or monthly donations.</p><p>But most OSS projects aren't big. The typical project on GitHub is better described as a <strong>utility</strong>. It's a small tool that does one thing really well. Over the course of building a complex application, you may end up using dozens of these utilities — and they'll save you hundreds of hours of development time. </p><p>Unfortunately, utilities like these rarely bring in a non-negligible amount of donations, no matter how widely used or beloved they are. Consider <a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router">react-router</a>. Even with 41.3k stars on GitHub, 3M weekly downloads from NPM, and nearly universal adoption in React-based single-page applications, it only brings in <a href="https://opencollective.com/react-router">~$17k</a> of donations annually. </p><p>The root of the problem is that open-source donations are made on a per-project basis. To support a project via GitHub Sponsors or OpenCollective, you must create <em>yet another</em> auto-renewing monthly subscription for <em>each and every</em> project you want to support. There's a major psychological cost associated with that. Moreover, at the moment of truth (<em>"I'm gonna sponsor X!"</em>) it's easy to "logic" yourself out of donating (<em>"But what if it gets replaced by some new hotness next week?!"</em>). In the end, only the projects that are massively, insanely, indisputably useful get funded. And those projects are usually the "big stuff" — frameworks, self-hostable software, etc. </p><p>A new model is needed; one that works for the small- and medium-sized projects, not just the huge ones. So I propose a novel(-ish) approach to OSS sustainability. </p><h2>Introducing "sponsor pools"</h2><ol><li>Every month, you donate some amount into a "wallet".</li><li>Your funds are then distributed to the projects in your "sponsor pool". Your sponsor pool is just the set of open-source projects you want to support. </li><li>Adding new projects to your pool should require <strong>one click</strong> —&nbsp;as easy as starring the repo on GitHub.</li></ol><p>That's it. It's hardly ingenious, which is why it's surprising that no major company or organization that has implemented it.</p> <p>This would achieve the holy grail of OSS sustainability: the one-click sponsorship. Once a person has funded their sponsorship pool, it would take <em>a single click</em> to financially support another project. <mark>The marginal cost — both psychological and financial — of supporting additional projects would drop to zero.</mark> That's a game changer.</p><h3>GitHub</h3><p>The best case scenario, in my opinion, is for GitHub to natively support this model as an extension of GitHub Sponsors. It's where the code lives (usually) so it is best positioned to create a zero-friction donation system like this.</p><p>Of course, if GitHub implemented something like this, they would likely divorce the donation mechanism from stars. Perhaps instead, users who have created and funded a sponsorship pool can be presented with an "Add to Pool" button in place of the current "Sponsor" button.</p><p><img alt="Add to pool button" src="https://vriad.com/add_to_pool.png"></p><p>GitHub has a financial incentive to switch to this approach — sort of. They're currently eating the cost of all processing fees for transactions on GitHub Sponsors. So if you sponsor a project at $1/mo, the maintainer gets $1/mo...and GitHub pays $0.30 to the credit card companies. Larger donation sizes means GitHub pays a proportionally smaller amount as fees.</p><p>Note that I said <em>proportionally smaller</em>. If more total donations are being processed (which is the goal of this proposal!), they may still end up paying more in total fees, even if the ratio of fees-to-donations is smaller. If the sponsorship pool concept is massively successful —&nbsp;say, cumulative donations of $1B annually — GitHub will be eating nearly $20M in card fees.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><header><small>Article - TypeScript - GraphQl<!-- --> · <!-- -->3 min read</small><h4>Autogenerate Typescript types and custom React hooks in React applications with GraphQL Code Generator.</h4><figure><img src="https://danilowoz.com/images/generating-typescript-types-and-react-hooks-based-on-graphql-endpoint/cover.jpg" alt="Generating TypeScript types and React Hooks based on GraphQL endpoint"><figcaption><small>Photo by Fred Jesus</small></figcaption></figure></header><p>Nowadays, developing ReactJS with TypeScript gives us a solid way to write applications: it adds the advantage of type-safety, component auto-documentation, error handling, and accurate autocomplete in the editor code. However, it still requires a considerable effort to write types and keep them maintainable. Moreover, when the data provider is a GraphQL server, it makes you feel like you're doing a useless job, given the server already has its own schemas for types. Seem redundant, right?</p><p>With this in mind, <a href="https://graphql-code-generator.com/">GraphQL Code Generator</a> gives us the ability to generate TypesScript typing out of GraphQL schemas. Beyond that, it gives us a couple of plugins to create custom React hooks that don't require any kind of maintenance or workaround to fit into your application.</p><p>Among many others, some of the benefits of using this tool:</p><ul><li><strong>Codeless:</strong> forget about creating the interfaces/types for every GraphQL endpoints; save time and spend effort on what matters;</li><li><strong>Development experience:</strong> as a result of having the types always available, your editor will provide meaningful autocomplete and error checking;</li><li><strong>Types always up-to-date:</strong> if your GraphQL endpoint schemas change, your application will be updated and typescript will help you make sure you make the necessary changes.</li></ul><h2>Setup</h2><p>First of all, let's install the dependencies needed:</p><pre><pre><p><span>npm i @apollo/react-hooks graphql</span></p></pre></pre><pre><pre><p><span>npm i @graphql-codegen/cli @graphql-codegen/import-types-preset @graphql-codegen/typescript @graphql-codegen/typescript-operations @graphql-codegen/typescript-react --save-dev</span></p></pre></pre><p>I'm considering the following folder structure, but of course, feel free to adapt it to your liking, just have in mind that it needs a place to store the schemas that will be fetched by the Code Generator:</p><pre><pre><p><span>📦 my-project</span></p><p><span>┣ 📂 src</span></p><p><span>┃ ┣ 📂 pages</span></p><p><span>┃ ┃ ┗ index.tsx</span></p><p><span>┃ ┣ 📂 queries</span></p><p><span>┃ ┃ ┣ 📂 autogenerate</span></p><p><span>┃ ┃ ┗ my-query.gql</span></p><p><span>┃ ┗ apollo-client.ts</span></p><p><span>┣ codegen.yml</span></p><p><span>┗ package.json</span></p></pre></pre><p>Then, basically, you'll need to create a configuration file at the root of the project, named <code>codegen.yml</code>. The following snippet shows how I usually set it up in my projects, where it generates different files for its own purpose, in other words, split by concerns like GraphQL operations and server schemas:</p><pre><pre><p><span></span><span>schema</span><span>:</span><span> https</span><span>:</span><span>//countries</span><span>-</span><span>274616.ew.r.appspot.com/graphql/</span></p><p><span></span><span>overwrite</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>hooks</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>afterAllFileWrite</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>-</span><span> prettier </span><span>-</span><span>-</span><span>write</span></p><p><span></span><span>generates</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>src/queries/autogenerate/schemas.tsx</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>documents</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'src/queries/**/**.gql'</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>plugins</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>-</span><span> typescript</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>src/queries/autogenerate/operations.tsx</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>documents</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'src/queries/**/**.gql'</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>preset</span><span>:</span><span> import</span><span>-</span><span>types</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>presetConfig</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>typesPath</span><span>:</span><span> ./schemas</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>plugins</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>-</span><span> typescript</span><span>-</span><span>operations</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>src/queries/autogenerate/hooks.tsx</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>documents</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'src/queries/**/**.gql'</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>preset</span><span>:</span><span> import</span><span>-</span><span>types</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>presetConfig</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>typesPath</span><span>:</span><span> ./operations</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>plugins</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>-</span><span> typescript</span><span>-</span><span>react</span><span>-</span><span>apollo</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>config</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>withHOC</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>withComponent</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>withHooks</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span></p></pre></pre><p>Also, let's add the scripts to generate the schemas and watch the files change in <code>package.json</code>:</p><pre><pre><p><span>"scripts"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  ...</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"schemas"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"graphql-codegen --config codegen.yml"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"schemas:watch"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"npm run schemas -- --watch"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>,</span></p></pre></pre><p>And as it turns out in the editor code:</p><img src="https://danilowoz.com/images/generating-typescript-types-and-react-hooks-based-on-graphql-endpoint/live-coding.gif" alt="Live coding" width="800" height="461"><p>This is only one of the possible ways to use it, as it has many plugins, presets, integrations, and configurations, for different purposes such as to generate React higher-order component, Gatsby integration, prettier and lint the files, among other cool things.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">                                   
                    <p>Flu (influenza) and pneumonia vaccinations are associated with reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease, according to new research reported at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference® (AAIC®) 2020.</p>

<p>Three research studies reported at AAIC 2020 suggest:</p>

<ul>
<li>At least one flu vaccination was associated with a 17% reduction in Alzheimer's incidence. </li>
<li>More frequent flu vaccination was associated
with another 13% reduction in Alzheimer's incidence.</li>
<li>Vaccination against pneumonia between ages 65 and 75 reduced Alzheimer's risk by up to 40% depending on individual genes.</li>
<li>Individuals with dementia have a higher risk of dying (6-fold) after infections than those without dementia (3-fold).</li>
</ul>

<p>"With the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines are at the forefront of public health discussions. It is important to explore their benefit in not only protecting against viral or bacterial infection but also improving long-term health outcomes," said Maria C. Carrillo, Ph.D., Alzheimer's Association chief science officer.</p>

<p>"It may turn out to be as simple as if you're taking care of your health in this way — getting vaccinated — you're also taking care of yourself in other ways, and these things add up to lower risk of Alzheimer's and other dementias," Carrillo said. "This research, while early, calls for further studies in large, diverse clinical trials to inform whether vaccinations as a public health strategy decrease our risk for developing dementia as we age."</p>

<h2>Seasonal Flu Vaccine May Reduce Incidence of Alzheimer's Dementia</h2>

<p>Previous research has suggested vaccinations may have a protective factor against cognitive decline, but there have been no large, comprehensive studies focused on the influenza (flu) vaccine and Alzheimer's disease risk, specifically. To address this gap, Albert Amran, a medical student at McGovern Medical School at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, and team, investigated a large American health record dataset (n=9,066).</p>

<p>Amran and team found having one flu vaccination was associated with a lower prevalence of Alzheimer's (odds ratio 0.83, p&lt;0.0001), and among vaccinated patients receiving the flu vaccine more frequently was associated with an even lower prevalence of Alzheimer's (odds ratio 0.87, p=0.0342). Thus, people that consistently got their annual flu shot had a lower risk of Alzheimer's. This translated to an almost 6% reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease for patients between the ages of 75-84 for 16 years.</p>

<p>The researchers found the protective association between the flu vaccine and the risk of Alzheimer's was strongest for those who received their first vaccine at a younger age — for example, the people who received their first documented flu shot at age 60 benefited more than those who received their first flu shot at age 70.</p>

<p>"Our study suggests that regular use of a very accessible and relatively cheap intervention — the flu shot — may significantly reduce risk of Alzheimer's dementia," Amran said. "More research is needed to explore the biological mechanism for this effect — why and how it works in the body — which is important as we explore effective preventive therapies for Alzheimer's."</p>

<h2>Pneumonia Vaccine May Reduce Alzheimer's Risk later in life.</h2><p>
 Repurposing of existing vaccines may be a promising approach to Alzheimer's disease prevention. Svetlana Ukraintseva, Ph.D., Associate Research Professor in the Biodemography of Aging Research Unit (BARU) at Duke University Social Science Research Institute, and team, investigated associations between pneumococcal vaccination, with and without an accompanying seasonal flu shot, and the risk of Alzheimer's disease among 5,146 participants age 65+ from the Cardiovascular Health Study. The team also took into account a known genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's — the rs2075650 G allele in the TOMM40 gene.</p>

<p>The researchers found that pneumococcal vaccination between ages 65-75 reduced risk of developing Alzheimer's by 25-30% after adjusting for sex, race, birth cohort, education, smoking, and number of G alleles. The largest reduction in the risk of Alzheimer's (up to 40%) was observed among people vaccinated against pneumonia who were non-carriers of the risk gene. Total number of vaccinations against pneumonia and the flu between ages 65 and 75 was also associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer's; however, the effect was not evident for the flu shot alone.</p>

<p>"Vaccinations against pneumonia before age 75 may reduce Alzheimer's risk later in life, depending on individual genotype," Ukraintseva said. "These data suggest that pneumococcal vaccine may be a promising candidate for personalized Alzheimer's prevention, particularly in non-carriers of certain risk genes."</p>

<h2>Infection Substantially Increases Mortality in People with Dementia</h2>

<p>People living with dementia commonly experience other health conditions including viral, bacterial, and other infections. There is a growing trend in research to investigate whether infections might be worsening, more life-threatening or possibly causing dementia.</p>

<p>Janet Janbek, a Ph.D. student at the Danish Dementia Research Centre, Rigshospitalet and the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, and team, used data from national health registries to investigate mortality in Danish residents over age 65 (n=1,496,436) who had visited the hospital with an infection. They found that people with both dementia and such hospital visits died at a 6.5 times higher rate compared with people who had neither. Study participants with either dementia alone or infection-related contacts alone had a threefold increased rate. The rate of mortality was highest within the first 30 days following the hospital visit.</p>

<p>The researchers also found that for people living with dementia the mortality rates remained elevated for 10 years after the initial infection-related hospital visit, and mortality rates from all infections (including major infections like sepsis to minor ear infections) were higher compared with people without dementia or without an infection-related hospital visit.</p>

<p>"Our study supports the need to investigate these relations even further; to find out why infections are linked to higher mortality in people with dementia, specifically which risk factors and biological mechanisms are involved. This will help advance our understanding of the role of infections in dementia," said Janbek.</p>

<p>"Our study suggests that the health care system — as well as relatives of people with dementia — should have increased awareness of people with dementia who get infections, so they get the medical care they need. People with dementia require more specialized treatment even when their hospital visits are not directly due to their dementia but to what might appear to be an unrelated infection," Janbek added.</p>

<p>I enjoy game development as a hobby on the side. I also enjoy working with container schedulers like Kubernetes. Over the weekend I decided to create a Kubernetes game, combining those two thoughts.</p>



<p>In the game you enter and explore nodes in your cluster, and can destroy your very own live, running pods. Hide prod away!</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The game is put together using my engine of choice, Unity. With Unity you code using C#.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/kube-nodes-arm-from-pi-k8s-cluster-in-game-644x387.jpg" alt="3 x Nodes represented in-game from my Raspberry Pi Kubernetes cluster." srcset="https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/kube-nodes-arm-from-pi-k8s-cluster-in-game-644x387.jpg 644w, https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/kube-nodes-arm-from-pi-k8s-cluster-in-game-300x180.jpg 300w, https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/kube-nodes-arm-from-pi-k8s-cluster-in-game-768x461.jpg 768w, https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/kube-nodes-arm-from-pi-k8s-cluster-in-game.jpg 1073w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"><figcaption>3 x Nodes represented in-game from my Raspberry Pi Kubernetes cluster. Can you spot the naming convention from one of my favourite movies?</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Game Logic</h2>



<p>The game logic was simple to put together. I have a couple of modular systems I’ve already developed (and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="actually sell (opens in a new tab)" href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/2d-shooter-bullet-and-weapon-system-19922" target="_blank">actually sell</a> on the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Unity Asset Store (opens in a new tab)" href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/2d-neon-grids-171218" target="_blank">Unity Asset Store</a>), so those made the movement and shooting logic, as well as background grid effects a breeze.</p>



<p>Movement is implemented in a simple ‘twin-stick’ controller <strong>Script </strong>(a Unity concept, which is a class implementing <code>Monobehaviour</code>).</p>



<p>Other game logic is mostly contained in the bullet pattern module. I have some more Scripts that arrange and control the Kubernetes entities as well as their labels.</p>



<p>The interaction with Kubernetes itself is fairly hacked together. I wanted to put the game together as quickly as possible as I only worked on it over a couple of weekend evenings.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/csharp-kubemanager-singleton.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/csharp-kubemanager-singleton-300x262.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/csharp-kubemanager-singleton-300x262.jpg 300w, https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/csharp-kubemanager-singleton.jpg 631w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a><figcaption>Let the hacky code flow…</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Unity is a bit behind in .NET Framework version support and .NET Core was out of the question. This meant using the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Kubernetes csharp client (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/kubernetes-client/csharp" target="_blank">Kubernetes csharp client</a> was not going to happen easily (directly in Unity that is). It would have been my first choice otherwise.</p>



<p>With that in mind, I skipped over to a hacky solution of invocating the kubectl client directly from within the game.</p>



<p>The game code executes <code>kubectl</code>commands on threads separate to the main game loop and returns the results formatted accordingly, back to the game’s main thread. I used <code>System.Diagnostics.Process</code> for this.</p>



<p>From there, game entities are instantiated and populated with info and labels. (E.g. the nodes and the pods).</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/kube-pods-spawned-644x479.jpg" alt="pods spawned in the game, bouncing around" srcset="https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/kube-pods-spawned-644x479.jpg 644w, https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/kube-pods-spawned-300x223.jpg 300w, https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/kube-pods-spawned-768x572.jpg 768w, https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/kube-pods-spawned.jpg 1041w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></figure>



<h3>Pods have health</h3>



<p>Pods are given health (hit points) and they simply bounce around after spawning in. You can chase after and shoot them, at which point a <code>kubectl destroy pod</code> command is actually sent to the Kube API via kubectl!</p>



<h2>The game world</h2>



<p>You enter the world in a ‘node’ view, where you can see all of your cluster’s nodes. From there you can approach nodes to have them slide open a ‘door’. Entering the door transports you ‘into’ the node, where you can start destroying pods at will.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mniUTN5.gif" alt="gif animation of player entering a node"></figure></div>



<p>For obvious reasons I limit the pods that are destroyable to a special ‘demo’ namespace.</p>



<h2>Putting together the demo pods</h2>



<p>I use a great little tool called <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="arkade (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/alexellis/arkade" target="_blank">arkade</a> in my Kubernetes Pi cluster.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/arkade-logo-sm-300x300.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/arkade-logo-sm-300x300.png 300w, https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/arkade-logo-sm-150x150.png 150w, https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/arkade-logo-sm.png 544w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"><figcaption>arkade makes it really simple to install apps into your cluster. Great for quick POCs and demos.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Arkade offers a small library of useful and well thought out apps that are simple to install. The CLI provides strongly-typed flags to install these apps (or any helm charts) in short, one-line operations.</p>



<p>It also handles the logic around figuring out which platform you’re running on, and pulling down the correct images for that platform (if supported). Super useful when you’re on ARM as you are with the Raspberry Pi.</p>



<p>Straight from the <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/arkade#get-arkade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="GitHub page (opens in a new tab)">GitHub page</a>, this is how simple it is to setup:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="shell" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group=""># Note: you can also run without `sudo` and move the binary yourself
curl -sLS https://dl.get-arkade.dev | sudo sh

arkade --help
ark --help  # a handy alias

# Windows users with Git Bash
curl -sLS https://dl.get-arkade.dev | sh</pre>



<p>I then went about installing a bunch of apps and charts with arkade. For example:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="shell" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">arkade install loki --namespace demo</pre>



<h2>Hooking the game up to my Kube Cluster</h2>



<p>With the demo namespace complete, and the application pods running, I needed to get my Windows machine running the game talking to my Pi Cluster (on another local network).</p>



<p>I have a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Pi 'router' (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.shogan.co.uk/kubernetes/building-a-raspberry-pi-kubernetes-cluster-part-1-routing/" target="_blank">Pi ‘router’</a> setup that is perfectly positioned for this. All that is required is to run a kube proxy on this, listening on 0.0.0.0 and accepting all hosts.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="shell" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">kubectl proxy --address='0.0.0.0' --port=8001 --accept-hosts='.*'</pre>



<p>I setup a local kube config pointing to the router’s local IP address on the interface facing my Windows machine’s network, and switched context to that configuration.</p>



<p>From there, the game’s kubectl commands get sent to this context and traverse the proxy to hit the kube API. </p>



<p>Destroying pods sure does exercise those <strong>ReplicaSets</strong>!</p>

            <p>You can try it out for yourself using this link <a href="https://sudoku.cmgresearch.com/">https://sudoku.cmgresearch.com</a> - just hold a Sudoku puzzle up to your WebCam. Or try it on your mobile phone - it should work pretty well in a mobile browser.</p>

<p>A long time ago I wrote an app for the iPhone that let you take a grab a sudoku puzzle using your iPhone’s camera.</p>

<p>Recently, when I was investigating my <a href="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/2020/06/05/self-organising-ws2811-leds.html">self organising Christmas lights project</a> I realised that the browser APIs and ecosystem had advanced to the point that it was probably possible to recreate the system running purely in the browser.</p>

<p>As you can see it works pretty well:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cOC-ad0BsY0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>As always, all the code is on GitHub for you to try out for yourself: <a href="https://github.com/atomic14/ar-browser-sudoku">https://github.com/atomic14/ar-browser-sudoku</a></p>

<p>It’s good to start with a simple definition of the problem we are trying to solve:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given an image identify and extract the Sudoku puzzle, recognise the numbers in each cell, solve the puzzle, render the results on top of the original image.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/1-puzzle.jpg" alt="Puzzle Image"></p>

<p>As a classically trained image processing guy, my first port of call is to remove redundant information.</p>

<p>We don’t care about colours, so we’ll convert the image to greyscale. As you can see we’ve not lost any useful information.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/2-greyscale.jpg" alt="Greyscale Image"></p>

<p>Looking at the image, we only ready care about paper and ink, so it makes sense to binarise the image and make black or white.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/3-thresholded.png" alt="Thresholded Image"></p>

<p>Next, we need to identify the blob that is the puzzle. Once we’ve got that we can extract the image of the puzzle and extract the contents of each box of the puzzle.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/4-located.jpg" alt="Thresholded Image"></p>

<p>Apply some OCR to the contents of each box, solve the puzzle and our job is done.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/6-solved.png" alt="Solved Puzzle"></p>

<p>It’s a pretty straightforward image processing pipeline!</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/7-pipeline.jpg" alt="Pipeline"></p>

<p>Let’s dive into each of these steps in turn and see how they work.</p>



<p>We’re taking a feed from the camera on the device. This comes into us as an RGB image. We’re not really interested in colour as we’re working with printed puzzles which will typically by printed in black and white.</p>

<p>So our first step is to convert from RGB to greyscale.</p>

<p>If we look at the standard formula for this we get this fomula <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayscale">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayscale</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Y = 0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What’s interesting about this is that a large portion of the value is coming from the green channel. So we can apply a little shortcut to our RGB to greyscale conversion and just take the green channel of the image.</p>



<p>We’re going to use morphological operations for locating the puzzle - typically these work on black and white binary images, so our next step is binarise our image.</p>

<p>This involves applying a threshold to seperate out foreground from background pixels.</p>

<p>Trying to apply a global threshold to the image can result in very poor results - especially when lighting conditions are not good.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/8-global-threshold.jpg" alt="Global Threshold"></p>

<p>However, if we look at a small section of the image we can see from the histogram that we do have an obvious collection of ink pixels and paper pixels.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/9-local-threshold-hist.jpg" alt="Local Area Histogram"></p>

<p>What we want to do is examine each pixel in the context of its surrounding area.</p>

<p>A simple way to do this is to apply a blur to the image and then compare the original image with this blurred image.</p>

<p>Doing this gives us a very clean segmented image even when lighting conditions are not ideal</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/A-local-thresholded.jpg" alt="Local Threshold"></p>



<p>We’ve now got a fairly clean image that contains our puzzle along with a bunch of random other printed elements. Typically you’d jump straight in here with something like a hough transform to detect lines. However we can be a bit smarter about what we are doing and take a bit of a shortcut.</p>

<p>We know that whoever is taking the picture should be pointing the camera at a puzzle. So we can assume that the puzzle would be the largest object in the image and also have the most number of pixels. We can also apply other heuristics such as aspect ratio to filter out elements that probably aren’t a puzlle.</p>

<p>If we scan the image pulling out all connected components the connected component that contains the puzzle should be the one with the most points.</p>

<p>Doing this lets us isolate the puzzle grid.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/B-located.png" alt="Located Puzzle"></p>



<p>With the puzzle grid identified we now need to identify the four corners of the puzzle. Once again we can apply a fairly simple heuristic to this problem. The pixels that are in the four corners should have the smallest manhatten distance from the corners of the max extents of the extracted component.</p>

<p>Runing this algorithm for all four extents of our located puzzle gives us the four corners.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/D-corners.png" alt="Puzzle Corners"></p>



<p>We know where the puzzle is in our image. We have the location of the four corner points.</p>

<p>To extract the puzzle image we formulate our problem into one of a homographic transform.</p>

<p>We want to map from the camera image of the puzzle to an ideal image of the puzzle that is not distorted by perpective or rotations.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/E-homography.png" alt="Mapping from flat image to camera image"></p>

<p>We do this by computing a homography between the two planes. The formula shown can be transformed into this - as you can see we need four points - this maps nicely onto the corner points that we’ve already located.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/E-homography2.png" alt="Calculating the homography"></p>

<p>If we rewrite the matrices algebraically we can find h using this algorithm.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/E-homography3.png" alt="Calculating the homography"></p>

<p>You can find more details on how to do this here - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150316191717/http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~cwren/interpolator/">https://web.archive.org/web/20150316191717/http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~cwren/interpolator/</a></p>

<p>Now that we have the homography between our ideal image and the camera image we can map pixels between images.</p>

<p>This gives us a nice square puzzle image from the camera image.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/F-extracted.jpg" alt="Extracted Puzzle"></p>



<p>Once we’ve got the square puzzle image we need to extract the contents of each individual cell. We can use the thresholded version of the image for this.</p>

<p>Looking at each box in turn we extract the bounds of any connected region starting from the center of each cell. We can then use this bounds to extract an image from the square greyscale image.</p>

<p>If there is no connected region in the center of the cell then we know that it is empty.</p>

<p>We now have an image for each populated cell of the puzzle.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/G-boxes.jpg" alt="Extracted Puzzle"></p>



<p>We’re going to use a neural network to perform OCR on each image. I’m going to use TensorFlow to train the network and then TensorFlow js to run the network in the browser.</p>

<p>Our neural network is going to be trained to recognise the digits 1 through 9.</p>

<p>I’ve synthesized a large number of training examples from a wide selection of fonts rendering a greyscale image of each digit.</p>

<p>I’ve added a small amount of blur and some Gaussian noise to each image. Hopefully this will provide a reasonable representation of what we will be getting in a live environment.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/H-training.jpg" alt="Training"></p>

<p>I’ve also sparated out 10% of the images into a testing data set that we can use to evaluate how well our network performs.</p>

<h2 id="training">Training</h2>

<p>I’m using an interactive Jupyter notebook to train the network - this is available in the GitHub repository. You’ll also find more information on the training in the YouTube video.</p>

<p>I perform some image normalisation and resize the input images to 20 by 20 pixels - we need to remember to also do this in the javascript code so that it matches.</p>

<p>I’m also augmenting our training data to help the network generalise. This will add some random mutations to our input data set.</p>

<p>Running the training we can see that we have pretty good accuracy on both training and validation.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/H-training.jpg" alt="Training Accuracy"></p>

<p>Looking at the confusion matrix we can see that “1”s and “7”s are currently getting confused.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/H-training3.png" alt="Training Accuracy"></p>

<p>Looking at the failed images I’m pretty happy with the performance. I think the fonts that it is failing on would not be used in the real world so I’m happy to ignore these failures.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/H-training5.png" alt="Training Accuracy"></p>

<p>As I’m happy with the neural network structure I’m going to train it on all the data and use the resulting network in my production code.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/H-training6.png" alt="Training Accuracy"></p>



<p>We can solve a sudoku puzzle using Donald Knuth’s application of Dancing Links to his Algorithm X for solving the exact cover problem.</p>

<p>Dancing links uses the seemingly very simple realisation that we can remove and put back nodes from a doubly linked list.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/I-DLX1.png" alt="Dancing Links"></p>

<p>We can see that when we remove node B from the list it still has pointers back to the nodes that used to link to it.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/I-DLX2.png" alt="Dancing Links"></p>

<p>This means that node B contains all the information required to add it back into the list.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/I-DLX3.png" alt="Dancing Links"></p>

<p>I go into more detail in the video around Algorithm X and you can find a good description in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X">WikiPedia artical</a>.</p>

<p>Dancing links solves the problem of backtracking in an efficient way.</p>

<p>We can encode the sparse matrix used by Algorithm X as a doubly linked circular list going left and right for the rows and up and down for the columns.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/I-DLX4.png" alt="Dancing Links"></p>

<p>Since these are now linked lists we can use fact that we can efficiently remove and re-add elements to perform the column and row removals and to backtrack if needed.</p>

<p>We can take advantage of this algorithm by recoding our sudoku puzzle as an exact coverage problem. Translating a puzzle into a set of constraints gives us a sparse matrix of 729 rows by 324 columns.</p>

<p>Here’s what a sudoku puzzle looks like when turned into a set of constraints.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/I-DLX5.png" alt="Dancing Links"></p>



<p>To render our results we could draw our text into a square image and then project each pixel onto the image coming from the camera. This would be quite computationally intensive.</p>

<p>Alternatively for each puzzle cell we could take an imaginary line through the center of each cell. We can then project that using our homographic transform and use this project line to calculate an approximate height and angle for the cell.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/J-rendering.png" alt="Approximate Digit Angle And Size"></p>

<p>We then simply draw the text at the projected location of the cell with the calculated height and angle.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/J-rendering2.jpg" alt="Rendered Solution"></p>

<p>Checkout the video to see how well it works along with a lot more detail of all these steps:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
        

        <p><em>But why?</em> you are wondering. You must be given some context: this is an experiment <a href="https://github.com/franciscop/create-static-web">inside another experiment I'm doing</a> to learn about Static Site Generators. PHP is the first language I knew well and I wanted to test whether it's a horrible or just a bad idea to use it for templates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you come from Google trying to find how to run PHP inside Javascript, you are very likely lost. Beware, this article is only for experts! <a title="the '/s' stands for 'sarcasm'" href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=%2Fs">/s</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since a large motivator for my site generator is to rely purely on Node.js and <em>not</em> to have to install Ruby, I also don't want to install PHP! But can you run PHP inside Javascript? I only need the most basic PHP features: variables, echo, loops.</p>
<p>The sarcastic language of this article might be deceiving, but there is <strong><a href="#demo">a working demo below</a></strong>.</p>
<h2 id="initial-objective">Initial objective</h2>
<p>The idea came when I was making FrontMatter work properly for the current file. It is also related to my general dissatisfaction with the Node.js template engines, but that a topic for another day:</p>
<pre><code>---
title: Running PHP in Javascript
---
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;{{title}}&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;meta content="{{title}}" property="og:title" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;</code></pre>
<p>It reminded me quite a bit to what can be achieved with raw PHP:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;? $title = "Running PHP in Javascript"; ?&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;&lt;?= $title ?&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;meta content="&lt;?= $title ?&gt;" property="og:title" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;</code></pre>
<h2 id="googling-around">Googling around</h2>
<p>Google just led me to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=run+php+inside+javascript">780 StackOverflow questions</a> with <code>-1</code> average score. After reading some, I believe the average score should be more like <code>-5</code>. I also learned that devs are trying to do:</p>
<pre><code>alert("&lt;?= "Hello world" ?&gt;");</code></pre>
<p>As an astute reader might notice, that is supposed to run first through the PHP server, <em>then</em> sent to the browser and finally run the resulting <code>alert("Hello world")</code> on the client. But this level of sophistication is too high, I just want to run raw PHP on the browser! I want something like this:</p>
<pre><code>// No server needed, "just" Javascript parsing PHP
alert(php(`&lt;?= "Hello world" ?&gt;`));</code></pre>
<p>But not even <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/atwoodslaw/search?q=php">Reddit's "PHP" search</a> in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/atwoodslaw/"> <code>r/atwoodslaw</code></a> could find what I seek.</p>
<h2 id="promising-finds">Promising finds</h2>
<p>After getting lucky with a <em>"PHP parser Javascript"</em> search, I end up finding the package <a href="https://github.com/glayzzle/php-parser"><code>php-parser</code> in Github/npm</a>. The problem is that the output is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree"><em>Abstract Syntax Tree</em></a>. I just wanted to run the code, not whatever an abstract tree seems to be:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/abstract-architecture-art-artistic-262577/"><img src="https://francisco.io/blog/running-php-in-javascript/abstract-tree.q50.jpg" alt="An abstract tree somehow"></a></p>
<p>Since you are reading this it means that in the <a href="https://github.com/glayzzle/php-parser#related-projects"><em>Related Projects</em></a> category I found my next clue. I head to the website with the <span title="I know, it's a tanuki ;)">funny looking cat</span>: <a href="https://gitlab.com/kornelski/babel-preset-php"><code>babel-preset-php</code></a>. It transpiles PHP into Javascript 🎉</p>
<p>Since babel is in total chaos with the whole <code>babel-loader</code> vs <code>@babel/loader</code> and no one knows which one is which (ironic, innit?), I give up and take a break. I do practice <a href="https://core.cards/">my Kanjis</a>, speak with my family in Spanish and think about the English title for this article.</p>
<h2 id="building-up-the-library">Building up the library</h2>
<p>Fresh again, I scavenge the library <code>babel-preset-php</code> for my project. I am now using:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>php-parser</code> to transform the PHP into the Abstract Tree thing.</li>
<li><code>babel-preset-php</code> ravaged files to do something that I have no idea what it is but it's the only way to keep it working.</li>
<li><code>@babel/generator</code> to finally generate the Javascript from the previous step.</li>
<li>A bit of Javascript. I use the fancier <code>new Function()</code> to pretend it's better than <code>eval()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wasn't going to show you, but since my code is so tiny thanks to those great libraries I can just paste it here for your satisfaction:</p>
<pre><code>import parser from 'php-parser';
import translator from './translator';
import generator from '@babel/generator';

const run = (code, opts) =&gt; {
  // Make a closure so that `out` doesn't collide with the PHP variables:
  let out = '';
  // Define `echo` since it's used in the transpiled JS code for some reason
  opts.echo = opts.echo || (str =&gt; out += str);
  // Pretend this is safe. Pro tip: IT IS NOT SAFE
  new Function(...Object.keys(opts), code)(...Object.values(opts));
  return out;
}

export default function (src, opts = {}) {
  const ast = new parser().parseCode(src);
  const file = translator.translateProgram(ast);
  const code = generator(file).code;
  return run(code, opts);
};</code></pre>
<p>Later on I will export some individual parts for better testing, but that is really all there is to it.</p>
<h2 id="demo">Demo</h2>
<p>The long-awaited demo! Turn your internet off, hide your kids and say your prayers. I already loaded <a href="https://francisco.io/blog/running-php-in-javascript/php.min.js">the <code>php()</code> function</a> for you, but are you <em>ready</em> to run it?</p>

<form id="horrible">


</form>


<p>Tips to make the demo better for <a href="https://documentation.agency/">lack of documentation</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals">backticks</a> as the first argument of <code>php()</code> to allow for any quote type and multi line.</li>
<li>Provide a second argument as a plain object like <code>{ hello: 'world' }</code> to define the variable <code>$hello</code> with the value <code>"world"</code> inside the PHP code.</li>
<li>If you want to run it with express use <code>{ _GET: req.query, _POST: req.body }</code> as the second argument (do <em>not</em> do it, specially on a live server).</li>
<li>You could pass <code>window</code> as the second argument as well if you prefer PHP instead of Javascript. Heck, you could make a tool that finds and runs all <code>&lt;script src="ohmy.php"  type="application/php"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>I am running <code>eval()</code> against your code. The php() function is basically running <code>eval()</code> internally. Do I get a "Go to Jail card" for basically doing <code>eval(eval(...))</code>?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="closures">Closures</h2>
<p>Yup, this sucks. Use it just as an example of things that should never happen. If you <em>really, really</em> need to use this, and want more features, feel free to throw me loads of money and I might consider talking you out of it or contacting the relevant health authorities.</p>
<p>Now that we have reached this point and seeing how many languages have AST generators, I ponder: can <em>any</em> language be transpiled to Javascript? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY-pUxKQMUE">Should we do it?</a> Webassembly is going to eat JS so we might just give it a try!</p>
<p>If you hate PHP, or Javascript, and you <em>really</em> want to let me and others know<a title="You want to feel like you belong, but spreading hate on PHP won't change the fact that no one really likes you...">*</a> feel free to comment on Hacker News:</p>

            <p>So <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13777">CVE-2020-13777</a> came out while I wasn't looking last week. The
GnuTLS advisory (<a href="https://gnutls.org/security-new.html#GNUTLS-SA-2020-06-03">GNUTLS-SA-2020-06-03</a>) is pretty opaque so I'll
refer instead to <a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile/status/1270061316368224256">this tweet</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile">@FiloSottile</a> (Go team
security lead):</p>

<blockquote><p>PSA: don't rely on GnuTLS, please.</p>

<p><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13777">CVE-2020-13777</a> Whoops, for the past 10 releases most TLS 1.0–1.2
connection could be passively decrypted and most TLS 1.3 connections
intercepted. Trivially.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="https://blog.filippo.io/we-need-to-talk-about-session-tickets/">TLS 1.2–1.0 session tickets are awful</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>You are reading this correctly: supposedly encrypted TLS connections
made with affected GnuTLS releases are vulnerable to <em>passive</em>
cleartext recovery attack (and active for 1.3, but who uses that
anyways). That is extremely bad. It's pretty close to just switching
everyone to HTTP instead of HTTPS, more or less. I would have a lot
more to say about the security of GnuTLS in particular -- and security
in general -- but I am mostly concerned about patching holes in the
roof right now, so this article is not about that.</p>

<p>This article is about figuring out what, exactly, was exposed in our
infrastructure because of this.</p>






<p>Assuming you're running Debian, this will show a list of packages that
<code>Depends</code> on GnuTLS:</p>

<pre><code>apt-cache --installed rdepends libgnutls30 | grep '^ ' | sort -u
</code></pre>

<p>This assumes you run this only on hosts running Buster or
above. Otherwise you'll need to figure out a way to pick machines
running GnuTLS 3.6.4 or later.</p>

<p>Note that this list only <em>first level</em> dependencies! It is perfectly
possible that another package uses GnuTLS without being listed
here. For example, in the above list I have <code>libcurl3-gnutls</code>, so the
be really thorough, I would actually need to recurse down the
dependency tree.</p>

<p>On my desktop, this shows an "interesting" list of targets:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>apt</code></li>
<li><code>cadaver</code> - AKA WebDAV</li>
<li><code>curl</code> &amp; <code>wget</code></li>
<li><code>fwupd</code> - another attack on top of <a href="https://github.com/justinsteven/advisories/blob/master/2020_fwupd_dangling_s3_bucket_and_CVE-2020-10759_signature_verification_bypass.md">this one</a></li>
<li><code>git</code> (through the <code>libcurl3-gnutls</code> dependency)</li>
<li><code>mutt</code> - all your emails</li>
<li><code>weechat</code> - your precious private chats</li>
</ul>


<p>Arguably, fetchers like <code>apt</code>, <code>curl</code>, <code>fwupd</code>, and <code>wget</code> rely on HTTPS for
"authentication" more than secrecy, although <code>apt</code> has its own
OpenPGP-based authentication so that wouldn't matter anyways. Still,
this is truly distressing. And I haven't mentioned here things like
<code>gobby</code>, <code>network-manager</code>, <code>systemd</code>, and others - the scope of this is
broad. Hell, even good old <code>lynx</code> links against GnuTLS.</p>

<p>In our infrastructure, the magic command looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>cumin -o txt -p 0  'F:lsbdistcodename=buster' "apt-cache --installed rdepends libgnutls30 | grep '^ ' | sort -u" | tee gnutls-rdepds-per-host | awk '{print $NF}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
</code></pre>

<p>There, the result is even more worrisome, as those important packages seem to rely on GnuTLS for their transport security:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>mariadb</code> - all MySQL traffic and passwords</li>
<li><code>mandos</code> - full disk encryption</li>
<li><code>slapd</code> - LDAP passwords</li>
</ul>


<p><code>mandos</code> is especially distressing although it's probably not
vulnerable because it seems it doesn't store the cleartext -- it's
encrypted with the client's OpenPGP public key -- so the TLS tunnel
never sees the cleartext either.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jedisct1/status/1270078914996682753">Other reports</a> have also mentioned the following servers link
against GnuTLS and could be vulnerable:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>exim</code></li>
<li><code>rsyslog</code></li>
<li><code>samba</code></li>
<li>various <code>VNC</code> implementations</li>
</ul>




<p>Those programs are not affected by this vulnerability:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>apache2</code></li>
<li><code>gnupg</code></li>
<li><code>python</code></li>
<li><code>nginx</code></li>
<li><code>openssh</code></li>
</ul>


<p>This list is not exhaustive, naturally, but serves as an example of
common software you don't need to worry about.</p>

<p>The vulnerability only exists in GnuTLS, as far as we know, so
programs linking against other libraries are not vulnerable.</p>

<p>Because the vulnerability affects session tickets -- and those are set
on the server side of the TLS connection -- only users of GnuTLS as a
server are vulnerable. This means, for example, that while <code>weechat</code>
uses GnuTLS, it will only suffer from the problem when acting as a
server (which it does, in relay mode) or, of course, if the remote IRC
server also uses GnuTLS. Same with apt, curl, wget, or git: it is
unlikely to be a problem because it is only used as a client; the
remote server is usually a webserver -- not git itself -- when using
TLS.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that it's not because a package links against GnuTLS that
it <em>uses</em> it. For example, I have been told that, on Arch Linux, if
both GnuTLS and OpenSSL are available, the <code>mutt</code> package will use the
latter, so it's not affected. I haven't confirmed that myself nor have I
checked on Debian.</p>

<p>Also, because it relies on session tickets, there's a time window
after which the ticket gets cycled and properly initialized. But that
is <a href="https://twitter.com/__agwa/status/1270054740559384576">apparently 6 hours by default</a> so it is going to protect only
really long-lasting TLS sessions, which are uncommon, I would argue.</p>

<p>My audit is limited. For example, it might have been better to walk
the shared library dependencies directly, instead of relying on Debian
package dependencies.</p>



<p>It seems the vulnerability might have been introduced in <a href="https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/merge_requests/695">this merge
request</a>, itself following a (entirely reasonable) <a href="https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/issues/184">feature request
to make it easier to rotate session tickets</a>. The merge request was
open for a few months and was thoroughly reviewed by a peer before
being merged. Interestingly, the vulnerable function
(<code>_gnutls_initialize_session_ticket_key_rotation</code>), explicitly says:</p>

<pre><code> * This function will not enable session ticket keys on the server side. That is done
 * with the gnutls_session_ticket_enable_server() function. This function just initializes
 * the internal state to support periodical rotation of the session ticket encryption key.
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, it thinks it is not responsible for session ticket
initialization, yet it is. Indeed, the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/merge_requests/1275/">merge request fixing the
problem</a> unconditionally does this:</p>

<pre><code>memcpy(session-&gt;key.initial_stek, key-&gt;data, key-&gt;size);
</code></pre>

<p>I haven't reviewed the code and the vulnerability in detail, so take
the above with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/merge_requests/1275.patch">full patch is available here</a>. See also the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/issues/1011">upstream issue
1011</a>, the <a href="https://gnutls.org/security-new.html#GNUTLS-SA-2020-06-03">upstream advisory</a>, the <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-13777">Debian security
tracker</a>,
and the <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1843723">Redhat Bugzilla</a>.</p>



<p>The impact of this vulnerability depends on the affected packages and
how they are used. It can range from "meh, someone knows I downloaded
that Debian package yesterday" to "holy crap my full disk encryption
passwords are compromised, I need to re-encrypt all my drives",
including "I need to change all LDAP and MySQL passwords".</p>

<p>It promises to be a fun week for some people at least.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, however, one has to wonder whether we should follow
<a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile">@FiloSottile</a>'s advice and stop using GnuTLS altogether. There are
at least a few programs that link against GnuTLS because of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSSL#Licensing">OpenSSL licensing oddities</a> but that has been first announced in
2015, then <a href="https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2017/03/22/license/">definitely and clearly resolved in 2017</a> -- or <a href="https://opensource.com/article/19/2/top-foss-legal-developments">maybe
that was in 2018</a>? Anyways it's fixed, pinky-promise-I-swear,
except if you're one of those weirdos still using GPL-2, of
course. Even though OpenSSL isn't the simplest and secure TLS
implementation out there, it could preferable to GnuTLS and maybe we
should consider changing Debian packages to use it in the future.</p>

<p>But then again, the last time something like this happened, it was
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">Heartbleed</a> and GnuTLS wasn't affected, so who knows... It is
likely that people don't have OpenSSL in mind when they suggest moving
away from GnuTLS and instead think of other TLS libraries like
<a href="https://tls.mbed.org/">mbedtls</a> (previously known as PolarSSL), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Security_Services">NSS</a>, <a href="https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/">BoringSSL</a>,
<a href="https://www.libressl.org/">LibreSSL</a> and so on. Not that those are totally sinless either...</p>

<p>"This is fine", as they say...</p>

        <p>2020-07-26</p>

        <p>We’ve been doing a lot of mob programming at work the last year or so and I’ve seen that I have a different attitude to naming things than others on my team. When I see that a name can be improved I always think this is priority number one. My colleagues often say “later”.</p>

<p>I also saw something related recently when doing a programming course internally at work. I sat and helped a guy with an issue he was having. I saw a really bad variable name and recommended he change it. He said “later, I just need to fix this first”. I pushed the point once more saying “trust me” and then left him to his devices. A few minutes later he asked for help again, being totally stuck. Renaming the variable got him immediately unstuck. He had wasted lots of time because the name put him in a mental trap.</p>

<p>My philosophy is: <em>there are only two acceptable types of names: good names and metasyntactic names</em>. If you have a name that is bad or just a bit misleading it’s better to rename it to <code>foo</code> NOW.</p>

<p>I believe good (or metasyntactic) names lead to easier problem solving and less effort in programming. It’s not just something we add at the end to make the code more understandable to others or future you. To me the primary thing we work with in programming isn’t numbers or computation, but language.</p>

  <p><span>This essay was co-authored by <a href="https://kortina.nyc/">Andrew Kortina</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@namratalpatel">Namrata Patel</a>.</span></p>

<figure><img src="https://kortina.nyc/files/kinky-labor-supply/04-kinky-labor-supply.png"><figcaption>Kinky (S<sub>1</sub>) vs classical (S<sub>0</sub>) labor supply curve.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Over the past few decades, labor force participation has sharply dropped for men ages 20-34. Theories about the root cause range from indolence, to a lack of skills and training, to offshoring, to (perhaps most interestingly) the increasing attractiveness and availability of leisure and media entertainment. In this essay, we propose that the drop in labor participation rate of young men is a result of a combination of factors: (i) a decrease in cost of access to media entertainment leisure, (ii) increases in both the availability and (iii) quality media entertainment leisure, and (iv) a decrease in the marginal signalling utility of (conspicuous) consumption goods for all but the highest earners.</p>

<p>At the macro level, this results in sub-optimal production, as firms are unable to satisfy their demand for labor via the usual mechanism of increasing wages. If you believe that economic productivity and growth are good, this presents a challenge when attempting to design stimulus policy, because subsidies or increases to the minimum wage would yield the same non-result as firms increasing wages. We discuss the potential efficacy of the somewhat radical idea of a tax on human attention or time spent consuming entertainment media as a way to stimulate productivity.</p>

<h3 id="declining-labor-participation-in-younger-demographics">Declining Labor Participation in Younger Demographics</h3>

<p>The overall labor force participation rate in the United States has been declining for the past several decades. The most obvious potential explanation would be an aging population (retirees comprising an increasing percentage of the overall population), but you can see this is not the root cause when you break out the labor force participation rate by age and sex:</p>

<figure><img src="https://kortina.nyc/files/kinky-labor-supply/00-labor-participation.png"><figcaption>Labor Participation Rate via <a href="https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/civilian-labor-force-participation-rate.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Labor participation has been dropping much faster for young men than any other groups. <em>(Interestingly, labor participation has been increasing most rapidly for older demographics, presumably because they must continue working later in life in order to support basic needs and healthcare costs).</em></p>

<p>In <a href="https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/maguiar/files/leisure-luxuries-labor-june-2017.pdf">Leisure Luxuries and the Labor Supply of Young Men</a>, Mark Aguiar and Erik Hurst note that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Despite stagnant wages, declining employment rates, and an increased propensity to live with their parents, younger men report increased happiness during the 2000s. This contrasts sharply with older men, whose satisfaction fell along with their relative earnings. We see the life satisfaction results as indirect evidence that younger men experienced relatively little decline in the consumption and greatly valued their improved leisure options.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Much of young men’s time which in past decades was spent working is now spent playing video games, according to Aguiar and Hurst. Given that reported happiness moved in the opposite direction from wages and employment rate, it would seem there is some preference for this specific type of leisure over the purchasing power sacrificed in the form of foregone wages. But given that leisure activities have always been an alternative to work, we should ask what about video games specifically makes them more compelling than historical leisure activities.</p>



<h3 id="decreasing-cost-increasing-availability-and-increasing-quality-of-media-entertainment">Decreasing Cost, Increasing Availability, and Increasing Quality of Media Entertainment</h3>

<p>Video games are just one example of media entertainment content that has become more a more attractive leisure choice as a result of advances in internet and mobile device technology.</p>

<p>For most of history, media consumption was bounded, like other forms of consumption, by cost – if you wanted more books, movies, music, console video games, etc, you needed money to buy them. Notable exceptions to this pattern were radio and cable television, where you could access programming at all hours of the day for a low fixed cost (or in some cases for free) – but in these cases, limits on the syndication of premium content entailed that not every hour of watching was equally enjoyable, and there were generally still diminishing (enjoyment) returns on each additional hour spent watching.</p>

<p>The digitization of content enabled infinite storage of evergreen content in the cloud and effectively zero marginal distribution cost of content through copying. Enabling on-demand access to all of the content that has ever been produced entailed a huge increase in the supply of good content. This essentially made all of history a viable competitor to people producing new content. Similarly, social media–produced for free, by amateurs–provided another huge influx of new content and more competition for attention.</p>

<p>This increased supply and competition put pressure on professionals creating new content to make it better and cheaper. On top of that, taking a page from the cable TV playbook, internet media distributors gave away content for free, and used advertising subsidies to pay for the small amount of content that was still being professionally produced.</p>

<p>All of these changes benefited the consumer by making more and better content available for free. Today, you can pretty much always spend yet another hour consuming some new and interesting content freely available on the internet, so once you have paid the (quite cheap) cost of access to your ISP or mobile data provider, you no longer require additional wages to pay for additional consumption of media as a leisure activity.</p>

<h3 id="decreasing-signalling-utility-of-conspicuous-consumption-goods">Decreasing Signalling Utility of Conspicuous Consumption Goods</h3>

<p>Before we accept that young men are simply foregoing working in favor of spending more time playing video games or consuming other forms of media entertainment content, we should ask what else they might spend foregone earnings on and why they are not working to fund that spend.</p>

<p>In general there are three types of goods: goods that meet your basic needs, leisure goods (including media goods), and conspicuous consumption goods (those that signal genetic fitness, social status, belonging, etc.). If young men playing video games are not foregoing their basic needs (an assumption we’ll make here), and the cost of media entertainment goods has dramatically fallen, then they must be trading off consumption goods. Next, we argue that this group has decreased consumption because the signaling utility of these goods has decreased.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-conspicuous-consumption-and-what-does-it-take-to-get-it">What is conspicuous consumption and what does it take to get it?</h4>

<p>Historically, the primary purpose of working was to generate enough income to satisfy basic needs. Once those needs were met, an individual had a tradeoff to make between spending their remaining time on work or leisure.</p>

<p>Observing the behavior of the nouveau riche in a post-industrialization society in the late 1800s, Thorstein Veblen introduced the theory of conspicuous consumption - the purchase of goods and services for the sake of signalling social status (vs. the intrinsic function provided by goods that meet basic needs or those that enable leisure).</p>

<p>As living standards improved in the 20th century and individuals had more discretionary income, this behavior expanded to men, women, and children across all economic classes who began to spend more money on goods and services as a sort of social fashion. Implicit in spending more time on work is a preference for conspicuous consumption over leisure.</p>

<p>If you have the money, how do you decide what to consume? Benjamin Schwarz suggested in his <a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-new-elites-silly-virtue-signaling-consumption/">review</a> of Elizabeth Currid-Halkett’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sum-Small-Things-Theory-Aspirational/dp/0691162735">The Sum of Small Things: A Theory of the Aspirational Class</a> that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This process depends on the great extent to which the elite’s consumption is at once devoted to and relies on “cultural capital”—that is, the adoption of values, tastes, and norms through social inculcation and formal education. That cup of Intelligentsia coffee may “only” cost five dollars, but learning about it in the first place depends on prizing the judgment of certain cultural tastemakers (again, say, the New York Times and those right-thinking podcasts), and on possessing a worldview that attaches a particular value and virtue to a particular container of hot liquid. Acquiring that cultural capital is, itself, a rarefied and usually expensive endeavor, because it involves a lengthy and complex process of what the sociologists call cultural and social formation: The peculiar cachet that the educated class attaches to that cup of coffee is far more likely to elude the daughter of an insurance adjuster brought up in Lansing, Kansas (a middle-class suburb of Kansas City), who attended the local high school and Kansas State, than it is the daughter of a screenwriter raised in uber-achieving north-of-Montana-Avenue Santa Monica, who attended the Harvard-Westlake School and Yale. Thus, buying that cup of coffee—or that organic cotton t-shirt, or that subscription to Harper’s—signifies a class identity that the purchase, in turn, reinforces.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The increased cost in time to acquire the knowledge of what to consume is yet another way that conspicuous consumption is becoming prohibitively more expensive.</p>

<p>The catch with all of this is that the psychological utility sought from conspicuous consumption is relative, not absolute. Sarah Perry sums this up nicely in her book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Every-Cradle-Grave-Rethinking-Suicide/dp/0989697290">Every Cradle is a Grave</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>More than anything, however, a human utility function is a function of social belonging. That’s the ultimate point not only of income, but of intelligence, beauty, and many other material and non-material goods: they may be traded for social belonging… We want income because we want to be able to get the attention of others. We want a safe social place, primarily—and, of course, we want a better social place than the one we currently occupy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The implication of this relative sizing up is that there is an ever-rising bar to maintain or improve your social position relative to the people and communities from which you seek affiliation or belonging. This was never easy given the money and time required, but at least …</p></article></div>

<p><span>Millions of users use Uber’s applications everyday across the globe, accessing seamless transportation or meal delivery at the push of a button. To achieve this accessibility at scale, our mobile apps require low-latency and highly reliable network communication, regardless of where customers use our services.</span></p>
<p><span>The network communication for all of Uber’s mobile applications are powered by the edge and the mobile networking infrastructures. The edge infrastructure provides secure connectivity for the HTTPS traffic originating from the mobile apps to the backend services. Uber’s edge infrastructure combines the global presence of public cloud platforms that help reduce app latencies with the additional ability to fallback to our own managed data-centers when required for enhanced reliability.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On the mobile side, a core component of our networking stack is the failure handler that intelligently routes all mobile traffic from our applications to the edge infrastructure. Uber’s failure handler was designed as a finite state machine (FSM) to ensure that the traffic sent via cloud infrastructure is maximized. During times when the cloud infrastructure is unreachable, the failover handler dynamically re-routes the traffic directly to Uber’s data centers without significantly impacting the user’s experience.</span></p>
<p><span>After rolling out the failover handler at Uber, we witnessed a 25-30 percent reduction in tail-end latencies for the HTTPS traffic when compared to previous solutions. The failover handler has also ensured reasonably low error rates for the HTTPS traffic during periods of outages faced by the public cloud infrastructure. Combined, these performance improvements have led to better user experiences for markets worldwide.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In this article, we share the challenges faced in designing the mobile failover handler for Uber’s applications, and how the design evolved as we operationalized the system across our users globally.</span></p>

<h2><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure</span></h2>
<p><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure comprises front-end proxy servers that terminate secure TLS over </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol"><span>TCP</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC"><span>QUIC</span></a><span> connections from the mobile apps. The HTTPS traffic originating from the mobile apps over these connections are then forwarded to the backend services in the nearest data-center using existing </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_pool"><span>connection pools</span></a><span>. The edge infrastructure spans across public cloud and privately managed infrastructures as shown in Figure 1, below, with the front-end proxies hosted both within public cloud regions and in Uber’s managed data-centers:&nbsp;</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_8070" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8070"><a href="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2nd-.gif"><img src="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2nd-.gif" alt="" width="1200" height="541"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8070">Figure 1. Uber’s edge infrastructure powers our mobile applications by routing mobile traffic either over the cloud infrastructure or directly to Uber’s managed data-centers.</figcaption></figure>

<p><span>Hosting the edge servers on public cloud enables us to leverage its widely deployed network of </span><a href="https://networkencyclopedia.com/point-of-presence-pop/"><span>Points of Presence</span></a><span>, or PoPs. </span><span>Terminating the QUIC/TCP connection closer to the user generally </span><span>results in better performance, translating to lower latency and error rates for the HTTPS traffic. In addition, the cloud’s front-end servers support newer, more </span><a href="https://eng.uber.com/employing-quic-protocol/"><span>performant protocols</span></a><span> that further lowers the latencies during poor network conditions. As such, it is critical we maximize the amount of HTTPS requests from mobile routed via the cloud regions to ensure the best possible user experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, if app requests are always routed to the cloud, we risk significant service interruptions during both&nbsp; local- and global-level disruptions. Such connectivity issues can be </span><a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi20spring_burnett_prepub.pdf"><span>attributed</span></a><span> to various components of the public clouds or the intermediate ISPs. Issues due to DNS service, load balancers, BGP routing, mis-configurations of network middleboxes, cloud outages etc. can lead to DNS or QUIC/ TCP connection timeouts. When disruptions occur, Uber’s platform must have the ability to dynamically failover and reroute incoming requests to our private data centers to ensure uninterrupted service.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The front-end servers hosted in the cloud and data-centers are registered as different </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name"><span>domain names</span></a><span>. By selecting the most appropriate domain-name, the mobile apps can route requests either through the cloud regions or directly to the Uber data-centers.</span></p>

<h2><span>Mobile Failover handling</span></h2>
<p><span>To facilitate highly performant and reliable app experiences for our users, we built an in-house failover handler that resides within the mobile networking stack as an interceptor placed above the core HTTP2/QUIC layers. As HTTPS requests are generated from the application, they pass through the failover handler, that rewrites the domain-name (or host-name) before they are processed by the core HTTP library. This ensures that the HTTPS traffic can be dynamically routed to the appropriate edge servers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Asynchronously, the failover handler continuously monitors the health of the domains and switches the domain if required based on the errors received from the HTTPS responses. The logic that decides when to switch the domains is the core component of the failover handler, and the main topic of discussion in this article.</span></p>
<p><span>The failover handler uses network errors for HTTPS responses as the signal to detect reachability issues with the domain. The fundamental challenge when designing the failover handler was distinguishing between errors on the user’s end due to mobile connectivity failures and errors on our end due to edge infrastructure unavailability or unreachability.&nbsp; This problem is further exacerbated due to the high usage of cellular/ LTE networks for Uber’s applications, especially at global scale. Mobile networks are </span><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/00aa/a84be127c04a21b5f5f8dc5d2426921654e2.pdf"><span>less reliable and stable</span></a><span> than their wired counterparts, prone to intermittent failures, connectivity issues, and congestion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Receiving temporary DNS errors or QUIC/ TCP connection timeouts for our primary domain (domain-name for the edge servers hosted within cloud regions) does not necessarily mean that it is unavailable; in most cases, this failure is actually due to an intermittent loss in connectivity. Imagine, for instance, going into a tunnel and losing mobile service. In such a scenario, switching the domain from a primary domain to a back-up domain does not help and may result in </span><i><span>lower</span></i><span> performance once connectivity recovers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Round robin-based failover handler</span></h3>
<p><span>A few straight-foward solutions we tested failed to address this challenge effectively. An earlier iteration of our failover handler used a round robin-based system configured with a list of domains. The first domain was the primary domain that provided the best possible performance. The primary domain was followed by back-up domains, typically Uber’s managed data-center servers, to ensure ability to fallback when the primary domain is unavailable. On receiving a specific network error—DNS errors, timeouts, TCP/TLS errors, and so on—the system switched the domain to the next in the list for all subsequent HTTPS requests.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While this round robin solution met our availability requirements, it had a few drawbacks regarding performance:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Aggressive host switches:</b><span> A few intermittent network errors cause the system to switch domains. Excessive switching across domains may result in unnecessary DNS lookups and connection setups causing additional delays.</span></li>
<li><b>Substantial requests routed to non-performant domains</b><span>: In the event of network errors, the system settles on one of the domains in the list with equal probability after the network recovers. We saw significant sessions settle on the lower-performing back-up domains, despite the primary domain being available. The system would only transition back to the primary domain following another round of network errors.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Threshold-based failover handler</span></h3>
<p><span>To avoid excessive domain switching, we also experimented with a threshold-based failover handler. Instead of triggering failover based on a single network error, the threshold-based solution switches domains only after encountering a minimum number of network errors.&nbsp; However, it proved hard to find a threshold value that worked efficiently across different applications, regions, and network types (LTE, WiFi etc.). Setting the value too low caused unnecessary switching, but setting it too high delayed recovery in scenarios where the primary domains were actually unavailable. Besides, this system did not completely solve the drawbacks of the previous approach.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Edge-driven failover handling</span></h3>
<p><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure has automated recovery mechanisms to mitigate domain failures, such as DNS re-mapping. In this situation, excessive errors on our primary domain triggers a reconfiguration of the domain-name to IP address mapping for the affected domain. DNS propagation is not instantaneous though, since the revised mapping must propagate across all DNS nameservers globally.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Oftentimes, the unreachability of the primary domain is also limited to a small region, a city, or a specific mobile carrier, and cannot be effectively mitigated by DNS mapping updates alone. Mobile apps have a better context of the connectivity conditions and can react in real-time. Hence, we determined that a device-local failover handler is necessary to ensure connectivity in addition to our edge-driven failover handling mechanisms.</span></p>

<h2><span>Failover handler design</span></h2>
<p><span>When designing Uber’s failover handler, we wanted to ensure we hit three main criteria that was lacking in existing solutions we assessed:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Maximize the usage of primary domains: </b><span>&nbsp;We needed our failover handling solution to operate in a way to preferentially route traffic to the primary domains, which typically offer the best performance. Maximizing the amount of HTTPS traffic going through these domains ensures lower latency and a better user experience overall.</span></li>
<li><b>Effectively differentiate between network errors and host-level outages: </b><span>The system required a robust mechanism that could confidently identify actual domain failures and lower the probability of switching to an alternate host because of intermittent mobile network connectivity issues.</span></li>
<li><b>Reduce degraded experience during primary domain outages: </b><span>Our failover …</span></li></ol></div></div>

<p>Ever since&nbsp;Google&nbsp;published the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://landing.google.com/sre/books/" target="_blank">Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) book</a>&nbsp;in 2016, the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="SRE movemen (opens in a new tab)" href="https://sdarchitect.blog/2017/06/26/cloud-service-reliability-part-i-apollo-13-to-google-sre/" target="_blank">SRE movemen</a>t has changed how organizations look at&nbsp;reliability, and incident response and management. Not unlike DevOps, working on adopting SRE is resulting in an organizational cultural shift. A shift which is changing how organizations are organized, on how information flows within an organization that would allow for the delivery of more reliable and resilient, dynamic systems. That being said, SRE, that is SRE as defined by Google, is not applicable for most organizations. Organizations need to take the thought process and culture behind Google’s SRE and adapt it just enough to make it suitable and viable for their organization’s business needs. As I see it today, large enterprises are mostly failing at doing this. They are either attempting to adopt SRE in its purest form, not realizing they are not Google, or totally changing (corrupting) it to suit how they do things, how they have always done things, to their broken culture, hence making what they call SRE, SRE in name only.</p>



<blockquote><p>“But, You are Not Google”</p><cite>Me talking to many a CIO/VP of Ops</cite></blockquote>



<p>“But, You are not Google”. This is a common refrain I have said to many a CIO or VP of Ops in companies that I have worked on SRE adoption with. I try to be polite, I promise. But really, they are not Google. In the very initial pages of the Google SRE book, in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/production-environment/" target="_blank">introduction</a> itself, the authors describes why Google developed SRE. They have massive data centers on which their services run. These data centers have a high incidence of hardware failure, given their size. This required Google to have the ability to dynamically move services from one part of the data center to another in a fraction of time. Given the large user base of the deployed services, Google also needed to have extremely fast response times to outages and degradation in quality of service, with minimal impact to the user. Their operations teams had to find a way to handle all these incidents, outages and failures in an automated manner to reduce toil and stress on the team. Their incidents, outages and failures were also very repetitive. Given the homogenous nature of the hardware across their datacenters, and the nature of the services deployed, there were very few outliers. Most tasks could (should) be automated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This led to the development of what we today know as SRE. Google had a team of software developers work in operations with the goal of developing software to handle the vast majority of tasks that were assigned to the system administration teams and incident response teams. As the software got more and more mature, more and more typical tasks had been automated. The humans could then focus on the outliers. On tasks that were not ‘typical’. Reliability Engineering meets software engineering = SRE.</p>



<p>If the 1<sup>st</sup> paragraph in this section is not an apt description of your datacenters and systems you are running, you do not need SRE. Don’t get me wrong, you need (service/system) Reliability Engineering. You still need to automate repetitive, typical tasks in operations. You just don’t need to, and really should not do it the Google way. You are not Google. Very few organizations are.</p>



<h3><strong>SRE for the Enterprise</strong></h3>



<p>So what does SRE in the ‘regular’ Enterprise look like? It may be easier to describe what it does not look like. Here goes:</p>



<ul><li>You are not replacing your current Ops team, your sys admins with software Engineers. You need your ops team. They know how your custom built infrastructure and systems work. They know its idiosyncrasies. They know when Chicago opens to a ticket to say they are offline again, its the network. Yes, its always the network, but the sysadmins know who to ping at Equinix to get it restored pronto. They know how the option trade desk system slows to a grind on Expiration Friday and you just ignore those tickets from traders that day. And even if you wanted to get rid of all the sys admins, can you afford to hire that many software engineers to replace them all? You can barely fill all your open slots on the dev teams. What you need to do is complement your Ops teams with software engineers who can understand what the teams do day-in, day-out and what tasks are repetitive and typical, and then they can develop tools for automated remediation. These software engineers should be embedded in the ops team, not a separate team on the outside. Think <em>Squads.&nbsp;</em></li></ul>



<div><div>
<ul><li>Renaming your DevOps teams as SRE is a no-no.&nbsp;First of all <em>&lt;steps on soapbox/&gt;</em> there should NOT be a team called the DevOps team! You created a new silo to do what was supposed to be a movement to eliminate silos? DevOps should be what everyone does. If you do have a separate team to build automation, that is exactly what they are – the automation building team. And that is exactly what they should do – build automation for others to use. They build tools to enable the processes of DevOps. They do NOT use those tools themselves to do any real deployments. Ever. But I leave my true feelings on this for another blog post <em>&lt;steps off soapbox/&gt;</em>.&nbsp; Renaming your DevOps teams as SRE only gets them to leave for better jobs as real SREs elsewhere at better salaries now that they are formally SREs according to their resumes. Don’t do it. DevOps is DevOps. SRE is SRE. They are joined at the hip, but they are different. SREs have a different set of goals from the application development teams – build automation to reduce toil, increase observability, and improve reliability of the systems in production. They should not be building deployment automation or improving test environments to get better quality signals.</li></ul>
</div></div>



<ul><li>SRE is first and foremost about culture. Do you have a culture that is reliability focussed? What does reliability mean to you? Is it <a href="https://sdarchitect.blog/2017/08/18/cloud-service-reliability-part-3-antifragile-when-devops-met-sre/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="MTBF or MTTR (opens in a new tab)">MTBF or MTTR</a>? Do you have well defined SLAs (or SLOs)? How do you measure them? Do you meet them? Do you have <a href="https://sdarchitect.blog/2020/01/08/understanding-observability/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Observability (opens in a new tab)">Observability</a>? Do you do blameless postmortems of incidents? Are they really blameless? Do you make your developers ‘carry pagers’ and do they do it without fear? Do you deploy on Fridays and sleep well over the weekend?&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>I am barely scratching the surface of how SRE needs to be adapted for the enterprise (that is not Google). I would like to hear from you. But instead of leaving a comment on this post, which I perfectly OK with, I would prefer you respond to an <a href="https://www.research.net/r/SRESurvey2020">SRE survey</a> we recently created. I had the opportunity earlier this year to work with three good friends of mine – <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAA2fPwBkGJsFLhm7pYTiGv1hOwqc3Vxt1I/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BPkL4y56tRGuL6Jxh%2FELPjQ%3D%3D">Marc Hornbeek</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAADGJN4BvhODuicPVGeQAljiRCR_Vx66MQM/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BPkL4y56tRGuL6Jxh%2FELPjQ%3D%3D">Archana Joshi</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAJS7zgBfhzivo8mNgusFqmaicqG0wuPYww/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BPkL4y56tRGuL6Jxh%2FELPjQ%3D%3D">Niladri Choudhury</a> on a <em><a href="https://www.research.net/r/SRESurvey2020">State of SRE</a></em> survey commissioned by <a href="https://www.catchpoint.com/">Catchpoint</a>. This survey is designed specifically to get a view into how enterprises and other organization not named Google are adopting SRE. If your organization is adopting or thinking of adopting SRE, do take this survey right now. We will be analyzing the results and sharing findings on the current state and trends (this is the 3<sup>rd</sup> year Catchpoint is running a SRE survey) later this Spring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To sweeten the deal, I am offering my time to anyone who completes the survey and wants to talk SRE. Once you complete the survey and want to talk about your SRE adoption or just have questions about SRE, <a href="mailto:sanjeev@sdarchtect.blog">email a screenshot of the completion screen to me</a> and I will schedule a <strong>free 20-minute consult with you and your team</strong>. So, what are you waiting for – click <a href="https://www.research.net/r/SRESurvey2020">here</a> to go to the survey. I look forward to speaking with you soon.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2><strong>Obstacles to learning from incidents</strong></h2><p>Learning from incidents; it sounds easy, right? We’re always learning...</p><p>Our team or organization has an incident, maybe we responded to it, and then we “learned” from it.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, just having the incident, even participating in a response team, doesn't mean that the learning that will elevate and improve your organization (at least the way we talk about it on this site) has occurred. Further, even if you have personally learned something, that doesn't mean it’s been disseminated or that others have as well.</p><p>I'm mostly operating from the view that we're talking about <em>your</em> incidents, however you slice that. They typically reside within your organization, though not always your immediate group or team. This isn't exclusive; we will talk briefly about incidents in other organizations as well.</p><h3><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292504703_Distancing_through_differencing_An_obstacle_to_organizational_learning_following_accidents"><strong>Distancing through differencing</strong></a></h3><p>The number one obstacle that can keep an organization from learning from an incident is <em>distancing through differencing</em>. This is when an us vs them sort of mentality emerges to produce all sorts of reasons that though this happened to <em>them</em> it, of course, would <strong>never</strong> happen to <em>us</em>.</p><p>You can be on guard for phrases like:</p><ul role="list"><li>"We would never respond that way"</li><li>"We have our own process to protect us from that"</li><li>"We wouldn't do something [stupid] like that"</li><li>"We're way more careful than they are"</li><li>"Day (or whichever other) shift is always like that, we're not like that"</li></ul><p>Any of the phrases like the above are strong signals that you're seeing <em>distancing through differencing</em> in action. This is something that can happen at multiple levels, when hearing about an incident at another organization or even when hearing about an incident at your organization, but not in your group or team.</p><p>You can begin to counteract this just by knowing and being aware that such a phenomenon exists in our psychology. Of course, all incidents have different specifics, but very often there are patterns that we can recognize in our own environment.</p><p>Further, when examining an incident, we can purposefully look for similarities between that incident and our current context about how the system should work.</p><h3><strong>Overconfidence</strong></h3><p>While having faith in our individual and group ability to face challenges can be a good indicator of an effective team, it is also possible to be overconfident in our ability to respond to or control a system hazard. We can become miscalibrated about the actual risk of an accident or incident to such a degree that we don't think about it or attempt to prepare for it. This of course can lead to surprise if an incident occurs involving that risk.It can be a contributor to a sort of denial that can encourage <em>distancing through differencing</em> as well. I call this out as a specific section though, because treating it can help both further learning and potential future response.</p><p>That doesn't mean that we can't gain confidence in our abilities, but we also don't wish to become out of touch with the reality of risks. High reliability organizational research calls this "<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781119175834.ch03">preoccupation with failure</a>," which can help us learn and respond more effectively.</p><p>For example, during my time in EMS I learned to not only trust in my abilities, but also to recognize that accidents would occur that were well beyond them. There was no world where I would be able to treat everything I'd find.</p><h3><strong>Root cause</strong></h3><p>You've likely seen processes where teams engage in a "root cause analysis" or similar, the goal being to find the one thing that started it all so it can be fixed. That way it won't ever happen again. This sounds nice, but unfortunately in complex systems, like the software systems we build and maintain, this doesn't apply. There are multiple things that need to occur in order for the incident to have happened - and they’re important to understand beyond the precipitating event.</p><p><strong>This might just sound like a matter of swapping out words, but it's actually a way of changing approaches.</strong> If we search for just one thing, we're making it almost impossible to find all the other things that contributed that we could possibly learn from. Starting with "root cause" means that we're going into it essentially with the bias of, "I'm going to blind myself to some contributing factors," which will inevitably constrain our learning.</p><p>Further, it can constrain others' learning as well. If it's communicated that there was a root cause to the incident, another person may presume that that is all there is, one fix to be made, problem done and dusted. Nothing to learn from there they may think.</p><p>Of course, our investigations can't continue on eternally, we must constrain our search in some way. But understanding how we choose to constrain our investigations and the naturally occurring constraint in our search for understanding can help us view those results, these lessons from the investigation, in a more effective light.</p><h3><strong>Only trying to learn from "bad" things</strong></h3><p>Often times learning attempts that do take place are strongly focused on the bad things, like what went wrong in a response or a bad outcome. But there is a lot to learn from incidents about what went well, what kept an outcome from being worse, what helped marshal a productive response (see also: <a href="https://www.learningfromincidents.io/blog/oops-learning-from-the-incident-you-didnt-have">OOPS! Learning from the incident you never had</a>).</p><p>Constraining our search for learning to only bad things means we'll miss all the good things. This isn't just a matter of being upbeat or positive, it helps us potentially notice things like:</p><ul role="list"><li>What parts of our incident response plan do we want to practice since it was especially effective?</li><li>What displays or system information helped bring clarity to the chaos?</li><li>What groups or responders were especially prepared to respond to this incident? How did that happen?</li><li>How do we uncover the unwritten know-how held by the daily practitioners making subtle adjustments to keep our systems in a stable state <em>before</em> things go wrong?</li></ul><h3><strong>High pressure reporting requirements</strong></h3><p>This one might seem a bit surprising; after all if incidents aren't reported, they can't be learned from. It's true that if an incident is swept under the rug it can be difficult to learn from, but the other extreme end of the continuum, requiring investigations and reports to be produced in a tightly specified time period can create pressure to "resolve" an investigation quickly.</p><p>This is likely to produce, at best, only a cursory investigation of the incident, making it incredibly difficult to learn from. In my experience, this sort of deadline approach is often a reaction to investigations not being done previously, or a fear that they wouldn't be done otherwise. As a result, a time period is mandated with the hope that that will solve the issue.</p><p>If broader change to this approach isn't yet possible in your organization or group, I've seen some limited success in changing what the deadline represents. That is, requiring an investigation to <em>begin</em> within a certain period (ideally broadly specified as a guideline), but no firm specification on when an investigation has to be done by, as that of course would vary depending on the incident.</p><h3><strong>Making sure this never happens again</strong></h3><p>As we touched on before, every incident is unique if you look at a detailed enough view. It's also possible to get stuck in the details, especially if your goal is to prevent this specific incident, with this exact outcome from ever happening again.</p><p>The detailed view of the individual incident itself should be the <em>starting</em> point to then zoom out and see more and more general things about the system as a whole. If we remain in the very low level detail of an individual incident, we are at risk for creating "fixes" that don't really address the problem and may see a similar looking incident in the future, despite our best efforts.</p><p>Looking at this through the lens of emergency medicine has helped frame this way of thinking. It would be strange to imagine a responder's purpose to ensure a car accident never happens again. Instead, they can advance their skillset and influence systemic factors that can reduce the impact of an entire class of accidents. If they focused all of their efforts on making sure one exact type of car accident didn't happen, one in which someone swerved to miss a deer, on a wet road, while making a turn, etc.they'd likely change a whole bunch of things that may make other accidents more common or impactful while failing to advance the ability to respond to all those other accidents.</p><h3><strong>Confusing writing, distribution, or meetings with learning</strong></h3><p>Often times, in post-incident analysis there will be artifacts produced, possibly some documents. There may even be some meetings during the process. The artifacts may be distributed throughout the company.</p><p>These may be helpful to the process of investigation, the artifacts can even be helpful to review. But none of them inherently cause learning to occur.</p><p>It's important to realize that simply because a meeting was held, a document created, a memo sent, that learning may or may not have occurred. You can make it easier or more effective to learn from these processes or artifacts or create a culture where learning is highly valued, but as an individual or "safety" type group, you <em>cannot</em> cause learning to occur in others.</p><p>When I was in emergency medicine, I learned this firsthand. For one particular ambulance company I would often write reports as a result of my work, but the only people that I knew of that would read them was the "quality" department. If I wrote it in some way they didn't like I'd end up with a meeting often called "chart review" or "report review."</p><p>This process has a lot of the characteristics of what software teams often do in hopes of learning. There would be an incident, I would write a report about it, perhaps a meeting would get scheduled, but it's pretty clear that no substantial learning occurred or was disseminated. That is, unless you count me learning how to write reports to suit a particular audience or learning how much I dislike those meetings.</p><p>If you've used this process …</p></div></div>

<p>From the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/technology/twitter-hackers-interview.html"> New York Times story on the recent Twitter hack</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>Mr. O’Connor said other hackers had informed him that Kirk got access to the Twitter credentials when he found a way into Twitter’s internal Slack messaging channel and saw them posted there, along with a service that gave him access to the company’s servers.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>It’s too soon after this incident to put too much faith in the reporting, but let’s assume it’s accurate. A collective cry of “<em>Posting credentials to a Slack channel? How could engineers at Twitter be so stupid?</em>” rose up from the internet. It’s a natural reaction, but it’s not a constructive one.</p>



<p>I don’t personally know any engineers at Twitter, but I have confidence that they have excellent engineers over there, including excellent security folks. So, how do we explain this seemingly obvious security lapse?</p>



<p>The problem is that we on the outside can’t, because we don’t have enough information. This type of lapse is a classic example of a <em>workaround</em>. People in a system use workarounds (they do things the “<em>wrong</em>” way) when there are obstacles to doing things the “right” way.</p>



<p>There are countless possibilities for why people employ workarounds. Maybe some system that’s required for doing it the “right” way is down for some reason, or maybe it simply takes too long or is too hard to do things the “right” way. Combine that with production pressures, and a workaround is born.</p>



<p>I’m willing to bet that there are people in your organization that use workarounds. You probably use some yourself. Identifying those workarounds teaches us something about how the system works, and how people have to do things the “wrong” way to actually get their work done.</p>



<p>Some workarounds, like the Twitter example, are dangerous. But simply observing “they shouldn’t have done that” does nothing to address the problems in the system that motivated the workaround in the first place.</p>



<p>When you see a workaround, don’t ask “how could they be so stupid to do things the obviously wrong way?” Instead, ask “what are the properties of our system that contributed to the development of this workaround?” Because, unless you gain a deeper understanding of your system, the problems that motivated the workaround aren’t going to go away.</p>

	  <p><span color="#51504E">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My 
		first rule of hitting was to get a good ball to hit. I learned down to 
		percentage points where those good balls were. The box shows my particular 
		preferences, from what I considered my “happy zone” - where I could hit 
		.400 or better - to the low outside corner - where the most I could hope 
		to bat was .230. Only when the situation demands it should a hitter go 
		for the low-percentage pitch.<p>
		
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since some players are better high-ball hitters than 
		low-ball hitters, or better outside than in; each batter should work out 
		his own set of percentages. But more important, each should learn the 
		strike zone, because once pitchers find a batter is going to swing at 
		bad pitches he will get nothing else. The strike zone is approximately 
		seven balls wide (allowing for pitches on the corners). When a batter 
		starts swinging at pitches just two inches out of that zone (shaded area), 
		he has increased the pitcher’s target from approximately 4.2 square feet 
		to about 5.8 square feet - an increase of 37 percent. Allow a pitcher 
		that much of an advantage and you will be a .250 hitter.</p></span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="layout-marketing"><section><div> <p><i>by</i> <span>Joe Marshall</span> <i>on</i> <span>July 23, 2020</span></p> <p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/atlas-header.png"></p></div> <div><h2 id="intro-to-stripe-atlas">Intro to Stripe Atlas</h2>
<p>Stripe Atlas is a <a href="https://stripe.com/atlas">“platform for forming a company”</a> aimed in particular at startups and internet businesses. It consolidates a lot of the legal paperwork, fees, and hassle of incorporating a business, giving you access to a bevy of Stripe resources for company formation, all behind an online dashboard that sits inside your usual Stripe account. It costs $500 and covers a few hundred dollars in legal fees, plus it comes with thousands of dollars in credits with affiliated partners.</p>
<p><strong>Stripe Atlas offers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proof your company is incorporated - papers, Tax ID, etc  </li>
<li>Stripe account  </li>
<li>Business checking account with Azlo Banking (optional, more on this later)  </li>
<li>Access to the Stripe Atlas community  </li>
<li>A year of registered agent fees (required for Delaware Corps, normally $100/year)</li>
<li>Off-the-shelf legal templates created by Stripe Atlas-affiliated lawyers</li>
<li>Special offers from vendors ($5,000 in AWS credits, $10,000 in Digital Ocean, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>Although Stripe Atlas was designed initially for businesses that wanted to incorporate as Delaware C Corporations, it’s been expanded to support LLCs - meaning that if you don’t want to issue stock, have a Board of Directors, etc, but just want the legal framework for some shared profit venture, with the liability protection of an LLC, Stripe Atlas is still for you.</p>
<p>A major feature of Atlas, finally, is that it optionally comes with a business bank account. Access to the US banking system is a killer feature for international entrepreneurs who might want to process payments, sell / purchase companies, or otherwise participate in the American market.</p>
<p><strong>So, Stripe Atlas is for</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Entrepreneurs who want to simplify the incorporation process  </li>
<li>Startup Founders  </li>
<li>Bootstrappers / Indiehackers / Side Project-ers  </li>
<li>International Entrepreneurs who want to do business in the US</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-we-chose-stripe-atlas">Why <em>We</em> Chose Stripe Atlas</h2>
<p>We’re a <a href="https://formcake.com/about">small, four-person bootstrapped business</a> (basically, bullet points one and three). We knew and trusted Stripe as our payment processor and loved the idea of not only consolidating a lengthy, involved process into a tool we (already!) used, we also saw the $500 fee as more than worth it, considering the promised $5,000 in AWS credits, registered agent fees, and incorporation fee. The ability to create a business bank account in addition to the incorporation was gravy, considering that we needed a business-only Stripe-connected account. For us, since all we required was a garden-variety, digitally-oriented LLC formation with the ultimate company divided into four ownership units, Atlas made perfect sense. If our needs hadn’t been so simple and we’d ultimately needed something more custom, we still would’ve explored Stripe Atlas’ premade templates and flat-fee legal services, but more cautiously.</p>
<h2 id="approval-process">Approval Process</h2>
<p>In order to get approved for a Stripe Atlas account and a Delaware C Corporation, you’ll need to provide some information to Stripe for <em>each person</em> who’s going to be a part owner of the company:</p>
<p><strong>What you’ll need</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Photo of your driver’s license</li>
<li>Driver’s license number</li>
<li>Driver’s license expiration</li>
<li>Physical address</li>
<li>Social security number</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you submit this info Stripe will hit you with a whole mess of emails asking you to Docusign everything from an IP Assignment, which assigns any intellectual property you might have created to the company, to the actual paperwork dividing stock if you’re a Delaware C Corp or ownership units if you’re an LLC. It’s all very direct and automated, signing each stage of documents and providing the requisite information unlocks the next stage of documents and info-gathering.</p>
<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
<p><strong>Day 1</strong>: We signed up and submitted all our personal info<br><strong>Day 3</strong>: A mistake! We noticed in our Stripe Atlas dashboard that the status of our documents was no longer "Submitted." We notified them, resubmitted some things, and they rectified the error.<br><strong>Day 6</strong>: We receive the company formation documents: IP assignment, ownership percentages, etc.<br><strong>Day 10</strong>: We received our bank account with Azlo but still couldn’t accept payment (trying to process one would trigger an error through the Stripe API)<br><strong>Day 14</strong>: We receive our EIN (Employer Identification Number), otherwise known as our tax ID. We can now accept payments!</p>
<h2 id="stripe-atlas-aws-credits">Stripe Atlas AWS Credits</h2>
<p>Stripe Atlas teases a number of partner benefits in their promotional copy - $5,000 for AWS, up to $100,000 for GCP (!). Of course our all-AWS infrastructure makes those AWS credits essentially free money, so we were very interested in maximizing that benefit.</p>
<p>So after signing up for Atlas and going through all the AWS rigamarole we were able to secure only $1,000 in AWS credits.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/stripe-atlas-includes-five-thousand-credits-this-is-what-we-got">posted about it</a> and actually received a follow up from Stripe:</p>
<section>
Hi David, 

<p>Thanks for your interest in Stripe Atlas. My name is Tony and I’ll be happy to share further about our tools.</p>
<p>We know that building a new business is exciting and challenging—but it can also be costly. To help you get off to a great start, Stripe Atlas has partnered with Amazon Web Services to create some great offers for Stripe Atlas businesses.</p>
<p>In your case, applying through Stripe Atlas, the amount you're eligible for is (up to) $5000. The "up to" phrase is because there is a lifetime eligibility cap.</p>
<p>If you have any other questions about AWS benefits or Stripe Atlas, just reply to this email—we're happy to help.       </p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Tony</p>
</section>

<p>In summary: It seems that though Stripe can advertise the "up to" amounts it’s the actual partners (like AWS) who are setting the standards for what companies merit what credit payouts. Basically, Stripe directs you to AWS, you verify you’re a Stripe customer via a code, and the Amazon Gods pay what they pay.</p>
<p>It seems in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/activate/">AWS Activate</a> (the program giving the credits) we signed up under the "Bootstrapped / Self-funded" option to get our $1,000 in credits. Maybe if we'd signed up as a "Funded" startup we could've expected the full $5,000?</p>
<p>It’s disappointing and a little opaque, but no more than most marketing copy. Just keep in mind as you’re reading those credit totals in the official Stripe Atlas documentation that they come with light asterisks - it’s not ultimately Stripe awarding those amounts.</p>
<h2 id="stripe-atlas-taxes">Stripe Atlas Taxes</h2>
<p>We have been incorporated for under a fiscal year, so alas we haven’t had the pleasure of doing taxes yet. We have done some research into it though, and tried to get a sense of what support Stripe offers Atlas companies during tax time.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of some of the Stripe communication around taxes. These resources all came in an email to Atlas founders:</p>

<p>We decided to create a business checking account with Azlo because we desperately needed to move off my-real-live-checking-account we naturally shipped with.</p>
<p>We haven’t done anything exciting from a financial perspective - no complicated M&amp;A’s, accounting logistics, or large business loans - we’ve just been depositing money from our Stripe account and occasionally withdrawing.</p>
<p>One neat feature of using Azlo + Atlas is that when you’re activating your Stripe account, moving beyond the testing stage and generating a live production token, as soon as Stripe gives you a valid token you’re ready to accept payments - immediately. It’s a great feeling adding that critical Stripe token to your secrets management, pushing it live, and knowing someone can “walk up”, purchase your digital product, and pay you money for it, all completely automated. This is admittedly a small thing but also indicative of some of that Stripe attention to detail they’re so great about.</p>
<h2 id="our-conclusion">Our Conclusion</h2>
<p>Really the only blemish on our entire Stripe Atlas experience was wanting that sweet $5,000 in AWS credits but settling for $1,000 - which feels like a pretty small, spoiled gripe. Having the central location for everything company incorporation-related in our Stripe dashboard - where we’re already comfortable - and small things like document and personal info checklists, only having to pay a single entity (Stripe) instead of a million small fees, along with just having the whole thing on rails, makes Atlas a great proposition.</p>
<h2 id="other-stripe-resources">Other Stripe Resources</h2>
<p>Here are a few resources we’ve found useful. They run the gamut from the official sources for some of the technologies we’ve mentioned to particularly good community discussions around common issues.</p>

        <h2>About Singular Value Decomposition</h2>
        <p>
          A matrix of size <span>m × n</span> is a grid of real numbers consisting of <span>m</span> rows and <span>n</span> columns.
          In linear algebra, a branch of mathematics, matrices of size <span>m × n</span> describe linear mappings from <span>n</span>-dimensional to <span>m</span>-dimensional space.
          The word linear roughly means that straight lines map to straight lines and the origin in <span>n</span>‑dimensional space maps to the origin in <span>m</span>‑dimensional space.
          When we have an <span>(m × n)</span>‑matrix <span>A</span> and a <span>(n × k)</span>‑matrix <span>B</span>, we can compute the product <span>AB</span> which is an <span>(m × k)</span>‑matrix.
          The mapping corresponding to <span>AB</span> is exactly the composition of the mappings corresponding to <span>A</span> and <span>B</span> respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition">Singular Value Decomposition</a> (SVD) states that every <span>(m × n)</span>‑matrix <span>A</span> can be written as a product
        </p>
        
        <p>
          where <span>U</span> and <span>V</span> are orthogonal matrices and the the matrix <span>Σ</span> consists of descending non-negative values on its diagonal and zeros elsewhere.
          The entries <span>σ<sub>1</sub> ≥ σ<sub>2</sub> ≥ σ<sub>3</sub> ≥ … ≥ 0</span> on the diagonal of <span>Σ</span> are called the <em>singular values</em> (SVs) of <span>A</span>.
          Geometrically, <span>Σ</span> maps the <span>j</span>‑th unit coordinate vector of <span>n</span>‑dimensional space to the <span>j</span>‑th coordinate vector of <span>m</span>‑dimensional space, scaled by the factor <span>σ<sub>j</sub></span>.
          Orthogonality of <span>U</span> and <span>V</span> means that they correspond to rotations (possibly followed by a reflection) of <span>m</span>‑dimensional and <span>n</span>‑dimensional space respectively.
          Therefore only <span>Σ</span> changes the length of vectors.
        </p>
        <h2>Using SVD for image compression</h2>
        <p>
          We can decompose a given image into the three color channels red, green and blue.
          Each channel can be represented as a <span>(m × n)</span>‑matrix with values ranging from 0 to 255.
          We will now compress the matrix <span>A</span> representing one of the channels.
        </p>
        <p>
          To do this, we compute an approximation to the matrix <span>A</span> that takes only a fraction of the space to store.
          Now here's the great thing about SVD: the data in the matrices <span>U</span>, <span>Σ</span> and <span>V</span> is sorted by how much it contributes to the matrix <span>A</span> in the product.
          That enables us to get quite a good approximation by simply using only the most important parts of the matrices.
        </p>
      </div><div>
        <p>
          We now choose a number <span>k</span> of singular values that we are going to use for the approximation.
          The higher this number, the better the quality of the approximation gets but also the more data is needed to encode it.
          We now take only the first <span>k</span> columns of <span>U</span> and <span>V</span> and the upper left <span>(k × k)</span>-square of <span>Σ</span>, containing the <span>k</span> largest (and therefore most important) singular values.
          We then have
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The amount of data needed to store this approximation is proportional to the colored area:
        </p>
        <p>
          compressed size = <span>m × k</span> + <span>k</span> + <span>k × n</span> = k × (<span>1</span> + <span>m</span> + <span>n</span>)
        </p>
        <p>
          (Actually, slightly less space is needed due to the orthogonality of <span>U</span> and <span>V</span>.)
          One can prove that this approximation is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-rank_approximation#Basic_low-rank_approximation_problem" title="Eckart–Young–Mirsky theorem">optimal in a certain sense</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This demo lets you choose the number of singular values <span>k</span> and see how this choice affects the quality of the approximation and the compression rate.
          Notice how for all photographs, the graph showing the singular values looks like a hyperbola: there are only a few really large SVs and a long tail of relatively smaller SVs.
          In contrast, for the random noise image the graph of SVs looks roughly linear.
        </p>
        <p>
          SVD is routinely used in statistics for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis">principal component analysis</a> and in numerical simulations for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_order_reduction">reducing the order of models</a>.
          For image compression, more sophisticated methods like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_uNPbdenRs">JPG</a> that take human perception into account generally outperform compression using SVD.
        </p>
        <h2>About this demo</h2>
        <p>
          The <a href="http://www.netlib.org/clapack/">CLAPACK</a> library provides the algorithm for computing the SVD.
          Since CLAPACK is a C library (it is a translation of the Fortran library LAPACK) we use <a href="https://github.com/kripken/emscripten">emscripten</a> to translate it to JavaScript/asm.js.
          The SVDs of all three color channels are computed in parallel on the client-side using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_worker">web workers</a>.
          To provide the quick preview, we use <a href="https://research.facebook.com/blog/294071574113354/fast-randomized-svd/">a randomized algorithm</a> to compute an approximate truncated SVD with 50 singular values.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div property="content:encoded"><p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this media release used a hypothetical example that suggested that Google used information about users’ health to personalise or target advertisements. Google says that it does not show personalised ads based on health information. This example has been removed from the media release.</em></p>

<p>The ACCC has launched Federal Court proceedings against Google LLC (Google), alleging Google misled Australian consumers to obtain their consent to expand the scope of personal information that Google could collect and combine about consumers’ internet activity, for use by Google, including for targeted advertising.</p>

<p>The ACCC alleges Google misled consumers when it failed to properly inform consumers, and did not gain their explicit informed consent, about its move in 2016 to start combining personal information in consumers’ Google accounts with information about those individuals’ activities on non-Google sites that used Google technology, formerly DoubleClick technology, to display ads.</p>

<p>This meant this data about users’ non-Google online activity became linked to their names and other identifying information held by Google. Previously, this information had been kept separately from users’ Google accounts, meaning the data was not linked to an individual user.</p>

<p>Google then used this newly combined information to improve the commercial performance of its advertising businesses.</p>

<p>The ACCC also alleges that Google misled consumers about a related change to its privacy policy.</p>

<p>“We are taking this action because we consider Google misled Australian consumers about what it planned to do with large amounts of their personal information, including internet activity on websites not connected to Google,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said.</p>

<p>“Google significantly increased the scope of information it collected about consumers on a personally identifiable basis. This included potentially very sensitive and private information about their activities on third party websites. It then used this information to serve up highly targeted advertisements without consumers’ express informed consent,” Mr Sims said.</p>

<p>“We allege that Google did not obtain explicit consent from consumers to take this step.”</p>

<p>“The use of this new combined information allowed Google to increase significantly the value of its advertising products, from which it generated much higher profits.”</p>

<p>“The ACCC considers that consumers effectively pay for Google’s services with their data, so this change introduced by Google increased the “price” of Google’s services, without consumers’ knowledge,” Mr Sims said.</p>

<p><strong>“I agree” notification</strong></p>

<p>The conduct is alleged to have impacted millions of Australians with Google accounts.</p>

<p>From 28 June 2016 until at least December 2018, Google account holders were prompted to click “I agree” to a pop-up notification from Google that purported to explain how it planned to combine their data, and sought the consumers’ consent for this.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p><em>Some new features for your Google Account</em></p>

	<p><em>We’ve introduced some optional features for your account, giving you more control over the data Google collects and how it’s used, while allowing Google to show you more relevant ads.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The notification also stated,&nbsp;<em>“More information will be available in your Google Account making it easier for you to review and control”</em>; and&nbsp;<em>“Google will use this information to make ads across the web more relevant for you.”</em></p>

<p>Before June 2016, Google only collected and used, for advertising purposes, personally identifiable information about Google account users’ activities on Google owned services and apps like Google Search and YouTube.</p>

<p>After June 2016, when consumers clicked on the “I agree” notification, Google began to collect and store a much wider range of personally identifiable information about the online activities of Google account holders, including their use of third-party sites and apps not owned by Google.</p>

<p>Previously, this additional data had been stored separately from a user’s Google account.</p>

<p>Combined with the personal data stored in Google accounts, this provided Google with valuable information with which to sell even more targeted advertising, including through its Google Ad Manager and Google Marketing Platform brands.</p>

<p>The ACCC alleges that the “I agree” notification was misleading, because consumers could not have properly understood the changes Google was making nor how their data would be used, and so did not - and could not - give informed consent.</p>

<p>“We believe that many consumers, if given an informed choice, may have refused Google permission to combine and use such a wide array of their personal information for Google’s own financial benefit,” Mr Sims said.</p>

<p><strong>Privacy policy change</strong></p>

<p>Before 28 June 2016, Google stated in its privacy policy that it&nbsp;<em>“will not combine DoubleClick cookie information with personally identifiable information unless we have your opt-in consent.”</em></p>

<p>On 28 June 2016, Google deleted this statement and inserted the following statement:<em>&nbsp;“[d]epending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.”</em></p>

<p>Google’s privacy policy also states:&nbsp;<em>“[w]e will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent.”</em></p>

<p>The ACCC alleges that Google did not in fact obtain consumers’ explicit consent for this change to the privacy policy, and that Google’s statement that it would not reduce consumers’ rights without their explicit consent was therefore misleading.</p>

<p>“Google made a clear representation about how it would protect users’ privacy. The ACCC alleges that Google made changes without obtaining the explicit consent it had promised consumers it would obtain before altering how it protected their private information,” Mr Sims said.</p>

<p><strong>DoubleClick</strong></p>

<p>In 2008, Google acquired DoubleClick, a supplier of ad-serving technology services to publishers and advertisers.</p>

<p>Google now supplies DoubleClick’s services through its Google Ad Manager and Google Marketing Platform brands, which are the leading suppliers of ad-tech intermediary services.</p>

<p>These services track users’ internet activity on third-party sites that display ads through the use of DoubleClick’s advertising technology.</p>

<p>Google’s acquisition of DoubleClick required approval by competition authorities including the US Federal Trade Commission and the European Commission. The ACCC also reviewed and cleared this transaction.</p>

<p>FTC and EC cleared the acquisition, and in doing so considered submissions from Google that it would not be able to combine DoubleClick’s data on consumers’ internet activity with its own data about consumers’ activity on Google services because, at the time, DoubleClick’s contracts with its users prevented Google from doing so.</p>

<p>The agencies did not, however, rely on these submissions in clearing the acquisition.</p>

<p>Before 28 June 2016, Google collected and stored this information on a non-personally identifiable basis, as stated in its privacy policy.</p>

<p>On 28 June 2016, it changed its privacy policy by removing the term explaining how it would treat this DoubleClick data.</p>

<p><strong>Images</strong></p>

<p>Depending on the device and Google service being used by the consumer, the notification published by Google from 28 June 2016 was presented in a variety of ways. A copy of the notification in the form published to consumers using desktop devices is provided below for reference.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>I bit the bullet and reformatted my MacBook Pro over the weekend. My motivation for doing this was to start from scratch to figure out what apps I need. I’m documenting the process I followed here. This guide is a work-in-progress.</p>



<h3>Backing Up My Files</h3>



<p>I wanted to keep it simple and work on organizing all of my files later. So I used the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bombich.com/" target="_blank">Carbon Copy Cloner</a> to do the hard work with backing up all my files over to my Drobo 5N. This took longer than I expected, so be patient.</p>



<h3>Signing Out</h3>



<p>You’ll need to make sure you sign out and deauthorize applications before you reformat.</p>



<h3>Installing Applications and Configuring</h3>



<p>Since I’m a developer, I’m always on the lookout for MacBook setup guides. I found <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.taniarascia.com/setting-up-a-brand-new-mac-for-development/" target="_blank">this</a> impressive guide by Tania Rascia and was inspired to make my own. </p>



<p>After installing <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">Homebrew</a>, here are the apps I installed.</p>



<pre><code>brew install \
  git \
  yarn \
  make 

brew cask install 1password bartender brave-browser carbon-copy-cloner cleanmymac cleanshot screenflow visual-studio-code google-chrome firefox iterm2 docker vlc slack keybase postgres postico postman coda malwarebytes steam dotnet-sdk
</code></pre>



<p>Since I needed to install Mac Store apps, I installed and used the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/mas-cli/mas" target="_blank">mas-cli</a>.</p>



<pre><code>brew install mas</code></pre>



<pre><code>mas install 937984704 1091189122 775737590 634148309 441258766 1274495053 568494494 485812721 497799835

# Amphetamine
# Bear
# iA Writer  
# Logic Pro X
# Magnet
# Microsoft To Do 
# Pocket
# TweetDeck
# Xcode</code></pre>



<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask-versions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cask-versions</a> to install alternative versions of applications that I haven’t upgraded like Alfred.</p>



<pre><code>brew tap homebrew/cask-versions</code></pre>



<pre><code>brew cask install alfred3 # then activated my power pack license</code></pre>



<p>Turn off spotlight keyboard shortcut and set keyboard shortcut to <code>CMD + spacebar</code> for Alfred.</p>



<h3>iTerm2 Setup</h3>



<p>I followed <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gist.github.com/kevin-smets/8568070" target="_blank">this</a> to setup my iTerm2.</p>



<h3>Visual Studio Code</h3>



<pre><code>{
    "workbench.startupEditor": "newUntitledFile",
    "workbench.colorTheme": "New Moon",
    "terminal.external.osxExec": "iTerm.app",
    "terminal.integrated.shell.osx": "/bin/zsh",

    "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
        "terminal.foreground": "#839496",
        "terminal.background": "#002833",
        "terminal.ansiBlack": "#003541",

        "terminal.ansiMagenta": "#d33682",
        "terminal.ansiRed": "#dc322f",
        "terminal.ansiWhite": "#eee8d5",
        "terminal.ansiYellow": "#b58901",
        "terminal.ansiBrightBlack": "#586e75",

        "terminal.ansiBrightYellow": "#657b83",
        "terminalCursor.foreground": "#839496",
        "terminalCursor.background": "#003541"
    }
}</code></pre>



<h3>Setting Up A Directory Structure for Projects</h3>



<p>I recommend using Stuart Ellis’ <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.stuartellis.name/articles/mac-setup/#setting-up-a-directory-structure-for-projects" target="_blank">directory structure</a> for projects, which looks like this for me.</p>



<pre><code>code/

    github.com/
      westerncj/
        a-project/
    gitlab.com/
      cwestern/

<![CDATA[Lessons on how to be a better engineer from Michael Jordan]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><span><p>Over the month, the Netflix’s show “The Last Dance” featuring Michael Jordan’s last year in the bull’s NBA team helped to shine light of his victory and success in his time to the public. Personally as a basketball lover, I’ve always followed him and his amazing story since the beginning of the internet era (I’m serious!). However, getting to 2 years into my software engineering journey helped me see different principles from his life that I could apply into my tech journey. In this post, I’ve decided to share with you all 6 lessons for the 6 championships that MJ has gotten in his career.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>1. Competitive: there is this need for him to win!</h2>

<p>Here’s this short video that simply puts this competitive aspect of him across clearly!</p>

<p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b6vlV0mUxs4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>

<p>As we can see from his life and the especially in the most recent show that came out “The Last Dance”, we could see how he is competitive on almost every aspect of life. From the game of basketball to the game of golf and to tossing coin that is the nearest to the wall.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>“Mike will compete with anything, though. If we’re drinking water, Mike will be like, ‘I’ll race you!’”<br>
Source:&nbsp;Jimmy Kimmel Live</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s the lesson I’ve learnt from him to apply into my software engineer journey: Apart from short once-off games such as a casual golf match, or one-on-one basketball matches, many times in technology, the way to show success over another company or implementation is long term. It isn’t a short fight, every technology solution requires time and effort to implement. But the key take away isn’t to compete with companies, more often than not, you can find yourself collaborating such there both parties can win. I guess the key takeaway is that sense of self confidence. When you first start off your blogging venture like I did, you look into the industry and you start seeing all the successful blogs with million views and high passive income. And you wonder how can you even compare? The message we can take away from Michael Jordan is that attitude that never backs down. You may be the under-dog today but you do not have to stay this way, and you can deliberately choose to be better than what you are now.</p>
<br>
<h2>2. Passion was his fuel. Pour your love into everything you do.</h2>
<br>
<div><p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bMmvIxxADg2PenWvuEErUUJIsA8=/0x0:3029x2033/1820x1213/filters:focal(1066x671:1550x1155):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66666326/101527P_MICHAEL_JORDAN_BULLS.0.jpg" alt=""><em>Michael Jordan crying as he won his first championship</em><br>
￼</p></div>
<p>Here’s a short video that managed to capture the emotions that was building in that locker room after the victory that night.</p>

<p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ir0-t5Yfq-Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>

<p>There’s just so much emotions, energy, and heart placed into this game. From the story of him being cut from his high school basketball team that hurt him over the summer. He decided to pour his heart and do his absolute best to get back onto the team. It has been 7 years since he entered NBA and to finally be able to reach to the top through the many years. Even as Michael cried holding that trophy, there was just so much passion and emotions put into whatever he did.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>”I’ve been waiting seven years for this and I thank God for blessing us to make it possible,”</p>
<p>”This is the happiest moment of my life,” Jordan said. “We did it. We did it as a team. I’ve been fighting to hold back my emotions all week. But I knew we would win it tonight and I knew my emotions would get the best of me. I’m just happy.”<br>
Jordan said.</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>Heart is what separates the great from the good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, I do see parallel behaviors among the giants even in the technology scene as well. We can see that from the life of Steve Jobs. Here’s an article that briefly talked about his stroy.</p>
<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/11/why-steve-jobs-cried/">Why Steve Jobs cried</a></p>

<p>The main point isn’t to cry over every thing that happened but to talk about that deep sense of passion and heart in what you do. I guess such a level of passion in any tasks or goal speaks more of the dedication that person has as an individual than about the seriousness of the task.</p>

<p>If you want to excel into any industry, you got to have that passion that pushes you beyond the boundaries to explore what could be beyond this limit. This is all the more true in the technology industry where all these technologies advancing with new updates or releases. In order to keep up, you got to have that sense of curiosity to find out what the industry has done to solve all the different problems you have. Only when you have that sense of curiosity then can you want to go out there to find out what are these technology giants doing. Let me give you an illustration:</p>

<p>Here’s a <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://roadmap.sh/devops">Roadmap for devops engineer</a>. It basically charts out for you the set of learnings or knowledge you should know or master if you ever chooses to walk down this path of being a devOps engineer.</p>

<p><strong>Just look at the amount of technology in one single page</strong>. And each box properly takes an individual years to master, and some even pursue just one box their entire career. If you did not have any interest or deep passion for the tools out there, you will probably just ignore most of that because you could just make do with the tools you already know to ‘hack’ your way to a solution.</p>

<p>The successful techies are not always the oldest, but more often than not, you find in these people a deep sense of curiosity and passion for the technology. The way they describe technology almost always sound like they are describing a friend you have to got to know on a daily basis. And one day, I aspire to be like one of them as well (:</p>
<br>
<h2>3. Focused on what he wants to do. And actually go get it</h2>

<p>One common trait among all great players or individuals that we know of, Warran buffet, Steve jobs, and Michael Jordan: They had laser sharp focus on what they want to do.</p>

<p>The focus to improve is not found on the court. What you see on the court in public’s view was merely the outcome of the grind behind closed doors in the gym. The focus to improve starts in the gym behind closed doors and far from media. He made sure to practice harder than that he played. That intensity of personal practice allowed him to create that familiarity and comfort zone during game time, and all he had to do was the react to what his body was already accustomed to do. He focused on getting his fundamentals right. Focused to perfect the small things that noone seem to notice. People only saw the outcome of that focus to little details.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>Doing the little things until perfection becomes a habit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many times people chase after the shiniest objects in the technology space - AI, Automation, Machine Learning. In the act of chasing, people lose sight of the fundamentals - understanding the business problem or creating product and services that business actually need or even simply just focusing on writing clean, testable, and readable code. While articles about AI and Machine learning may create some wows, it is the seemingly dull and ‘boring’ habits of consistently writing code, learning about good coding practices that sharpens your fundamentals. When it is crunch time, you will find yourself well equipped to shine in your work. These little act of grinding can be attending online courses to learn more about courses that does hands-on projects with you.</p>

<p>One such course is <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pluralsight.com/">Plural sight</a>. They have really detailed courses with instructors that will guide you through the fundamentals of what you are learning, impart the best practices and share their learning in a walkthrough guide that you can do alongside them. Another will be udemy. Check those out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When you practice daily and deliberately, you will find yourself ready when the next challenge or problem comes your way.</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<h2>4. Together we can do more: he has a close group of people to keep him grounded</h2>

<p>People do not usually see this aspect of him when we hear of the great Michael Jordan. Many instances, I’ve noticed from all the videos, he always had the support of his parents and siblings when he hits rock bottom. Even during the first championship, his dad was present there alongside him. And was also there to deal with backlashes about MJ’s gambling habits.</p>

<p>Imagine the devastation to know that your strong support was taken away just like that.</p>

</p>

<p>If you want to go far, you have to go together as a team. Over the years, I’ve came to understand that if we want to solve problems that are bigger than ourselves - societal issues, you have to have a team alongside you. You have your strength to offer to the table, but rarely do we see how our strengths alone is able to bring a holistic solution. Yes, you may be an amazing god-like engineer that can replicate another google. Even with all the knowledge in the world, you lack the one resource you cannot buy - time. Everyone of us needs one another. In technology, the ability to come together with our different skills and collaborate opens up door of opportunities.</p>
<br>
<h2>5. Know how to respond to failure: failure is the only way to success</h2>

<p>Michael Jordan did not fear the spot light. He did not shy away from the crunch time. When it was time for the bulls team to take the final score, it goes to him without a question. But that illusion of ‘success since birth’ did not start that way. He was not always a winner. There is this famous quote from him:</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’ve missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I’ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.”</p>
</blockquote>

</p>

<p>It is always easy to make sense of all these failures on hindsight - this is called the hindsight bias, where the decisions and circumstances you faced seems like an invisible ink before the good outcome, but plain as day after the outcome as if a fool would have missed it.</p>

<p>Similarly in technology, as you start off, you will find yourself deep into the unknown; overwhelmed with unfamiliarity regarding the technology you have to deal with in order to deliver the solution. You make mistakes in your earlier days and thus causing scalability issues when the solution starts to scale to hundreds of people. Since that feature is implemented by you, these mistakes and bugs are starting to …</p></span></p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-8a4d83837a563922fa44"><p>One of the most challenging aspects of starting and maintaining a business, regardless of whether you are a freelancer or a conglomerate, is determining the right price to charge for your services.&nbsp; If you are an economist, the ideal price is simply the point at which demand meets supply.  If a price is too high the demand for the service will go down thereby resulting in excess supply or capacity by the service provider.  If the  price is too low then demand will increasing leaving the supplier less availability to meet demand.  Of course, pricing can be significantly more complex than this and has become a lot more sophisticated in recent years.   Businesses pay thousands of dollars to pricing consultants for strategies that take numerous factors into consideration when determining pricing.  One only has to look to airlines as example of a seemingly inscrutable pricing model.  Unfortunately, smaller businesses, freelancers and startups don’t usually have the budget for a pricing strategist and have to make do by searching for information available on the internet, discussing it with their business associates  or simply using their gut to come up with something that makes sense.  As an internet source, I have set out a strategy for determining a price for your services </p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_7_1439256306507_6993"><div><h3><strong>Calculate Baseline Pricing for Your Services</strong></h3><p>A good starting point is to determine how much you could earn if you were employed either full time or part time, and translate this to an hourly rate.&nbsp;&nbsp; Below is a calculator to help you determine your hourly rate based on a full time salary:</p><p><strong>Annual Salary</strong> estimate for an employee doing the same job </p><p><strong>Annual Tax Benefits Paid By Employer</strong> including <a href="https://www.montrealfinancial.ca/blog/understanding-payroll-deductions-personal-income-tax-rates-c.html">Payroll taxes such as CPP, QPIP, QHSF</a> as well as group insurance, automobile allowance,<a href="https://www.montrealfinancial.ca/blog/guidelines-for-deducting-conference-and-training-expenses"> professional development</a> etc.  This is usually calculated as 10-15% of your salary.</p><p><strong>Annual Estimated </strong><a href="https://www.montrealfinancial.ca/blog/20-essential-tax-facts-for-small-business-owners.html"><strong>Expenses</strong> of running the business</a> could include rent, supplies, direct expenses of supplying the service, subcontractors, subscriptions, office supplies etc.</p><p><strong>Number of WEEKLY TOTAL hours </strong>that you plan to work in your business .  This is usually 35-40 hours if you plan to work full time but can also be less if you only plan to work part time.</p><p><strong>Number of WEEKLY Hours Spent on Administration&nbsp;</strong> represents a variety of <a href="https://www.montrealfinancial.ca/blog/the-many-hats-of-self-employment.html">administrative tasks such as marketing, accounting, sales, IT, updating your website </a>etc. that can take up a significant amount of time but for which you can’t specifically charge your clients.  Instead this is built into your hourly rate. </p><p><strong>Number of Weeks&nbsp;<em>Per Year</em></strong>&nbsp;Working on Business can be anywhere up to 52 weeks.  If you want to take 4 weeks of vacation per year, this number would be 48 weeks.</p><h3><strong>HOURLY RATE CALCULATOR FOR BUSINESS SERVICES:</strong></h3></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594594020315_43906"><div><p>Using the calculator above, if you were to work 40 hours a week, you would need to charge $37.50 an hour to earn an amount that is approximately equivalent to $50,000 a year. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Compare the Baseline Hourly Rate to Competitors and other sources</strong></h3><p>In order to identify the competition, you should search for similar business with comparable service offerings and determine pricing for their services.  You will likely find a wide range of pricing which is influenced by where you are located, how much experience you have, the breadth of services that you are able to offer including complementary services (eg. offering web development along with web hosting).  Once you have an idea of what the fees are for their services, you can see how your own baseline compares.  </p><p>It can also be useful to speak to colleagues, other business owners and post on business related message boards/sub-reddits etc. to try and glean what a reasonable rate is for the services that you are providing.  Other sources include UpWork, Fiverr and other freelance websites where people often post their services that will provide more of a range.  </p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594594020588_38801"><div><h3><strong>Determine how you are going to differentiate your services from your competitors</strong></h3><p>Since almost every existing service is already being provided by someone else and your competition is no longer only businesses in your area, but anyone who is willing to work remotely, it is essential that you think about what differentiates you and your service offerings from the other businesses in your space.&nbsp; There are numerous ways of differentiating yourself:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Offer a complimentary service to every client that signs up with you, </p></li><li><p>Personalize the services to meet your clients needs.&nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Have a unique pricing structure that is based on results (see discussion on pricing below)</p></li><li><p>Create a loyalty program</p></li><li><p>Offer a money back guarantee if they are not satisfied</p></li><li><p>Write articles that highlight your expertise or create an app that is useful to your target market</p></li></ul><p>Once you have honed in on what differentiates your service offerings, you need to be able to communicate this effectively to your potential clients.  This will allow them to see the value in your services.  Although, many businesses particularly, when they are first starting out, feel that they have to compete on price, this could not be further from the truth.  Often potential customers will shy away from the lowest cost option as this might suggest lower quality.  Also, they are looking to solve a problem and many business owners know from experience that going with the cheapest provider who ultimately can’t provide them with the service they need, can end up being more costly in the long run.</p><h3><strong>come up with a pricing strategy for your services</strong></h3><p>There are essentially two ways you can price your services:</p><p><strong>Hourly Based Pricing</strong></p><p>Perhaps  the most popular method by which business price their services is on an hourly basis.  The benefit of hourly pricing is that it is simple to implement and to track.  Clients will often expect to pay an hourly rate and therefore it is an easier sell.  The downside of pricing on an hourly basis is that clients  are often (unpleasantly) surprised by the amount of time a job may take which requires justification and often requires that you reduce your price just to keep them happy.  The other significant downside is that, to paraphrase <a href="https://amzn.to/3fpatAq">Ronald Baker</a> , you have created a ceiling on how much you can charge.  This means that since you only have a limited amount of time, there is a maximum amount that you can earn which is the number of hours worked times X your hourly rate.</p><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3fpatAq">Value Based Pricing</a></p><p>Simply speaking, value based pricing is the price that you would charge to a customer based on the value that they perceive.  A great example of this would be a painting by Van Gogh.  If you were to take the cost of materials and labour (his hourly rate would have been very low in his lifetime), the painting would sell for a few hundred dollars. Using the value pricing model, his painting “<em>The Portrait of Doctor Gachet” </em>sold for more than $80 million, which was the value of the painting to the purchaser.  Sadly, most of us cannot charge $80 million for our services.  However, it does underline the point that customers might be willing to pay more for our services as long as we can demonstrate their value to them.  </p><p>Demonstrating value can be done in a variety of ways.  One example would be to show a customer how your web development service where you implement an online shopping app will directly increase their revenues.  A pricing structure can be created whereby you charge the customer for the percentage of increase in revenues or it can be a hybrid of a fixed price for the project + a percentage of sales.  Another example would be to communicate to them on how your accounting service will help them to reduce their interest and penalties by ensuring that tax returns are filed or debt payments are made on a timely basis. A third example would be a collection service that promises to improve the collection of customer receivables by 25% thereby increasing the customer’s cash flow.  </p><p>All of these are examples of services that could be highly valuable to a client.  The goal for the business service provider is to put a value on how much these services are worth and charge that price.  The benefits of the value pricing model is that the customer knows exactly how much they are going to pay up front so there are no surprises and the price of the service can be quite a bit higher than simply charging the hourly rate than the number of hours.  The downside is that you have to effectively communicate to your client the value of your service.  Also,  there might be unforeseen issues or it might end up taking much longer than you anticipated.  </p><p>Using value based pricing requires that you essentially provide a pre-determined price, that you and your client agree on, for a project or ongoing service.  An excellent resource on the subject can be in found in <a href="https://amzn.to/3fpatAq">Ronald Baker’s book on value pricing</a>.  Once you have calculated how much you are going to charge, you can bill your client once certain milestones have been reached, all at once or for ongoing services on a monthly basis.  It can also be very useful to provide a client with different options (usually 3 options) to choose from which increases the likelihood that they will choose one of the options.  (This is a variation on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">Monty Hall problem</a> where simple probability suggests that there is a only a 50% chance of choose one of two options but a 75% chance of choosing one of 4 options)</p><p>Although overvaluing your services can be bad for business, undervaluing them can be equally damaging. Clients are often more willing to stick with a business that provides great service, is passionate , possesses superior knowledge and continues to provide value on an ongoing basis rather than one that only offers a lower price.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>]]>

  <p><span>24 Jul 2020</span></p><p>Dependency Inject (DI) is one of the most notable practices to create reliable and high-quality software. This effort enables us to keep the extensibility without losing readability and testability. You may have encountered a situation where you would want to replace any objects in the software flexibly like me. Many frameworks or libraries are allowing us to make use of the dependency injection in our software project. In my case, I would like to use <a href="https://dagger.dev/">Dagger</a> in our web application using <a href="https://www.dropwizard.io/">Dropwizard</a>. But I was ignorant of what Dagger was and how to use it in our Dropwizard project. Hence, this article is for writing down the process to get started with Dagger in your web application using Dropwizard.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-dagger">What is Dagger</h2>

<p>First of all, what is Dagger? Dagger is a Java-based dependency injection library originally invented by <a href="https://squareup.com/">Square</a>. For now, it’s mainly maintained by Google as an open-source project.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.lewuathe.com/assets/img/posts/2020-07-24-how-to-inject-jersey-resource-in-dropwizard-with-dagger/dagger.png" alt="Dagger"></p>

<p>You might hear about <a href="https://github.com/google/guice">Guice</a> before, which is also maintained by Google. It has a more extended history than Dagger. Despite that, Dagger has a more significant number of stars in <a href="https://github.com/google/dagger">its GitHub repository</a>. Why is Dagger more popular than Guice? There are several reasons from my perspective.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dagger is compiling time DI library, while Guice’s injection happens at runtime</li>
  <li>Guice often causes challenging error to solve relating to its reflection usage</li>
  <li>Dagger provides more simple APIs to use</li>
  <li>Dagger has notable use cases due to the adoption in the Android development</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, I try to use Dagger in our web application this time.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-integrate-dagger-in-dropwizard-project">How to integrate Dagger in Dropwizard project</h2>

<p>What I’m going to do is integrate Dagger in a Dropwizard project to inject Jersey resources flexibly. Before going deeper into this goal, we need to be familiar with some Dagger terminologies.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Module</code>: Has associations between the interface and actual injected objects.</li>
  <li><code>Component</code>: Constructs a whole graph resolving the dependencies of injected objects</li>
</ul>

<p>Unlike Guice, what I’ve found is that we needed to construct one more class called <code>Component</code>. The component is a sort of highest level class managing all objects injected by Dagger. Therefore, all objects should be injected from the component.</p>

<p>In our case, we will create <code>WebResourceModule</code> for the module and <code>WebappComponent</code> for the component.</p>

<p>The client of the injected class can use the <code>javax.inject.Inject</code> annotation. Constructor injection or field injection is recommended in Dagger.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>@Path</span><span>(</span><span>"/users"</span><span>)</span>
<span>class</span> <span>UserResource</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>@Inject</span>
  <span>public</span> <span>UserResource</span><span>(</span><span>UserConfig</span> <span>userConfig</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Used for the user resource specific configuration</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>config</span> <span>=</span> <span>config</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We are going to inject <code>UserConfig</code> as we like by using Dagger.</p>

<p>The dagger library can be imported with the following code in <code>build.gradle</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>dependencies</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>implementation</span> <span>'com.google.dagger:dagger:2.28.1'</span>
  <span>annotationProcessor</span> <span>'com.google.dagger:dagger-compiler:2.28.1'</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="module-and-component">Module and Component</h2>

<p>First, we define the module to illustrate how to construct the target <code>UserConfig</code> class.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>dagger.Module</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>dagger.Provides</span><span>;</span>

<span>@Module</span>
<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>WebResourceModule</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>final</span> <span>UserConfig</span><span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>WebResourceModule</span><span>(</span><span>Configuration</span> <span>configuration</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>userConfig</span> <span>=</span> <span>configuration</span><span>.</span><span>getUserConfig</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>@Provides</span>
    <span>UserConfig</span> <span>provideUserConfig</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>userConfig</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>@Provides</code> annotation lets the compiler know how to construct the class at the compile time. Therefore, all classes in the application use the <code>UserConfig</code> constructed by the method, <code>provideUserConfig</code>. Next, we can create a module class for building the whole dependency graph.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>dagger.Component</span><span>;</span>

<span>@Component</span><span>(</span><span>modules</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>WebResourceModule</span><span>.</span><span>class</span><span>})</span>
<span>public</span> <span>interface</span> <span>WebappComponent</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>UserResource</span> <span>getUserResource</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The argument of <code>@Component</code> annotation specifies the modules knowing how to construct the injected objects. All <code>WebappComponent</code> interface needs to provide is the method to build the object we finally want to get. In this case, the web resource which will be registered into the Dropwizard later. That’s all that we must do with Dagger.</p>

<p>But here comes one question. Who creates the instance of <code>WebappComponent</code>? The answer is Dagger. Dagger generates a class prefixed by <code>Dagger</code>. In this case, <code>DaggerWebappComponent</code> will be created to construct the <code>UserResource</code> from it. Additionally, it provides us a way to bind a module at runtime.</p>

<h2 id="dropwizard-application">Dropwizard Application</h2>

<p>In the Dropwizard, we will get the component class to get the <code>UserResource</code> and register it as a jersey resource.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Application</span> <span>extends</span> <span>io</span><span>.</span><span>dropwizard</span><span>.</span><span>Application</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Configuration</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

                        <span>.</span><span>build</span><span>();</span>

    <span>environment</span><span>.</span><span>jersey</span><span>().</span><span>register</span><span>(</span><span>component</span><span>.</span><span>getUserResource</span><span>();</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>DaggerWebappComponent</code> has a builder interface to bind the module at runtime. By changing the module here, we can change the behavior. For the test purpose, we can write a component like this.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>WebappComponent</span> <span>testComponent</span> <span>=</span> <span>DaggerWebappComponent</span><span>.</span><span>builder</span><span>()</span>
                    <span>.</span><span>webResourceModule</span><span>(</span>
                            <span>new</span> <span>TestWebResourceModule</span><span>(</span><span>configuration</span><span>)</span>
                    <span>.</span><span>build</span><span>();</span>

<span>UserResource</span> <span>testUserResource</span> <span>=</span> <span>testComponent</span><span>.</span><span>getUserResource</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It obviously helps us write more testable code.</p>

<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up</h2>

<p>As we saw now, using a Dagger looks easy. Dagger enabled me to write more maintainable code without learning many things. Its simple APIs significantly reduce the trouble and burden to employ the DI framework in our software projects. Let’s try to use Dagger in your Dropwizard project as well!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-e31d7a75b991deb6415c"><div><h2>Who?</h2><p>I identified with Eric Weinstein so much because of the shared struggles with the educational system.&nbsp;</p><p>Eric became a <strong>beacon of hope</strong> for me when he started sharing his story and lessons he learned throughout his impressive career as an academic, mathematician, physicist, economist, managing director of Thiel Capital, and podcaster.&nbsp;</p><p>Although he’s been told he is dyslexic, dysgraphic, color blind, ADD, and kinesthetic reinforcement deficits, he is proof of the educational system debacles. He says, “All BS. I wasn’t meant for educators, as those are actually their issues with me (i.e. teaching disabilities).”</p><p>He’s an inspiration as I’ve faced similar obstacles especially with the focus of compliance in the educational system over creativity, curiosity, even intellect has <a href="https://www.juandavidcampolargo.com/blog/highschool" target="_blank">hurt me in my educational career</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Why Should You Care?</h2><p>I started writing these <a href="http://juandavidcampolargo.com/newsletter" target="_blank">essays</a> and making <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU87CN_FxGC1q3hzWM0CCDA" target="_blank">videos</a> because <strong>ideas are the currency of the 21st century. </strong>I humbly believe the ideas I share could help others as I pursue my <a href="http://juandavidcampolargo.substack.com/" target="_blank">Curiosities</a><em>.</em></p><p>Eric Weinstein’s ideas have awakened me and showed a world unknown to most people, such as the real world of academia and science.&nbsp;</p><p>One of these ideas is what he calls the <strong>DISC</strong> (Distributed Idea Suppression Complex) which explains how disruptive and innovative ideas that challenge the status quo are suppressed. Keeping institutions safe from individuals who create change.&nbsp;</p><p>The DISC is spread throughout major institutions such as in academia, the mainstream media, and politics. It tries to undermine ideas that may challenge or weaken the elite. This isn’t directly planned, and it’s not under central control.&nbsp;</p><p>Eric and his family have been victims of the DISC multiple times. Eric in physics, his wife in economics, and his brother in biology. He started noticing the same pattern in politics when MSNBC hid polling graphics of presidential candidate Andrew Yang.&nbsp;</p><p>The DISC is only one of these marvelous ideas that Eric explores in his podcast called The Portal where he explores subjects including science, economics, culture, politics, and business.&nbsp;</p><p>The goal of the show is to help you see the world through a different lens, which opens up your mind to new ways of viewing events and your life. Each guest is a portal to a reality showcasing what we would normally consider impossible, are indeed possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s visit The Portal!</p><h2>Favorite Episodes</h2><p>Eric launched The Portal in June 2019 and less than a year later has created a community of people who want to explore this hidden reality and discover new portals.&nbsp;</p><p>Eric has wide expertise in many fields, but what’s interesting is how he engages your mind, moves your heart, and lights a spark in your soul. Eric can discover unexplored worlds and bring them back to his audience. Sometimes, complex or hard to understand, but always interesting where you get the sense of upgrading your mind.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are my favorite episodes:</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9f0W2KD5s" target="_blank"><strong>1: Peter Thiel:</strong></a><strong> </strong>this was how I found the podcast. Peter rarely appears on interviews, so I knew this one had to be special. Peter Thiel is one of the most influential and contrarian thinkers of the last decades. He’s also the co-founder of PayPal and Palantir. He was also the first big investor in Facebook.&nbsp;</p><p>Peter and Eric challenge our way of thinking and encourage us to see things differently. For instance, they discussed the relationship between growth and violence. Thiel argues that if economic growth is low, violence is more likely to arise. He highlights that violence among humans is high because according to Rene Girard, we want what other people want, giving rise to conflict.&nbsp;</p><p>This may be one of the best episodes in the history of podcasts. I found this conversion can help you understand Girard’s theories' implications in society, especially in a time of wealth gap inequality, racial conflicts, and a pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>They also discussed the era of stagnation, the future of education, student debt, the broken world of academia, and polymaths.&nbsp;</p><p>Peter (a conservative) and Eric (a progressive) discuss ideas with unique and often opposing views as they try to find a solution and reach an agreement on his arguments.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://plinkhq.com/i/1469999563/e/1000462975502" target="_blank"><strong>19: Bret Weinstein - The Prediction and the DISC:</strong></a><strong> </strong>In this rigid conversation with Bret, they talked about the DISC and how it affected Bret with one of his biology discoveries.&nbsp;</p><p>In this episode, Eric eagerly tries to get his brother to tell the story of his powerful finding. Bret discovered that the mice we use for medical trials have ultra-long telomeres (something humans don’t have) and that these “hide” the dangers of certain medicines. This same discovery could cure cancer and end aging.&nbsp;</p><p>After he discovered this, he tried to go the usual path of peer-review and so on. According to the podcast, he was silenced. Yet his findings were taken and made someone else the Nobel Prize winner.&nbsp;</p><p>A mind-blowing episode that will stir your curiosity and make you learn about the findings, the DISC, and The Portal.</p><p><a href="https://plinkhq.com/i/1469999563/e/1000460365533" target="_blank"><strong>17: Anna Khachiyan - Reconstructing The Mystical Feminine From The Ashes Of “The Feminine Mystique”:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Eric interviews Anna, who is a Russian-American social, literary and artistic theorist. She is also the co-host of the fierce and popular Red Scare podcast.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>At the beginning of the conversation, Eric tells her, “I've been addicted to your podcast not quite understanding why. It's one of the strangest things I've ever found.” That’s exactly how I felt.&nbsp;</p><p>They talked about mystery and how society thought we wanted clarity and directness. But what we actually want is mystery, especially in our relationships.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, they talked about the importance of mystery and what it means to be mysterious. This episode will help you perceive the significance of how we can use mystery in our lives.</p><p>I’ll be honest, I don’t know why I liked this episode, but I listened to it several times and it was weirdly fascinating.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BONUS </strong><a href="https://plinkhq.com/i/1469999563/e/1000477637846" target="_blank"><strong>36: Dark Matter, Black Matters and All That Jazz</strong></a><strong> </strong>with Stephon Alexander is an amazing episode to learn more about physics, racial issues, and music.&nbsp;</p><h2>Geometrically Unified</h2><p>I disagree with many of Eric’s views, however I still consider him a role model because of his love and passion for science. He proposed a theory of everything called Geometric Unity where he tried to explain and combine all physical aspects of the universe.&nbsp;</p><p>I love learning about science. I read books, email experts, watch interviews, write essays, and listen to podcasts like The Portal to learn more about science.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Science</strong> combined with <strong>entrepreneurship</strong> has the power to create a world of progress and technological advancement, so we create a world of equality, fairness, and peace.&nbsp; That’s what I hope to do with my life.&nbsp;</p><p>I hope you find Eric’s work as interesting, fascinating, and curious as I have.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks to <a href="https://jenvermet.com/" target="_blank">Jen</a>, <a href="https://salman.io/" target="_blank">Salman</a>, <a href="https://juliasaxena.com/" target="_blank">Julia</a>, and <a href="https://fullofkrapp.com/" target="_blank">Kevin</a>  for reading drafts of this essay. </p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595770382135_5451"><p>If you’re into interesting ideas (like the one you just read), join us at our<a href="https://juandavidcampolargo.com/newsletter"> </a><a href="https://juandavidcampolargo.com/newsletter" target="_blank"><strong>newsletter</strong></a>, and I’ll send you new essays right when they come out. <br></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <hr> 
<p>I manage this website with markdown and a shell scripts. Hereâ€™s how.</p>

<ul>
<li>Fast load time</li>
<li>Minimal Interface</li>
<li>A site directory</li>
<li>Readable URLs</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>A fancy framework</li>
<li>Site analytics/admin interface</li>
<li>Large files</li>
<li>Ads</li>
</ul>

<p>I spent some time in HTML/CSS designing a header for the site. This includes a generic title for each page, an â€œAboutâ€� tab, â€œPostsâ€� tab, â€œContactâ€� tab, and horizontal bar to separate the header from the body. I linked each tab to the URL I planned for each page, which is my domain (jarbus.net) followed by the filename with the <code>.html</code> extension removed. (e.g.Â&nbsp;jarbus.net/About)</p>
<p>I write all my posts in markdown, then convert it to HTML using <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a>.</p>
<p>I wrote a conversion script to turn an HTML file for a post into an HTML file for the site. I accomplish this by creating a new file consisting of the header HTML mentioned, concatenating with the post HTML afterwards. I also run a <code>sed</code> command to replace the generic title in the header for the filename of the post, with dashes replaced with spaces.</p>
<p>I keep my markdown files in a directory called â€œdraftsâ€�, which is sibling to the GitHub Pages repository thatâ€™s hosting my website. When Iâ€™m done with a post, I convert it to a site page, move it to the git repository, then push. Itâ€™s that easy!</p>
<p>The <a href="http://jarbus.net/Posts">Posts</a>, <a href="http://jarbus.net/About">About</a>, <a href="http://jarbus.net/jarbus.net">Index</a>, and <a href="http://jarbus.net/Contact">Contact</a> pages all maintained as above. I used to have a script to automatically recreate my <a href="http://jarbus.net/Posts">Posts</a> page to add new entries, but found that I much prefer the curated &amp; categorical page I have now.</p>

<p>I also have an <a href="http://jarbus.net/feed">rss feed</a>, which I update manually. However, given that adding a new entry simply requires putting</p>
<pre><code>&lt;item&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;
    PostName
  &lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;link&gt;
    https://www.jarbus.net/PostName
  &lt;/link&gt;
&lt;/item&gt;</code></pre>
<p>at the top of my feed file, I think Iâ€™ll manage. Plus, I enjoy the ability add custom tags on a post by post basis if I decide to.</p>

<p>Overall, Iâ€™m really happy with how the site turned outâ€“I have absolute control over all aspects of my blog while doing negligible content management. I have lighting-fast load times, a minimal interface, and can fix any aspect of my site were something to break.</p>

    <div>
        <p>As much as I like the Amazon Firestick and Apple TV, both are missing a killer smart TV feature: the ability to easily make memes from viewed content.</p>

<p>Currently, if you want to make a meme from video content, you need to either screenshot the appropriate frames or capture a section of the video. This can be done somewhat easily on mobile and increasingly so on desktop, but it’s still a chore.</p>

<p>But if you are sitting on the couch and you see something funny on your Smart TV, the process of creating a meme is much higher friction. How likely is it that you will pull out another device, find the same content all-over again, capture it, then edit into a meme? I’m exhausted just at the thought.</p>

<h2 id="proposed-solution-meme-it">Proposed Solution: “Meme It!”</h2>

<p>Instead, what if the next time you are watching TV and you see a funny and loop-able moment like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://jelling.io/assets/img/memeit/Loop.png" alt="Lucille Bluth's exaggerated wink on Arrested Development"></p>

<p>Or you see a funny clip of a show like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://jelling.io/assets/img/memeit/Panels.png" alt="Scene from Parks and Rec"></p>

<p>You, as the user, can just speak into your smart TV remote and say “Meme It!”</p>

<p><img src="http://jelling.io/assets/img/memeit/Capture.png" alt="User says &quot;Meme It!&quot; into smart TV remote"></p>

<p>Later at your convenience, you can edit the desired video into a meme using the smart TV app on your phone. By default, the previous 10 seconds of audio, video, and closed captioning text. But if you want to capture more time just say “Meme It last X seconds.”</p>

<p>And unlike creating memes on mobile or desktop, the “Meme It” server knows that the user is capturing media for the purpose of meme creation as opposed to capturing video or business purposes. As a result, the server can then process the video and create markers with thumbnails for each cut from one camera view to another or moments when the total count of people / entities in-frame changes.</p>

<h2 id="usages-and-applications">Usages and Applications</h2>

<p>Publishing the resulting memes to social networks is table-stakes but a few more interesting applications include:</p>



<p>As OTT networks continue to compete for increasingly limited disposal personal income, any strategy that increases stickiness at a lower cost than exclusive content can and should be tried in my opinion. And while I do not think an OTT social network will ever replace the dominant social networks, users could still find value in them if they are integrated into the media consumption. What that would look like would vary by platform: any Disney social features will need to be closely moderated for family friendliness while Adult Swim’s would be a much wilder and woolier place.</p>

<h3 id="meme-based-content-discovery">Meme-Based Content Discovery</h3>

<p>Further, I wouldn’t mind browsing TV content via Memes. It is frustrating to wait and see if one likes a new TV show - maybe it gets funnier in the next episode, or maybe it doesn’t - but seeing a few of the shows greatest moments in meme format could help.</p>

<p><img src="http://jelling.io/assets/img/memeit/Show%20Page.png" alt="Parks and Rec show page with memes"></p>

<h3 id="personal-meme-wallet">Personal Meme Wallet</h3>

<p>Most memes are currently created for distribution in the relatively “big rooms” of social networks. As high friction as it is to create video memes right now, that makes sense in terms of the effort:reward ratio.</p>

<p>But as “Meme It!” drastically reduce the required work, people will create more memes, and I expect, increasingly for smaller audiences, such as families or partners. That 3 second video loop may not be funny to everyone but it might slay in your small group, especially if it was initially viewed together. To facilitate this, any memes created via “Meme It” in a “Meme Wallet” that can be accessed via iMessenger / Hangouts / Whats App / any messaging application.</p>

<h2 id="potential-blocks-and-objections">Potential Blocks and Objections</h2>

<p>Content Publishers may not like the idea of more people repurposing their content but I think this is counter-productive. Just like it is largely true that there’s no such thing as bad publicity, having content memed is free advertisement for the original piece of content.</p>

<p>I would go as far as to say that shows that are not memed will have much shorter lifespans than those that are. No-one who is currently 12 years old will be unaware that the TV show “The Office” exists due to the plethora of memes from the show. But “Seinfeld” is far less memed and I suspect it will fade quicker as a result.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>The “Meme It!” Smart TV voice command would let smart TV users easily create memes from recently watched content. Reducing the friction of creating memes would lead to more fun memes and frankly we could all use a little more of that right now. And meme-ing video content is effectively free advertising so hopefully copyright rights holders will give this their blessing.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This essay is an illustrated proof of the No Free Lunch (NFL) theorem; the NFL theorem has many variants, which all say slightly different things. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_theorem">most famous one</a> says, roughly, that every learning algorithm has the same performance, when averaged across all possible target functions. In other words, there is no universal learning algorithm that outperforms every other algorithm on every learning task.</p>

<p>Throughout this essay, I'm going to be refering to a "learning algorithm". If you're unfamiliar, in the machine learning context, a learning algorithm is an algorithm that takes in \(S\), a series of (x,y) pairs, i.e. our training data or training set, from some target function and outputs a hypothesis, which is a function that tries to be close to the original target function. Note that the inputs and outputs aren't necessarily  binary, but it's easier to illustrate them as such, and the proof is not affected. Learning algorithms are often evaluated by looking at the error rate, which in the case of classification, is the proportion of \((x,y)\) pairs it predicts incorrectly.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/hypothesis.svg"></p>

<p>In this essay, I will focus on an easier NFL theorem (from <a href="https://www.cse.huji.ac.il/%7Eshais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/index.html">Understanding Machine Learning by Shai Shalev-Shwartz and Shai Ben-David</a>) which says, roughly, for any learning algorithm that outputs a binary function, there exists a distribution that will cause it to output a hypothesis with a high error rate, even when there exists another function that can achieve 0 error on the distribution. In other words, for every learning algorithm, we can find a distribution that can trip up the learning algorithm.</p>

<p>How do we formalize this? </p>

<p>The NFL theorem we're going to prove states that:</p>

<p>Say we have a learning algorithm A which outputs a binary classifier (this is our hypothesis) over a domain \(X\). </p>

<p>Next, let's define an error or loss function, which will tell us how well our output hypothesis does on the actual distribution. We'll use the <strong>1</strong> loss function \(L\) which, when given two inputs, outputs 0 if the two values match, otherwise it outputs 1. Then, there exists a distribution \(D\) over \(X \times \{0,1\}\) (i.e. a distribution over possible \((x,\{0,1\})\) values) such that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There exists a function \(f: X \to \{0,1\}\) with \(L_D(f) = 0\). That is, there is some binary function over \(X\) such that the expected loss of \(f\) over \(D\) is 0. In other words, there is some function which will correctly classify all the points in our distribution correctly.</p></li>
<li><p>With probability of at least \(\frac{1}{7}\) over the choice of \(S \sim D^m\) \(L_D(A(S)) \ge \frac{1}{8}\). In other words, for at least \(\frac{1}{7}\) of all possible training sets of size \(m\) from \(D\), the expected loss of output of the training algorithm on the training set is at least  \(\frac{1}{8}\). (Note that our loss function is defined here as the average <strong>1</strong> loss across all points in the distribution).</p></li>
<li><p>The distribution \(D\) is defined over \(2m\) points, so our training set will consist of at most \(m\) unique values, i.e. half of the distribution's points. </p></li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/nfl-base.svg"></p>

<p>To prove this, we are actually going to prove something different, but equivalent. Instead, we are going to prove that:</p>

<p>\(\underset{i \in [T]}{\text{max }} \underset{S \sim D_i^m}{\mathbb{E}} [L_{D_i}(A(S))] \ge 1/4\)</p>

<p>That is, if we run our learning algorithm on training sets of size \(m\), across a family of distributions \(D_1-D_T\), the largest such expected loss will be at least \(\frac{1}{4}\). In other words, we will show that at least one distribution \(D_i\) from this group will trip up our algorithm.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/dist-one-fourth-error.svg"></p>

<p>To see how these two statements are equivalent, we just apply a modified version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov%27s_inequality">Markvov's inequality</a>. This lower bounds how likely a random variable is to be greater than some value:</p>

<p>\(P(X \ge a) \ge \frac{\mathbb{E}[X]-a}{1-a}\)</p>

<p>Applying that to our inequality above, we see that:</p>

<p>\(P(L_{D_i}(A(S)) \ge \frac{1}{8}) \ge \frac{\frac{1}{4}-\frac{1}{8}}{\frac{7}{8}} \ge \frac{1}{7}\) as desired. So now we just need prove this new inequality.</p>

<p>Before that, here's the intuition for why this inequality is true:</p>

<p>First, our learning algorithm only gets half of all possible points as its training set. This means our algorithm knows nothing about the labels of the other half of the points. Now, if we assume that every function over these unknown points is equally likely, then each point is either 1 or a 0. This means that our algorithm can only guess for these unknown points, which makes its expected error rate 0.5. So in the best case, it'll still get an error rate of 0 on the half it sees and 0.5 on the half it doesn't see, which makes its overall error 0.25.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/seen-unseen-data.svg"></p>

<h3>The Proof</h3>

<p>Now, let's begin the proof.</p>

<p>Let \(C \subseteq X\) such that \(|C| = 2m\). So it's a subset of our input space that's of size \(2m\). </p>

<p>Notice that there are \(T = 2^{2m}\) possible functions from \(C\) to \(\{0,1\}\).  Let \(D_i\) be the distribution over \(D\) that only assigns probability to the \((x,f_i(x))\) pairs for the corresponding function. This captures the idea that our input space \(C\) is twice the size of our training set, and that each function is equally likely. </p>

<p>Each function is now turned into a probability distribution that places \(\frac{1}{|C|}\) probability if the given \((x,y)\) point is one of the function's input/output pairs, and 0 probability otherwise. So each unique function has a unique distribution associated with it.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/function-dist.svg"></p>

<p>Recall that we're trying to calculate \(\underset{i \in [T]}{\text{max }} \underset{S \sim D_i^m}{\mathbb{E}} [L_{D_i}(A(S))]\), i.e. the expected loss over all possible training examples, with regards to the distribution that maximizes this loss. </p>

<p>For any given distribution,  \(\underset{S \sim D_i^m}{\mathbb{E}} [L_{D_i}(A(S))]\) is the loss for a given training set, averaged over all possible choices of training data. </p>

<p>If our input space consists of \(2m\) points and our training data consists of a sequence of \(m\) points, then there are \(k = (2m)^m\) possible sequences. </p>

<p>Below, we'll let \(S_j^i\) be the \(i^{th}\) possible sequence of training data, labeled with the \(j^{th}\) possible function. </p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/sij.svg"> </p>

<p>Thus, we know that \(\underset{S \sim D_i^m}{\mathbb{E}}[L_{D_i}(A(S))] = \frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=1}^kL_{D_i}(A(S^i_j))\). In other words, for any one given distribution of data, the expected loss of our learning algorithm (across all training data sets) is equal to the expected loss if we take \(m\) training points, averaged across all possible functions that could label the data.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/one-distr-error.svg"> </p>

<p>Recall that, from above, we care about taking the <strong>maximum</strong> error across all possible distributions; by definition, this will be at least as big as the <strong>average</strong> loss across all distributions. Thus, we know that:</p>

<p>\(\underset{i \in [T]}{\text{max }} \frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=1}^kL_{D_i}(A(S^i_j)) \ge \frac{1}{T}\sum^T_{i=1}\frac{1}{k}\sum^k_{j=1}L_{D_i}(A(S^i_j))\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/sum-distr-training.svg"> </p>

<p>Next, it doesn't really matter if we take the average over all distributions first or the average over all training sets first. Thus, we can switch the order of the summations to get the same value:</p>

<p>\(\frac{1}{T}\sum^T_{i=1}\frac{1}{k}\sum^k_{j=1}L_{D_i}(A(S^i_j)) =\frac{1}{k}\sum^k_{j=1}\frac{1}{T}\sum^T_{i=1}L_{D_i}(A(S^i_j))\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/sum-training-distr.svg"></p>

<p>Now, if we're taking the loss averaged over all training data, notice that this will necessarily have to be at least as big as the loss given by the training data which leads to the <strong>smallest</strong> average loss. </p>

<p>Thus, we can replace our inequality with a smaller, simpler one. Our inequality has to be at least as large as the average loss (across all functions) when applied to that specific training set.</p>

<p>\(\frac{1}{k}\sum^k_{j=1}\frac{1}{T}\sum^T_{i=1}L_{D_i}(A(S^i_j)) \ge \underset{j \in [k]}{\text{min }} \frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^TL_{D_i}(A(S^i_j))\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/one-training-error.svg"> </p>

<p>So we've been abstractly talking about the loss function for a while now. What does \(L_{D_i}(h)\) actually represent? We want it to be how well our hypothesis does on a specific distribution \(D_i\). One straightforward way to formalize this is to just go through all \((x,y)\) pairs in \(D_i\) and take the average <strong>1</strong> loss between \(y\) and \(h(x)\):</p>

<p>\(L_{D_i}(h) = \frac{1}{2m}\sum_{x\in C}\mathbf{1}[h(x) \not= f_i(x)]\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/loss.svg"></p>

<p>Next, let's fix some \(j \in [k]\), which has \(m\) training examples given by \(S_j = (x_1,..,x_m)\). Let \((v_1, ...,v_p)\) be the examples in \(C\) (all data points) that <strong>aren't</strong> in \(S_j\). We can see that \(p \ge m\) because at most we have half the data from the distribution, which is when we have no duplicates.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/p-data.svg"> </p>

<p>Thus:</p>

<p>\(L_{D_i}(h) =\frac{1}{2m}\sum_{x\in C}\mathbf{1}[h(x) \not= f_i(x)] \ge \frac{1}{2p}\sum_{j=1}^p\mathbf{1}[h(v_j) \not= f_i(v_j)]\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/loss-p.svg"> </p>

<p>In other words, the average loss over all points in the distribution is at least half of the average loss over all points <strong>not</strong> in the training set. </p>

<p>Now, we can substitutue this in for \(L_{D_i}\) from our inequality earlier to get:</p>

<p>\( \frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^TL_{D_i}(A(S^i_j)) \ge \frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^T \frac{1}{2p}\sum_{j=1}^p\mathbf{1}[h(v_j) \not= f_i(v_j)]\)</p>

<p>So now we're taking the loss across all functions, across all points in \((v_1,...,v_p)\). Like before, we can swap the order of the summations:</p>

<p>\( \frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^T \frac{1}{2p}\sum_{j=1}^p\mathbf{1}[h(v_j) \not= f_i(v_j)] =\frac{1}{2p}\sum_{j=1}^p\frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^T \mathbf{1}[h(v_j) \not= f_i(v_j)]\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/sum-p-dist.svg"></p>

<p>Once again, we can upper bound this inequality by noticing that the average loss across all points in \((v_1,...,v_p)\) and across all functions has to be at least the loss of the point \(v_r\) which we assume to be the point which gives the minimal loss:</p>

<p>\(\frac{1}{2p}\sum_{j=1}^p\frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^T \mathbf{1}[h(v_j) \not= f_i(v_j)] \ge \frac{1}{2}\underset{r \in [p]}{\text{min}}\frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^T \mathbf{1}[h(v_r) \not= f_i(v_r)]\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/one-p-error.svg"></p>

<p>Now, notice that we can partition \([T]\) into \((f_a, f_b)\) pairs such that \(f_a\) and \(f_b\) agree on every value except …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-450095a061b684fe116b"><div><p>Beginning in 2013, I began a series of essays that outlined my vision for an OTT “<a href="https://redef.com/original/disney-as-a-service-why-disney-is-closer-than-ever-to-walts-60-year-old-vision">Disney as a Service</a>” subscription, including how it would work, its likely <a href="https://redef.com/original/disney-as-a-service-pt-ii-and-the-future-of-the-house-of-mouse">pricing</a> ($6) and release date (2019), and why it was <a href="https://redef.com/original/nine-reasons-why-disney-will-succeed-and-why-four-criticisms-are-overhyped">likely to rapidly attract tens of millions of customers</a>. These pieces were based on my reading of (and obsession with) Disney’s corporate strategy and culture, the strength of its IP, the decisions it’d begun to make behind the scenes, as well as the developing changes in media technology and business models. <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/6/10/18658964/amazon-prime-video-netflix-disney-plus-streaming-video-lotr-matthew-ball-peter-kafka-media-podcast">Vox/Recode</a> has reported on how the “DAAS” series has influenced Bob Iger and Kevin Mayer.</p><p>To this end, I’m often asked about Nintendo (one of few companies I adore more). Many believe that Nintendo is Disney circa 2014 or 2015 or 2016 or 2017 — and thus poised for substantial growth as it makes the transition to online or D2C or OTT distribution or mobile or [new thing]. And certainly, there are many similarities. There is no other gaming company with more beloved and long-running IP, a stronger culture of creativity in storytelling, a deeper history of immersive/technological innovation, more resonant content brand, and so on. </p><p>In fact, it’s easy to map the Disney ethos to Nintendo’s more recent public positioning. In early 2019, Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aime gave a speech in Seattle where he said that Nintendo aspires to be an "entertainment" company, not a gaming one: “That time you spend surfing the Web, watching a movie, watching a telecast of a conference: that's all entertainment time we’re competing for. [Nintendo]’s competitive set is much bigger than [its] direct competitors in Sony and Microsoft. [Nintendo] competes for time.”</p><p>Furthermore, Fils-Aime declared that the Nintendo now had three "pieces of business": (1) a dedicated proprietary hardware video game business ("the way most of our consumers interact with us"); (2) a mobile gaming business; (3) the expansion of Nintendo’s IP outside of core gaming applications (“[Nintendo is] about Mario, Zelda, Pokémon — all these wonderful intellectual properties… How we leverage these across a variety of entertainment platforms is how we're looking to grow the company… a belief that [consumers will] come back, maybe buy a Mario T-shirt, eat that Mario cereal, or buy a Switch, because of affiliation and affection they have with that IP.”)</p><p>This framing feels a lot like Disney saying films are the core of its entertainment flywheel, that OTT streaming video is the company’s new growth and investment area, and that it will continue to proliferate its IP into emergent categories. And, as with Disney in the early- to mid-2010s, there’s evidence of this transition. The company is underway with its first-ever theme park lands, its first feature film in nearly three decades, and several new interactive merchandise partnerships with the likes of Lego and more.</p><p>More broadly, one could argue Fils-Aime’s positioning and Nintendo’s commercial expansions suggest a company ready to conquer all entertainment platforms as part of the ever-growing “IP” wars. The focus on minutes, for example, sounds more like a mega-cap tech company like Microsoft, Netflix, or Amazon than it does a modest Japanese game maker. And while Nintendo might be late to individual battles, one key lesson of the past twenty years is that top IP is more valuable and extensible than ever believed before. And thus, for the very same reason Nintendo’s IP feels under-tapped today, it can be tardy and still rise to the top — like Disney in streaming. And given the enormous growth potential in the category (which some consider to be in the trillions), Nintendo could grow several fold (prior to COVID, Disney was up 45% since announcing Disney+).</p><p>However, the “Nintendo is Disney” thesis is deeply flawed. It feels more like a desire to apply a pattern than to find a real analogue. Elements of Nintendo certainly represent Disney, but they represent Disney insofar as both companies are best in class creators of four-quadrant, multi-generational content. Otherwise the businesses are fundamentally different, their management styles fundamentally different, and their approaches to content itself are fundamentally different, too.</p><p>The best way to unpack this is to walk through Nintendo’s culture in (1) Hardware; (2) Content, as is shown through the company’s efforts in mobile; and (3) Ambition. After that, I’ll discuss the company’s future (sections four and five).</p><p><span><strong>#1: Nintendo’s Hardware Culture</strong></span></p><p>There are essentially four types of companies in gaming:  </p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Platforms like Microsoft, Sony and Valve, which produce hardware and/or operate digital stores that allow players to play games. In exchange, the platforms take a percentage of each game sold for their platforms (and associated in-game sales), plus charge various license fees to publishers, and often sell additional services to their user base</p></li><li><p>Publishers like EA and Activision Blizzard, which finance the creation of games and manage their marketing and distribution, in exchange for (or by loaning out) IP, equity in the title, and the associated majority of profits </p></li><li><p>Developers like Naughty Dog and Visual Concepts, which literally design and “make” a game</p></li><li><p>Infrastructure and middleware providers like Epic Games, Unity, Amazon and Microsoft, which operate extensive technology suites that enable developers to more easily create, distribute, and operate their games. In this case, they take a licensing fee, typically as a percentage of revenue or based on total traffic/data/etc.</p></li></ol><p>Each of the major platforms also owns (or has exclusivity agreements) with top publishers, which in themselves own (and/or have exclusive agreements with) top developers. This allows the platforms to differentiate their hardware through exclusive content. This is particularly helpful when releasing a new generation of consoles. At launch, a console’s player base is too small for major developers to prioritize versus building games for the outgoing generation (which, by definition, will have a larger customer base than ever before). However, a platform’s goals are much broader than maximizing the sales of a specific title — it hopes to build an ecosystem where it nets revenue from the sale of all titles. Other variations of this model exist. Valve, for example, sometimes develops games (which it then publishes) to drive not just its platforms (Steam) but also its game engine, Source, or the industry overall (e.g. virtual reality).</p><p>Nintendo is unique as a “hardware platform” because it really isn’t one anymore. <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1210345159549968384?s=20">To quote Tim Sweeney</a>, founder and CEO of Epic Games, “something is a platform when the majority of content people spend time with is created by others.” Although Nintendo operates a hardware platform like Microsoft’s Xbox or Sony’s PlayStation, 85% of software sold for Nintendo hardware is now made by Nintendo. This is the reverse of industry averages (e.g. 85%+ of PlayStation playtime comes from games not published by Sony). This makes Nintendo a sort of fifth type of company. They make hardware so that its development arm can make the games it wants to make, which also happens to be hardware that other developers can distribute their games through but mostly don’t. (It is true that the NES and SNES era saw vast third-party libraries, but Nintendo being the standard-bearer of third-party gaming content has not been valid since 1995, when the PlayStation launched).</p><p>And over the past forty years, it’s indisputable that Nintendo’s development arms have been the best in the business. Per GameRankings/Metacritic, five of the top ten and nine of the top twenty best reviewed games of all time come from the Kyoto-based company.</p><p>Because Nintendo thrives at content but doesn’t generate platform-like profits, investors have long argued Nintendo should get out of the hardware business and focus exclusively on games. This would produce value in several ways. First, hardware sales typically generate little to no profit as it’s sold below and/or near manufacturing cost. This low margin strategy isn’t a problem if you can make it up in third-party licensing fees (i.e. from the sale of games made by others), but per above, this business is marginal for Nintendo. In addition, the cost of developing, marketing, and holding inventory is high.</p><p>This approach also limits the sales potential for Nintendo’s games to those who own their hardware. There are over a hundred million PlayStation and Xbox consumers who might happily buy <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> or <em>Super Mario</em> for $60 to play on their PlayStation or Xbox but won’t spend $300 on a Switch just to do so. (And then there are the hundreds of millions of iPads, iPhones and Androids, which I’ll get into later.)</p><p>For twenty years, Nintendo has refused this strategy. And to the company’s credit, its dedication to hardware has led to significant innovation in the marketplace. Nintendo created the D-Pad, analog stick, and rumble packs, and was first to distribute VR, motion-based, and fully portable consoles. These hardware innovations resulted in content innovations, too (e.g. Wii Sport, Wii Fit, Brain Age, etc.). It’s also clear that when Nintendo achieves a consumer tech breakthrough, it sees substantial in-generation console success (e.g. Nintendo Wii, Nintendo Switch).</p><p>At the same time, the “breakthrough” Nintendo consoles tend to see substantially less success than most assume. And they don’t ever really “break away” from their competitors, either. The Wii “won” the seventh generation with unit shipments of roughly 105MM. But PlayStation 3 did 90MM and Xbox 360 hit 85MM. This isn’t a huge gap, especially given the latter two were $100-150 more. More revealing is the fact that the Wii’s early lead in the seventh generation was substantially larger than its finishing win. The PlayStation 3 and Wii both launched in November 2006, but after a year, Nintendo had nearly 200% greater sales (17MM v 6.5MM). The Wii launched a year <em>after </em>the Xbox 360, at which point the …</p></div></div></div>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In modern computer programming, concurrency is often required to accelerate solving a problem. In Python programming, we usually have the three library options to achieve concurrency, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html"><code>multiprocessing</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html"><code>threading</code></a>, and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html"><code>asyncio</code></a>. Recently, I was aware that as a scripting language Python’s behavior of concurrency has subtle differences compared to the conventional compiled languages such as C/C++.</p>



<p><a href="https://realpython.com/">Real Python</a> has already given a good <a href="https://realpython.com/python-concurrency/">tutorial</a> with <a href="https://github.com/realpython/materials/tree/master/concurrency-overview">code examples</a> on Python concurrency. In this blog post, I would like to discuss the <code>multiprocessing</code>, <code>threading</code>, and <code>asyncio</code> in Python from a high-level, with some additional caveats that the Real Python tutorial has not mentioned. I have also borrowed some good diagrams from their tutorial and the readers should give the credits to them on those illustrations.</p>

<h3 id="cpu-bound-vs-io-bound">CPU-Bound VS I/O-Bound</h3>

<p>The problems that our modern computers are trying to solve could be generally categorized as CPU-bound or I/O-bound. Whether the problem is CPU-bound or I/O-bound affects our selection from the concurrency libraries <code>multiprocessing</code>, <code>threading</code>, and <code>asyncio</code>. Of course, in some scenarios, the algorithm design for solving the problem might change the problem from CPU-bound to I/O-bound or vice versa. The concept of CPU-bound and I/O-bound are universal for all programming languages.</p>

<h4 id="cpu-bound">CPU-Bound</h4>

<p>CPU-bound refers to a condition when the time for it to complete the task is determined principally by the speed of the central processor. The faster clock-rate CPU we have, the higher performance of our program will have.</p>

<div>
<figure>

    <figcaption>Single-Process Single-Thread Synchronous for CPU-Bound</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>Most of single computer programs are CPU-bound. For example, given a list of numbers, computing the sum of all the numbers in the list.</p>

<h4 id="io-bound">I/O-Bound</h4>

<p>I/O bound refers to a condition when the time it takes to complete a computation is determined principally by the period spent waiting for input/output operations to be completed. This is the opposite of a task being CPU bound. Increasing CPU clock-rate will not increase the performance of our program significantly. On the contrary, if we have faster I/O, such as faster memory I/O, hard drive I/O, network I/O, etc, the performance of our program will boost.</p>

    <figcaption>Single-Process Single-Thread Synchronous for I/O-Bound</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>Most of the web service related programs are I/O-bound. For example, given a list of restaurant names, finding out their ratings on Yelp.</p>

<h3 id="process-vs-thread-in-python">Process VS Thread in Python</h3>

<h4 id="process-in-python">Process in Python</h4>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_interpreter_lock">global interpreter lock</a> (GIL) is a mechanism used in computer-language interpreters to synchronize the execution of threads so that only one native thread can execute at a time. An interpreter that uses GIL always allows exactly one native thread to execute at a time, even if run on a multi-core processor. Note that the native thread here is the number of threads in the physical CPU core, instead of the thread concept in the programming languages.</p>



<p>Because Python interpreter uses GIL, a single-process Python program could only use one native thread during execution. That means single-process Python program could not utilize CPU more than 100% (we define the full utilization of a native thread to be 100%) regardless whether it is single-process single-thread or single-process multi-thread. Conventional compiled programming languages, such as C/C++, do not have interpreter, not even mention GIL. Therefore, for a single-process multi-thread C/C++ program, it could utilize many CPU cores and many native threads, and the CPU utilization could be greater than 100%.</p>



<p>Therefore, for a CPU-bound task in Python, we would have to write multi-process Python program to maximize its performance.</p>

<h4 id="thread-in-python">Thread in Python</h4>

<p>Because a single-process Python could only use one CPU native thread. No matter how many threads were used in a single-process Python program, a single-process multi-thread Python program could only achieve at most 100% CPU utilization.</p>



<p>Therefore, for a CPU-bound task in Python, single-process multi-thread Python program would not improve the performance. However, this does not mean multi-thread is useless in Python. For a I/O-bound task in Python, multi-thread could be used to improve the program performance.</p>

<h3 id="multiprocessing-vs-threading-vs-asyncio-in-python">Multiprocessing VS Threading VS AsyncIO in Python</h3>

<h4 id="multiprocessing">Multiprocessing</h4>

<p>Using Python <code>multiprocessing</code>, we are able to run a Python using multiple processes. In principle, a multi-process Python program could fully utilize all the CPU cores and native threads available, by creating multiple Python interpreters on many native threads. Because all the processes are independent to each other, and they don’t share memory. To do collaborative tasks in Python using <code>multiprocessing</code>, it requires to use the API provided the operating system. Therefore, there will be slightly large overhead.</p>

<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://leimao.github.io/images/blog/2020-07-11-Python-Concurrency-High-Level/CPUMP.webp">
    <figcaption>Multi-Process for CPU-Bound</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>Therefore, for a CPU-bound task in Python, <code>multiprocessing</code> would be a perfect library to use to maximize the performance.</p>

<h4 id="threading">Threading</h4>

<p>Using Python <code>threading</code>, we are able to make better use of the CPU sitting idle when waiting for the I/O. By overlapping the waiting time for requests, we are able to improve the performance. In addition, because all the threads share the same memory, to do collaborative tasks in Python using <code>threading</code>, we would have to be careful and use locks when necessary. Lock and unlock make sure that only one thread could write to memory at one time, but this will also introduce some overhead. Note that the threads we discussed here are different to the native threads in CPU core. The number of native threads in CPU core is usually 2 nowadays, but the number of threads in a single-process Python program could be much larger than 2.</p>

<p>Therefore, for a I/O-bound task in Python, <code>threading</code> could be a good library candidate to use to maximize the performance.</p>



<p>It should also be noted that all the threads are in a pool and there is an executer from the operating system managing the threads deciding who to run and when to run. This can be a short-coming of <code>threading</code> because the operating system actually knows about each thread and can interrupt it at any time to start running a different thread. This is called pre-emptive multitasking since the operating system can pre-empt your thread to make the switch.</p>

<h4 id="asyncio">AsyncIO</h4>

<p>Given <code>threading</code> is using multi-thread to maximize the performance of a I/O-bound task in Python, we wonder if using multi-thread is necessary. The answer is no, if you know when to switch the tasks. For example, for each thread in a Python program using <code>threading</code>, it will really stay idle between the request is sent and the result is returned. If somehow a thread could know the time I/O request has been sent, it could switch to do another task, without staying idle, and one thread should be sufficient to manage all these tasks. Without the thread management overhead, the execution should be faster for a I/O-bound task. Obviously, <code>threading</code> could not do it, but we have <code>asyncio</code>.</p>



<p>Using Python <code>asyncio</code>, we are also able to make better use of the CPU sitting idle when waiting for the I/O. What’s different to <code>threading</code> is that, <code>asyncio</code> is single-process and single-thread. There is an event loop in <code>asyncio</code> which routinely measure the progress of the tasks. If the event loop has measured any progress, it would schedule another task for execution, therefore, minimizing the time spent on waiting I/O. This is also called cooperative multitasking. The tasks must cooperate by announcing when they are ready to be switched out.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<p>The short-coming of <code>asyncio</code> is that the even loop would not know what are the progresses if we don’t tell it. This requires some additional effort when we write the programs using <code>asyncio</code>.</p>

July 26, 2020 | https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/slowsort | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/slowsort">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Slowsort is a sorting algorithm that is designed to be deterministically sub-optimal. The algorithm was published in 1986 by Andrei Broder and Jorge Stolfi in their paper <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2805500_Pessimal_Algorithms_and_Simplexity_Analysis">Pessimal Algorithms and Simplexity Analysis</a> where they expressed a bunch of very in-efficient algorithms. These techniques and algorithms are special because they never make a wrong move while solving a problem, instead, they find ways to delay the success. In this essay, we put our focus on the Slowsort algorithm based on the <em>Multiply and Surrender</em> paradigm.</p>

<p>The <em>Multiply and Surrender (MnS)</em> paradigm, is a humorous take on the popular <em>Divide and Conquer (DnC)</em> technique. MnS splits the problem into subproblems, slightly simpler than the original, and continues doing so recursively for as long as possible. The subproblems are multiplied and the evaluation is delayed till the state that the solving could not be further postponed and then it surrenders.</p>
<p>MnS paradigm is very similar to DnC; but where the DnC actually splits the problems into subproblems to reach the solution quicker, MnS does it to procrastinate, making the entire process very inefficient but yet convergent.</p>
<p>Although Slowsort is a classic example, recursive Fibonacci with no memoization also fares under the MnS paradigm. The recursive code to find <code>n</code>th Fibonacci number is as illustrated below</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>fib</span><span>(n)</span>:</span>
    <span>"""the function returns the `n`th fibonacci number
    """</span>

    
    
    <span>if</span> n &lt; <span>2</span>:
        <span>return</span> <span>1</span>

    
    
    <span>return</span> fib(n - <span>1</span>) + fib(n - <span>2</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>While computing the Fibonacci numbers, we split the problem into subproblems and do this recursively till we are left with elemental states i.e. <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> and which is when we return the initial values which are <code>1</code> and <code>1</code>. This approach is not DnC because we are not splitting the problem into subproblems to achieve optimality, instead are doing a lot of repetitive work and taking a non-polynomial time to generate the Fibonacci numbers.</p>

<p>Slowsort algorithm draws a lot of similarities to the very popular Mergesort, but while Mergesort operates in <code>O(n . log(n))</code> the complexity of Slowsort is non-polynomial <code>O(n ^ log(n))</code> and its best case performs worse than the worst case of bubble sort.</p>
<p>Slowsort algorithm recursively breaks the array sorting problem into two subarray sorting problems and a few extra processing steps. Once the two subarrays are sorted, the algorithm swaps the rightmost elements such that the greatest among the two becomes the rightmost element of the array i.e. the greatest among the two is placed at the correct position relative to each other, and then it invokes the sorting for all elements except this fixed maximum.</p>
<p>The algorithm could this be expressed as following broad steps</p>
<ul>
<li>sort the first half recursively</li>
<li>sort the second half recursively</li>
<li>find the maximum of the whole array by comparing the last elements of both the sorted halves and place it at the end of the array</li>
<li>recursively sort the entire array except for the maximum one</li>
</ul>
<p>The in-place implementation of the Slowsort algorithm is as illustrated below</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>_slowsort</span><span>(a, i, j)</span>:</span>
    <span>"""in-place sorts the integers in the array
    spanning indexes [i, j].
    """</span>
    
    
    
    <span>if</span> i &gt;= j:
        <span>return</span>

    
    
    
    m = (i + j) // <span>2</span>

    
    _slowsort(a, i, m)
    _slowsort(a, m + <span>1</span>, j)
  
    
    
    
    
    
    <span>if</span> a[m] &gt; a[j]:
        a[m], a[j] = a[j], a[m]
  
    
    
    
    _slowsort(a, i, j - <span>1</span>)


<span><span>def</span> <span>slowsort</span><span>(a)</span>:</span>
    <span>"""in-place sorts the array `a` using Slowsort.
    """</span>
    _slowsort(a, <span>0</span>, len(a) - <span>1</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>The Slowsort algorithm typically replaces the <code>merge</code> function of the Mergesort with a simple swap that correctly places the largest element (local maxima) and then invokes the sort function on all but this element. So on every invocation, we keep correctly placing the largest element but in a recursive manner.</p>
<p><em>A visualization of this algorithm could be found in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRoyhGdjnA">youtube video</a>.</em></p>

<p>The runtime of Slowsort could be computed by the following recurrence relation</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/88473102-cb594e80-cf37-11ea-9015-217c3eda50d6.png" alt="slowsort recurrence relation"></p>
<p>When the above recurrence relation is solved and we find that the asymptotic lower bound for <code>T(n)</code> is given by</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/88473128-14a99e00-cf38-11ea-905b-f3f473a0d74c.png" alt="lower bound of slowsort"></p>
<p>The above expression suggests that lower bound of Slowsort is non-polynomial in nature and for a sufficiently large <code>n</code> this would be more than <code>n ^ 2</code> implying that even the best case of Slowsort is worse than the worst case of Bubble sort. The illustration below compares the time taken by Slowsort and the recursive implementation of Bubblesort.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/88475549-8e4c8680-cf4e-11ea-8ee4-9f7ed345ff5d.png" alt="slowsort vs recursive bubblesort"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The iterative implementation of Bubblesort stood no chance in terms of time taken for smaller sets of integers, hence the chart was plotted against the recursive implementation of it. The iterative bubble sort for smaller arrays is nearly flat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort">Bogosort</a> is a sorting algorithm that has an average case time complexity of <code>O(n!)</code> and an unbounded time in the worst case. The algorithm keeps on permuting (shuffling) the array till it is sorted which introduces an unboundedness in its implementation and hence the algorithm is considered to be the worst sorting algorithm ever.</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> random

<span><span>def</span> <span>is_sorted</span><span>(a)</span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> all(a[i] &lt;= a[i + <span>1</span>] <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> range(len(a) - <span>1</span>))

<span><span>def</span> <span>bogosort</span><span>(a)</span>:</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>not</span> is_sorted(a):
        random.shuffle(a)
</code></pre>
<p>The reason that we should rate Slowsort highly is the fact the Bogosort could sort the list in its first shuffle while Slowsort is deterministic and will take <code>O(n ^ log(n))</code> time in best case scenario.</p>
<p>A rule that every algorithm follows is that every step that it takes actually makes some progress towards the final goal. Bogosort does not guarantee progress, and since it randomly shuffles the array, at one iteration we could end up at a nearly sorted array while the next shuffle takes us afar.</p>
<p>Slowsort is deterministic and convergent. The number of swaps made (inversions) during the execution is non-increasing which means once two items are swapped they are in the correct order relative to each other. In other words, we say that Slowsort never makes a wrong move.</p>

<p>I wanted a very easy solution for setting up HTTPS so I recently switched my blog from <a href="#">Nginx</a> to <a href="https://caddyserver.com/">Caddy</a> <a href="#footnote-content-1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>With Caddy I had HTTPS working in <em>minutes</em>, but I had a little trouble setting up a custom 404 page. This is actually very easy to do in Caddy, but it is very hard to figure it out from the documentation. According to the author of Caddy, Matt Holt, <a href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues/3336#issuecomment-623239266">better support for custom error pages will be coming in or after Caddy v2.1</a>.</p>
<p>After reading through <a href="https://caddy.community/t/v2-how-to-achieve-custom-404/6874/5">some</a> <a href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues/3336">forum</a> posts, and learning more about the <code>Caddyfile</code> format, here is the solution I came up with. You can <a href="https://vivekseth.com/djfkladsfjasl">see it working here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="my-caddyfile">My Caddyfile</h2>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>vivekseth</span>.<span>com</span> {
  <span>root</span> <span>*</span> <span>/</span><span>home</span><span>/</span><span>web</span><span>/</span><span>blog</span><span>/</span><span>public</span>
  <span>file_server</span>
  <span>handle_errors</span> {
    <span>rewrite</span> <span>*</span> <span>/</span><span>404</span><span>/</span><span>index</span>.<span>html</span>
    <span>file_server</span>
  }
}

</code></pre></div><p>This tells Caddy to try to serve files from <code>/home/web/blog/public</code>, and to serve <code>&lt;root&gt;/404/index.html</code> whenever it encounters any error.</p>
<p>If you only want to show your 404 page when there is a 404 error, you can use <a href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues/3336#issuecomment-638947294">this snippet</a>.</p>
<h2 id="one-gotcha">One “Gotcha”</h2>
<p>This may seem obvious, but I spent at least 30min trying to debug this issue…</p>
<p>Make sure that the 404 path you use is relative to the “root” you define. For example, since my 404 page is located at <code>/home/web/blog/public/404/index.html</code>, I needed to use <code>/404/index.html</code> as the path. If you use the absolute path to the 404 file, it won’t work.</p>
<p>Hope this helps you set up Caddy with a custom error page!</p>
<hr>

<p><a href="#footnote-link-1">[1]</a> A few days after I set up Caddy, I ended up learning how to set up HTTPS with Nginx using Lets Encrypt. Its actually very easy and only slightly more work than Caddy. If I did not already have Caddy working, I would probably just continue to use Nginx and use Let’s Encrypt’s <code>certbot</code> to generate and auto-renew my SSL certifcates.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>To those of you who give advice on which languages, methodologies, architectures, or whatever else to use, I want to start by saying thank you. Your advice is vital to the growth of millions of people like me who are early in their careers.</p>

<p>But I’ve noticed a pattern with software engineering advice that leads to over-engineering and unnecessary arguments. So I have a request:</p>

<p><em>Please make your advice more specific</em></p>

<p>It’s too often overlooked that there isn’t just one type of “software”, thus it is rare for advice to be applicable to every situation. For example, advice for testing a small B2B web app might not work for embedded device firmware. But it might work for a large B2C web app. And since readers will rarely have experience in all of those situations, I think we should start being more explicit about the applicability of our advice.</p>

<p>Being more specific might help address two big time sinks in the industry:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cargo_culting">Cargo-culting</a>, like when people read how great Kubernetes works for Netflix, but then they decide to use it for a little Django app (that was me a few years ago).</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding">Bikeshedding</a>, like when people argue incessantly that a language is useless because it can’t be used in some niche.</li>
</ol>

<p>A good start might be answering questions like the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Does your advice apply to my scale? (local restaurant website vs. Youtube.com)</li>
  <li>Does your advice apply to my type of product? (library, web app, CLI tool, firmware, on/off-premise, etc.)</li>
  <li>Does your advice apply to my type of users? (developers, enterprises, regular people, etc.)</li>
  <li>If not, what should I use instead? (like <a href="https://adamdrake.com/command-line-tools-can-be-235x-faster-than-your-hadoop-cluster.html">replacing Hadoop with <code>find/xargs/awk</code></a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, it’s hard to find the right balance between hand-holding readers or just saying “buyer beware”. But hopefully spending time to add an extra subheading on “Applicability” to READMEs or blog posts will pay for itself in time spent over-engineering and arguing over minutiae.</p>

        <h2 id="what-is-travis-ci">What is Travis-CI?<a href="#what-is-travis-ci" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>Well, TravisCI is what we call a Continuous Integration(CI) tool. CI is a practice of merging in small code changes frequently instead of doing it at the end of a development cycle where there is a ton of code and you are bound to run into issues which will be harder to debug.
But, having to do frequent changes makes it harder to run tests and deploy it to your server and that’s where Travis steps in. Travis makes it easier to automate your building, deploying and testing stages.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?<a href="#how-does-it-work" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>Travis clones your GitHub repository into a new virtual environment and carries out the series of tasks you write out in your Travis testing file.(.travis.yml)</p>
<p>To learn more about the builds &amp; job lifecycle, check out these two posts:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/for-beginners/#builds-stages-jobs-and-phases">Builds, Stages, Jobs and Phases</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/job-lifecycle/#the-job-lifecycle">The Job Lifecycle</a></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="our-goals">Our Goals<a href="#our-goals" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<ul>
<li>Deploy to a server.</li>
<li>Run any required scripts on the server if required.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="assumptions">Assumptions<a href="#assumptions" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<ul>
<li>You are using GitHub.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="first-time-travis-setup">First-time Travis setup<a href="#first-time-travis-setup" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>If it’s your first time using Travis then you need to define what OS, distribution and/or language your virtual environment will be using. For example:</p>
<pre><code>  os: linux
  dist: bionic
  language: python
  python:
    -'3.7'
</code></pre><p>To read more about this, check out <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/tutorial/#to-get-started-with-travis-ci-using-github">Travis’ Getting Started Guide</a> and <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/python/">Building a Python Project Guide</a> or the guide specific to what programming language you want to use.</p>
<h2 id="setup-ssh-encryption-keys">Setup SSH encryption keys<a href="#setup-ssh-encryption-keys" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>To be able to deploy and run commands on server, you need to have SSH access to it which means you will need an SSH keypair but of course we can’t leave our private key lying around in our repository for everyone to see, so we need to encrypt it so that only the Travis CI can read it. For that, we need to use the Travis CLI to encrypt our files. <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/encrypting-files/">Here’s the relevant Travis Documentation page for it.</a></p>
<ol>
<li>Install Travis</li>
</ol>
<p><code>$ gem install travis</code></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Log-in to Travis and authorise your GitHub account with it</li>
</ol>
<p><code>$ travis login --com</code></p>
<p>The com argument is because we are using travis-ci.com and not travis-ci.org, make sure you are careful around the documentation since travis-ci.com and travis-ci.org have a few differences. <a href="https://devops.stackexchange.com/a/4305">Here is an answer on StackOverflow explaining what the difference is.</a></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Set up SSH keypair</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Generate the keypair</li>
</ul>
<p><code>$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C 'build@travis-ci.com' -f ./deploy_rsa</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Encrypt the deploy_rsa file</li>
</ul>
<p><code>$ travis encrypt-file deploy_rsa --add</code></p>
<p>The <code>--add</code> flag automatically adds the required lines in the .travis.yml file.</p>
<ul>
<li>Install Public SSH key on server</li>
</ul>
<p><code>$ ssh-copy-id -i deploy_rsa.pub &lt;USERNAME&gt;@&lt;DEPLOY-HOSTNAME&gt;</code></p>
<ul>
<li>DELETE the keypair</li>
</ul>
<p><code>$ rm -f deploy_rsa deploy_rsa.pub</code></p>
<p>This is very IMPORTANT, make sure that the private key is not on the repository.</p>
<p>Your .travis.yml file must be looking something like this:</p>
<pre><code>addons:
  ssh_known_hosts: &lt;DEPLOY-HOSTNAME&gt;

before_deploy:
- openssl aes-256-cbc -K $encrypted_&lt;...&gt;_key -iv $encrypted_&lt;...&gt;_iv -in deploy_rsa.enc -out /tmp/deploy_rsa -d
- eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
- chmod 600 /tmp/deploy_rsa
- ssh-add /tmp/deploy_rsa
</code></pre><p>Alright, before we go ahead with deployment, lets add some secrets to the repository, you can do it two ways.</p>
<ol>
<li>Using the Travis CLI tool:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>$ travis encrypt --pro SOMEVAR="secretvalue"</code></p>
<p>But, that adds the values in the .travis.yml file which looks kinda ugly so I chose to add it using the travis-ci.com website, it really depends on what you want to do.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Using the travis-ci.com website</li>
</ol>
<p>..* Go to your TravisCI dashboard and pick the repository you want to work with. Click on the “More Options” hamburger menu and go into settings. There you will see an Environment Variables section, add your server’s HOSTNAME and USERNAME to it just so you don’t reveal your IP address in the .travis.yml file. ;)</p>
<h2 id="deployment">Deployment<a href="#deployment" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>Before we start writing the deployment script, it would be nice to create a <code>scripts/</code> folder and then place a <code>deploy.sh</code> file in that folder. Yes, the deployment script is just a single line but it would be easier to add more commands in there without populating up the <code>.travis.yml</code> file.</p>
<p>The single line you would use to deploy is:</p>
<p><code>ssh -i /tmp/deploy_rsa $USERNAME@$HOSTNAME "cd &lt;repo-directory&gt;; git pull origin &lt;branch-name&gt;"</code></p>
<p>We need to put this script somewhere in the .travis.yml file, but it can’t be just anywhere. We need to follow Travis’ build lifecycle events. So, we will use the deploy script lifecycle event which looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>deploy:
    - provider: script
      skip_cleanup: true
      script:  scp -r $TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR $USERNAME@$HOSTNAME:/path/to/repository/files
      on:
      branch: master
</code></pre><p>Or, if you created a separate <code>scripts/deploy.sh</code>, add the single <code>scp</code> command to the deploy.sh file and then your deploy script would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>deploy:
    - provider: script
      skip_cleanup: true
      script: bash scripts/deploy.sh
      on:
        branch: master
</code></pre><p>That’s all for deployment and if you want to run any commands post deployment, you could add an extra line in your deploy script:</p>
<p><code>ssh -i /tmp/deploy_rsa $USERNAME@$HOSTNAME  "cd &lt;repo-directory&gt;; &lt;run any command(s) or script(s)&gt;;"</code></p>
<p>Make sure there aren’t any process that linger or else the command will not exit and the build will fail.</p>
<h3 id="finishing-up-the-script">Finishing up the script<a href="#finishing-up-the-script" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>Just above both the <code>before_deploy:</code> stage you would include a <code>jobs:</code> section since the <code>jobs:</code> section entails a sequence of stages, i.e., your <code>before_deploy:</code> and <code>deploy:</code> stage.</p>
<p>It would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>jobs:
    include:
      - stage: deploy
        if: branch = master AND type != pull_request
        script: skip
</code></pre><p>What this does is that it runs the script only on a push to master and NOT if it’s a pull request.</p>
<p>If you want to deploy multiple branches, you could add an extra condition, for example:
<code>if: branch = master OR branch=testing AND type != pull_request</code></p>
<p>And your deploy script would look like:</p>
<pre><code>deploy:
       - provider: script
         skip_cleanup: true
         script: bash scripts/deploy_master.sh
         on:
           branch: master
       - provider: script
         skip_cleanup: true
         script: bash scripts/deploy_testing.sh
         on:
           branch: testing
</code></pre><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>I hope you were able to understand how Travis works, its workflow and how it makes it very easy to deploy and run things without putting in much effort.</p>
<p>Make sure to put some time reading the Travis Documentation, they are really good and it will generally help you do things properly and make the entire process much more effortless.</p>
<p>For example, if someone creates a pull request but their code is really ugly and not properly linted, or want to run tests to make sure nothing broken is being pushed to master, you could add an extra linting and testing stage just above the deploy stage. It would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>jobs:
   include:
   - stage: flake8 test
     if: type = pull_request
     script: flake8 .
</code></pre><p>This runs a flake8 styling test and if the code doesn’t abibe by it, the Travis build will fail.</p>
<p>Here’s an example .travis.yml that I use to push a <a href="https://github.com/Super-Serious/bot">Telegram Bot written in Python</a> to a server:</p>

a Makefile and some CSS that builds a HTML and PDF version of a resume from
plain Markdown source.</p>
<p>Plain text source has all the usual benefits (plays nice with version control,
diff, grep, etc.), but this approach has the additional advantage that it has
very light dependencies: two pure Python packages that can be pip installed
(<a href="https://python-markdown.github.io/">python-markdown</a> and
<a href="https://weasyprint.org/">weasyprint</a>). You don’t need pandoc or LaTeX.</p>
<p>To use it: clone the repository, install the dependencies, edit the
file
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/williamsmj/resume.md/main/resume.md">resume.md</a>
(which is very simple vanilla Markdown), then run <code>make</code>. You’ll get
a HTML file that looks like this <img src="https://mike.place/post/resume.md/resume.png" alt="Screenshot ofresume.html">
and a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/williamsmj/resume.md/main/resume.pdf">PDF that looks very

Edit the CSS to change fonts, spacing, layout, etc. See <a href="https://github.com/williamsmj/resume.md">the README for

<h2>TRIPUTER</h2>

<p>
I bought in September 2016 an FPGA development board called <b>Cyclone V GX Starter Kit</b> from
<a href="http://www.terasic.com.tw/" target="_blank">Terasic</a> (see Figure 1). It costs 179 US$ and uses
a 28-nm FPGA with six 3.125 Gbps transceiver channels from Altera. The board offers a 32-bit wide LPDDR2 DRAM 
memory with 512 Mbytes capacity. This device has a very high bandwidth for many applications. In addition the
board has a HDMI output, an audio device, an SD card interface, many LEDs and switches and some expansion
connectors.
</p>

<p>
The plan is to realize with this board a "multiple computer" system. The name TRIPUTER is an indication of how
many systems will be integrated. The first one will be the PC532 running NetBSD. The second one will be the
Ceres-3 using Oberon. Currently the last one will be the BBC computer with the 32016 Second Processor.
</p>

<p>
Using a commercial board for this purpose is the best choice. Nevertheless the board is not ideal. For example it
lacks an Ethernet port and a real time clock. But it is cheap and the used FPGA is a modern one which will be available
for many years. The missing features can be added through the expansion connectors. I will develop the necessary
hardware for it too. 
</p>

<p>
The three computers to be integrated are very different from a software point of view. Having them available in one
system should be an exciting experience. The FPGA of the board is big enough to hold the required hardware.
</p>

</p>
<p>Fig. 1. The initial configuration of the Cyclone V GX Starter Kit is presenting a photo of itself on the screen</p>

<p>
Of course such a complex system is not build over night. But as time goes by the fourth milestone is now achieved
:-)
</p>

<p><img src="http://cpu-ns32k.net/images/Trip_2.jpg"></p>
<p>Fig. 3. The hardwired VT100 terminal of TRIPUTER V0.3 shows the boot process of NetBSD.</p>

<h3>Milestone 4 : TRIPUTER V0.3 is available =&gt; updated to V0.33 again due to some issues in the VT100 terminal
emulation.</h3>

<p>
<b>Description:</b> version 0.33 of TRIPUTER contains the PC632M system running NetBSD with an SD card. Still this
system uses the USB connection for the RS232 interface. The image for the SD card is available at
<a href="http://cpu-ns32k.net/NetBSD.html">Software/NetBSD</a>. The <a href="http://cpu-ns32k.net/files/TRIPUTER_V033.zip">V0.33 zip archive</a>
contains the following files:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>TRIPUTER_V033.sof , the FPGA configuration
  </li><li>TRIPUTER_V033.pof , the flash configuration
  </li><li>TRIPUTER_V033.pdf , the User Manual
  </li><li>output_file.cof , the definition file for Quartus to generate a new pof file
  </li><li>ans32k.exe , the Series 32000 crossassembler for Windows
  </li><li>monitor.32K , the source code of the TRIPUTER MONITOR program
  </li><li>mon_auto.hex , the hex file of the monitor program for PC532
  </li><li>two application programs and a readme.txt
</li></ul>

<p>
The date of the zip-file is 11 May 2019.
</p>

<p><b>Status:</b> done.</p>

<h3>October 2019 : the PERI board is available!</h3>

<p>
The PERI board is an IO board which brings to the FPGA board some necessary extensions: a true RS232 interface,
a real time clock (RTC), two PS2 ports for mouse and keyboard, a second SD card connector and a 100 Mbit Ethernet
interface. All of these things are now operational. One port is not yet usable: SATA. The hardware is there, but
the verilog code for this challenging interface must still be written.
</p>

<p>
Figure 4 shows the PERI board in action.
</p>

<p><img src="http://cpu-ns32k.net/images/PERI.jpg"></p>
<p>Fig. 4. The PERI board with the serial number 1 is attached to the Cyclone V GX Starter Kit. 2 of the 3 LEDs of
the Ethernet interface are active.</p>

<p>
The purpose of PERI is to transform the Starter Kit into a standalone computer. Then all the planned systems can
be implemented.
</p>

<p>
To test the functions of the PERI board I have made a new version of TRIPUTER: it is V0.9 . The 
<a href="http://cpu-ns32k.net/files/TRIPUTER_V09.zip">V0.9 zip archive</a> contains only three files:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>TRIPUTER_V09.pof , the flash configuration
  </li><li>TRIPUTER_V09.pdf , the User Manual
  </li><li>monitor.32K , the source code of the TRIPUTER MONITOR program
</li></ul>

<p>
The system can only test PERI if the flash is being configured with the pof file. Then some software is available.
I hope that V0.9 will be replaced soon with a version which enables SATA...
</p>

<h3>Milestone 5 : TRIPUTER V1.0 is available.</h3>

<p>
<b>Description:</b> TRIPUTER V1.0 will be the first system that uses all features of the PERI board. It will emulate
the PC532, run NetBSD from a SATA device and will have an Ethernet interface for easy down- and uploading of big
files.
</p>

<p><b>Status:</b> to be done.</p>

<h3>Milestone 6 : TRIPUTER V2.0 is available.</h3>

<p>
<b>Description:</b> TRIPUTER V2.0 will contain the Ceres-3 and the PC532.
</p>

<p><b>Status:</b> to be done.</p>

<h2>PC532</h2>

<p>
The PC532 is an interesting story. Beginning of the 1990's some people tried to build a NS32532 based computer
system. Finally they were successful. The number of systems build was quite low compared to industrial standards. But
nevertheless around 150 boards were build and shiped to enthusiastic NS32000 fans. The operating system used was
NetBSD version 1.5.3 at least.
</p>

<p>
I saw my first PC532 at the Vintage Computer Festival (VCFe) in 2003. Figure 1 shows the system.
</p>

<p>
<img src="http://cpu-ns32k.net/images/PC532-JS.jpg">
</p>
<p>Fig. 1. A PC532 at VCFe 2003.</p>

<p>
Later I came into contact with another PC532 owner. Unfortunately his system is no longer functional. On the next
photo you can see not only the board but some probes from an oscilloscope. I tried to bring it up again.
But at the end I was not successful :-(
</p>

<p>
<img src="http://cpu-ns32k.net/images/PC532-MP.jpg">
</p>
<p>Fig. 2. A PC532 showing no sign of working.</p>

<p>It is difficult to measure something inside a computer with an oscilloscope. Obviously a logic analyzer is much more
helpful. If the system does nothing during booting
one can check some control signals after reset is released. In this case the CPU seems to make something wrong.
Therefore I decided to exchange this chip.</p>

<p>
<img src="http://cpu-ns32k.net/images/PC532-pcb.jpg">
</p>
<p>Fig. 3. A view of the PC532 board.</p>

<p>
To exchange the CPU I took the pcb out of the case. On top of the CPU you can see a fan. The owner of this
PC532 told me that his system was running at 30 MHz and the CPU got hot. Therefore the fan was necessary. My own NS32532
is running at 25 MHz with a heat-sink only. Four serial ports are available with two UARTs from Signetics. The IC from
Adaptec is a SCSI controller which was used for the HDD.
</p>

<p>
<img src="http://cpu-ns32k.net/images/PC532-CPU.jpg">
</p>
<p>Fig. 4. A close up view of the heart of the PC532.</p>

<p>
Figure 4 shows the NS32532 CPU, now the fan is removed, the NS32381 FPU and 8 Mbytes of partity protected DRAM. Surprisingly
the CPU and FPU were 25 MHz rated devices. Clocking them with 30 MHz is 20 %
overclocking and maybe something died inside one chip due to the permanent overload. As a first step I replaced the 60 MHz
oscillator with a 50 MHz one. The oscillator is sitting below the NS32381 FPU.
</p>

<p>
<img src="http://cpu-ns32k.net/images/PC532-Hand.jpg">
</p>
<p>Fig. 5. Trying to break out the NS32532 CPU.</p>

<p>
This was very strange! I tried to get the CPU out of its socket but nothing helped. At least I build a special construction
which you can see in figure 5. But I hesitated to apply as much force as I could. The board was already bending and
damaging the board was not an option! At the end I packed everything together and gave the PC532 back. Unrepaired.
</p>

<h2>Documents</h2>

<p>
Some documents about the hardware of the PC532 are available. The schematics together with the PAL equations give a good
overview of the design.

<p>Real entrepreneurs ship, don’t ever forget that. An idea is worthless until it has been translated and executed into a tangible product that your potential customers can use. Getting from inception of an idea all the way to shipping it seems like a pretty straight forward process, but so is war- get guns, tanks, draw a strategy, invade, and take over. When you get caught up in the heat of a battle, I’m sure what seemed simple on the surface, isn’t so simple after all. Gunfire has a way of doing that. Shipping a product that customers want is kind of the same thing. The gunfire of confusion, resisting feature creep, and not having a defined process can make taking an idea from inception to shipping it terribly difficult. I was guilty of this with my first startup, Publictivity. <strong> Never ever again. </strong> I often get asked about the topic, so here’s the exact blueprint I follow. This is how I go about taking a product from inception all the way to shipping it as well as having paying customers lined up. I will use examples from two products I’m currently working on <a href="http://www.padpressed.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.PadPressed.com', ' PadPressed ']);"> PadPressed </a> (shipped, profitable, 100+ customers, and version two on its way) and <a href="http://flow.cloudomatic.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://flow.cloudomatic.com', 'Cloudomatic(flow) ']);">Cloudomatic(flow) </a> (early alpha testing, shipping soon for mass consumption, 150+ customers lined up for launch).</p>
<h2>Step 1: Define The Problem</h2>
<p>The biggest problem with ideas is the fact that they don’t really solve a problem. All too often entrepreneurs go about creating cool things that don’t solve a real problem. By defining the problem, it helps you clarify what you’re building and why. Defining the problem gives you constraints around feature creep. It lets you say “Does this feature or functionality add anything that is core to solving the problem?” You would be surprised how many features make it into products that have absolutely nothing to do with solving the problem.</p>
<p><strong> Example 1: </strong> I just bought my iPad, started blogging more heavily, and wanted to make sure my blog was optimized for the tablet format. I certainly wasn’t going to make a native iPad app. At first I thought I would just modify my existing theme by removing dropdowns, increasing the size of the font,etc. Well yeah, that did not work out too well. <strong> Problem: No easy way for publishers to make their content Tablet friendly using their existing CMS (in my case WordPress). </strong></p>
<p><strong> Example 2: </strong> We created Cloudomatic.com in a weekend. Revenue model was simple: drive traffic, integrate affiliate links, make a very nice commission as SaaS has a very nice ARPU. It turns out that very few SaaS developers had an affiliate program. As former SaaS guys ourselves, we looked around and understood why: existing stuff was too complex, didn’t work with subscription services, and devs were too busy to build it themselves. <strong> Problem: No easy way for web app developers to get setup with a simple affiliate program in under an hour. </strong></p>
<h2>Step 2: High Level Overview Specifications and Mockups</h2>
<p>At this point you probably know what you want to build and specifically what problem the app is meant to solve. From here you start to define the solution to the problem stated above. How will the app specifically solve this problem? What is the secret sauce? The high level specifications should be 1-2 pages at MOST. This is something that a normal human being should be able to read and define specific important features. It’s really the skeleton for the technical outline of your app. In short, it should be enough for photoshop mockups or even just wireframes created with Balsamiq.</p>
<p>When creating mockups and wireframes don’t focus on fleshing out every last detail or every last little screen ie- the reset password screen or some obscure settings page. Instead, pick maybe 4-5 different screens that show the key functionality of the app. You’re prepping yourself for initial customer feedback and validation, so pick the screens that are going to convince them and get the point across that your solution is solving the problem you have defined.</p>
<p><strong> Example 1: </strong> With <a href="http://www.padpressed.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.PadPressed.com', ' PadPressed ']);"> PadPressed </a>, I spent a fair amount of time looking at the native iPad applications major publishers had put out such as USA Today, BBC, Financial Times,etc. I also had a list of specific functionality that I knew was crucial. Simple page design, large fonts, accelerometer aware, touch navigation, swiping to advance were some of them. I also defined the way that integration should work with WordPress. This was more of a technical issue, but it was also key to adoption. For mockups I basically screenshotted from my iPad, photoshopped a bunch of different things together, and also took videos of the touch interactions that were key.</p>
<p><strong> Example 2: </strong> With <a href="http://flow.cloudomatic.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://flow.cloudomatic.com', ' Cloudomatic(flow) ']);"> Cloudomatic(flow) </a> we basically locked ourselves down for an entire weekend to get through steps 1-3. I defined everything that was needed from the both the developer standpoint and the affiliate end. From there we translated that into the 4 most important separate screens that had an overview of what the app would do- overview dashboard, define payment plans coordinated with your app, and what the interface looks like for an actual affiliate.</p>
<h2>Step 3: Initial Customer Feedback and Validation</h2>
<p>This is a really crucial step and it might be a really depressing or exciting step. At this point you now have something that you can show potential customers to have them say: “This is interesting, I would use it and/or would pay you for it.” You should probably synthesize the simple specs into some type of sales literature or at least something a normal person can read. The mockups should be fine as is. If you’re using wireframes, just explain that this is for feedback purposes only and a very rough idea of what is being built.</p>
<p><strong> Example 1: </strong> With <a href="http://www.padpressed.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.PadPressed.com', ' PadPressed ']);"> PadPressed </a> we kept things really rough and also took a risk by playing things close to the chest. We basically explained what the app would do in simple terms: Take your existing WordPress install, if a user accesses your blog from their iPad web browser, it behaves like a native iPad app. We highlighted major features that drove this point home and showed what were some God awful mockups. They were frankshops of many different apps we thought made sense, but it got the point across. Enough bloggers told us this would be useful and that they would pay for it. So we soldiered on.</p>
<p><strong> Example 2: </strong> <a href="http://flow.cloudomatic.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://flow.cloudomatic.com', ' Cloudomatic(flow) ']);"> Cloudomatic(flow) </a> was an interesting beast from this perspective. It went way better than we thought it would. This was a very public customer feedback/validation phase using what’s called an MVP smoke test ie- the product isn’t fully built, but gauge consumer feedback as if it is there. The goal was to see if we would get sign-ups, but we also indicated in the confirmation email that if you wanted to be fast tracked into the beta that you could email us indicating so. This let us do a few things a) see how badly some people wanted the product b) have some initial individuals we could reach out to in order to make sure we were building the most critical features first c) set priorities for sending out actual invites when the time came. The site at <a href="http://flow.cloudomatic.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://flow.cloudomatic.com', 'flow.cloudomatic.com ']);">flow.cloudomatic.com </a>is the same exact site, screenshots,etc. that we used for this phase if you want to see what was actually there.</p>
<h2>Step 4: Be An Axe Murderer</h2>
<p>Guess what? You’re probably doing too much even with the simple initial spec and mockups that you put together. Besides validating the problem and your specific solution, talking to potential customers allows you to find out which features are really crucial and which ones are nice to have. Start killing off things you don’t need right away and leave them to Version 1.1,etc., but also make sure the really important ones have a very high priority. By doing this, your app will be left to the most core and essential features. This will make it easier to get the product in the hands of your customers AND it will also make you laser focused on the things that truly matter to your customers.</p>
<p><strong> Example 1: </strong> With <a href="http://www.padpressed.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.PadPressed.com', ' PadPressed ']);"> PadPressed </a> we kept the features that stuck with the core vision of making the app feel native as opposed to adding things that would have been publisher/blogging specific. We don’t have comments right now and probably won’t until we can do them right to integrate with the experience. We could have easily just included the comment div, but it wasn’t worth keeping a half assed feature.</p>
<p><strong> Example 2: </strong> Cloudomatic(flow) is really really simple. We reduced it down to a few API calls and a Javascript embed. There are a lot of features we’ll add in the future for conversions, advanced affiliate management, reseller management,etc. We basically only went with features that focused on the core problem at hand: a) Specifically working with recurring subscriptions for SaaS b) Making integration take less than an hour for SaaS developers by reducing things to a few simple API calls. We also reduced the payout options from every provider under the sun to the most requested one: PayPal</p>
<h2>Step 5: Detailed Specifications</h2>
<p>Detailed specs are like your blueprint for the app, and shouldn’t be rushed. You can’t think of every scenario until you start building + testing it, but you can certainly try. When you’re working with a multiperson team, you don’t have time to wait for email responses, second guess, or hold things up. If it’s in the specs, you know where to go. It also helps keep scope creep away. My specs also include the database structure and design as well.</p>
<p><strong> Example 1: </strong> <a href="http://www.padpressed.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.PadPressed.com', ' PadPressed’s ']);"> …</a></p></section></article></div></div>

      <p> <em>Published: </em> 07/26/2020</p>

      <p>I hate it when I run across what is reported to be an epic hack involving Russians, Chinese or spies only it turns out the hacking victims were not taking any form of basic security seriously. Its like asking Bonnie and Clyde to rob a bank where the combo is printed on a large banner outside the vault and there are no keys to any safe deposit boxes. Or it’s like letting the fox get inside the hen house.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the victims in this case seem to be the US Government. The article is titled: <a href="https://abc7chicago.com/russia-russian-hacking-elections-illinois/3778816/">“How the Russians penetrated Illinois election computers - ABC7 Chicago”</a>.</p>

<p>What was the hack? SQL injection. SQL INJECTION!!@!@!! What the #$%@? Are we living in the 90s? What the heck are developers doing? Sadly, I’ve encountered the problem on projects I’ve worked on within the last YEAR. WTF is wrong with people? Are we lazy or stupid or a bit of both?</p>



<p>Here’s an innocent query; let’s say we’re using Postgres and NodeJS</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>firstName</span><span>,</span> <span>lastName</span><span>,</span> <span>email</span> <span>From</span> <span>users</span> <span>where</span> <span>email</span> <span>=</span> <span>"adam@adambourg.com"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Not bad, but lets see how we can build it in Javascript:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>lookupUserByEmail</span><span>(</span><span>emailAddress</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span><span>(</span><span>!</span><span>emailAddress</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>throw</span> <span>"</span><span>Email address is required!</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>await</span> <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>any</span><span>(</span><span>`SELECT firstName, lastName, email From users where email = "</span><span>${</span><span>emailAddress</span><span>}</span><span>"`</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There is a simple method to ensuring we have an email and fetching a user record from the database. The trouble is, we’re doing string interpolation, meaning we take that query and inject ANYTHING from the emailAddress variable. No big deal, right?</p>

<p>What if email address is this:</p>



<p>That means it would match on the first value, 1, which probably won’t match anything or on 1=1 which is literally interpreted by SQL as does 1 equal 1? Which is always true. Thus would return EVERY record in the system.</p>



<p>Assume the hacker has no knowledge of the system and does this:</p>



<p>Now I’ve got a list of all the records in the table; great, what if I want to know what options are present in the system? Well, do this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>1</span><span>'; SELECT c.relname FROM pg_catalog.pg_class c LEFT JOIN pg_catalog.pg_namespace n ON n.oid = c.relnamespace WHERE c.relkind IN (‘r’,”) AND n.nspname NOT IN (‘pg_catalog’, ‘pg_toast’) AND pg_catalog.pg_table_is_visible(c.oid); 
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Version?</p>



<p>Postgres users?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>1</span><span>'; SELECT usename FROM pg_user;
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Users and password hashes? No problem:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>1</span><span>'; SELECT usename, passwd FROM pg_shadow — priv;
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s the thing if you don’t sanitize your inputs, you are venerable to so many easy hacks. In fact there are <a href="http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/sql-injection/postgres-sql-injection-cheat-sheet">many</a>, <a href="http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/sql-injection/mysql-sql-injection-cheat-sheet">dozens</a> of <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/examining-the-database">different</a> <a href="https://www.netsparker.com/blog/web-security/sql-injection-cheat-sheet/">guides</a> on <a href="https://www.sqlinjection.net/table-names/">any</a> and <a href="https://download.oracle.com/oll/tutorials/SQLInjection/index.htm">all</a> <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-05/bh-us-05-fayo.pdf">versions</a> of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/sql-injection?view=sql-server-ver15">SQL</a>.</p>



<p>Unlike the idiots in Chicago, buying an expensive Cisco Firewall will not do anything to protect you. In fact, it will only cause you to feel more secure thus take more risks. No what you need is real security. Basic security. It’s like putting a lock on your door type of security.</p>



<p>Just about every SQL library supports Parameterized Queries. If they don’t you need to find a new lib to use.</p>

<p>Example in PQ:</p>

<p>Given our example from above, here’s what a safe query would look like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>lookupUserByEmail</span><span>(</span><span>emailAddress</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span><span>(</span><span>!</span><span>emailAddress</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>throw</span> <span>"</span><span>Email address is required!</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>await</span> <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>any</span><span>(</span><span>`SELECT firstName, lastName, email From users where email = "$emailAddress"`</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>emailAddress</span><span>});</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Well, that was simple! Basically $ with out the brackets are treated as a normal string, you can keep the string template literal (the back ticks) or use quotes instead; then you’re dumping email address into an object that gets passed to the db’s any method which does all the work.</p>

<p>This works:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>lookupUserByEmail</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>adam@adambourg.com</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This does not work as the hacker expected:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>lookupUserByEmail</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>1 or 1=1;</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>A few examples of the method body in other languages using this safe method:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$stmt</span> <span>=</span> <span>$dbh</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>prepare</span><span>(</span><span>"SELECT firstName, lastName, email From users where email = (?)"</span><span>);</span>
<span>$stmt</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>bindParam</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>$email</span><span>);</span>
<span>$stmt</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>execute</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span>String</span> <span>sqlQuery</span> <span>=</span> <span>"SELECT firstName, lastName, email From users where email = (?)"</span><span>;</span>
<span>PreparedStatement</span> <span>prepStmt</span> <span>=</span> <span>conn</span><span>.</span><span>prepareStatement</span><span>(</span><span>sqlQuery</span><span>);</span>
<span>prepStmt</span><span>.</span><span>setString</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>"adam@adambourg.com"</span><span>);</span>
<span>prepStmt</span><span>.</span><span>executeUpdate</span><span>();</span>
<span>prepStmt</span><span>.</span><span>close</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>Active Record does right out of the box; it’s automatic, similar for Sequelize. Should you turn it off, like this <a href="https://medium.com/@devinburnette/be-prepared-7768d1a111e1">idiot says</a>? Hell NO!</p>



<p>If you want to dive more into this topic, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_injection.asp">W3 Schools</a> has a really good guide to injections.</p>

  <p>What’s the worst that could happen after <code>npm&nbsp;install</code>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you open an app or execute a program from the terminal,
that program can do anything that you can do.</p>

<p><strong>In a nutshell</strong>: Imagine if your computer were to disappear in front of your eyes and re-appear in front of mine. Still open. Still unlocked. What could I do from this moment on? <em>That</em> is what an unknown program could do.</p>

<p>Upon running <code>npm install</code>, you may be downloading and executing hundreds of unknown programs.</p>

<ol>
  <li>What is at&nbsp;stake?</li>
  <li>How does it compare to other package managers?</li>
  <li>What can you do about&nbsp;it?</li>
</ol>

<p>Programs from nice people sometimes ask for your permission. This is because a developer choose to do so.</p>

<p>There may also be laws that could punish them if they get caught choosing differently.</p>

<hr>

<p>What about programs of which the authors choose differently? Well, such program could do quite a bit.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It could access any of your files, modify them, delete them, or upload them. This also applies to the internal files used by other applications.</li>
  <li>It could install other programs in the background.</li>
  <li>It could talk to other devices linked to your home network.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-is-atstake">What is at&nbsp;stake</h2>

<p>Files you might not be thinking about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The cookies in your web browser.</li>
  <li>Desktop applications. Chat history, password managers, todo lists, etc. They all use files to store the text and media you send or receive.</li>
  <li>Digital media. Your photo albums, home videos, and voice memos.</li>
  <li>SSH private keys, GPG key rings, and other crypto files used by developers.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="browser-cookies">Browser cookies</h2>

<p>Browsers cookies make it so you’re immediately logged-in when you open a new tab for Gmail, or Twitter. An evil program can copy the browser’s cookies file and share it with the attacker.</p>

<p>They could then read any e-mail you’ve ever received or sent stored there. It could also delete any. (Got a backup?) They can naturally access future e-mails as well. Like the ones you get from “Forgot password” buttons. They could also hide any trace of these (e.g. filter rules).</p>

<p>This affects any website you use. Social network? Access to any post or DM — regardless of privacy setting. Company e-mail, Google Drive? That too.</p>

<h2 id="sleeper-programs">Sleeper programs</h2>

<p>The evil program may configure itself to always start in the background when you open your laptop. A new friend for life!</p>

<p>It could also add local command-line programs that wrap the popular <code>sudo</code> and <code>ssh</code> commands, to make them do a little extra behind the scenes. Next time you run <code>sudo &lt;something&gt;</code> to perform an administrator action and enter your password—you may have given away full system access. Deploying some code? Running <code>ssh cloud.someplace.special</code> might let the attacker tailgate along with you, opening one shell for itself and another for you.</p>

</figure>

<h2 id="local-webserver">Local web&nbsp;server</h2>

<p>These background programs could also affect you in a myriad of other ways. I won’t detail those today, except to mention they can keep a local web server running. Spotify and Zoom have been seen in the news doing <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/zoom-zero-day-4-million-webcams-maybe-an-rce-just-get-them-to-visit-your-website-ac75c83f4ef5">questionable things</a> with their local web servers.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="is-this-an-npmproblem">Is this an npm&nbsp;problem?</h2>

<p>Maybe. Technically these concerns apply to any method of executing unknown code. Running <code>npm install</code> isn’t very different from pasting a command like <code>curl url… | bash</code>. They both execute a downloaded program from your terminal. The difference is in user expectation.</p>

<p>Upon seeing the url and the <code>bash</code> invocation, you have a choice: Trust the publisher (the url), or trust the script (download, review, then decide whether to run). The result is generally predictable and without hidden dependencies.</p>

<h3 id="other-packagemanagers">Other package&nbsp;managers</h3>

<p>What about Debian (apt-get) or Homebrew? Like npm, code published there is unknown to most of us and hard to review. But, there is an important difference: Peer-review. These traditional repositories are curated by a central authority. You don’t have to trust the script or original authors of each package, so long as you trust the publishers and their curation process.</p>

<h3 id="the-scale-has-changed-thegame">The scale has changed the&nbsp;game</h3>

<p>What about PyPI or Packagist (Composer)? These are like npm. Anyone can publish anything. There is however a difference in scale. PyPI has 194K projects. Packagist is host to 237K packages with 0.5 billion downloads a month. npm has over 1.3 million packages and 30 <em>billion</em> downloads a month. This makes it a much more popular target. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://pypi.org/">[1]</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://packagist.org/statistics">[2]</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.npmjs.org/post/180868064080/this-year-in-javascript-2018-in-review-and-npms">[3]</a></p>

<h3 id="dependency-graphs">Dependency graphs</h3>

<p>There is also a difference in habit: PyPI packages have 7 dependencies on average, with typically 1 indirect dependency. And, I would expect most dependencies there to be from authors the user has trusted before. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://snyk.io/blog/how-much-do-we-really-know-about-how-packages-behave-on-the-npm-registry/">[4]</a> Snyk.io published in April that the average npm package has a whopping 86 dependencies, with a 4+ levels of indirect dependencies. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://snyk.io/blog/how-much-do-we-really-know-about-how-packages-behave-on-the-npm-registry/">[4]</a></p>

<p>The ESLint package has 118 npm dependencies <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://npm.anvaka.com/#/view/2d/eslint/6.3.0">[5]</a>. Eleventy, a popular static site generator, requires 555 dependencies (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://npm.anvaka.com/#/view/2d/%254011ty%252Feleventy/0.9.0">Explore dependency graph</a>). Each one of these may run <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.alexwendland.com/2018-11-20-npm-install-scripts-intro/">arbitrary shell commands</a> from the terminal both during the installation process, after later when using the tool.</p>

<h2 id="i-get-it-now-what-can-we-do-aboutit">I get it. Now, what can we do about&nbsp;it?</h2>

<p>There isn’t a magic bullet to make everything perfectly safe. But, there are a number of things you can do to reduce risk.</p>

<h3 id="isolation">Isolation</h3>

<p>For the past year, I’ve been using disposable Docker containers as a way to reduce the risk of compromise. It has controls for network access, and for which directories can be exposed. Docker isn’t a perfect safety net by any means, but it’s a step in the right direction.</p>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://timotijhof.net/assets/attachments/2019_npm_Servers.jpg" alt="Earth is small compared to Jupiter. Jupiter is roughly 11 times larger."></p>

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>My base image uses Debian and comes with Node.js, npm, and a few other utilities (such as headless browsers, for automated tests). I use a bash script to launch a temporary container, based on that image. It runs as the unprivileged <code>nobody</code> user, and mounts only the current working directory.</p>

<p>From there, I would run <code>npm install</code> and such. The only thing it interacts with is the source code and local <code>node_modules</code> directory for that specific project. It isn’t given access to any other Git repos, desktop apps, browser cookies, or crypto files. And, once that terminal tab is closed, the container is destroyed.</p>

<p>I’ve published the script I use at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/wikimedia/fresh#start-of-content">github.com/wikimedia/fresh</a>. I don’t recommend using it outside Wikimedia, however. Create your own instead. The repository explains <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/wikimedia/fresh/blob/19.10.1/Tutorial.md">how it works</a>.</p>

<p>Other options for isolating your environment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Speed and flexibility: Use <code>systemd-nspawn</code> or <code>chroot</code>. This takes more work to setup, but provides a faster environment than Docker. In terms of security it is comparable to Docker. Read more systemd-nspan on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd-nspawn">ArchWiki</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Security and ease of use: Use a virtual machine (e.g. VirtualBox/Vagrant). This is more secure by default and offers a GUI for controlling what to expose. The downside is that VMs are significantly slower.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fewer-dependencies">Fewer dependencies</h3>

<p>Finally, you can reduce risk by reducing the number of packages you depend on in your projects (and then shrink-wrap them). Especially development dependencies, as these tend to be explicitly aimed at executing from the CLI.</p>

<p>Question yourself and question others before introducing new dependencies. Perhaps even encourage maintainers of your favourite packages to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/issues/1342#show_issue">Reduce the size of their dependency graph</a>!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                    <p>MinIO supports a complete object locking framework offering both Legal Hold and Retention (with Governance and Compliance modes). Object Locking functionality is a requirement for many regulated industries from financial services to healthcare. <br></p><p>Lifecycle management is an increasingly critical element in the data ecosystem. Data is the primary asset in most organizations at this point - more so than the physical assets we normally associate with large enterprises - trains, planes, automobiles or oil rigs. Protecting this data, and managing how long to protect it are complex challenges. <br></p><p>MinIO now offers the complete suite of lifecycle management capabilities. This includes versioning, object locking and the various derivative components. Every use case is different and our goal is to create software and documentation that allow our community to implement these features with confidence. <br></p><p>Our approach models Amazon’s. This is important for a number of reasons. First, for companies seeking compatibility for their applications, the same S3 API calls that work in the public cloud need to work on premises. Second, Amazon took a measured approach to the problem, considered all of the corner cases and built a strong offering. We acknowledge a debt there. Third, given Amazon’s leadership there is strong adoption of this in the approach and most of the issues have been resolved. <br></p><p>Even with Amazon’s leadership, not a lot of companies have implemented this feature. We are pleased to add our name to the list. Given the other attributes of our software, we think this removes any hesitation around adopting MinIO as your private cloud object store. <br></p><p>Having immutability and protection from deletion ensures that your data assets are safe.<br></p><p><strong>Versioning</strong><br></p><p>Versioning allows a user to retain multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. Versioning provides a mechanism to &nbsp;preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in a bucket. Versioning ensures that objects remain available across a range of failures from applications to human error. <br></p><p>Versioning is enabled at the bucket level. When enabled, MinIO automatically creates a unique version ID for the object. There can be multiple versions of the same object. <br></p><p>One of the main benefits of versioning is to protect overwriting it or deleting it unintentionally. This is performed using the concept of a delete marker. When a versioned object is deleted it is not removed permanently. Rather a delete marker is created and becomes the current version of the object. When that object is read it returns a 404 Not Found message.<br></p><p>Objects that have the delete marker can be restored. <br></p><p>Along the same lines, if a versioned object is overwritten, it creates a new version and that becomes the current version. Again, the older version can be restored as needed. <br></p><p>To account for these changes there are now three bucket states in MinIO. Unversioned which is the default, versioning-enabled, or versioning-suspended. Please note that once a bucket is enabled for versioning, that action cannot be undone - only suspended. Versioning is a global setting within the bucket - meaning all objects are now versioned. <br></p><p>Users with appropriate permissions can suspend versioning to stop accruing object versions. This is applicable only for that bucket and not for other buckets. For more information on what happens in this case refer to the documentation. <br></p><p>As with all of MinIO, versioning can be applied using the MinIO Client (mc), the SDK or via the command line. <br></p><p>Versioning is the simplest way to protect data from unintended actions. It does have the effect of adding to bucket sizes as objects are versioned and can lead to a higher number of interdependencies between the objects as well as the risk of hidden object dependencies. This can be mitigated with Lifecycle Management Choices. Still, for most organizations, this is a reasonable tradeoff for data protection. <br></p><p>There are, however, other use cases, that require another level of certainty. <br></p><p><strong>Object Locking, Retention and Legal Holds</strong><br></p><p>Object locking is a key feature for those companies operating in regulatory environments or having forward thinking policies around retention, audit or other compliance related requirements. We will be publishing our final Cohasset Report shortly but have a favorable assessment in hand. <br></p><p>This work builds on our previous feature set for write once, read many (WORM) - extending it as appropriate. As always, we took a minimalist approach - ensuring that it was feature complete without being feature-heavy and sapping performance. <br></p><p>While there are dozens of use cases, they can be effectively reduced to Legal Hold and Retention. Additionally there are modes, either Governance or Compliance and these have certain implications. There is some overlap here so we will do our best to be precise in our descriptions. <br></p><p><strong>Retention</strong><br></p><p>Retention ensures that an object is WORM protected (cannot be deleted or overwritten) for some period of time. It can be expressed in seconds, days or years. <br></p><p>Retention is set at the object level. You can place a retention period on an object version either explicitly or through a bucket default setting. A default lock configuration set at the bucket level does not apply retroactively to versions of objects created before. It only applies to objects that are created afterwards. &nbsp;When you apply a retention period to an object version explicitly, you specify a Retain Until Date for the object version. The Retain Until Date setting is stored in the object version's metadata and protects the object version until the retention period expires. <br></p><p>When the bucket default setting is used, a Retain Until Date is not specified. Instead, a duration is set (either days or years), for which every object version placed in the bucket should be protected. When a new object is placed in the bucket a Retain Until Date is calculated for the object version by adding the specified duration to the object version's creation timestamp. The object version is then protected exactly as though it was explicitly locked with that retention period on the object version.<br></p><p>When you place a retention period on an object version, a timestamp is stored in the object version's metadata to indicate when the retention period expires. After the retention period expires, the object version can be deleted unless a legal hold was also placed on the object version.<br></p><p>Explicit retention mode and period specified while creating an object version always overrides the bucket default settings.<br></p><p>The retention period can be extended by submitting a new lock request. <br></p><p>There are two types of modes in the Retention framework:<br></p><p>Governance Mode<br></p><p>When setting a retention period for your objects or buckets Governance mode is used when the goal is to protect objects from being deleted by standard users. Having said that, there are users that will retain the permissions required to modify the retention settings or delete the objects. Those users will need the s3:BypassGovernanceRetention permission as well as the DeleteObject permission.<br></p><p>Compliance Mode<br></p><p>Compliance mode is more restrictive - it cannot be undone within the retention period. As a result, Compliance mode should be used when you are certain that you do not want anyone, including the root user, to be able to delete the objects during its retention period.<br></p><p><strong>Legal Hold</strong><br></p><p>Legal hold offers the same protection (WORM) as the retention period but it has no expiration date by default nor can one be set. It is an indefinite hold that can only be removed by an authorized user.</p><p><strong>Combo and Versioning </strong><br></p><p>While Retention and Legal Hold prevent objects from deletion or overwriting, they can overlap. An object version can have both retention and legal hold. Retention and legal hold apply to individual object versions. Different versions of a single object can have different retention modes and periods.<br></p><p>Specifically, an object can have a retention period (call it six months) and a legal hold (indefinite). Even after the expiration of the retention period, the object version cannot be deleted because it still carries the legal hold. Only once the legal hold is lifted on that version of the object, can it be deleted. <br></p><p>While objects may have retention or legal hold, they can still be versioned. A copy operation on a version of an object does not carry forward the retention and legal hold settings that may be present on the source to the destination.</p><p><br>Here is a quick walk-through of a Legal Hold and Retention Period:</p><p>To use S3 Object Lock, follow these basic steps:<br></p><ol><li>Create a new bucket with Object Lock enabled.</li></ol><p><em><code>./mc mb myminio/testbucket --with-lock</code> </em></p><p>The command listed above creates a bucket that supports object locking.</p><p>(Optional) Configure a default retention period for objects placed in the bucket.</p><p><em><code>/mc bucket lock myminio/testbucket governance 100d</code></em></p><p>Place the objects that you want to lock in the bucket.</p><p><code>.<em>/mc cp /path/to/file myminio/testbucket</em></code></p><p>Apply a retention period, a legal hold, or both, to the objects that you want to protect.</p><p><em><code>./mc retention myminio/testbucket/file governance 1y</code></em></p><p><em><code>./mc legalhold myminio/testbucket/file on</code> </em></p><p>Pretty straightforward stuff. &nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br></p><p>The addition of these features adds another layer to our ever growing suite of enterprise capabilities. For banks and healthcare companies that were already using MinIO, these capabilities, supported by our Cohasset assessment, provide an additional suite of use cases to use with MinIO, expanding our reach within the organizations. <br></p><p>We encourage you to try out these features for yourself. &nbsp;We have documentation <a href="https://docs.minio.io/docs/minio-bucket-object-lock-guide.html">here</a> and our <a href="https://minio.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-flxqy9og-K_cDBMh~yXq0rM9qktWFfQ#/">Slack channel</a> is always on.</p>

<!--  -->

<p>As a technical writer, I’m often the first person to use a new widget or whatsit without knowledge of its internal function or composition, so I get to act as a surrogate user. Sometimes I spot bugs or areas for improvement that my developer colleagues have not, but before those things have been revealed to our customers (though it’s a credit to the skill of my colleagues that this is an unusual occurrence). Thus, I get to write bug reports and feature requests on a somewhat frequent basis. And I’ve come to a recurring pattern for reports and requests that has proven successful at getting those problems fixed and those changes made.</p>

<p>So today I present to you, with considerable commentary, my outline for writing up a bug report or feature request. These guidelines aren’t definitive, but they represent the kind of requests I’ve sent or received that got results, with a minimum of back-and-forth.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Briefly summarize the request.</strong></p>

    <p>Ideally this should be no more than a few words. It should fit comfortably into the subject line of an email or your ticket tracker. This summary will probably become a mental shorthand that identifies a unit of work for somebody, so it’s kind to be terse. A terse summary often takes a simple form, such as <em>noun verbs the object</em> for a bug or <em>noun should verb the object</em> for a feature request.</p>

    <p>If you can’t complete this step, stop and think things over before continuing. You might have more than one problem on your hands. Narrow it down a little, or you might make the recipient an unwitting contestant in a game of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Questions">Twenty Questions</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Describe the current situation.</strong></p>

    <p>Provide a context to compare the proposed change with the status quo. If it’s a bug, provide the steps to reproduce the bug. If you can’t reliably reproduce it, describe (in as much detail as you can) the conditions under which the bug appeared. If it’s a feature, just briefly describe how things work right now.</p>

    <p>As both a reader and a writer, it’s easier to understand a proposal when there’s a contrast between the way things are and the way things you want them to be.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Describe the desired outcome.</strong></p>

    <p>In other words, ask for the change. Don’t forget to be polite.</p>

    <p>This is probably the thing that prompted you to start this process in the first place. If you’re requesting a bug fix, describe what you expected to happen. If you’re asking for a new feature, describe how a working implementation would behave.</p>

    <p>Unless you’re knowledgeable about the specific implementation details, don’t speculate about how easy, hard, simple, or complex the changes required may be. It’s neither as helpful nor as convincing as you imagine.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Describe the benefits of the change.</strong></p>

    <p>Justify your request. Describe how it will help your users, customers, or colleagues to live better, more pleasant lives. This is useful not just to convince the recipient to fulfill your request, but also to enable her to make an informed decision about which tasks to take on first.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Describe the negative effects of the change.</strong></p>

    <p>If you can, describe how the change will require new effort or behavior on the part of your users, customers, or organization. You might suppose it’s counterproductive to describe the drawbacks of your proposed change, but ignoring drawbacks means ignoring opportunities to mitigate them. And occasionally you’ll have the good fortune to report that there’s no downside.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Here’s a made up example, based on the outline, to request a new feature for Gmail:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Feature request</strong>: Individual messages should have a delete button</p>

  <p>Presently, to delete a specific message in a Gmail conversation, you must click the down arrow menu button in the upper right corner of a message, then click “Delete this message.”</p>

  <p>Please add a button, perhaps alongside the existing forward button and down arrow menu button, that deletes the message in question when clicked.</p>

  <p>The button would speed up the process of handling individual notification messages that Gmail has erroneously grouped together as a conversation. It would reduce the number of clicks in such a situation by 50%.</p>

  <p>The addition of the button may cause some confusion for users when it first appears. During the adjustment period, some users may accidentally click the delete button and need to undo deletions more frequently than they would otherwise.</p>

  <p>Please let me know if you require any additional information. Thank you for taking the time consider my request.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Honestly, it’s an iffy, high-risk feature—if I worked on Gmail, I’d probably reject it—but it contains some information on which to make that decision. On rejection, there’s an opportunity to identify alternatives, like fixing erroneous conversation grouping or providing a facility to split conversations. Those alternatives wouldn’t be apparent in a less detailed request, such as “Individual messages should have a delete button” alone. On acceptance, there’s enough information to determine what completion looks like (in this case, whether the implementation reduces clicks by 50%). Either way, a well-organized request makes it possible to find a good outcome.</p>

<p>And finding good outcomes is what making bug reports and feature requests is all about. So, with your help, we can make a less buggy, more useful tomorrow.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>At some point we had an issue with application startup performance.
For a bit of context this app runs in a Kubernetes cluster, with k8s it’s possible
to define a <em>rollout policy</em> to avoid service distruption, that what we had, so there’s a
rollout, new pods (a pod is composed of the application container) get created,
new application are started, then Kubernetes has a mean to check when the application is
<strong>ready</strong>, it’s called the readyness probe. This probe can be a call to http endpoint or a script,
ours is an HTTP endpoint.</p>
<p>WHen the probe indicates the application is ready, the application starts receiving traffic,
from this moment latencies increased from 10-20 milliseconds to seconds.</p>
<p>Opening the recording JMC, it will start an automated analysis. Sometime it’s helpful
and warning should be looked at. In this case the issue was elsewhere.</p>
<p>To help in our case, we need to go in the thread view, which as a <em>thread lanes</em>
which displays each thread as an horizontal bar, and JFR event are painted on the bar
at the time they happened and for how long. At the bottom there’s a the time axis.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-0-thread-lanes.png" alt="startup 0 thread lanes">
</p>
<p>Thread Lanes</p>
</div>
<p>The first things that catch our eyes will be the vertical patterns, especially the one with
yellow and red around 12:51:15. Let’s zoom (you can select and right click, or use arrow keys.).</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-0-threads-lanes-closer.png" alt="startup 0 threads lanes closer">
</p>
<p>Zooming on the problematic</p>
</div>
<p>The vertical pattern is more precise, these vertical pattern indicates a <em>cross
threads phenomena</em>. And we can notice that all thread are not affected the same way.</p>
<p>The lanes in green at the top indicates these threads are progressing normally, nothing’s
wrong with them. However is we go down there especially, the pattern materialize around
12:51:11.</p>
<p>Each color indicate some events</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Gray ⇒ the thread does nothing, it’s parked</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Small dark point ⇒ The park event, the thread was scheduled but was eventually parked</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Red ⇒ In this case it’s a <em>blocked lock</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yellow ⇒ Here the yellow events that intrests us are thread waiting on a lock</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>I’m not well versed in desfribing colors, so know that there are other events that use
a slightly different tone / shade of red, yellow or else. Just click on the event
to see what’s going on.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-1-threads-jedis-lock-event.png" alt="startup 1 threads jedis lock event">
</p>
<p>monitor blocked</p>
</div>
<p>The UI could be improved but going over the events shows a popup with it’s details,
for the Monitor Blocked event, there’s the duration this monitor was block, who held
this monitor before, and the monitor address in the heap.</p>
<p>This monitor was held for ~9s, that’s a big bottleneck !</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-1-threads-jedis-monitor-acquire-blocked.png" alt="startup 1 threads jedis monitor acquire blocked">
</p>
</div>
<p>In this case we had ~200 thread competing for this lock in particular. And finding the thread that
acquired it is not automated, it’s a bit tedious, but in the end didn’t revealed anything.</p>
<p>However the Monitor Blocked event has another interesting element, the stacktrace. In the lower
pane of JMC, if the event is selected, we can see the stack trace where this event was emmitted.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-1-threads-jedis-monitor-blocked-stack.png" alt="startup 1 threads jedis monitor blocked stack">
</p>
<p>jedis classloading</p>
</div>
<p>Here that’s the JDK classloader. I would never have thought that the JDK code would cause ~9s
contention. But looking at the stacktrace, there <em>jedis</em> (a Redis client) connection pool involved.
Maybe the class have static initialization that does IO, maybe it’s the agent that runs in production
that introduces latencies during this specific classlaoding.</p>
<p>But all the threads starts working again around 12:51:22, and redis bottle neck is not anymore an issue
afterward. Let’s look at the story on the IO side, open the Socket IO view.</p>
<p>Identify which one is related to redis, either via IP or via port (Redis is <code>6379</code>).</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-1-socketio-redis-port.png" alt="startup 1 socketio redis port">
</p>
<p>Socket IO with redis port selected</p>
</div>
<p>While we see a total time of 30s, it’s the accumulated time for all thread for the recording duration (6m).
So nothing fancy here. However we see that actual IO happens really late, around 12:51:22.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-1-socketio-redis.png" alt="startup 1 socketio redis">
</p>
<p>Socket IO actual Redis read / write</p>
</div>
<p>I’m not sure of the cause, we can definitely rule out Redis, the is either in the network, during
connection establishment, or actually during classloading.</p>
<p>In order to remediate that, we noticed this code is called once the application is ready.
So in order to avoid the contention the code was changed to pre-connect to redis during the
application startup before the the application is considedred ready. And it worked, this
specific issue disappeared.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-2-thread-lanes.png" alt="startup 2 thread lanes">
</p>
</div>
<p>However as knew from the first recording, and now the second iteration this was not the only issue
identified when flying over the yellow and red events.</p>

<p>All the stacktraces above have one thing in common, a contention on a lock.
As thread were blocked, and new request appeared, this had the effects of increase the
queuing, and made tomcat creates new <em>http nio</em> worked threads until the maximum is reached
(200 by default). I applied the same trick: i.e before readyness, exercise code paths that
are lazy initialized. And it worked too. Most contention disappeared afterward.</p>

</p>
<p>Better startup / C2 compiler event</p>
</div>
<p>There was still some potential gain however. We noticed a few C2 compiler events,
If you don’t know C1 and C2, it’s the compilers that transform bytecode to assembly.
While C1 is somewhat superficial in optimizing the assembly, but it requires few
CPU and it allows code to be executed asap yet not as efficient as possible. In a
second phase C2 may kick in, this one outputs highly optimized code for hot code path
(code that is executed very, very often), but it requires resources.</p>
<p>Note this compilation event is not blocking threads !</p>
<p>As an experiment I decided to use the Graal compiler, which I believe is the new
generation of compiler. <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/compiler/README.md">Graal compiler</a>
is part of the <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal">GraalVM</a> project.
It ships as an experimental option : <code>-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseJVMCICompiler</code>.</p>
<p>And the result for this work load in particular.</p>

<p>This graph is falling under the <a href="https://latencytipoftheday.blogspot.com/2014/06/latencytipoftheday-most-page-loads.html"><em>percentlie</em></a>
but the improvement is still visible.</p>
<p>Now when we analyzed the new profile we noticed that JVM was using a lot of time to
revoke bias locking. Note the events in fushia are custom JFR events that track HTTP requests.
(<a href="https://twitter.com/gunnarmorling">Gunnar Morling</a> has an inspiring
<a href="https://www.morling.dev/blog/rest-api-monitoring-with-custom-jdk-flight-recorder-events/">write up</a> about it).</p>
<p>This VM operation is done during safepoint during which the JVM is paused. At this time a lot of
of bias revocation event appears, so we removed them, and it works too.</p>

</p>

</div>
<p>The graphic below shows the difference in startup time. Other consuming backend services had to timeout
and eventually perform retries during rollouts which increased the pressure on the application.</p>

</p>
<p>Before ⇒ after</p>
</div>
<p>Other smaller issues could be discovered and tackled, for example I noticed a few gaps
200ms wide at 30/1min intervals that were related to GC pauses.</p>
<div>
<p>GC gaps</p>
<p><span><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-9-gc-pause-1.png" alt="startup 9 gc pause 1" title="GC gap 1"></span> <span><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-9-gc-pause-2.png" alt="startup 9 gc pause 2" title="GC gap 2"></span></p>
</div>
<p>For this application the GC is working within 20ms excepts for a few larger pauses
during the early minutes of startup:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-9-thread-lanes-gc-pauses-effect.png" alt="startup 9 thread lanes gc pauses effect">
</p>
<p>GC pauses causes new HTTP worker threads</p>
</div>
<p>Tuning GC is out of scope for this article, but JMC presents a nice view that could help identify GC
causes. In my opinion it’s currently a bit less powerful as GC logs because GC events lack
useful information only found in GC logs with appropriate tags and level.</p>

</div>
<p>Anyway from there we could imagine a <em>setting</em> file in the JDK dedicated for GC events.
Instead of parsing log files whose <em>string format</em> that may change a bit over releases
(even with unified logging) GC events could be analyzed leveraging the included JFR schema.</p>
<p>Also with JFR, it’s even possible to record memory leak using the <code>profile</code> <em>settings</em> file,
I never tried that in a real situation though, but if this avoids the need to make a heap dump
and parse it then I’m all in.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          <p><strong>Empowering People. Uniting Communities.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://qbix.com/communities">Qbix</a> works with communities to release their own local <em><strong>social network</strong></em>, and help gradually onboard all the administrators, members, and guests. This lets people connect over common interests, date, make reservations at local establishments, get group discounts with local merchants, and so on. Meanwhile, the community could get statistical reports on how people are socializing.</p>
<p><a href="http://intercoin.org/">Intercoin</a> was launched in 2017 with the same vision – work with communities to release their own local <em><strong>payment network</strong></em>, and help gradually onboard all the merchants, citizens, and visitors. This would let people pay local merchants, receive a Basic Income, finance community projects, and support the local economy. Meanwhile, the community would get statistical reports on how money is flowing.</p>
<p><strong>Roadmap for Rolling Out Voluntary UBI</strong></p>
<p>There is a series of steps a community can take, to gradually implement a local UBI, one which is both voluntary and sustainable, and supports the local economy. This can be done by a town, a university, or even an online community.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Issue their own currency.</strong> The protocol powering this currency <a href="https://intercoin.org/invest.pdf">must be able to scale</a> to handle unlimited everyday transactions between people, even as money velocity goes up. Ideally, it should have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel">no bottlenecks</a>, like mining a block. Let citizens and visitors obtain this currency by depositing cash with local ATMs, banks and currency exchangers which will load it onto their digital wallets and payment cards via QR codes.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Get merchants to accept it.</strong> Tell local merchants about a new town currency that they will be able to cash out for 90 cents on the dollar through the town’s exchanges/gateways. People will be showing up with this currency, ready to buy things. Merchants who are ready to accept this currency will get to put a sign in the window and get more business.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Sell the currency at a discount.</strong> Let locals and visitors obtain the local currency at a 5% discount, to give them an incentive to obtain it. The local currency’s value <a href="https://community.intercoin.org/t/intercoin-application-stablecoins">will be stable and pegged to the federal fiat currency</a>, or <a href="https://community.intercoin.org/t/intercoin-application-virtual-currency">to a cryptocurrency like ITR or BTC</a> if your national currency is experiencing hyperinflation. Your town takes $100 and sells 105 local credits, which merchants must accept as payment for $105 of goods and may cash out for $94.50 .</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Circulating the currency.</strong> Since local currency holders would take a 10% hit every time they cash out the local currency, everyone will be motivated to push others to accept this currency. (In economics, this is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law">Gresham’s law</a>.) Merchants will be motivated to hire and keep local employees who accept some or all of their salary in the town’s local currency. These employees may get a 5% raise, or simply beat out employees who refuse to accept the local currency.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Voluntary UBI Fund.</strong> The previous steps have built up more organic demand for the currency, and caused it to circulate within the community rather than being cashed out. Now, the town’s residents can begin to receive a Basic Income, from having more money being minted into circulation, and distributed to every recipient automatically. A fund is set up by the town, or the university’s donors, to act as reserves for cashing out merchants and others.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Taxes and Fees</strong> The town can now implement transaction fees, and taxes, which remove local currency from the economy, and thus reduce their liabilities and the amount of reserves they need to keep. By operating the payment infrastructure, the town can collect 1-2% on each transaction, and also begin to collect another 5% in sales tax. Here, “collect” actually means “take out of circulation”, to <a href="http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/wp244.pdf">counteract the money printing on the other side</a>.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/16/18251646/modern-monetary-theory-new-moment-explained">Modern Monetary Theory</a> views the role of taxes as removing money from a fiat economy. Already in 1984, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grace_Commission#Report">the Grace commission report</a> found this was the case for nearly all income tax in the USA.)</p>
<p><strong>Sustainability</strong></p>
<p>For “sound money” that people can trust, most banks keep fractional reserves, but communities launching their own currencies are going to start out keeping <em>full reserves</em> to redeem every coin issued, exactly in the manner promised, even though this might be overkill in practice.</p>
<p>Already in steps 2 and 3, the town had to only keep 90% or 94.5% reserves, respectively. Since there is a lag between a coin being issued, being spent at a merchant, and being cashed out, they have to keep even less reserves.</p>
<p>This 10% “exit tariff” continuously motivates all coin-holders to spend it locally rather than take a loss cashing it out. Thus, the coins increasingly circulate in the local economy, supporting local commerce, but also increasing the lag of an average coin being cashed out, sometimes by 10x or more. As a result, the community can begin to keep fractional reserves, which can become smaller and smaller as as less and less coins are cashed out at any given time.</p>
<p>Finally, as taxes and fees are introduced in the local economy, the community can start to issue a Universal Basic Income in its own currency, without causing inflation.</p>
<p>Various taxes can be organically introduced, including sales taxes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism#:~:text=Georgism%2C%20also%20called%20geoism%20and,to%20all%20members%20of%20society.">land taxes</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigovian_tax">pigovian taxes</a> on things like pollution, fossil fuels, meat or cigarettes. By <a href="https://citizensclimatelobby.org/basics-carbon-fee-dividend/">redistributing taxed money equally to everyone</a>, this can align public incentives with taxing these negative externalities, and avoid them falling disproportionately on the working class, as happened with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_vests_movement">yellow vest protests</a> in France.</p>
<p>As demand for the local currency (and thus local real estate and services) grows, so does the town’s ability to tax various transactions. <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/in-defense-of-blockchain-voting">The town’s citizens could be given the ability to democratically vote</a> on the level of taxes, and thus the level of UBI, they want to receive.</p>
<p>Thus the town can have both sound money and true democratic control of its fiscal and monetary policies, all the while becoming more self-sufficient and stronger. Any town will be able to introduce a local UBI to end food insecurity, improve health outcomes, reduce dependence on means-tested welfare programs, and so on.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Seeing as the Slab allocator is a fairly hard and advanced topic to grasp but also essential to start programming in the Linux kernel, I wrote this document which explains how it works. I will briefly explain what the buddy allocator is in order to make it clear why a slab allocator is handy in the linux kernel and then continue with a more detailed explanation of the slab allocator(s). This writeup has been written based on the 5.3.13 Linux kernel (latest stable release at the time of writing — <em>Fri 15 Nov 22:13:17 CET 2019</em>). I will illustrate what happens on x86-64 systems in which the page sizes are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Normal Pages: 4KB (defined as the PAGE_SIZE constant in the kernel).</li>
  <li>Huge Pages: 2MB or 1GB.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-buddy-allocator">The Buddy Allocator</h2>

<p>The basic idea of a buddy allocator is fairly simple. Physical memory is broken up into large chunks of memory where each chunk is a <em>“page order”</em> (i.e., 2^n * PAGE_SIZE). Whenever a block of memory needs to be allocated and the size of it is not available, one big chunk is halved continuously, until a chunk of the correct size is found. At this point, of the two halves, also known as <strong>buddies</strong>, one will be used to satisfy the allocation request, and the other will remain free. At a later stage, if and when that memory is free’d, the two buddies (if both free) will coalesce forming a larger chunk of free memory.</p>

<p><em>Note: Linux uses a buddy allocator for each memory zone. You are not necessarily expected to understand the notion of a memory zone. Generally speaking there will be DMA and DMA32 zones, highmem zone and a Normal zone and other zones (e.g., Zone Movable).</em></p>

<p>The buddy allocator keeps track of free areas via an array of “queues” of type <code>struct free_area</code> which keeps track of the free chunks (in reality we are talking about page frames –&gt; <code>struct page</code>). It goes from 0 (min order) to 10 (MAX_ORDER - 1).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>free_area</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>struct</span> <span>list_head</span> <span>free_list</span><span>[</span><span>MIGRATE_TYPES</span><span>];</span>
		<span>unsigned</span> <span>long</span> <span>nr_free</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that the buddy allocator (and the slab allocator) allocate physically contiguous memory blocks. The third allocator in the Linux kernel, vmalloc() (which won’t be discussed for the time being) on the other hand, allocates memory that is ONLY virtually contiguous but not necessarily physical. It is primarily used for very large allocations, and cannot be used in cases where virtual addressing is not possible (e.g., devices)</p>

<p><img src="https://hammertux.github.io/img/buddy.png" alt="buddy" title="Buddy Allocator"></p>

<p>Page frames are allocated and free’d in the kernel using the following procedures:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>// "linux/gfp.h"</span>
<span>static</span> <span>inline</span> <span>struct</span> <span>page</span> <span>*</span><span>alloc_pages</span><span>(</span><span>gfp_t</span> <span>gfp_mask</span><span>,</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>order</span><span>);</span>

<span>/*
 * e.g., to request one page: struct page *page = alloc_pages(GFP_KERNEL, 0);
 */</span>

<span>// "linux/page_alloc.c"</span>
<span>void</span> <span>free_pages</span><span>(</span><span>unsigned</span> <span>long</span> <span>addr</span><span>,</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>order</span><span>);</span>


</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Both functions take the order as the parameter to see which queue to look for. If the queue is empty, the buddy allocator will search for queues in the bigger “orders” to split a block into two buddies and allocate the requested pages.</p>

<p>The GFP (Get Free Page) mask that is in the <code>alloc_pages</code> signature represents a set of flags that can be combined to represent who requests the memory allocation: e.g., <code>GFP_KERNEL</code> is used when allocating page frames for use in the kernel, <code>GFP_USER</code> is for userspace allocations, etc… (For a complete list of the GFP flags, see <code>include/linux/gfp.h</code>).</p>

<p>As it might be clear by now, the buddy allocator has one big problem. Say we want to allocate 33 pages. Seen as the buddy allocator works with the order queues explained above, the minimum amount of pages we can get is 2^6 = 64 because 33 &gt; 2^5 (=32). This <em>“wastes”</em> 31 pages (i.e., for an allocation of 33 pages, we would have an overhead of 31/64 * 100 = 48\%). This is also known as <strong>internal fragmentation</strong>. This problem in Linux is addressed using the <strong>slab allocator</strong> which slices pages into smaller blocks of memory (slabs) for allocation.</p>

<p><em>Note that in reality, the linux kernel maintainers have optimised the buddy allocator by defining page mobility (i.e., <strong>some</strong> pages are reclaimable or movable) which reduces the overhead discussed above, however this is outside the scope of this writeup</em> (if interested see the definition of <code>enum migratetype</code> in “linux/mmzone.h”).</p>

<h2 id="the-slab-allocator">The Slab Allocator</h2>

<p>The slab allocator in Linux sits on top of the buddy allocator and the basic idea behind it is to keep caches of commonly used objects available for allocation in the kernel. This is particularly useful because the Linux kernel allocates and frees many structures continuously (for example, the <code>struct task_struct</code> which is the structure that represents a process, <code>inodes</code>, <code>dentries</code>, etc…). By caching the freed object, it is possible for the basic structure to be preserved between uses thus allowing for quick allocation of new copies of the same structures. I.e., By reusing the freed objects, in some cases, the kernel doesn’t necessarily have to reinitialise them from scratch. Over the years (and many kernel versions…) the Linux slab allocator has evolved, and changed substantially. There have been three different implementations to this day:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>SLOB Allocator</strong>: Was the original slab allocator as implemented in <em>Solaris OS</em>. Now used for embedded systems where memory is scarce, performs well when allocating very small chunks of memory. Based on the <em>first-fit</em> allocation algorithm.</li>
  <li><strong>SLAB Allocator</strong>: An improvement over the SLOB allocator, aims to be very <em>“cache-friendly”</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>SLUB Allocator</strong>: Has better execution time than the SLAB allocator by reducing the number of queues/chains used.</li>
</ol>

<p>Nowadays (on most distributions) the default Slab allocator is the SLUB allocator.</p>

<p><em>Note: The generic “Slab Allocator” term can be used to refer to all three alllocators. Whenever there is the need to make a clear distinction between the allocators, I will write SLOB, SLAB or SLUB in capital letters.</em></p>

<p>A slab cache contains multiple slabs which in turn, contain multiple objects. The general organisational overview can be seen below:</p>

<p><img src="https://hammertux.github.io/img/slab-org.png" alt="slab org" title="Slab organisation"></p>

<h3 id="caches"><strong>Caches</strong></h3>

<p>The slab allocator provides two main classes of caches:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Dedicated</strong>: These are caches that are created in the kernel for commonly used objects (e.g., <code>mm_struct</code>, <code>vm_area_struct</code>, etc…). Structures allocated in this cache are initialised and when they are freed, they remain initialised so that the next allocation will be faster.</li>
  <li><strong>Generic</strong> (<em>size-N</em> and <em>size-N(DMA)</em>): These are general purpose caches, which in most cases are of sizes corresponding to powers of two.</li>
</ol>

<p>This separation can be seen in the dedicated file for slab in the proc file system:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo cat</span> /proc/slabinfo <span>#I will only show partial output for brevity</span>

<span># name &lt;active_objs&gt; &lt;num_objs&gt; &lt;objsize&gt; &lt;objperslab&gt; &lt;pagesperslab&gt; : tunables &lt;limit&gt; &lt;batchcount&gt; &lt;sharedfactor&gt;</span>

<p>The first few lines show dedicated caches, from <code>dma-kmalloc-256</code> onwards the generic caches are listed.</p>

<p><code>kmalloc</code> is the interface the kernel provides to do generic allocations through the slab allocator:</p>

<p>Creating dedicated caches for your objects is slightly trickier and requires initialising a slab cache (<code>struct kmem_cache</code>).</p>

The frequency and variability of these events are outstripping our ability to mitigate its source -- greenhouse gas emissions -- and our ability to adapt to the heightened risk.</p><h4><strong>Accounting for the Damage</strong></h4><p>Climate change is here, now. Natural disasters around the world <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-insurance-disasters/forest-fire-insurance-costs-soar-idUKKCN1P2129"><span>caused</span></a> $160 billion in economic damages in 2018. Devastating storms in the Gulf of the U.S. or the coast of Japan have led to lives lost and economic destruction of <a href="http://www.cityam.com/271984/natural-catastrophes-led-more-than-half-trillion-pounds"><span>upward of</span></a> $650 billion over two years. Global human displacement is seeing new highs in the Asia Pacific region, with <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/world/factbox-asia-pacific-worlds-most-disaster-prone-region">60 million people displaced</a> from 2013 and 2015 alone. This is an area where nearly a billion people are <a href="https://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/2015_Year%20in%20Review_final_PDF_1.pdf"><span>expected</span></a> to live by 2030.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595759604616_6108"><div><h4><strong>Fuel to the Fire</strong></h4><p>The U.S. Department of Defense <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Explore/News/Article/Article/603440/"><span>called</span></a> climate change a “threat multiplier.” There are no countries immune to its effects. No clearer was this exemplified than during the Syrian Civil War in 2011. A series of droughts in the region <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0962629816301822"><span>led to</span></a> large scale migration of young men to the country’s cities. The socio-economic stresses already present were exacerbated by the influx. Less rainfall and prolonged drought in East Africa causing further entrenched conflicts over natural resources is also representative of how anthropogenic climate change is fueling the fire of conflict.</p><p>A study by the Pentagon last year <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-18/in-dire-report-pentagon-warns-bases-imperiled-by-climate-change"><span>warned</span></a> of the link between climate change, war, and migration -- confirming that global temperature rise has and will fuel conflict and refugees. A few months later, Rod Schoonover, a member of the White House National Security Council, spoke to the Senate in June 2019, and explained:</p><p>“No country will be immune to the effect of climate change over the next 20 years, but some will be able to cope, adapt, or respond more effectively than others. […] Local problems could spillover with global consequences, such as through increased human displacement, natural resource disputes, commodity price volatility” […] “Climate change effects could undermine important international systems on which the U.S. and its partners are critically dependent, such as trade routes, food and energy supplies, the global economy, and domestic stability abroad.”</p><h4><strong>Risks to Come</strong></h4><p>There are also other risks that have only begun to be accounted for. Those that are often unforeseen but inescapable in an interconnected world.</p><p>For one, the management of corporate supply chains in an accelerating transition to renewable energy and disruptive changes to consumer habits will lead to economic collisions. It is not only the impact of destabilizing production sources in geographies vulnerable to physical climate disruptions. The prices of goods will also need to be stabilized in the open market as the financial industry, like pension funds, shift capital to ESG-pegged investments.</p><p>As an example, Coca Cola saw its balance sheets <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/24/science/earth/threat-to-bottom-line-spurs-action-on-climate.html?ref=business"><span>endangered by droughts</span></a> that reduced water availability needed to produce its soda, a risk they recognize will magnify. Nike has also sounded the alarm in its supply chain management due to the increase of tropical storms hitting its factories that mostly reside in Southeast Asia. Four Nike factories in Thailand had to shut down in 2008 due to floods.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595762628047_9013"><div><h4><strong>Canary in the Coal Mine</strong></h4><p>The thawing of permafrost and retreating sea ice in the Arctic has been said to be the “canary in the coal mine” of the climate crisis. That’s because the gradual and dramatic physical changes to this area of the Northern Hemisphere are more immediate and detrimental as temperature increase here <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar4/syr/">happens twice as fast</a> as everywhere else.</p><p>The cryosphere&nbsp; -- the frozen water part of the Earth system -- is the first place we expect to see impacts of climate change. Sea ice in the Arctic follows a seasonal cycle with minimums in September and maximums in February and March. Ice sheets’ equilibrium of snow during the winter and melt during the summer is tipping. What happens next is a change in glacier length affecting ecosystems and water resources and a change in global sea level (i.e., the volume of ocean water and volume of the ocean basins).</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595761665845_7869"><div><p>The Paris Agreement of 2015 asked that countries limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, with the aim of keeping the temperature below 1.5 degrees Celsius to avoid the most devastating consequences of climate change.</p><p>Collective action is indispensable if we are to adequately rein in emissions to meet those targets. Understanding the interconnectedness and fragility of our natural and economic systems should prompt a sense of responsibility. Understanding the climate crisis, and our direct experience with it is a way to break through its absence and minimization in the national discourse. It should prompt us to vote, fund, and work on the solutions.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p>This is the 2nd of the blog posts series that talks about ARM64 performance investigation for .NET 5. You can read my previous blog at <a href="https://kunalspathak.github.io/2020-07-04-Dotnet-Arm64-Performance">Part 1 - ARM64 performance of .Net Core</a>.</p>

<p>In this post, I will describe the implication of weakly-ordered memory model of ARM64 on generated code by .NET and how we got good wins in ARM64 for some methods present in <code>System.Collections.Concurrent.ConcurrentDictionary</code>.</p>

<h3 id="memory-ordering">Memory ordering</h3>

<p>ARM architecture has weakly ordered memory model. The processor can re-order the memory access instructions to improve the performance of the processor. It can rearrange the instructions to reduce the time processor takes to access memory. The order in which user has written the code is not guaranteed to be executed in same order and can be weakly defined depending on the memory access cost for given code. This is fine for single core machine but imagine a situation in a multi-threaded program ran on multi-core machine where core A is about to read a memory that just got overwritten by core B. The user might have intended to have code that is executed by core A to read memory before the code executed by core B writes. As you can see, this can easily get complicated and problematic. Luckily, in such situations, there are instructions to tell processors not to re-arrange memory access at a given point inside code. The technical term for such instructions that restricts this re-arrangement is called “memory barriers”. The <code>dmb</code> instruction in ARM64 acts as a barrier prohibiting the processors from moving the instructions across the fence. There are various types of barriers depending on if the user intent to restrict the re-ordering of just memory loads or memory stores or both. There are instructions to also have a barrier one-way i.e. instructions can be moved from after the barrier to before the barrier but not other way round or vice-versa. More details can be read in <a href="https://developer.arm.com/docs/den0024/a/memory-ordering">ARM documentation</a> or some of the excellent articles <a href="https://preshing.com/20120930/weak-vs-strong-memory-models/">here</a> and <a href="https://afana.me/archive/2015/07/10/memory-barriers-in-dot-net.aspx/">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="c-memory-barrier-using-volatile">C# memory barrier using volatile</h3>

<p>There are various ways to express the desire in C# to add  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_barrier">memory barriers</a>. One such way is by using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/volatile">volatile variable</a> in C#. With <code>volatile</code> variable, it is guaranteed that the runtime, JIT or the processor will not rearrange reads and writes to memory locations for performance. To make this happen, RyuJIT would emit <code>dmb</code> (data memory barrier) instruction for ARM64 every time there is an access (read/write) to a <code>volatile</code> variable.</p>

<p>For example, below is the C# code taken from <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/performance/blob/master/src/benchmarks/micro/libraries/System.Threading/Perf.Volatile.cs#L17">microbenchmarks</a>. It does a volatile read of local field <code>_location</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Perf_Volatile</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>double</span> <span>_location</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
    
    <span>[</span><span>Benchmark</span><span>]</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>double</span> <span>Read_double</span><span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Volatile</span><span>.</span><span>Read</span><span>(</span><span>ref</span> <span>_location</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The generated relevant machine code of <code>Read_double</code> for ARM64 is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>; Assembly listing for method Program:Read_double():double:this
; Emitting BLENDED_CODE for generic ARM64 CPU - Windows

G_M49790_IG02:
        91002000          add     x0, x0, #8
        FD400000          ldr     d0, [x0]
        D50339BF          dmb     ishld
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The code first gets the address of <code>_location</code> field, loads the value in <code>d0</code> register and then execute <code>dmb ishld</code> that acts as a data memory barrier.</p>

<p>Although this guarantees the memory ordering, there is a cost for it. The processor must now guarantee that all the data access done before the memory barrier is visible to all the cores after the barrier instruction. This means that the barrier requires all memory operations to complete before letting the cores cross the barrier instruction and this is time consuming.</p>

<h3 id="systemcollectionconcurrentconcurrentdictionary">System.Collection.Concurrent.ConcurrentDictionary</h3>

<p>While going through the benchmarks that are slower on ARM64, I noticed that <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/performance/blob/master/src/benchmarks/micro/libraries/System.Collections/Concurrent/Count.cs#L37">a simple benchmark</a> that gets the count of number of items stored inside <code>System.Collection.Concurrent.ConcurrentDictionary</code> was slower. On inspecting <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/0f834db1fd80cf82e5ef27f72c48af1c911775da/src/libraries/System.Collections.Concurrent/src/System/Collections/Concurrent/ConcurrentDictionary.cs#L1005">GetCountInternal</a>, I noticed that there was an access of <code>volatile</code> variable <code>_tables</code> inside a loop. 
Here is the code before it was fixed:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>private</span> <span>sealed</span> <span>class</span> <span>Tables</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>// ..</span>
    <span>internal</span> <span>volatile</span> <span>int</span><span>[]</span> <span>_countPerLock</span><span>;</span> <span>// The number of elements guarded by each lock.</span>
    <span>// ..</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>private</span> <span>volatile</span> <span>Tables</span> <span>_tables</span><span>;</span>

<span>private</span> <span>int</span> <span>GetCountInternal</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>count</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// Compute the count, we allow overflow</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>_tables</span><span>.</span><span>_countPerLock</span><span>.</span><span>Length</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>count</span> <span>+=</span> <span>_tables</span><span>.</span><span>_countPerLock</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>];</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>count</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For this method, we generated ARM64 code having memory barrier instruction inside a loop. Here is the generated assembly code:</p>

<p><img src="https://kunalspathak.github.io/assets/img/memory-barrier/code-before.png" alt="ARM64 code"></p>

<p>Here, <code>IG03</code> is a loop and the 4 yellow highlighted ones inside this block are the memory barrier instructions. Each pair is present to access two <code>volatile</code> variables <code>_tables</code> and <code>_tables._countPerLock</code>. Accessing <code>volatile</code> variable in a loop is sensible because different thread can update the value present in the variable, and we want to ensure that this doesn’t happen while we are calculating the count. However the code already takes <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/0f834db1fd80cf82e5ef27f72c48af1c911775da/src/libraries/System.Collections.Concurrent/src/System/Collections/Concurrent/ConcurrentDictionary.cs#L974">appropriate locks</a> before executing the <code>GetCountInternal()</code> method. That means, the <code>GetCountInternal()</code> method is guaranteed to execute by one thread at a time. With that being present, it is fine to cache the <code>volatile</code> variable value out of loop and use it inside the loop. That will change the C# code to something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>private</span> <span>int</span> <span>GetCountInternal</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>count</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
    <span>int</span><span>[]</span> <span>countPerLocks</span> <span>=</span> <span>_tables</span><span>.</span><span>_countPerLock</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// Compute the count, we allow overflow</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>countPerLocks</span><span>.</span><span>Length</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>count</span> <span>+=</span> <span>countPerLocks</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>];</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>count</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here is the generated ARM64 code after the change.</p>

<p><img src="https://kunalspathak.github.io/assets/img/memory-barrier/code-after.png" alt="ARM64 code"></p>

<p>If you see there are no more memory barrier instructions inside the loop <code>IG03</code> now. This simple change gave approxiametely <b>30%</b> win in the corresponding benchmark. The <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/34225">fix to hoist volatile variable access out of loop</a> was merged. In it, I was able to also hoist the access for some other methods <code>CopyTo</code>, <code>GetKeys</code> and <code>GetValues</code>. I am pretty sure there are other places in .NET code base where similar code is there and someday, I need to sit and scan through it to get more performance wins.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>To summarize, C# developer should pay careful attention while using various locking APIs or language features such as <code>volatile</code>. They come with a cost and different architecture have different cost. Thorough code review and questioning the code you write is the key to write efficient code for cross-architecture.</p>

<p>Namaste!</p>

    <p>Today’s story is about how I hackily patched a <em>division-by-zero</em> bug in the game <em>Brogue</em> by using a few useful tools available on MacOS.</p>

<p>I’m a sucker for well-made roguelikes. I cut my teeth on the venerable <em>NetHack</em>, had a long affair with the very

<p>My latest roguelike obsession has been <em>Brogue</em>.</p>

<p>Brogue, whose development began in 2009, is fairly well renowned and influential for its 
<a href="https://www.tigsource.com/2012/01/15/brogue/">very streamlined game design</a> and 
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/01/23/have-you-played-brogue/">accessible UI</a>. 
You may have even been exposed to Brogue’s core mechanical conceits through <em>Pixel Dungeon</em>,the oft-forked and remixed mobile app, such as I was.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>While procrastinating working on performance reviews, I had been playing some Brogue. 
Picking up a magic Rapier of Confusion in the game, a quick weapon with powerful lunges, I enchanted it heavily with magic scrolls.</p>

<p>Stepping onto a new level, I enhanced it one more time with a Scroll of Enchantment. 
I then went to stab a lonesome goblin, when my game suddenly crashed. I shrugged, as this is not too uncommon. 
Reloading the game again from my auto-save and appearing at the start of the level, I enchanted the rapier once again and tried to stab the goblin. 
Again, the game crashed.</p>

<p>Usually the game crashes for very inexplicable reasons, but this was a repeatable issue. 
I reloaded the game, enchanted the weapon, and then tried to look at the weapon’s stats. 
The game crashed.</p>

<p>This time instead of hand waving away the MacOS crashed program prompt, I clicked on the report issue button. 
Thanks to Brogue being open-source, the program was compiled with debug symbols, 
so I could see by the stack trace that crash was being caused by a 
division-by-zero error by the fp_sqrt function called by the function runicWeaponChance. 
By searching for <em>runicWeaponChance</em> in the repo, 
I quickly found the line at fault <a href="https://github.com/tsadok/brogue/blob/master/src/brogue/PowerTables.c#L418">here</a>,
where the game adjust the proc change of magical effects for quick weapons, such as the rapier.</p>

<p>At first, I tried to do things the proper way. 
I downloaded the code from the official site and tried to compile it with Xcode. 
As many know, simply compiling code can often turn into a fun exercise in yak shaving. 
Apple appears to like to deprecate things very quickly with my version of Xcode 
refusing to touch the old Swift code that Brogue uses for its Mac UI. My heart pines 
for Windows more humane treatment of elderly code, as 
opposed to MacOS’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan%27s_Run_(film)">Logan’s Run-esque</a> regime.</p>

<p>I could have kept banging my head against Xcode, but it seemed like so much effort to change one 
line of code. At that point, I made my decision: even though there was probably a much better way 
of fixing this bug, I was just going to patch it out by hand.</p>

<p>This was a nice exercise to explore the state of reverse engineering on MacOS, albeit with a non-obfuscated, source available, symbol lush binary.</p>

<p>I first took a stab at the binary with <a href="https://www.hopperapp.com/">Hopper Diassembler</a>. 
The free-trial is fairly restrictive, but the labeling provided was very useful in 
hunting down the assembly code section corresponding to the buggy line of code.</p>

<p>I then used <em>otool</em> to get a text disassembly dump via the command <code>otool -vtj Brogue &gt; asmdump</code>.
<em>otool</em> is a nifty CLI program for working with LLVM produced code and artifacts that I believe is on MacOS by default.
I’m a little more dextrous interacting with code via Vim, so it was easier to play around with the 
specific assembly sections. Additionally, this tool gave me the full hexdump of each line of assembly, 
which I couldn’t easily tease out of Hopper.</p>

<p>Via a combination of Hopper and otool, I anchored on that call to <code>fp_sqrt</code>, represented by <code>callq 0x1000209f0</code> 
in the <code>otool</code> dump. Scanning up, I found the telltale <code>cmpq</code> then <code>je</code> that usually represents a branch in x86-64 assembly.</p>

<p>I struggled a bit finding ways of reversing the otool dump back into code, especially since I wanted to play 
with Brogue, instead of playing around with getting the correct linked header files. Thus, I fell back on trusty xxd.</p>

<p>I dumped the binary to a structured hexdump with <code>xxd Brogue &gt; hexdump</code>.
<code>xxd</code> is a very simple, fairly standard Unix program for creating readable hexdumps of binaries. 
I found particularly unique hexcode in the neighborhood of that branch in the otool dump <code>e8 7811</code> and jumped to it with the fun regex <code>e8.\?78.\?11</code> 
since I didn’t know how it would be split in the hexdump. I then found the branch leading to the code in the hexdump.</p>

<p>Looking back at the code and noticing that it was just a slight clamp on how powerful this Rapier of Confusion would be. 
I decided to short circuit the code. I changed the <code>JE</code> (jump if the previous cmp check was equal) to <code>JNO</code> (jump if not overflow). 
This jump was now was now always taken, skipping over the buggy proc chance code. 
To perform this change, I changed <code>0F 84</code> to <code>0F 81</code>. I then reversed the hexdump with <code>xxd -r hexdump &gt; Brogue</code>.</p>

<p>I loaded back up the game. Sadly, the game handles saves via replay, which now diverged given that the proc chance was higher. 
Someone actually smart probably could have patched it to actually fix the bug and avoid the desync issue. 
Instead, I just grabbed the seed for that run and quickly played back to the autosave.</p>

<p>And there was no more crashing. I got back to the goblin and killed it. 
Soon after that, I had an unfortunate run-in with some eels and was likewise killed.</p>

<p>I went back to working on my performance review, having learned a few more tricks for 
hacking binaries on MacOS and a greater fear and respect for eels.</p>

        <p><em>(This post was originally written as a reply on the mailop mailing-list, but
a friend asked me to turn it into a blog post.  I've edited it, mostly
adding more links to elsewhere, but there are some additions here.)</em></p>
<p><em>Context: someone with a mail-server hosted in a German facility with a
poor reputation for handling abuse reports was asking for help on
sending email to their Gmail-using friends; they had SPF and didn't see
the point of DKIM; they had TLS setup for their mail-server, using a
certificate from CACert.</em></p>
<p>There's a PDF from Google from 2006 which is still worth reading:
<a href="https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/45.pdf">https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/45.pdf</a>, entitled
“Sender Reputation in a Large Webmail Service” by Bradley Taylor.
Anyone running a mail-server today needs to read that document.</p>
<p>If you don't send much email, then the only IP-based reputation which
Google can assess you on is the reputation of your address-block, so
being in a “troublesome” hosting provider will score heavily against
you.  At that point, if not moving away, you need to try to balance out
that negative score with enough positives that any of the large
providers using reputation scoring will accept the mail.</p>
<p>Working forward-and-reverse paired DNS is even more important for IPv6
than for IPv4; for better or worse, some of the large providers have
decided that exemptions in old standards for old behavior should not
apply when folks deploy standards which are far newer.  So you
absolutely need an <code>MX</code> record, you must not just rely upon
address-records (<code>A</code> and <code>AAAA</code>).</p>
<p>With a poor IP-based reputation, you need to see if you can score a
better domain-based reputation.  This is where DKIM comes into play:
once you can provably link a message to really be from a given domain,
then even if you don't send much mail you can benefit from stuff like
“not on day-old-bread domain-lists”.  But having DKIM and then a DMARC
record does help (and <a href="https://bridge.grumpy-troll.org/2014/04/dmarc-stance/">I'm no fan of DMARC</a>).</p>
<p>For the mail-server's TLS: for that to count in your favor instead of
being a wash, I strongly suspect that it needs to be a certificate which
senders can verify.  For those people scoring up for “better TLS”, those
senders using DANE will be happy with a TLSA record in DNSSEC for your
CACert anchor.  But the large webmail providers are Resistant to having
to deploy DNSSEC verification, so instead have pushed out an alternative
called MTA-STS.  With MTA-STS, you're tied into “whichever subset of CAs
all the large senders you care about will trust”, and then using that CA
for the certificates both for the MTA-STS web-server and for your
mail-server.  Note that you don't need to implement the client logic for
MTA-STS (and I think it's antithetical to an open federated platform)
but do need to just publish the static information for those senders who
do use it. At that point, CACert is not going to cut it.  You'd need to
try Let's Encrypt instead.</p>
<p>The ongoing natural tendency from larger providers is to favor
supporting what the majority of their users want the majority of the
time.  With so many people using larger providers, they naturally tilt
towards stuff which works with the larger senders, and requiring more
hoops.  Those additional hoops create more work for smaller providers
and self-hosters doing thing manually.</p>
<p>We need better automation tools around all of this.  The below will make
it clearer why.</p>
<p>So, here is my current understanding of the best current practices here,
in reality not IETF idealism.  This includes making mandatory stuff
which some folks insist must be optional, because realistically to send
to some large providers it's not optional.  This list includes features
to make you compatible with ongoing trends in the EU (particularly
Germany) to strongly disfavor allowing clear-text SMTP.</p>
<p>This assumes that you are <em>not</em> a large sender who should also be
setting up feedback loops, learning how to “warm” IPs, considering BIMI,
postmaster tooling domain verification, etc.</p>
<h3 id="deliverability-fixes">Deliverability fixes</h3>
<ol>
<li>reverse DNS with matching forward DNS; the name used should not
pattern-match anything generic and ideally would include a DNS label
of <code>mail</code> or <code>mx</code> or the like in it.</li>
<li>MX record, always.</li>
<li>Accurate SPF;
<ul>
<li>ideally not too broad; pay attention to SPF's query limits.</li>
<li>avoid <code>-all</code> at the end because, with the sole exception of “this
domain never sends email” records, the larger operators have metrics to
show that using <code>-all</code> <em>tends</em> to be a sign of over-enthusiasm rather
than reality, so it will slightly count against you;</li>
<li>remember to have an SPF record for your <code>HELO</code> hostname, because
when you send a “bounce” rejection, this is the thing which will be
looked up (since there's no domain in <code>&lt;&gt;</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DKIM set up, with thought towards the selector namespace.
<ul>
<li>RSA2048 key is effectively a hard-requirement
<ul>
<li>DNS TXT records consist of one or more DNS strings, each of which
is limited to 255 ASCII characters.  For a key of this size, you
will end up needing two DNS strings in the zonefile.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ed25519 keys are not yet widely supported, but by now are not
likely to actively break and make things worse for you, if you
dual-sign.  This needs to be a different selector.</li>
<li>Note that for various good reasons you should design this to be
something you routinely rotate.
<ul>
<li>Some folks use yearly, some monthly</li>
<li>I rotate every three months.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DMARC record; see <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7489" title="Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC)">RFC 7489</a>
<ul>
<li>But for domains which humans send from <em>don't</em> use
<code>p=quarantine</code> or <code>p=reject</code>;</li>
<li>Do consider setting up a receiver for reports, just so that you can
see how much of a privacy breach DMARC reporting is when you send
to mailing-lists which don't re-sign. :-/</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>TLS certificate from a CA in the main trust anchor bundles;
<ul>
<li>Just use Let's Encrypt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MTA-STS web-server with HTTPS certificate from the same CA, and the
relevant MTA-STS txt file in place; add the DNS record when it's up
and happy.  See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8461" title="SMTP MTA Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS)">RFC 8461</a>.
<ul>
<li>See <a href="https://esmtp.email/tools/mta-sts/">https://esmtp.email/tools/mta-sts/</a> for a testing validation tool
(with thanks to Luis Muñoz for the pointer).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For the independent mail providers using the stuff broadly supported
in open source MTAs, you should look at DNSSEC, because the patterns
here are less susceptible to rent-seeking pressures:
<ul>
<li>DNSSEC-signed zone for your own domain
<ul>
<li>Use whichever signing algorithm CloudFlare are currently using:
this should be both current for cryptography and widely enough
supported that if it's not supported by someone's resolver, then
they have bigger problems than just your domain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DNSSEC validating resolver for you to look up records of others
(consider <a href="https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/">Unbound</a> or <a href="https://www.knot-resolver.cz/">Knot Resolver</a>)</li>
<li>DANE records for your own domain (TLSA records in DNS)
<ul>
<li>See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7672" title="SMTP Security via Opportunistic DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) Transport Layer Security (TLS)">RFC 7672</a> for the SMTP details.</li>
<li>See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6698" title="The DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol: TLSA">RFC 6698</a> for the base spec with <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7218" title="Adding Acronyms to Simplify Conversations about DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE)">RFC 7218</a> for some common
acronyms which make talking about it easier.</li>
<li>See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7671" title="The DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) Protocol: Updates and Operational Guidance">RFC 7671</a> for the updates and operational guidance.</li>
<li>There are other RFCs, for SRV records and for OpenPGP, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tell your mail-server to obey DANE stuff, so that if there's a TLSA
record in DNSSEC-verified DNS then the mail-server can disable
fallback to cleartext for delivery to MX (and ideally also then
verify the TLS connection has a cert chain which is anchored in one
of the TLSA records)</li>
<li><a href="https://dnsviz.net/">https://dnsviz.net</a> is your friend</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>_smtp._tls</code> record so you can get reports of TLS failures sending to
you</li>
<li>Seeing if you can get your IP onto one of the open DNS-based
allow-lists (also called “whitelists” but some folks are moving away
from that term), such as <a href="https://www.dnswl.org/">https://www.dnswl.org/</a> or Spamhaus's SWL.</li>
<li>Periodically check if you appear in any DNS-based deny-lists.</li>
<li>Make sure you're not sending from “ISP residential address-space”; if
need be route your mail outbound via a host in better address-space
(and update SPF etc to match)</li>
<li>Don't do sender call-out verification to SMTP servers which aren't
yours.</li>
<li>For your own sanity, do make sure you set up <a href="https://www.fail2ban.org/">fail2ban</a>, or something
like it, scanning your mail-server logs, because SMTP AUTH online
cracking is widespread.  If they ever get in, your deliverability
will be negatively impacted by their spam campaign through your
mail-server.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="convenience-stuff">Convenience Stuff</h3>
<p>Outside of “Phil's BCP” above, additional non-deliverability but
convenience options include:</p>
<ol>
<li>DNS SRV records for submission(s)/imap(s)/pop3(s)/sieve, even if just
to say with «<code>0 0 0 .</code>» that it's not supported.</li>
<li>If your communications base includes people using OpenPGP with email,
then set up WKD to publish OpenPGP keys for your domain too.
<ul>
<li>This is just a fixed schema for laying out keys for HTTPS retrieval.</li>
<li>See the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-koch-openpgp-webkey-service/?include_text=1" title="OpenPGP Web Key Directory">WKD draft</a> for details.</li>
<li>I wrote <a href="https://github.com/PennockTech/openpgpkey-control">https://github.com/PennockTech/openpgpkey-control</a> as a
management framework for an organization; the
<code>other/standalone-update-website</code> script is designed to be
embeddable into an existing site-building workflow without anything
else from the repository.</li>
<li>The GnuPG project has tooling available which manages the WKD layout as
an email-integrated workflow, for people to update their own keys.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If your communications base includes people using S/MIME then set up
SMIMEA records in your DNSSEC-signed DNS.
<ul>
<li>They look a lot like TLSA records; both are trust anchors in DNS.</li>
<li>See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8162" title="Using Secure DNS to Associate Certificates with Domain Names for S/MIME">RFC 8162</a> for details.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The moment you start specifying “must be TLS-secured” it's worth
adding <code>CAA</code> records into DNS, so that Certificate Authorities which
are broadly trusted will refuse to issue for your domain unless you
list them.
<ul>
<li>See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8659" title="DNS Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) Resource Record">RFC 8659</a> for details</li>
<li>The values checked by each Certificate Authority as indicating they
have permission are required to be listed in their Certification
Practice Statement, as part of the CA/Browser forum's Baseline
Requirements.  If it's missing, then browsers are not supposed to
be trusting that CA.</li>
<li>For domain-validation CAs such as Let's Encrypt, consider adding
account information to those records to tie it to your specific
account.  See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8657" title="Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) Record Extensions for Account URI and Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) Method Binding">RFC 8657</a> for details.</li>
<li>Beware that at time of writing, Let's Encrypt only honors the
<code>accounturi</code> restriction in their staging environment, not their
production setup; this will likely change.</li>
<li>Remember that DNS zonefiles support comments.  You'll want them</li></ul></li></ol></article></main></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After 6 unforgettable years in Singapore, I was ready to start a new adventure in London. But as COVID struck, my plan to immigrate to the UK had to be shelved. With cases on the rise in the UK, I was relieved to be in Singapore. That was until I was asked to leave. As I had already resigned from my job in Singapore, my Singapore visa expired. And as I could not travel to the UK, my UK visa expired too since I didn't activate it. Singapore government graciously extended my visa for two months, allowing more time to weather the COVID crisis. But I eventually got a call from Indian Embassy asking me to book a repatriation flight to India. Here is an account of how it was -</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="changi" title="changi" src="https://naman.io/static/4ec0469c8d17c38edbf75c9d34547d20/8ff1e/changi.png" srcset="https://naman.io/static/4ec0469c8d17c38edbf75c9d34547d20/9ec3c/changi.png 200w,

    </span></p>
<h2>Buying a ticket</h2>
<p>I got an email from the Indian embassy asking me to visit the airline's office at 2 pm the next day to purchase ticket for a repatriation flight. Knowing how the Indian system work, I reached around 12.30 pm to get a ticket. There were few people in the office and I got a ticket within minutes. They had a list of names and were only giving tickets to the people on the list.  I think had I reached the office on time (2 pm) I might not have got the ticket since the flight was full.</p>
<h2>Check-in</h2>
<p>After saying goodbyes I reached the airport 4 hours before the flight (as mentioned in my ticket). Instead of directly queuing at the check-in counter, I was handed over some declaration forms and a slip that mentioned the time I am allowed to check-in.
<span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="checkin" title="checkin" src="https://naman.io/static/c3f8e1a0f21c7ebd473e2472d3292a89/8ff1e/checkin.png" srcset="https://naman.io/static/c3f8e1a0f21c7ebd473e2472d3292a89/9ec3c/checkin.png 200w,

    </span>
Since my check-in time was still an hour away, I made a few calls and clicked some pictures to pass the time. Then came my turn and it took less than 5 minutes to check-in and I was sent to another queue. Here Indian embassy officials took the declaration form and allowed us to move to immigration.</p>
<h2>Immigration</h2>
<p>Immigration at Singapore was pretty standard, I went to the Immigration official handed over my passport. She looked at it, stamped it and off I go.</p>
<h2>Waiting Area</h2>
<p>Singapore airport is the best airport in the world. The one thing I missed during this trip was the water. All the water outlets were closed to prevent the spread of COVID, so I had to buy the overpriced bottle from the lone shop that was available.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>Like any other trip, people formed a long queue at security.  Security followed the standard procedure. Take out your jackets, laptops etc. a quick check and guard allowed me to go. Everyone at
security was wearing masks and wearing suits.</p>
<h2>Holding Area</h2>
<p>This is where you start to get the feeling that it's not going to be a normal flight. You can see a lot of people wearing gloves, suits etc (mask was compulsory). Airline officials gave everyone mask, face shield and some tissues. They handed out extra suits to some of us as well.
<span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="mask" title="mask" src="https://naman.io/static/3036dab460b3677156e1322d2ab81023/a296c/mask.jpg" srcset="https://naman.io/static/3036dab460b3677156e1322d2ab81023/f544b/mask.jpg 200w,

    </span>
Then came the announcement and we started boarding.</p>
<h2>Flight</h2>
<p>Flight was full. Airlines required everyone to wear the masks and face shield at all times. Food was packed and kept on every seat, though few passengers ate it. It was a night flight, but sleeping with a mask and face shield was next to impossible. Flight entertainment was turned off as well.</p>
<h2>Arrival</h2>
<p>All the norms of social distancing were gone once the flight landed at Delhi airport. As usual people formed queues to get out of the plane standing close to each other.
<span>
      <span></span>

    </span>
Officials asked us to sit in a holding area for briefing and filling health declarations.</p>
<h2>Health Check and Briefing</h2>
<p>They ask us to queue up at the 3 counters for the health check, which was basically just temperature screening. Officials at the airport tried their best to maintain social distancing. We were then  asked to go to a special holding area according to our state. I went to "Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan" holding area.</p>
<h2>Grouping, Immigration and Baggage</h2>
<p>The officials took our passport and put a sticker with a number, dividing us into groups of 30 each. We were told that all other formalities will happen group wise. Officials first took us to  immigration and then baggage collection making sure all the social distancing norms were followed. Protocols and arrangements were impressive. Our passports were now taken away in a bag and were again asked to go to individual state counters.</p>
<h2>Haryana State Counter</h2>
<p>At the counter, A district-specific form (Gurugram in my case) was given to me. I was handed over my passport as well. There was one CRPF (central police) officer at the exit, who only allowed people out after confirmation from state officials. I filled the form and waited for my turn. A lot of people kept breaking the queue despite several pleas from the officials. I went in and was asked to select a hotel for 7 days or a government-sponsored quarantine facility. I asked if I can do home quarantine which was politely declined. I chose my hotel and was then asked to present a proof of my Gurugram residency. I contacted my brother to get the residency proof after which I was allowed to leave.</p>
<h2>Exit</h2>
<p>At the exit, CRPF official still didn't allow me to leave asking me to bring state official personally. So I did and was finally allowed to exit. Just outside several cab drivers offered me to drive to the hotel which is like less than 8 km for Rs. 2000 - Rs. 4000, normal price is Rs. 300. I took a pre-paid cab which cost me 600 Rs and the person didn't give me any receipt. After 4 hours at the airport, I was in no mood for an argument.</p>
<h2>Hotel</h2>
<p>Cab driver sanitized his car and drove me to the hotel. I was given a room for 7 days at Govt. subsidized rate of Rs. 3000 including food which is pretty decent for 4-star hotel. I was asked not to come out of the room for the next 7 days and a COVID test was arranged for me on 6th day after which I was allowed to leave.

<p>These are challenging times. I will not forget about this journey for a long time. Stay at home, stay safe.</p></div></div>]]>

    <p><span>04 May 2020 · 2 min read</span></p><!-- https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/add-twitter-share-button -->
    <p>This article is based on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn-syMunNy8">PyCon 2020 talk</a> of the same title.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="http://cristal.inria.fr/~weis/info/commandline.html">In the beginning, was the command line</a>. Well, not quite the command line we know today.</p>
<p>We had typewriters. We were communicating using Morse code. One fine day, someone had an idea to connect a typewriter to an existing network of communication wires. And the teletypewriter was born!</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://vinayak.io/files/tty-ww2.jpg">
</p>

<p>Teletypes removed the need for a human to know Morse code, which improved message typing speed and delivery time. In this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-eFFd5BmpU">1932 video</a>, the narrator describes how a teletype takes only a matter of seconds to deliver a message from London to Edinburgh. A stark contrast to the earlier ETA of one week — the time taken by a mail coach to undertake the same 600 km journey.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://vinayak.io/files/mainframes.jpg">
</p>

<p>Meanwhile, computers were becoming powerful enough to interact with users in real-time. Another fine day, someone had an idea to repurpose a teletype, connect it to a modem, and use it as a remote interface to early computers. This was the origin of the command-line interface!</p>
<p>Among these teletypes were the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friden_Flexowriter">Friden Flexowriter</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletype_Model_33">Teletype Model 33</a>. Users typed commands after a prompt character was printed on paper. After they were satisfied with the input, they would press Enter which would then send the command to the computer. And finally the output from the computer would be printed on paper again.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://vinayak.io/files/vt100.jpg">
</p>

<p>Teletypes were continued to be used as terminals to computers, until video displays came into the picture during the late 1970s. Video terminals quickly became popular input-output devices for computers after the manufacturers moved to a set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal#Early_VDUs">common standards</a>.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://vinayak.io/files/tty-modern.png">
</p>

<p>Today, physical teletypes and video terminals are obsolete. We instead have terminal emulators, which are <a href="http://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/">software simulations of the real thing</a>. But, have modern terminal emulators borrowed any features from the OG metal beasts?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
										
<p>The guerrilla 3D-gun file development group <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Deterrence Dispensed (opens in a new tab)" href="https://keybase.io/team/det_disp" target="_blank">Deterrence Dispensed</a> released to the public yesterday the much-anticipated FGC-9 project. The FGC-9 is described in the official release documentation as “the most effective and easiest to build homemade semi-automatic firearm design for people with limited access to gunsmithing knowledge and tools.”</p>



<p>The FGC-9 release is important because it represents a fulfillment of the promise of 3D printed guns: they can’t be stopped. In 2013, the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Liberator (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberator_(gun)" target="_blank">Liberator</a> was proof of concept. In 2020, the FGC-9 is proof of carbine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FGC-9 enables everyday people all around the world to build a 9mm semi-automatic firearm, from start to finish, using a 3D printer and commonly available, unregulated materials. It’s specifically designed to be accessible to folks with minimal gun building experience, and avoids using parts commonly or easily restricted by law in the US and Europe. Anyone can build it, and no one can stop it.</p>



<p>In case there was any doubt about the political ideology here, you should know that the ‘FGC’ in the ‘FGC-9’ stands for “fuck gun control”. </p>



<p>Designer <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="jstark1809 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://keybase.io/jstark1809" target="_blank">JStark1809</a> details his motivation for the project, “Frustrated by not being able to acquire and bear firearms because of regulations and tyrannical laws, I embarked on the journey to learn to produce my own firearms.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>An anonymous European designer and maker, JStark1809 worked with other prominent developers to complete the project. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="IvanTheTroll (opens in a new tab)" href="https://keybase.io/ivanthetroll" target="_blank">IvanTheTroll</a> developed the printed Glock magazines and ECM barrel making process, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Incarbonite (opens in a new tab)" href="https://keybase.io/Incarbonite" target="_blank">Incarbonite</a> adapted an airsoft M4 fire control group for an AR-15 lower receiver. Others like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="CtrlPew (opens in a new tab)" href="https://keybase.io/ctrlpew" target="_blank">CtrlPew</a> helped video documentation, and a team of beta testers put the build through its paces before release.</p>



<p>To fully appreciate the importance of this release, one must understand two things: </p>



<ol><li><strong>What Makes the FGC-9 Special</strong></li><li><strong>How 3D Printed Guns Got to This Point</strong></li></ol>



<hr>



<h2>What Makes the FGC-9 Special?</h2>



<p>Thanks largely in part to the efforts of the Deterrence Dispensed group, 3D printed gun developers in recent years have produced a number of functional, high-quality firearms that many nay-sayers thought to be outside the scope of what 3D printed materials could safely produce. Guns like the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Glock 17 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.enblocpress.com/resources/the-3d-printed-glock-facts-vs-misconceptions/" target="_blank">Glock 17</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Tec-9 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B8KaG1wIaPH/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target="_blank">Tec-9</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="AK-47 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/Ivan_Is_Back/status/1244644782992961536?s=20" target="_blank">AK-47</a>, or even <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Hi-Point (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.enblocpress.com/news/deterrence-dispensed-project-lopoint-release/" target="_blank">Hi-Point</a>, can be anonymously fabricated at home without government oversight using a cheap 3D printer and factory/OEM parts. And they have a serviceable lifespan of thousands of rounds.</p>



<p>But here’s the catch: you still need a factory barrel and parts kit for these guns. The Glock 17 print needs a parts kit and a Glock slide. The Tec-9 needs an upper receiver and parts kit. The AK-47 needs an AMD-65 parts kit. The Hi-Point needs a C9 or C380 parts kit. And these parts kits can be scarce or potentially even regulated by the government. </p>



<p>Currently, most 3D printed guns are <em>really</em> just 3D printed frames, that are later completed using factory parts. Factory parts that can’t practically or easily be made at home.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/B8MxL3alvtr/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="12"></blockquote>
</div><figcaption>The purple frame is printed. The metal portion is factory produced.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The above video shows a Tec-9 build at the range. The frame (the purple part) is 3D printed, and the upper (the silver part) is from a factory-produced Tec-9. This is how the majority of current 3D guns are made. There’s no serial number, and no documentation the firearm exists. This is why it’s a ‘ghost gun’. But the construction of the gun is dependent on the availability (and, if you’re a good little boy or girl, the legality) of factory parts in order to come to life as a functional firearm.</p>



<p>The FGC-9 is important because it removes this limitation. The FGC-9 is made almost entirely out of home-built or 3D printed parts and unregulated materials. It can’t be regulated away, and it can be built by anyone. Keep in mind that the main designer is in Europe — where practically no firearms are legal, and items like barrels or frames (which are generally unregulated in the United States) are legally restricted and not readily available in the consumer market — and so the limitations to what could be used in the design process were greater than what’s faced by U.S. based makers.</p>



<h3>A Look at the FGC-9</h3>



<p>The FGC-9 release file package includes all the knowledge and design files necessary to print and make the gun. It also includes a detailed 110-page build guide, thoughtfully designed to walk the everyday person through the construction and assembly of the firearm.</p>

</p><figcaption>The FGC-9 being fired</figcaption></figure>



<blockquote><p>The FGC-9 is a 9x19mm pistol caliber carbine that is made mostly out of 3D-printed components, utilizes an AR-15 or airsoft M4 rifle fire control group, is compatible with Glock magazines and offers a truly effective, simple to build and reliable tactical option for self-defense and more.&nbsp;</p><cite>– FGC-9 Documentation</cite></blockquote>



<p>The build files are seeded using the LBRY protocol over a peer-to-peer, distributed network using blockchain. Anyone who downloads the files can share them with anyone else. They can be stored on a USB thumb drive and shared offline or stored. There’s no centralized server or set of mirrors to be taken down via court order. Any efforts to mitigate the propagation of these gun files is purely for show at this point. The signal can’t be stopped.</p>



<p>The FGC-9 documentation offers clear, step-by-step instructions. There are plenty of diagrams, pictures, and schematics. There’s a table of contents. A troubleshooting guide. An email address. There’s an encrypted chat group — almost 7,000 people strong — where people can ask questions and find support. There are guides to 3D printing guns distributed widely across the internet (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="and even one hosted right here on En Bloc Press (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.enblocpress.com/resources/deterrence-dispensed-getting-your-first-3d-printer-and-how-to-use-it/" target="_blank">and even one hosted right here on En Bloc Press</a>).</p>



<p>All told, the FGC-9 release file equips the average person with the tools necessary to produce a quality 9mm semi-auto for less money than most factory-produced 9mm pistol carbines. No government paperwork, no bureaucracy, no permits (after all, free men don’t ask permission). The information is distributed globally and permanently. The only thing required to obtain the gun is the human effort it takes to build it, and access to a printer and common hand tools.</p>







<h3>What About the Barrel?</h3>



<p>The barrel is a rifled metal barrel, made through a process called <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="electrochemical machining (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrochemical_machining" target="_blank">electrochemical machining</a>. “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/Ivan_Is_Back" target="_blank">Ivan the Troll</a>” developed the easy to replicate ECM rifling process for 9mm barrels, which allows them to be built in small indoor spaces like an apartment or a bathroom. The ECM process lets the average person create a rifled barrel from metal, at home using salt water and electrodes, without requiring expensive machine tools or metal working experience. </p>



<h3>Which Magazines Does It Take?</h3>



<p>The FGC-9 runs on Glock 9mm magazines. These are readily available in most markets. For people who live in non-free states and countries, the magazines can be 3D printed and produced at home using the ‘Menendez Mag’ (named in honor of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Bob Menendez (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.menendez.senate.gov/" target="_blank">Bob Menendez</a>, the anti-gun Senator from New Jersey). These magazines were also developed by Ivan, and the design files for the Menendez Mag are available from Deterrence Dispensed or from the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="DEFCAD repository (opens in a new tab)" href="https://defcad.com/library/8ab6bdbc-d81f-4bdd-bf6f-89d97e18629f/" target="_blank">DEFCAD repository</a>. </p>

<h2>How 3d Printed Guns Got to This Point</h2>



<h3>Standing on the Shoulders of Giants</h3>



<p>The release of the FGC-9 is especially significant because it represents a complete technological iteration of Cody Wilson’s Liberator pistol. If the Liberator is the first fish squirming out of the sea and onto dry land, the FGC-9 is the first human to stand upright. </p>



<p>The Liberator is a 3D printed, single shot handgun. It rocked the firearm and political world in 2013, when Wilson, and his company Defense Distributed, made the design files available to anyone with an internet connection. The pistol was essentially a minimum viable product, and was entirely impractical to use for self-defense or any other traditional application. But it drew plenty of attention, and it picked a Texas sized fight with the powers that be. </p>

<p>Liberator demonstrated to anyone with a gavel or a voting bloc that guns could be made at home, out of untraceable materials, by regular people. They weren’t practical yet — but it was obvious that eventually they would would be.</p>



<p>The response to Liberator by the government was sudden and severe. The files were ordered to be taken down from the internet. Wilson and his company have been involved in some legal battle or another almost perpetually since the release of the Liberator. The fight has involved years of effort, and involvement by the DOJ, State Department, and 21 separate state Attorneys General. But this fight is of Wilson’s design — and he’s winning.</p>



<h3>Fighting Within the Constraints of the System</h3>



<p>Cody Wilson, a former law student, has made clear that he believes the American legal system offers protections to free speech and the right to keep and bear arms, and that his endeavors are not only legal but specifically protected. Computer code (and thus 3d printing files) are expressive; they’re free speech. The fact that this free speech can be turned into a gun is also protected. His fight is about principal, not necessarily practicality. He wants his efforts to be vindicated by the system. To be expressly permitted. To be beyond legal reproach.</p>



<p>The government obviously has a major interest in controlling the ability of citizens to possess firearms. 3D printing prevents this, and the government at the federal and state level has fought fiercely against it ever since Cody Wilson first fired the Liberator on YouTube.</p>



<p>Wilson has stated that he views his fight against the government as a struggle against “massive forces — anonymous forces — of discipline and control”, and that he sees liberty as “under siege”. </p>



<p>But Defense Distributed’s challenges in court are expensive and time consuming. Their success is never guaranteed, and their future is always threatened by the power of the State. The administrative state can use its powers of bureaucracy to bog down …</p></div></div>

        From: C. M. Sperberg-McQueen <cmsmcq@blackmesatech.com>
        Subject: Re Humanist 34.53

In Humanist 34.53, Norman Gray suggests, as have others in slightly
different formulations, that the committee which specified Algol 58
is likely to have been influenced in its choice of basic symbols by
the keyboards in use at the time:

     The language designers decided it would be useful to lexically
     distinguish assignment from an equality test, they presumably cast
     around in their memories for a suitable symbol available using the
     keyboards in front of them, which would have some level of
     intuitive affordance to the language's users, ':=' fitted the
     bill, and thus made they it so.

That this scenario appeals to many of us can be seen by the regularity
with which some variant of it appears in postings to this thread.

Unfortunately, it can easily be shown false by the account given in
the Algol 58 report itself and by the actual content of the report.
This has been pointed out several times over the last week, though for
reasons apparently connected to Humanist's consistently erratic mail
handlers none of the messages have appeared in Humanist.  With this mail
I would like to make one last attempt to outwit Humanistâ€™s
black hole for incoming mail and rehearse some of the relevant factual
background.

Some salient points:

- The Uniscope 300 keyboard pointed to by NG as a sample of what might
have inspired the Algol 58 committee, became available as a commercial
product about 1964 (as did the IBM 029 keypunch machine pointed to by
WMcC in the same role), about six years too late to have served as a
point of reference.

- The committee's report on the language says explicitly that the
choice of symbols was not guided by the availability of characters on
existing equipment:

    The characters [of the reference language] are determined by ease
    of mutual understanding and not by any computer limitations, coder
    notation, or pure mathematical notation.

- On the contrary, the reports on what we now know as Algol 58 and on
Algol 60 distinguish systematically among the reference language, the
publication language, and the language's 'hardware representations',
which are expected to vary across machines and countries.

- It is in the reference language that := appears as the signal for
assignment.  That the committee not only said that they had not
consulted current hardware limitations, but had really not done so, in
choosing the basic symbols of the reference language, seems to be
confirmed by the inclusion of a number of symbols not then (and not
now) readily available on keyboards:

   Ã— the St. Andrew's cross symbol for multiplication
   Ã· the dotted-fraction symbol for division (in addition to the solidus)
   â‰&nbsp; the negated equal sign
   â†‘ â†“ â†’ an up arrow, a down arrow, a right arrow
   [ ] square brackets
   â‰¤ â‰¥ the symbols for 'less than or equal to' and 'greater than or
equal to'
   â‹€ â‹� â‰¡ the symbols for logical conjunction, logical disjunction, and
logical equivalence.

If in 1958 any group casts around in their memories for symbols
available on contemporary keyboards and then chooses that particular
inventory of signs, one can only infer that their memories of having
seen actual keyboards were hazy at best.

- The fact that the reference language used symbols not readily
available on data entry equipment was a source of criticism of the
Algol 58 and Algol 60 reports, as is clear from Jean Sammet's paper on
the development of Cobol, which has been cited earlier in this thread
and from the first comment after John Backus's paper at the 1959
conference in Paris at which he first presented what is now known as
the Backus Naur Form for grammars, also cited earlier in the thread.

It may be noted that the designers of Cobol, who made a conscious
effort to define their language in terms of characters available on
widely used data entry equipment and who were working a little later
than the group that defined Algol 58, eschewed not only St. Andrew's
cross and the other symbols listed above, but also (unless I am
mistaken) provided textual alternatives to symbols like &lt;, &gt;, and =.


Like some others in the thread, NG stresses the arbitrary nature of
such symbols and their interpretation; I take this to be a gentle
remonstration with WMcC hinting that he is looking for meaning in
places where none is to be found.

It is true, I think, that the assignment of symbols in languages like
Algol 58 is arbitrary in the sense that it proceeds by fiat from the
will of the language specifiers.  If they had chosen to represent
assignment by St. Andrew's cross, multiplication by the solidus, and
addition and subtraction by a down arrow and the keyword 'begin',
respectively, they would have introduced no logical contradiction in
their work.

And yet, it seems unlikely that any of the thousands of programming
languages devised over the last seventy years have chosen to represent
assignment with St. Andrew's cross, or subtraction with the keyword
'begin'.  (I have just checked: not even Brainfuck does anything of
the kind, and Snobol4 limits itself to allowing the programmer to do
so.)  Why is that?  NG has already provided the answer: like others
who over the centuries have invented notations, the designers of
programming languages seek what NG calls "some level of intuitive
affordance" to users.  This was particularly important, it appears,
for the members of the group specifying Algol 58, since one of its
explicit goals was to serve human-to-human communication of algorithms
(hence the explicit identification of a "publication language"
suitable for typesetting and journal publication, which indeed duly
ensued: in the U.S. Algol had much more success as a language for
publishing algorithms than as a language for programming computers).

Willard's initial post, then, asks (it seems to me) the entirely
reasonable question "what was the intuitive affordance provided by the
choice of := to signal assignment, and why was := preferred over, say,
a left-pointing arrow?  or a right-pointing arrow with the variable
name on the right?"  I am not much persuaded by his conjectural
answer, but the question seems to me to be a reasonable one.

After all, the history of symbolic notations is full of symbols chosen
for their ability to suggest an appropriate idea, or avoided because
of the danger of conveying a misleading idea.  (Descartes was familiar
with the symbol = for equality, and used it in that sense in at least
one letter, but generally avoided it; Florian Cajori speculates that
he may have done so because the same symbol was also in use to denote
arithmetical difference.)

So far, the only suggestions in the discussion that have not involved
anachronistic keyboards (and anachronistic assumptions that senior
academics and technical people would in 1958 have been likely to know
their way around a keyboard or a keypunch machine) are Herbert
Wender's observation that := and =: are sometimes used in mathematical
definitions (with the definiendum on the same side as the colon) and
Norman Gray's suggestion that Church's lambda calculus might be a
possible source.  Alas, my copy of Church's Introduction to
mathematical logic does not show any use of := as a symbol; as a
substitution operator Church uses S with a subscript and a
superscript.

If Church's notation influenced the group, it may have been in a
negative sense. The German and Swiss participants in the meeting
proposed to write assignment in the form

   a + 3 â†’ s

but the American participants resisted and in Algol 58 this assignment
would take the form

   s := a + 3

It is clear from F.L. Bauer's account of this that twenty years later
he still resented the way this decision came out.  (I can relate to
that.)

Although he does not use := to denote substitution, Church does use a
special symbol to denote definitions.  And as luck would have it, he
uses the right arrow, pointing not at the definiendum but at the
definiens:  X â†’ Y means 'X is defined as meaning Y', not 'Y gets the
meaning X'.

It may be a stretch to invoke Church at all here: McCarthy was not a
participant at this stage (and in any case McCarthy at some point
confessed to not having read Church all the way through, which is
apparently how Lisp came to have dynamic scope instead of the lexical
scope of the lambda calculus).  But one can easily imagine a
discussion beginning "wait, surely you mean for that arrow to be
pointing the other way!" "no, why?!" and ending "why don't we find
another symbol to use here?"  And one can easily imagine that
discussion finding its echo in the preliminary report's bland
reference to "ease of mutual understanding".

All in all, I am sure that the arguments in ZÃ¼rich over the assignment
symbol were absolutely nothing compared to the arguments over the
decimal point.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-9425"><div><div><div><h2>Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney lambasts Apple and Google for their App store policies charging 30% commission from developers</h2><p>With the dates for <a href="https://androidrookies.com/jeff-bezos-tim-cook-mark-zuckerberg-sunder-pichai-to-testify-in-u-s-antitrust-hearing-on-july-27/">House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee hearings</a> nearing, there has been a storm of criticism directed against Apple for its App store policies. Earlier we had <a href="https://androidrookies.com/telegram-developer-wants-a-law-to-make-apple-allow-iphone-users-to-install-apps-from-other-app-stores/">Pavel Durov of Telegram</a> who wanted legislation enacted to make Apple allow iPhone to install independent Apps stores. Now, Epic Games CEO, Tim Sweeney has joined the crowd.</p><p>Sweeney castigated both Apple and Google for their monopolistic App store policies. Both Apple and Google charge a 30% commission from developers offering paid/premium or in-App services. Sweeney says that both the tech giants have<span> built app stores that are entirely based on the idea of monopoly.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Sweeney called Apple an <strong>absolute monopoly</strong>.&nbsp;In an interview with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/24/epic-games-ceo-tim-sweeney-apple-crippled-app-store-with-30percent-cut.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CNBC</a>, Sweeney says Apple has invented “an absolute monopoly,” while Google crushes competition stores with “UI barriers.” He says that the 30% fee charged by both Apple and Google are unrealistic and emphasized that these charges only&nbsp;increase the price of the apps and games.</p><p>Epic Games has a bad history with App stores, especially with Google Play Store. It had earlier Fortnite for Android smartphone as an APK to beat Google’s 30% commission fees. However, when Fortnite players complained that installing the APK was too complicated, Epic Games relented and published it on <a title="Google Play" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.epicgames.fortnite&amp;hl=en_IN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Store</a> paying Google the 30% commission as mandated.</p><p>“Google essentially intentionally stifles competing stores by having user interface barriers and obstruction. If every developer could accept their own payments and avoid the 30% tax by Apple and Google we could pass the savings along to all our consumers and players would get a better deal on items. And you’d have economic competition,” Sweeney told CNBC.</p><p>He was also very fierce on Apple. “Apple has locked down and crippled the ecosystem by inventing an absolute monopoly on the distribution of software, on the monetization of software,” Sweeney told CNBC’s Julia Boorstin.</p><p>This is not the first time Sweeney has lashed out against Google. In <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/02/12/tim-sweeney-android-is-a-fake-open-system-and-ios-is-worse/">February 2020</a> during a keynote address to the DICE Summit game event in Las Vegas, he had called Google’s Android a “fake open system” for putting up barriers in front of users.</p><p>The representatives of tech giants, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, will be testifying in a <a href="https://androidrookies.com/jeff-bezos-tim-cook-mark-zuckerberg-sunder-pichai-to-testify-in-u-s-antitrust-hearing-on-july-27/">Congress hearing</a> for their anti-trust behavior. <a href="https://androidrookies.com/microsoft-complains-about-apples-30-commission-from-app-developers-during-private-anti-trust-meeting/">Brad Smith, President and Legal Officer of Microsoft</a> has already had a private meeting with the anti-trust committee members in which he complained about Apple’s App store commission.</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

<p>If you try to deploy a new release of Clojure library with
<a href="https://leiningen.org/">Leiningen</a>, it prompts you to sign the .jar file with GPG. This step
often causes confusion and breaks. I believe that it’s not worth the effort to
make it work.</p>
<p>As far as I know, <em>nobody ever verifies the signatures</em> in a systematic way.
There are a bunch of obstacles:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s unclear if any tools for verifying the signatures actually work. For
example, I just tried to run <code>lein deps :verify</code> against a couple of projects
and it reported every dependency as <code>:unsigned</code>. I know that some of those
dependencies are signed and I verified that the <code>.asc</code> files exist on
repo.clojars.org.</li>
<li>It’s hard to find the public keys for the library maintainers. Sometimes they
upload them on the keyservers, sometimes not.</li>
<li>There’s no established way of communicating that which public keys should be
trusted. If there’s a new release and it has been made with a new key, your
best bet is to e-mail the maintainer and ask what is up.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s hard to get any security benefits from the signatures in practice. Thus
it’s okay to set <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/998d373ae06d17234efffde761fae93242c736fa/sample.project.clj#L111"><code>:sign-releases</code></a> to <code>false</code> in your
project.clj even if Leiningen’s manual does not recommend it.</p>
<hr>
<p>In princple, the systematic checking of signatures could provide security
against a dangerous supply-chain attack: weak or leaked passwords for package
manager accounts. For example, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/08/the-year-long-rash-of-supply-chain-attacks-against-open-source-is-getting-worse/">several RubyGems</a> have been attacked
this way. Most likely the signing keys would not be compromised at the same
time.</p>
<p>There are alternative solutions, though, such as disallowing publishing packages
without multi-factor authentication. Using Clojars’s <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/clojure/GmAU4XwnRpw">deploy tokens</a>
helps a bit as well.</p>
<p>Right now we place a lot of trust on Clojars and Maven Central. If either of
them got compromised, we all would be screwed. Package signing could be a part
of a solution to mitigate that risk, but a comprehensive solution would be
something like using <a href="https://theupdateframework.io/">The Update Framework</a>. Go’s <a href="https://blog.golang.org/module-mirror-launch">checksum
database</a> is also worth taking look at.</p>
<p>Finally, if you’re moved to do something about this, please do not build
anything new using PGP. To quote Latacora: <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html">PGP is bad and needs to go
away</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’ve written this post in part to be proven wrong. I’m eagerly waiting for posts
from y’all about how you do, in fact, systematically verify the signatures.</p>

                    <p>As a kid I loved buying books during the yearly book fair in the city where I grew up. I was not a good judge of my aptitude so I mostly ended up buying books that were beyond me. Naturally a lot of them remained piled up in my home gathering dust. They still do. My mother had her own pile of literary collection. Too many books for a small house.</p><p>Once in a while somebody would mention about the unread books. It would be some distant uncle during his yearly visit, or one of my own friends. “How many of them have you read?”</p><p>It was a logical question. It made me wonder if I had been wasting my parents’ money buying all these books and leaving them unread.</p><p>Turns out I wasn’t the only one being asked this question. The late Italian writer <a href="https://amzn.to/3g33Unw">Umberto Eco</a> had a personal collection of thirty thousand books in his private library. Most of the people who visited him reacted with, “What a library you have! How many of these books have you read?” Only a very small minority understood that a library is not meant to show off the number of books one has read. A library is a research tool where read books are far less valuable than unread ones. In other words, the knowledge you have gained is less valuable than what you don’t know.</p><p>Does it mean that we should buy books only not to read them because reading would make them less valuable? Can this idea be used as an excuse to be a collector of books, but not a reader? Not exactly!</p><p>I’ll agree that this isn’t the most obvious and intuitive concept to grasp. On top of that, this can be easily misinterpreted. Yet this is precisely how Nassim Nicholas Taleb starts <a href="https://amzn.to/30PJCrg"><em>The Black Swan</em></a>—by introducing us to the concept of an <em>antilibrary</em>.</p><blockquote><em><em>“A private library is not an ego-boosting appendage but a research tool. Read books are far less valuable than unread ones. The library should contain as much of what you do not know as your financial means, mortgage rates, and the currently tight real-estate market allow you to put there.”</em></em></blockquote><p>— Nassim Nicholas Taleb, <a href="https://amzn.to/30PJCrg"><em>The Black Swan</em></a></p><p>An antilibrary—the unread books in our collection—represents what we don’t know. It’s a reminder of our ignorance. It’s a delineation of the fact that even if we pursue knowledge for the next 100 years, we won’t be able to know everything there is to know. In fact, not even a tiny fraction of it.</p><p>The purpose is not to depress us, but to remind us to be humble about our own knowledge. So that we don’t become so cocksure about everything that it prevents us from learning, from seeing, and from questioning things. Especially our own conjectures.</p><p>When you have just started reading books, you are absolutely sure of your ignorance. Therefore you value the unread books. You have certain notions and assumptions that you want to verify. The problem starts when you’ve read a good deal. You start becoming too sure, too confident, too prudent. As Taleb writes, this is exactly what leads to Black Swan events.</p><blockquote><em><em>It is our knowledge—the things we are sure of—that makes the world go wrong and keeps us from seeing and learning.</em></em></blockquote><p>— Lincoln Steffens (1866 – 1936), Investigative Journalist</p><p>Our knowledge is incomplete, imperfect, and infinitesimal in absolute terms. The antilibrary represents the <em>unknowledge</em>—the things we don’t know. Unknowledge is the only antidote to our overconfidence from knowledge.</p><p>A scholar is someone who knows many things. An <em>antischolar</em> is somebody who is humbly aware that they don’t know everything. They are “someone who focuses on the unread books, and makes an attempt not to treat his knowledge as a treasure, or even a possession, or even a self-esteem enhancement device.” They question things. They are skeptical empiricists who know that what they don’t know is more valuable than what they know.</p><p>A good library is filled with mostly unread books. That’s the point. The unread books are a tool for us to question our knowledge, our assumptions, and our worldview. “You’ll never read all of them,” many people say when they look at my unread collection. With time I’ll go on adding more unread books, and my probability of reading all of them will further decrease. They are right. I won’t be able to read all of them, and that’s exactly how it works.</p><p>I’m aware of the limits of my knowledge. My library of unread books is a constant reminder. My limited knowledge can only take me so far. Like all of us, I know that unknowledge—what I don’t know—affects me far more than my knowledge. As Taleb writes, “Note that the Black Swan comes from our misunderstanding of the likelihood of surprises, those unread books, because we take what we know a little too seriously.”</p>

                    <p>As COVID-19 continues to alter the way we live, there is a scramble to predict what our “new normal” will look like. After the virus fades away or, God help us, becomes a constant in our day-to-day life for years to come, which change brought on by the pandemic will stick? </p><p>There is one consensus prediction that is emerging, especially among knowledge workers and those in tech: The distributed workforce is here to stay.

Remote work, the thinking goes, allows people to live in whatever environment they’d like — depending on their own circumstances.</p><p>These remote technology jobs don’t just go to a version of you living on a cute farm in the Hudson Valley.

So instead of asking a remote worker "what did you do today?" you can now just say, "Show me what you did today." As a manager, you can directly evaluate the work--the thing you're paying this person for--and ignore all the stuff that doesn't actually matter.</p>

Second, Fried is right, you do gain a bit of freedom from your boss (which doubles as a loss of a mentor, but we’ll get to that). You also gain “freedom” from your colleagues and collaborators. Which means you’re effectively on your own. </p><p>This is empowering to some, but the isolation can mean your contributions are easily overlooked or misunderstood. As a result, I’ve noticed a disturbing trend at (especially larger) remote companies: Some managers often have no clue what their direct reports are doing and how they are doing it. </p><p>Performance reviews are difficult enough under normal circumstances. But how do you judge someone when you can only see their output and never their process? Marketers, project managers, product managers, growth marketers, and others spend their days supporting or maintaining existing things. &nbsp;</p><p>This a difficult problem that predates any shift to remote work. But when applied to remote work, a manager loses several of the inputs needed to judge a direct report’s output — including, yes, who is physically (and mentally) present when actual work is being done. But also: Do the other team members appear to enjoy working with this person? And, if they are struggling, is it due to a lack of effort/focus or something outside of their control? </p><p>Employees who “do the right thing” spending extra time and energy supporting their teammates receive absolutely no recognition for doing the little things needed for a smooth-running, collaborative organization. It’s usually a quantifiable fact whether a sales departments reaches their goals. It’s not as clear that the social media manager had a good quarter.</p><p>With the removed context of a real-life office, your team’s output is difficult to individualize for your manager — especially if work is done in private DMs or one-on-one Zoom calls. The manager sees the end product with no visibility as to who did what, who pulled their weight, who made tough choices, and who made things more difficult. This has a nasty side effect of the leader viewing you less as a person who they have to empathize with and understand — and more as a talking head on a Zoom call or Slack who does things for them. </p><p>This will cause your work to “flatten.” Whatever soft skills you bring to the table will be minimized when working remotely. This will lead to companies and processes relying less on things like creativity and collaboration and more on simple inputs and outputs. Which, again, makes your work easier to outsource.</p><p>We bemoan the loss of empathy and context created by solely getting our news and interacting via social media … and we then turn around and set up our working lives in their image.</p><p>This has a pronounced effect in large organizations.</p><h2 id="remote-work-breaks-large-companies">Remote work breaks large companies</h2><p>Remote work supporters often return to the “interruption culture” at an IRL office as an argument for distributed work. First, clearly people that believe remote work creates an interruption-free zone have never used Slack or email. Second, those interruptions often exist for a reason: They often communicate information that ensures everyone is working on the right thing.</p><p>For companies that have strong product/market fit, have reached scale, and have a clear product roadmap, remote works swimmingly. A distraction-free environment means everyone can focus on “what matters” because “what matters” has been clear and consistent. &nbsp;</p><p>But what happens when “what matters” changes? </p><p>Because it will. Eventually, the market shifts. There’s a competitor or a Black Swan-style event in the industry (like, say, a global pandemic). Suddenly the well-oiled machine needs to adapt and change course. For companies larger than 100 people, this is tremendously difficult in an in-person environment. Working remote, it’s damn near impossible. Twice-a-year in-person meetups are not enough to disseminate brand new strategies. </p><p>And I'd bet that as formerly IRL companies go remote, it will have a negative effect on their ability to iterate and adjust to market conditions making them vulnerable for a smaller, co-located upstart.</p><h2 id="remote-work-can-stifle-your-career-growth">Remote work can stifle your career growth</h2><p>Think back to your first job in your current field. I’d bet there is a person or group of people who were tremendously important in shaping your career. They gave you candid advice and were able to passively observe and critique your behavior.</p><p>When you work remotely, mentorship is stifled because there is no learning via osmosis. You can’t model your behavior on your successful teammates because you only see them on Zoom and in Slack. Whatever process they are using to achieve their results is opaque to you. </p><p>Much of the language used around remote work (and remote events) assumes that one is in the mid-to-late stages of their career. When you’re young, you don’t need “focus” or to “get things done.” You need exposure to new ideas and people. You need the serendipitous fortune of sitting in on the right meeting, attending the right happy hour, or earning the respect of the right observer.</p><p>All of the above is more difficult in a remote environment. As a result, we are in danger of having a generation of new knowledge workers who are never properly onboarded and hastily told to work remotely with nothing but an OKR to chase. They have no context for how to do all of the messy office-ready skills like building consensus, having productive disagreements, and advocating for their ideas.</p><p>Additional…</p></div></section></article></div></main></div></div>

    <h3><a id="porism-statement" href="#porism-statement">Poncelet's Porism</a></h3>
    <p>
    Poncelet's Porism is a well-known and much-beloved result in plane
    geometry, discovered by Jean-Victor Poncelet in 1813. Here is the
    statement:
    </p><p>
    <b>Theorem [Poncelet's Porism]</b>
    <i>
      Let $C$, $D$ be non-singular conics in general position in the projective plane,
      and $n \ge 3$ a natural number. If there exists an $n$-sided polygon,
      all of whose vertices lie on $C$ and all of whose edges are tangent to
      $D$, then there exists such a polygon with a vertex at any given point of
      $C$.
    </i>
    </p><p>
    If this is the first you have heard of Poncelet's Porism, pause for
    thought: it is not obvious.
    </p><p>
    Poncelet's Porism has a lot going for it. It turns out to be an
    archetypal result demonstrating the power of "modern" algebraic geometry,
    it admits numerous fruitful generalisations, and it has connections to many
    beautiful subjects including elliptic curves, modular forms, dynamical
    systems, the Painlevé equations, and even instantons.
    But there is another reason for its popularity: it
    asserts the existence of some very appealing pictures and animations.
    </p><h3><a id="interactive-app" href="#interactive-app">Create your own animated gif</a></h3>
    The animated gif at the top of this page was created using the app
    embedded just below. You can use it to make your own animated gif right now.
    <p>
    On the left hand side, the following two conics are plotted:
    $$
        \left(\frac{x}{a}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y}{b}\right)^2 = 1, \qquad x^2 + y^2 = 1,
    $$
    together with the results of Poncelet iteration (the red lines). There are
    controls for adjusting the values of $a$, $b$ and the number of edges,
    as well as other elements whose functions
    are hopefully self-explanatory. We defer an explanation of the curves on the
    right until we discuss
    <a href="#cayley-closure-condition">Cayley's results</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    For anyone interested, the source for the above is available at Microsoft's
    code-hosting hub <a href="https://github.com/ocfnash/poncelet" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p><p>
    Note that an instance of the porism in this real plane has two natural
    topological invariants:
    </p><ol>
      <li>the vertex count, $n$,</li>
      <li>the number of times the polygon winds around the circle, $w$.</li>
    </ol>
    Note that $w &lt; n$ and that $w$, $n$ are coprime because the graph of
    the polygon is connected.
    These numbers will show up in different guises below.

    <h3><a id="gh-porism-proof" href="#gh-porism-proof">Griffiths and Harris proof</a></h3>
    Working over $\mathbb{C}$, let $C$, $D$ be non-singular conics in general
    position in $\mathbb{P}^2$ and define the incidence space:
    $$
      X = \{(p, l) \in C\times D^* ~|~ p \in l\},
    $$
    where $D^*$ is the set of lines tangent to $D$. Because there are
    two tangents to $D$ through a general point of $C$, $X$ carries a natural
    involution that swaps these tangents:
    $
      i_D : X \to X.
    $
    Similarly, because there are two points of $C$ lying on a general tangent
    to $D$, $X$ also carries a natural involution that swaps these points:
    $
      i_C : X \to X.
    $
    Note that $i_C$ has fixed points corresponding to the four points of
    $C^*\cap D^*$, and $i_D$ has fixed
    points corresponding to the four points of $C \cap D$.
    <p>
    Composing, we have an endomorphism:
    $$
      T = i_D \circ i_C : X \to X.
    $$
    Poncelet's Porism is the statement that $T^n$ has a fixed point iff it is
    the identity map.
    </p><p>
    With this setup, we need only chain together the following basic
    facts from general theory:
    </p><ol>
      <li>X is a smooth and has genus one (i.e., topologically a torus).</li>
      <li>After choosing a point to act as identity, every smooth
          curve of genus one becomes an elliptic curve, isomorphic to a quotient
          of $\mathbb{C}$ by a maximal-rank lattice.</li>
      <li>The only involutions admitting a fixed point on an elliptic curve are
          of the form $u \mapsto v - u$ for some point $v$. (Alternatively, note
          that for any $u \in X$, the fibre through $u$ of the natural map $X \to C$ is
          $u + i_D(u)$, and that this must be constant. Similarly for $i_C$.)</li>
    </ol>
    Applying fact 3 to $i_C$ and $i_D$ we learn that $T$ must be a translation
    and thus so also must $T^n$.
    We are now done: the only tanslation with a fixed point
    is the identity map.
    <p>
    Note that if $O\in X$ is the identity, this proof gives us a new
    interpretation of $n$: it is the order of the torsion point $T(O)$. We
    will depend upon this interpretation when discussing
    <a href="#cayley-closure-condition">Cayley's results</a> below.
    </p><p>
    If you didn't know the results 1–3 already, you might not be all
    that happy with this proof. The good news is, we will give another
    more elementary proof, due to Jacobi,
    <a href="#bjs-porism-proof">below</a>. In fact it's really the same proof
    in different language.

    </p><h3><a id="projective-invariance" href="#projective-invariance">Projective invariance</a></h3>
    Jacobi's marvellous proof of Poncelet's Porism is characteristic of its
    time and benefits from judicious choice of coordinates. In preparation, we comment
    on coordinate choices.
    <p>
    Poncelet's Porism concerns only incidence and tangency, and so
    is projectively invariant. Since the group of projective transformations of
    the plane is eight-dimensional, and the space of conics is five-dimensional,
    the space of pairs of conics up to projective equivalence is
    two-dimensional (5 + 5 - 8).
    </p><p>
    There are at least three natural ways to parameterise these two
    dimensions:
    </p><ol type="i">
      <li>A circle and a concentric, axis-aligned ellipse. This yields
          local coordinates such as the semi-minor, semi-major radii of the
          ellipse dividing by the radius of the circle.</li>
      <li>A pair of non-concentric circles. This yields local
          coordinates such as the radii of the two circles divided by the
          distance between their centres.</li>
      <li>The two cross ratios of the four intersection points of the conics:
          one cross ratio on each conic.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    Following Schoenberg, we will present Jacobi's argument in terms
    of the parametrisation (i) even though Jacobi used (ii). Note
    that (i) exists as a consequence of the well-known result
    in linear algebra that for any pair of quadratic
    forms, we may always find a basis in which one is a diagonal matrix of
    $\pm 1$s, and the other is diagonal. We will discuss the case
    over $\mathbb{R}$ with $C$ and $D$ represented by the matrices:
    $$
      \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
        1/a^2 &amp; 0     &amp; 0\\
        0             &amp; 1/b^2   &amp; 0\\
        0             &amp; 0       &amp; -1/r^2
      \end{array}\right]
      \quad\mbox{and}\quad
      \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
        1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
        0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
        0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1
      \end{array}\right]
      \quad\mbox{respectively.}\quad
    $$
    </p><p>
    These matrices are of course only defined up to scale which allows us to
    assume $r=1$. Note that even after this we have still not used all the
    symmetry of projective invariance: we have freedom to permute the elements
    of our basis. Thus the quotient by full projective invariance is naturally
    (an open set of) the weighted projective space
    $\mathbb{P}(1, 2, 3) \simeq \mathbb{P}^2/S_3$
    where the eigenvalues $1/a^2$, $1/b^2$, $-1/r^2$ are homogeneous coordinates
    on the $\mathbb{P}^2$.
    </p><p>
    Note that the same $S_3$ indeterminacy is
    also visible in parameterisation (iii). A cross ratio depends on the ordering
    of the four points; without an ordering we only have an orbit of the
    anharmonic group (abstractly $S_3$) rather that a single value. These
    cross ratios will naturally show up again below when we discuss the
    <a href="#pencil-branching">natural map</a> to the pencil of conics.
    </p><h3><a id="bjs-porism-proof" href="#bjs-porism-proof">Bertrand-Jacobi-Schoenberg proof</a></h3>
    We work over $\mathbb{R}$ and take our conics
    to be an ellipse and concentric circle:
    $$
        \left(\frac{x}{a}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y}{b}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^2, \qquad x^2 + y^2 = 1.
    $$
    and for simplicity assume $0 &lt; r &lt; b \le a$. Following Schoenberg, the following diagram will be useful:
    <img src="http://olivernash.org/2018/07/08/poring-over-poncelet/assets/images/schoenberg-diagram.svg" width="500" height="500">
    We wish to study the map that sends the point $P$ to $Q$. The key is to
    work in terms of the natural angular coordinate of the
    circumcircle of the ellipse. More precisely, we associate points of
    the ellipse with their images under the map $(x, y) \mapsto (x, ay/b)$.
    This maps the points $P$, $Q$ on the ellipse to the $P'$, $Q'$ on the
    circumcircle, and likewise the tangency point $M$ to $M'$. Then define
    the angles:
    $$
      \phi_0 = \angle{AOP'},\quad \phi_1 = \angle AOQ'.
    $$
    We seek to understand $\phi_1$ as a function of $\phi_0$. This turns out to
    be easy. Firstly:
    $$
      \frac{d\phi_1}{d\phi_0} = \frac{M'Q'}{M'P'}.
    $$
    Exercise: prove this! Secondly, trivially:
    $$
      \frac{M'Q'}{M'P'} = \frac{MQ}{MP}
    $$
    (both sides are equal to the corresponding ratios of $x$
    coordinates.) Thirdly, by Pythagoras:
    $$
      \begin{align}
        MP &amp;= \sqrt{a^2/r^2 - 1}\cdot\sqrt{1 - m\sin^2\phi_0},\\
        MQ &amp;= \sqrt{a^2/r^2 - 1}\cdot\sqrt{1 - m\sin^2\phi_1}.\\
      \end{align}
    $$
    where $m \in [0, 1)$ is given by:
    $$
      m = \frac{a^2 - b^2}{a^2 - r^2}.
    $$
    Combining these three facts, we obtain the key identity:
    $$
      \frac{d\phi_1}{d\phi_0} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - m\sin^2\phi_1}{1 - m\sin^2\phi_0}}.
    $$
    Equivalently, the function:
    $$
      \omega(\phi_0) = \int_{\phi_0}^{\phi_1}\limits\frac{d\psi}{\sqrt{1-m\sin^2\psi}}
    $$
    is constant.
    <p>
    Now suppose
    $\phi_0, \phi_1, \ldots, \phi_n$ is a sequence of angles associated with
    the Poncelet construction, and that the $\phi_i$ keep track of how many
    times we have wound round the circle by adding multiples of $2\pi$ if
    necessary. The $\phi_i$ correspond to a Poncelet $n$-gon iff:
    $$
      \phi_n = \phi_0 + 2\pi w,
    $$
    for some natural number $w$. Since the integrand is positive, this is true
    iff
    $$
      \int_{\phi_0}^{\phi_n}\limits\frac{d\psi}{\sqrt{1-m\sin^2\psi}} =
      \int_{\phi_0}^{\phi_0 + 2\pi …</p></div>

</address><p>Many foreigners travel to Switzerland to take their own lives with the assistance of an organisation. In Switzerland, assisted suicide is considered a legitimate way to end your life.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2014, This Jenny, a respected Swiss politician, ended his life with the help of the assisted-suicide organisation Exit. He was terminally ill with stomach cancer. Swiss television accompanied him in his last weeks in an unflinching examination of the subject of assisted suicide. There was no cry of outrage across the country. Instead, there was sympathy and admiration. Assisted suicide is broadly accepted by the Swiss population and the country is one of the most progressive in this matter. &nbsp;</p>
<p>More and more people are considering assisted suicide and becoming members of assisted organisations like Exit.</p><p>“In Switzerland we know that this option is open to us if we need it,” says Samia Hurst-Majno, a professor of ethics at the University of Geneva. “Cases of assisted suicide remain rare, even in Switzerland. But many people are reassured to know that they have this option even if they never use it.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The result of a local vote and surveys show that most Swiss don’t want to ban assisted suicide. Shortly after citizens of Zurich spoke out vehemently against restrictions on assisted suicide, the Swiss government decided against introducing nationwide regulations – even though the European Court of Human Rights has already chided Switzerland for a lack of legal clarity. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Hurst-Majno says one possible reason for this is that Swiss laws on assisted suicide have existed for a long time, and that the population trusts that abuses won’t take place.</p><p>“We are confident that people with mental illnesses will be sent to prevention services, that all other alternatives will be considered, and that assisted suicide is only open to people with a rational desire for suicide as the last resort,” the professor says.&nbsp;</p><p>At the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, Switzerland, like many other countries, decriminalised suicide.</p><p>“If suicide is a crime, then suicide assistance is a crime of complicity,” Hurst-Majno explains. “If it is not a crime, then there is also no complicity.”&nbsp;</p><p>Following a broad public debate in Switzerland, there is consensus that self-interest should be a decisive point:</p><p>“Anyone who assists the suicide of someone who is financially dependent on them, or someone from whom they will inherit, should be penalised,” Hurst-Majno says. “But if there are no self-interested motives, then assistance is not a crime.”&nbsp;</p><p>In most countries, active suicide assistance is banned. Switzerland is one of very few countries where foreigners can opt for it. This has led to a form of “death tourism”. According to Dignitas, a well-known organisation that accepts non-Swiss applications, more than 90% of its members in 2018 were foreigners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Acceptance of assisted suicide does not mean zero opposition. Cases involving applicants who do not suffer from terminal illness but are simply tired of life or have a mental condition sparked controversy even in Switzerland. Some doctors are not willing to issue prescriptions for a lethal drug in such cases.&nbsp;</p><p>Swiss assisted-suicide organisations are campaigning for more leeway. They want easier access to lethal medications for people without terminal illness or for those who are very old or weary of life. Some are even lobbying for the legalisation of assisted suicide in other countries through court cases, consulting, lobbying, advertising and public relations campaigns. &nbsp;</p><p>Their vision: assisted suicide should be legal worldwide so that nobody has to make the journey to Switzerland to die of their own free will.&nbsp;</p>

July 26, 2020 | https://www.dampfkraft.com/romaji-history.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.dampfkraft.com/romaji-history.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently created a tool called <a href="https://github.com/polm/cutlet">cutlet</a> for converting Japanese to romaji.
While working on cutlet I was surprised at the difficulty of finding a good
guide to the difference between romaji systems, particularly their history and
usage, so I wrote this up.</p>
<h2 id="a-romaji-refresher"> A Romaji Refresher</h2>
<p>There are three relatively well-defined romaji systems. For a quick overview of
some of their differences:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Japanese</th>
<th>新橋</th>
<th>お茶漬け</th>
<th>富士山</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Hepburn</td>
<td>Shinbashi (or Shimbashi)</td>
<td>ochazuke</td>
<td>Fujisan</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kunreisiki</td>
<td>Sinbasi</td>
<td>otyazuke</td>
<td>Huzisan</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nipponsiki</td>
<td>Sinbasi</td>
<td>otyaduke</td>
<td>Huzisan</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Hepburn is the most widely used outside Japan, Kunreisiki is officially taught
to children in Japan. Nipponsiki is similar to Kunreisiki but older. Technically
Hepburn uses macrons for long vowels while Kunreisiki and Nipponsiki use
circumflexes, but usage isn't consistent and there's no difference in meaning
between them.</p>
<p>In recent years "wapuro" romaji, based on input when typing Japanese, are also
relatively common, but it's not systematized (except in as far as programs
either take or don't take certain sequences) and isn't used in any kind of
formal writing.</p>
<h2 id="particle-comparison"> Particle Comparison</h2>
<p>As another refresher, here's how non-phonetic particles are represented in the
various systems.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Japanese</th>
<th>は</th>
<th>を</th>
<th>へ</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Hepburn</td>
<td>wa</td>
<td>wo</td>
<td>e</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kunreisiki</td>
<td>wa</td>
<td>o</td>
<td>e</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nipponsiki</td>
<td>ha</td>
<td>wo</td>
<td>he</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Hepburn is phonetic except for <em>wo</em>, Kunreisiki is strictly phonetic, and
Nipponsiki is strictly orthographic.</p>
<h2 id="early-romaji"> Early Romaji</h2>
<p>Japanese was first written in the Latin alphabet in the 1600s, mainly by
Christian missionaries. It was used by the missionaries for recording and
learning the language, and also used in texts they produced to try to spread
Christianity. Since Christianity was later supressed in Japan, these forms of
romaji never had wide adoption, though they influenced later efforts.</p>
<h2 id="the-origins-of-the-hepburn-system"> The Origins of the Hepburn System</h2>
<p>In 1867, missionary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Curtis_Hepburn#Missionary_work_in_Japan">James Curtis Hepburn</a> published a
Japanese-English dictionary in Yokohama. Naturally he needed some way to write
Japanese words for people who couldn't read Japanese, so he devised a system of
representing Japanese that reflected the pronunciation of English consonants.
His system wasn't designed from the ground up, but developed based on his
knowledge of existing systems by other missionaries as well as his own
knowledge of Japanese.</p>
<p>Somewhat later, in 1885, an organization known as the
<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9E%E5%AD%97%E8%AB%96#%E3%83%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9E%E5%AD%97%E4%BC%9A">羅馬字会</a>
(Romajikai) was established. Mainly a society of Japanese academics, it was
interested in promoting the use of romaji as a replacement for kana and kanji.
Some motivations for getting rid of native writing systems included easier
international communication and improved domestic literacy. The principle
founders were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ry%C5%8Dkichi_Yatabe">Ryoukichi Yatabe</a>, a botanist and the first Japanese graduate of Cornell, and <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A4%96%E5%B1%B1%E6%AD%A3%E4%B8%80">Masakazu Toyama</a>, a graduate of Michigan University who
later occupied a high post at what would eventually become Tokyo University.</p>

This edition was reprinted in 1978. via <a href="https://www.wul.waseda.ac.jp/kotenseki/html/he22/he22_07214/index.html">Waseda University</a>
</figcaption></figure>
<p>In 1886 the Romajikai published <a href="https://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/862485">a romaji system</a>. Also in 1886
Hepburn published the third edition of his dictionary, which roughly used the
system.  I've had trouble finding the exact nature of the influence between
Hepburn's system and the Romajikai, but they were on friendly terms and
cooperating. Hepburn's dictionary's third edition took off, the romaji system
mainly came to be called by his name, and it became widely established,
particularly among foreigners dealing with Japan.</p>
<p>If you're interested in learning more about Hepburn's dictionaries, a <a href="http://www.meijigakuin.ac.jp/mgda/waei/">wealth
of information</a> is available via Meiji Gakuin University
Library, including a comparison of romaji in all published versions and
manuscripts.</p>
<h2 id="the-origins-of-the-nipponsiki-system"> The Origins of the Nipponsiki System</h2>
<p>Around the time the Romajikai was established, one of the members, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanakadate_Aikitsu">Aikitu
Tanakadate</a>, developed his
own romaji system, based on some existing informal conventions, that was
specifically designed to mirror the structure of Japanese kana without regard
to foreign pronunciation.</p>
<p>In 1885 Tanakadate proposed this new system to the Romajikai, but they
ultimately rejected his proposal in favor of keeping Hepburn. As a result
Tanakadate left the Romajikai and promoted Nipponsiki on his own. Before
becoming known as "Nipponsiki" this style of Romanization was known as
"Tanakadatesiki".</p>
<p>The disagreement between Tanakadate was only the first in a long series of
arguments between Hepburn and Nipponsiki proponents.</p>
<p>Tanakadate was around 30 when he invented this system, and most of his later
career was in physics. He worked with Lord Kelvin in Scotland and helped bring
about the adoption of the metric system in Japan. He used romaji in personal
writings and promoted it throughout his life. We'll be seeing him again later.</p>
<h2 id="standard-form-and-the-romaji-hirome-kai"> Standard Form and the Romaji Hirome Kai</h2>
<p>In 1905 the ローマ字ひろめ会 (Romaji Hirome Kai, "Society for the Advancement
of Romaji") was established. They published a magazine, called simply "Rômaji",
to create more reading material in romaji and spread its use within Japan.  By
this point Toyama and Yatabe had both passed away, and it's unclear if the
original Romajikai still existed in any capacity. An important early member of
the new society was <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%97%A4%E5%B2%A1%E5%8B%9D%E4%BA%8C">Katsuji Fujioka</a>, who wrote the
<a href="https://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/942994">羅馬字手引</a> (Romaji Tebiki), a kind of romaji dictionary.</p>
<p>Shortly after it was founded the Romaji Hirome Kai proposed a slightly modified
Hepburn and called it 標準式, or "Standard Form". Note that this is "Standard
Form" in general, not "Standard Hepburn", suggesting this was some kind of
official standard romanization system; this may have been a response to
Tanakadatesiki becoming known as "Nipponsiki", which could imply that other
romaji systems were "foreign". As we'll see in a bit, this rhetorical trick
ultimately didn't help official adoption.</p>
<p>I haven't been able to track down the original document with Standard Form, but
the Romaji Tebiki was already using it in 1906.</p>
<p>Standard Form replaced macrons with circumflexes and always romanized ん as
"n", rather than sometimes using "m" depending on the following consonant.</p>
<p>Tanakadate was still around and joined the Romaji Hirome Kai at some point, but
got fed up with their use of Hepburn, left, and founded his own organization in
1914.</p>
<h2 id="the-origins-of-kunreisiki"> The Origins of Kunreisiki</h2>
<p>In 1930 the government formed a committee to evaluate various romaji systems
for official government use. At this point Tanakadate was a member of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Peers_(Japan)">House of Peers</a>, and Romaji Hirome Kai member and Hepburn proponent
Fujioka was not a politician, but had political influence due to his long and
prominent career as a linguist. Both were involved with the government
committee.</p>
<p>While the system used at this point varied considerably by government agency,
Hepburn was more popular, so it seemed slated for official adoption.  However,
in 1935 Fujioka died of illness. In 1937, following a recommendation from the
committee, a slightly modified version of Tanakadate's Nipponsiki, dubbed
Kunreisiki, was established as the official government romaji system.</p>
<p>The main difference between Kunreisiki and Nipponsiki is that kana that are not
pronounced differently in standard modern Japanese are spelled as their more
common counterpart (づ and ず are both <em>zu</em>), though there are other
differences, like how particles are represented, and how ambiguous phonetic
boundaries are written.</p>
<h2 id="the-war"> The War</h2>
<p>Despite the recent official adoption of a government-approved romaji system,
around 1938 a number of more radical romaji proponents were arrested as
potential (or actual) anti-nationalists. One example was Esperantist and
language researcher <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%96%8E%E8%97%A4%E7%A7%80%E4%B8%80">Hidekatsu Saitou</a>, who contracted tuberculosis in
prison and died in 1940.</p>
<p>Following World War 2, the occupying American forces rescinded the law making
Kunreisiki official and ordered the use of Hepburn for public signage and
documents. During the occupation, an American educational commission
<a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pur1.32754081234191&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=28">recommended native Japanese writing be replaced with romaji</a>.
This never happened, though romaji became a standard component of post-war
education.</p>
<p>Post-war the development of romaji became less dramatic, as serious proponents
of replacing Japanese writing systems with romaji mostly disappeared. There
have been a number of laws and rules issued by the government over the years,
as well as a few special systems like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSL_romanization">unique system</a> developed for a
textbook called "Japanese: The Spoken Language", but Hepburn and
Nipponsiki/Kunreisiki remain the major systems.</p>
<p>There is also much to be written about interaction of romaji with computers,
but that's best left for another time.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-revised-hepburn%3F"> What About Revised Hepburn?</h2>
<p>Sometimes you'll see references to "Revised Hepburn", but nobody knows what
this is. It is used to mean, variously:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hepburn's system in his third edition, in contrast to earlier editions</li>
<li>the 1905 version by the ローマ字ひろめ会 (properly 標準式 or "standard form")</li>
<li>a version introduced with Kenkyuusha's "New Japanese-English Dictionary" in 1954, subsequently <a href="https://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/romanization/japanese.pdf">adopted by the American Library of Congress</a></li>
<li>other minor variants proposed at different times</li>
</ul>
<p>While the Library of Congress is surely consistent in their romaji usage, their
choice of a particular 1954 dictionary is a bit odd, and distinguishing it from
the similar 1905 system is a source of confusion. At one point it seemed like
Hepburn might become an ANSI standard, but instead Kunreisiki was adopted, and
that standard (Z39.11-1972) has since been deprecated. This lack of an official
standard contributes to inconsistency in what "Revised Hepburn" means.</p>
<p>In contrast, "traditional Hepburn" is somewhat reliably used to refer to the
system used in Hepburn's third edition as opposed to later forms.</p>
<p>Another common variant, "passport Hepburn" refers to the system previously
mandated for names on Japanese passports, which included some exceptions to
normal Hepburn, but those requirements are <a href="https://www.mofa.go.jp/mofaj/toko/passport/pass_4.html#q17">no longer strictly in force</a>,
and you can use any romanization you want (such as "George" for what would be
"Jouji" in Hepburn) if you have …</p></div></div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594000429895_118575"><div><h2>The mystery of its location</h2><p>It’s often repeated how most of the cameras that landed on the moon stayed on the moon. Astronaut Gene Cernan had been telling the story of how<a href="https://petapixel.com/2012/12/06/the-last-man-to-walk-on-the-moon-left-his-camera-for-a-long-term-gear-test/" target="_blank"> he left his camera</a> on the lunar rover<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/space/9728289/Apollo-17-commander-left-camera-on-moon-40-years-ago.html" target="_blank"> for years</a>, recounting the tale in interviews:</p><blockquote><p>"I left my Hasselblad camera there with the lens pointing up at the zenith, the idea being someday someone would come back and find out how much deterioration solar cosmic radiation had on the glass. So, going up the ladder, I never took a photo of my last footstep. How dumb! Wouldn’t it have been better to take the camera with me, get the shot, take the film pack off and then (for weight restrictions) throw the camera away?"</p></blockquote><p>It’s easy to accept Cernan at his word - he’s an American hero who flew to space three times, twice to the moon - so as far as everyone was concerned, including the press, the camera was right where he said he left it. Plus, a quick scan of the Apollo 17 stowage list reveals no mention of a lunar surface camera splashing down with the command module. So why the mystery? </p><p>Looking closer, there’s a sprinkling of evidence in photos and transcripts that suggest his camera did in fact return to earth, contradicting both the 1972 NASA inventory and the astronaut. No, don’t cue the dramatic music… there’s no mischief or intentional deception here. I believe Gene Cernan did leave a camera on the lunar rover, just not “his.”&nbsp;Memory can be a fickle thing, even for heroes, and that rings especially true in this case&nbsp;when the story involves not one camera, but three.</p><h2>A tale of three cameras</h2><p>When you’re going to the moon, you’re assigned a camera with a 60mm lens that gets strapped to your chest to document samples, experiments, and the lunar terrain. Both astronauts get their own, clearly labeled with a sticker on the side: “CDR” for commander and “LMP” for lunar module pilot, but they weren’t mutually exclusive, often being swapped throughout the mission based on what film they were shooting with. On Apollo 17, Jack Schmitt - LMP and geologist extraordinaire - was set up with the black &amp; white film. When he needed color, he’d grab Cernan’s camera and vice versa. </p><p>A third Hasselblad camera was also to be used on the mission; it was a bit of a beast really, boasting a 500mm telephoto lens meant to capture distant lunar features for, you know… science. Of the two astronauts, Cernan got stuck looking down the barrel of the 500mm the most, so it’s entirely possible that <em>this</em> is the camera he remembers leaving on the rover. In fact, the post-flight analysis of the transcript pretty much confirms it. But what happened with the other two?</p><h2>The stowage list says they stayed </h2><p>A little background. As each Apollo mission launched, NASA prepared a final stowage list that documented all the equipment aboard, detailing what was to be transferred between each spacecraft before and after landing on the moon. This list was then revised in real time as plans changed due to time or weight restrictions. In the latest revision of the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17stowage.pdf" target="_blank">Apollo 17 LM Lunar Launch Stowage List</a>, dated December 12th, 1972, the three cameras that went down in the LM are all marked as “offloaded,” meaning they were left on the surface. The problem is, they launched from the moon on December 13th! So if extra items were brought onboard, it’s not recorded. At least not in what’s available online.</p></div></div><div><div><div data-aspect-ratio="55.70987654320988" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594649779919_85920"><div>

As you read the following excerpt, Cernan and Schmitt are both standing by the final resting place of the lunar rover at the end of their last EVA.</p><blockquote><p>169:29:44<strong>&nbsp;Parker [Mission Control]:</strong> ...and, Jack, <strong>we're making plans here, to change the camera usage at the end of EVA here.</strong> And we're going to let you take Commander's camera out to the ALSEP and take a few photos which people think we need. And Gene's going to take your camera out and document the geophone, when he deploys it. We will not deploy it for the long-term experiment, however. <strong>And we'll bring both (cameras) back, and carry them to the ETB when we get done.</strong></p><p>169:30:17&nbsp;<strong>Cernan:</strong> Okay.</p><p><em>[When he said "document the geophone", Bob may have been referring to documentary photos of the seismic charge Gene will deploy near the VIP site.

Presumably, the intent was to recover the camera at some future date to get information of long-term exposure to the lunar environment.]</em></p><p>[Cernan - "Parker said 'We'll bring them both (that is, both cameras) back,' but I know what I did with that camera. I left it on the Rover pointed straight up. <strong>That's what I planned to do and that's what I did. </strong>I can remember specifically wedging it - I don't remember exactly where - somewhere up between our seats."]</p></blockquote><p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Fast forward to where the astronauts are now back at the LM &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</em></p><blockquote><p>170:39:59&nbsp;<strong>Parker [Mission Control]: </strong>Okay, and we gather an ETB coming up with two cameras in it.</p><p>170:40:04&nbsp;<strong>Schmitt:</strong> ETB's next.

One update for the post-sleep procedure. I understand you brought in the LMP's camera, and we want to be sure you get that into the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-JettBag.html" target="new">jett bag</a>&nbsp;before the final jettison here. And, by the way, you're Stay for that final jettison.</p><p>183:40:39&nbsp;<strong>Schmitt: </strong>Okay, Gordy. It's already in the jett bag, thank you. (Pause)</p><p><em>[</em><strong><em>Cernan </em></strong><em>- "Obviously, I did not leave the LMP's camera on the Rover pointed at the zenith. But I swear I put something there. It's possible it could have been the 500 lens, because we didn't bring it back and I mentioned it was under the seat. I know that I did something with a camera. Now, it could have been a lens. And I stuck it between the seats, sort of wedged it in somewhere, and pointed the lens toward the zenith."]</em></p><p>[<strong>Schmitt </strong>- "Houston wanted us to jettison the camera because they didn't want us to take pictures of Ron Evans' EVA. They had decided it was too cumbersome and too risky. But, we were going to ignore them, and we figured out how we could do it. But we needed a camera. Ron had a camera, but it was not EVA-qualified."]</p><p>[<strong>Cernan</strong> - "We had made up our minds we were going to take pictures of Ron."]</p><p>[<strong>Schmitt </strong>- "And we needed a lunar-surface camera to do it."]</p><p><strong>[Cernan - "Now, we did put the LMP's camera in the jett bag, so we must have had mine."]</strong></p></blockquote><p>*Click*. Finally, we have some clarity. One 500mm camera stays behind, and of the two that go up into the LM, the LMP camera gets jettisoned back to the surface before launch. Cernan’s camera leaves with them as they blasted off live on TV and in color.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594997167739_70248"><div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Before we get into the details of how to train your subconscious mind, let’s understand the importance of positive thinking and how does the subconscious mind work.</p> <p>There was a time in my life when I was trying hard to improve my financial situation. Despite being a qualified IT professional with more than 12 years of work experience, I was unable to find work for myself. So I decided to make it on my own and started freelancing for clients.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-box-3"></span></p><p>But very soon, I found myself failing miserably to generate sustainable income, and as time progressed, I started becoming angry and frustrated. I started criticizing everything and everyone around me, my relationships suffered, and I started losing health.</p><p>Before I even realized I was grossly overweight, I was having lower back pains and bouts of migraine tension headaches (programmers know what I’m talking about).</p><p>Things were going from bad to worse for me. It took me some time to realize that I needed to clear this pool of negative energy, which I had built around me and be more accepting of what life has to offer me.</p><p>Most people tell themselves, “Oh, I’ll be happy once I achieve this or that,” and that’s the root cause of their misery in the first place.</p><p>You can manifest whatever you desire in life, and the universe will assist you, but you have to approach it with positivity. Positive thinking changes our outlook of life and fills us with compassion and love. Once I understood this, things started rolling for me.</p><h2>So what exactly is the subconscious mind?</h2><p>Most people believe that the human mind has dual nature, the conscious or the rational mind, and the subconscious mind. The conscious mind is aware and contains all thoughts, feelings, memories, desires, and is more logical.</p><p>A subconscious mind, on the other hand, is like a reservoir or a vast database that contains all types of thoughts, memories, feelings, and emotions.</p><p>Unlike the conscious mind, the subconscious mind lacks the discriminatory capability of what is good or bad. It believes whatever your conscious mind tells it. And that’s the reason why it is so powerful.</p><p>The only way to program the subconscious mind is through the conscious mind. So if you repeat positive affirmations such as, “I am a happy person, I will succeed in my endeavors, I will achieve financial freedom”, your subconscious mind will start believing it. Even in times of greatest adversities, you will stay strong and focused on your goals.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p><p>On the other hand, if you repeat negative affirmations such as, “I don’t deserve success, I can’t afford that car, I’m bad at managing relationships”, the mind will start believing that and may drive you into depression, anxiety, and fear.</p><p><em>The subconscious mind
can be our best friend or our worst enemy. It can be whatever we want it to be.</em></p><p>The subconscious mind is reactive, and it reacts to the nature of your thoughts. Did you know that the subconscious mind makes up more than 90% of your mind, as opposed to the conscious mind?</p><p>How many times have you tried quitting smoking and failed? How many times did you try losing weight but ended up gaining instead? How many times did you start a project just to leave it midway or when you were just about to finish? Why does this happen to us? This happens because we have not programmed your subconscious mind properly.</p><p>Now that we understand how the subconscious mind works, let’s explore the various ways in which we can harness its power to be more productive and successful in life.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-box-4"></span></p><h2>Mindfulness Meditation</h2><p>Meditation is one of the most powerful tools to train your subconscious mind. In meditation, we go deep inside ourselves and observer our thoughts and emotions. We simply become the witness without judging or being affected by the thoughts we generate.</p><p>If you want to get started with meditation, check out the free <a href="https://mindfulnessquest.com/meditation-guide/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultimate Meditation Guide</a>.</p><p>Meditation helps you to advance spiritually by making you calm inside, and psychologically more stable. By practicing it every day, you slowly learn to confront your fears and negative emotions and are no more affected by them.</p><p>Start by sitting in a comfortable posture. You can be seated on the ground in a cross-legged position, or if that’s uncomfortable, just sit on a chair with your spine erect. One of the simple techniques involves watching the breath as if it moves in and out of your body.</p><p>Start by doing this every day for just 10 minutes and gradually increase the time as you become more proficient in it.</p><h2>Positive Affirmations</h2><p>Earlier, we touched upon this briefly and saw how the conscious mind could be used as a tool to train your subconscious mind. If there were no consciousness or awareness, it would be impossible to train the subconscious mind and avail the infinite potential it offers.</p><p>One way is to use Affirmations. The main process here is to keep repeating a particular behavior over and over again until the message is deeply ingrained in your subconscious mind. For example, if you want to lose weight, keep telling yourself, “I’m not going to stop my workouts until I shed 10 pounds”.</p><p>One thing to note here is that you should not take up a challenge that far exceeds your present capacity. Otherwise, this will not work, and this is the main reason why people fail in their resolutions.</p><p>For example, don’t try to lose 20 pounds in 1 month is you are overweight. Be practical while making your affirmations, and choose a small target initially. Once you achieve your goal, increase the challenge.</p><p>Here is a list of some of the most common affirmations
people use to train their mind:</p><ol><li>I will think positive.</li><li>I will not judge others and be critical of them.</li><li>I will spread love and joy to others because I’m happy inside.</li><li>I am a spiritual being with infinite potential to love.</li><li>Each day I will make an effort to learn something new.</li><li>I will keep a smile on my face throughout the day, even if no one talks to me.</li><li>I will not let negative though pull me down.</li></ol><p>By repeating such affirmations, you tremendously boost your self-esteem, develop empathy towards others, tone down your ego, and increase your confidence.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-large-leaderboard-2"></span></p><p>You must make an effort to believe in your affirmations (with emotions). If you don’t believe what you are saying, your subconscious mind will not get the message. Just like meditation, affirmations also require daily practice.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>There are many other techniques which I will be covering shortly in other articles.</p><p>One of the most important books that helped me to learn about the subconscious mind is “The Power of Subconscious mind”.

July 26, 2020 | https://chrisshort.net/the-aws-bill-heard-around-the-world/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://chrisshort.net/the-aws-bill-heard-around-the-world/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main"><div><div><article role="main"><h2 id="scene">Scene</h2><p>It was a bright, Saturday morning, July 4, 2020. I had just gotten Max all situated with breakfast and cartoons (Mighty Mike, if you’re curious). Julie was sleeping in like she usually does on every day I have off. I’m an early riser and this is a cherished part of our co-parenting. It gives Max and I time to bond (when he’s not stuffing his face and laughing at cartoons). I sat down with my laptop to plow through the week’s personal email.</p><h3 id="the-e-mail">The e-mail</h3><p>“Oh look, the AWS bill, I should have a laugh at that,” I thought to myself. Until recently, it had been pennies a month for some very light SES usage. In February, I moved off Google Cloud back to AWS. The primary motivation was that Google had so intertwined GSuite and GCP IAM that it became overly confusing.</p><p>Along with that migration came the CDN for this web site (cdn.chrisshort.net). I mean <a href="https://chrisshort.net/low-cost-content-delivery-network-cdn/">a Cloudflare fronted S3 bucket that holds assets deemed too big for git</a> when I say CDN. It’s not even <a href="https://chrisshort.net/">chrisshort.net</a> itself, as it is hosted on Netlify’s CDN and every other static site I own or manage. I’ve been a Cloudflare user for a long time. The CDN is less than 300 files and has existed for over five years on various clouds. Moving it back to AWS from GCP bumped the AWS bill to an average of $23/month. Not too bad given the <a href="https://app.usefathom.com/share/suwvjwwc/chrisshort.net">site’s traffic</a>.</p><h3 id="the-shock">The shock</h3><p>Not on this Saturday morning, nope. June 2020’s AWS bill was a heart palpitation causing <strong>$2,657.68</strong> (<a href="https://chrisshort.net/the-aws-bill-heard-around-the-world/invoice498711077_redacted.jpg">JPG</a>). I audibly gasped, “Keep your shit together.” I thought to myself. Max was leaned up against me drinking his milk. I know he could tell something was wrong because he looked at the laptop screen. I only assume when he saw letters and numbers, he thought, “Adult stuff… These cartoons and this Cinnamon Toast Crunch tho.” 2020 being the year that it is and my military history being what it is, I’ve been diagnosed with a panic disorder (on top of the PTSD and physical injuries).</p><h3 id="the-panic">The panic</h3><blockquote data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Good morning, $2700 AWS bill!</p><p>Holy shit...</p></div>— Chris Short (@ChrisShort) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisShort/status/1279406322837082114?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, 2020</a></blockquote><p>I immediately began having a panic attack. As I took the mental steps to mitigate the onset of the panic attack, I started forming a battle plan. Yes, I can switch back to emergency mode, like back in the old days, when something would go bang or boom, and I’d run towards it (it’s not helpful overall, trust me).</p><p>First, Max: Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs? Check.<br>Next, me: As if it was destined, my alert for morning medications went off.</p><p>“Daddy’s gotta grab his meds, bud.” Instinctively, Max leans off me (wow… okay… he’s used to hearing that reminder and statement shortly after that; my brain is now in overdrive). I take everything I need to conquer this while still being able to function cognitively. I refill my coffee and grab a laptop charger.</p><h2 id="incident-response">Incident response</h2><p>Check the source of truth.</p><p>What’s diverged?</p><p>How do we get things back to normal?</p><p>I login to the AWS console, hoping I got some output that was uniquely off this month. Weirder stuff has happened (like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/message/41926/">S3 going down</a>). This bill couldn’t be more out of the norm than ever. This AWS bill is several hundred dollars more than our mortgage! I hit the AWS Billing page and am deeply saddened by what I see:</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/1f2dd17bc5d8e1407c22b84f7f981a7ad9888eba/8e235/the-aws-bill-heard-around-the-world/aws-bill-landing-page.png" alt="AWS Billing landing page showing a $2,657.68 balance"></p><p>There it was. <strong>$2,657.68</strong>, staring at me. “This can’t be legit.” Drilling down even further, it looks like it is indeed legitimate traffic from the cdn.chrisshort.net S3 bucket in us-east-2. In total, <strong>more than 30.6 terabytes of traffic</strong> had moved out of that one S3 bucket. WHEN?!? Did this just happen? Nope.</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3373f05e910b0938aeed4a2975b4b4f48922fdc0/2e223/the-aws-bill-heard-around-the-world/aws-june-2020-data-transfer.png" alt="AWS data transfer billing break down"></p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/46294144a86a5d64df074d306386b3024b7d882a/af2d6/the-aws-bill-heard-around-the-world/june-23-24-2020-s3-breakdown.png" alt="S3 Activity"></p><p><strong>30.6 TB?!?!</strong> how is that even possible???<br>$1,011.59 on 23 June 2020.<br>$1,639.07 on 24 June 2020.</p><p>I immediately open a ticket with AWS Support frantically wondering what broke? How is this even possible? Did someone bypass Cloudflare? What the hell is Cloudflare saying?</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6cd3322753f262dc51bbca44a07fef6b19b381e9/52aec/the-aws-bill-heard-around-the-world/cloudflare_june_22_2020.png" alt="Cloudflare 22 June 2020"><br>Oh cool, Cloudflare let those 2,700 requests passthrough completely uncached? How is that not anomaly detected as a DDoS??? How is it that barely a fraction of the traffic is cached (more on that later)?</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/a0f7d1526c44cb74baba13f749f3d5a886bbdadb/6d2b1/the-aws-bill-heard-around-the-world/cloudflare_june_23_2020.png" alt="Cloudflare 23 June 2020"><br>Oh, another 4,400 requests the next day… Sweet, baby Jesus. Oh, but you served 9 GB from cache. Thanks, Cloudflare.</p><h2 id="help-arrives">Help Arrives</h2><p>Apparently, when you tweet something crazy af, like a $2700 AWS bill, it gets a lot of attention on a quiet holiday morning. A quarter-million people saw the tweet and a third of them interacted with it. It was enough attention that the AWS Support Twitter account was on it before, <a href="https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1186319925901586432">my friend</a> and <a href="https://www.duckbillgroup.com/">cloud economist</a>, Corey Quinn.</p><blockquote data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh no! 😰 Sorry to hear about this unpleasant Saturday morning surprise, Chris.

I am not sure this would’ve ended up as well as it did without it.<blockquote data-dnt="true"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/tUrNnXqWMY">pic.twitter.com/tUrNnXqWMY</a></p>— HydroxyCoreyQuinn (@QuinnyPig) <a href="https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1279446759664611329?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, 2020</a></blockquote><br>I forwarded the bill to Corey almost immediately after seeing it at pre-dawn west coast time. I am forever thankful to Corey for his analysis. When he was ready, Corey sent me a list of things he needed to do an analysis (instead, I created him a regular IAM account with the proper perms 😉 and yes I cleaned up after).<p>Corey encouraged me to apply a bucket policy that would only allow Cloudflare IP addresses to access anything from the bucket. The theory here is that someone could have been bypassing Cloudflare somehow. But, thankfully, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/">Cloudflare publishes their IP blocks</a> and they don’t change all that often. The Cloudflare support article, <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037983412-Configuring-an-Amazon-Web-Services-static-site-to-use-Cloudflare#77nNxWyQf69T1a78gPlCi9">Configuring an Amazon Web Services static site to use Cloudflare</a> gives you an example bucket policy to do exactly that. This should become a standard practice for folks. However, it wouldn’t have mattered in this case; more on that later.</p><p>Corey Quinn’s thread on the topic covers what happened on the AWS side pretty well:</p><blockquote data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">That's right--it's threading time!<a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisShort?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@chrisshort</a>'s surprise <a href="https://twitter.com/awscloud?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@awscloud</a> bill of $2700 looks S3 driven... <a href="https://t.co/VnXufn24iA">https://t.co/VnXufn24iA</a> <a href="https://t.co/tKLWv5rHtW">pic.twitter.com/tKLWv5rHtW</a></p>— HydroxyCoreyQuinn (@QuinnyPig) <a href="https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1280280727133642753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 6, 2020</a></blockquote><ul><li>”…it’s almost entirely due to us-east-2 data transfer out…”</li><li>“Now, what caused this? Nobody knows!”</li><li>“Chris Short isn’t some random fool…” (Might be the nicest thing Corey’s every said about anyone he’s not related to)</li><li>”‘Surprise jackhole, your mortgage isn’t your most expensive bill this month, guess you shoulda enabled billing alarms!’ is crappy, broken, and WOULD NOT HAVE SOLVED THE PROBLEM!”</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1280289410844471296?s=20">“I want to be explicitly clear here: Chris Short didn’t do anything wrong!”</a></li></ul><h2 id="but-wait-there-s-more">But wait! There’s more!</h2><p>I had tickets in with Cloudflare (1918916) and AWS (7153956931). Cloudflare was the least helpful service I could have imagined given the circumstances. A long term user and on and off customer thinks they were attacked for two days and you don’t lift a finger? If I didn’t have reason enough to move off of Cloudflare, I do now. That’ll be an update for a later blog post. But, if you work for a CDN company and you’re relatively painless to get up and running, I’m interested in hearing from you.</p><p>After a very chaotic morning, I take Corey’s advice, disconnect, and enjoy the holiday weekend.</p><h2 id="more-help-arrives">More Help Arrives</h2><p>On July 8th, an astute AWS employee starts doing some digging around and reaches out to me. Because they see this as bafflingly as Corey and I do. How did so few requests generate so much traffic so quickly and then as soon as it appears, it’s gone again? It doesn’t seem like something intentionally malicious either because Cloudflare and AWS let it right on through.</p><h3 id="here-s-the-theory">Here’s the theory</h3><p>In hindsight, I made a poor decision to distribute a trial Windows 2019 SQL Server virtual machine images (fully patched with all necessary drivers and VM extensions) in the form of a qcow2 file. Someone became aware of the existence of this VM image. They then stood up hundreds, potentially thousands, of copies this VM using the internet accessible URL. This is, in theory, possible, with something like <a href="https://chrisshort.net/tags/kubernetes/">Kubernetes</a> and <a href="https://kubevirt.io/">Kubevirt</a>. Given that the disk image becomes a volume mount in the corresponding VMs pod. Spin up enough copies of the VM, a single YAML file can create infinite copies of a VM. If the YAML definition directly referenced the Cloudflare or S3 URL and not a locally cached copy, you can rack up the number of times you pull down an image real quick. The qcow2 image, in this case, was 13.7 GB. But it’s trickier than that.</p><h3 id="the-sharp-edge-of-the-cloud">The sharp edge of the cloud</h3><p>File this under, “Things I should’ve known but didn’t.” Did you know that “The maximum file size Cloudflare’s CDN caches <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200172516-Understanding-Cloudflare-s-CDN#:~:text=The%20maximum%20file%20size%20Cloudflare's,request%20caching%20of%20larger%20files."><strong>is 512MB</strong></a> for Free, Pro, and Business customers and 5GB for Enterprise customers.” That’s right, Cloudflare saw requests for a 13.7 GB file and sent them straight to origin every time <em>BY DESIGN</em>. <strong>Ouch!</strong></p><p>I suspected these files immediately on July 4 and moved them to an internal work GDrive for the time being. If you need the images, let me know, you’re also a suspect if you ask for them, be warned.</p><p>If you’re sitting at home doing the math, something might not be adding up. The bandwidth cost is off, there was indeed some legitimate traffic to the bucket in June, of course, But, as it turns out the intrepid AWS employee discovered that 3655 partial GETs to the object might have actually been delivered as full file requests and Cloudflare might have ever done anything with them. Yes, this is a bug somewhere and folks are looking into it. I also suggested that object size limits be a tunable S3 bucket policy.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Slowsort is a sorting algorithm that is designed to be deterministically sub-optimal. The algorithm was published in 1986 by Andrei Broder and Jorge Stolfi in their paper <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2805500_Pessimal_Algorithms_and_Simplexity_Analysis">Pessimal Algorithms and Simplexity Analysis</a> where they expressed a bunch of very in-efficient algorithms. These techniques and algorithms are special because they never make a wrong move while solving a problem, instead, they find ways to delay the success. In this essay, we put our focus on the Slowsort algorithm based on the <em>Multiply and Surrender</em> paradigm.</p>

<p>The <em>Multiply and Surrender (MnS)</em> paradigm, is a humorous take on the popular <em>Divide and Conquer (DnC)</em> technique. MnS splits the problem into subproblems, slightly simpler than the original, and continues doing so recursively for as long as possible. The subproblems are multiplied and the evaluation is delayed till the state that the solving could not be further postponed and then it surrenders.</p>
<p>MnS paradigm is very similar to DnC; but where the DnC actually splits the problems into subproblems to reach the solution quicker, MnS does it to procrastinate, making the entire process very inefficient but yet convergent.</p>
<p>Although Slowsort is a classic example, recursive Fibonacci with no memoization also fares under the MnS paradigm. The recursive code to find <code>n</code>th Fibonacci number is as illustrated below</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>fib</span><span>(n)</span>:</span>
    <span>"""the function returns the `n`th fibonacci number
    """</span>

    
    
    <span>if</span> n &lt; <span>2</span>:
        <span>return</span> <span>1</span>

    
    
    <span>return</span> fib(n - <span>1</span>) + fib(n - <span>2</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>While computing the Fibonacci numbers, we split the problem into subproblems and do this recursively till we are left with elemental states i.e. <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> and which is when we return the initial values which are <code>1</code> and <code>1</code>. This approach is not DnC because we are not splitting the problem into subproblems to achieve optimality, instead are doing a lot of repetitive work and taking a non-polynomial time to generate the Fibonacci numbers.</p>

<p>Slowsort algorithm draws a lot of similarities to the very popular Mergesort, but while Mergesort operates in <code>O(n . log(n))</code> the complexity of Slowsort is non-polynomial <code>O(n ^ log(n))</code> and its best case performs worse than the worst case of bubble sort.</p>
<p>Slowsort algorithm recursively breaks the array sorting problem into two subarray sorting problems and a few extra processing steps. Once the two subarrays are sorted, the algorithm swaps the rightmost elements such that the greatest among the two becomes the rightmost element of the array i.e. the greatest among the two is placed at the correct position relative to each other, and then it invokes the sorting for all elements except this fixed maximum.</p>
<p>The algorithm could this be expressed as following broad steps</p>
<ul>
<li>sort the first half recursively</li>
<li>sort the second half recursively</li>
<li>find the maximum of the whole array by comparing the last elements of both the sorted halves and place it at the end of the array</li>
<li>recursively sort the entire array except for the maximum one</li>
</ul>
<p>The in-place implementation of the Slowsort algorithm is as illustrated below</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>_slowsort</span><span>(a, i, j)</span>:</span>
    <span>"""in-place sorts the integers in the array
    spanning indexes [i, j].
    """</span>
    
    
    
    <span>if</span> i &gt;= j:
        <span>return</span>

    
    
    
    m = (i + j) // <span>2</span>

    
    _slowsort(a, i, m)
    _slowsort(a, m + <span>1</span>, j)
  
    
    
    
    
    
    <span>if</span> a[m] &gt; a[j]:
        a[m], a[j] = a[j], a[m]
  
    
    
    
    _slowsort(a, i, j - <span>1</span>)


<span><span>def</span> <span>slowsort</span><span>(a)</span>:</span>
    <span>"""in-place sorts the array `a` using Slowsort.
    """</span>
    _slowsort(a, <span>0</span>, len(a) - <span>1</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>The Slowsort algorithm typically replaces the <code>merge</code> function of the Mergesort with a simple swap that correctly places the largest element (local maxima) and then invokes the sort function on all but this element. So on every invocation, we keep correctly placing the largest element but in a recursive manner.</p>
<p><em>A visualization of this algorithm could be found in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRoyhGdjnA">youtube video</a>.</em></p>

<p>The runtime of Slowsort could be computed by the following recurrence relation</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/88473102-cb594e80-cf37-11ea-9015-217c3eda50d6.png" alt="slowsort recurrence relation"></p>
<p>When the above recurrence relation is solved and we find that the asymptotic lower bound for <code>T(n)</code> is given by</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/88473128-14a99e00-cf38-11ea-905b-f3f473a0d74c.png" alt="lower bound of slowsort"></p>
<p>The above expression suggests that lower bound of Slowsort is non-polynomial in nature and for a sufficiently large <code>n</code> this would be more than <code>n ^ 2</code> implying that even the best case of Slowsort is worse than the worst case of Bubble sort. The illustration below compares the time taken by Slowsort and the recursive implementation of Bubblesort.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/88475549-8e4c8680-cf4e-11ea-8ee4-9f7ed345ff5d.png" alt="slowsort vs recursive bubblesort"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The iterative implementation of Bubblesort stood no chance in terms of time taken for smaller sets of integers, hence the chart was plotted against the recursive implementation of it. The iterative bubble sort for smaller arrays is nearly flat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort">Bogosort</a> is a sorting algorithm that has an average case time complexity of <code>O(n!)</code> and an unbounded time in the worst case. The algorithm keeps on permuting (shuffling) the array till it is sorted which introduces an unboundedness in its implementation and hence the algorithm is considered to be the worst sorting algorithm ever.</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> random

<span><span>def</span> <span>is_sorted</span><span>(a)</span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> all(a[i] &lt;= a[i + <span>1</span>] <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> range(len(a) - <span>1</span>))

<span><span>def</span> <span>bogosort</span><span>(a)</span>:</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>not</span> is_sorted(a):
        random.shuffle(a)
</code></pre>
<p>The reason that we should rate Slowsort highly is the fact the Bogosort could sort the list in its first shuffle while Slowsort is deterministic and will take <code>O(n ^ log(n))</code> time in best case scenario.</p>
<p>A rule that every algorithm follows is that every step that it takes actually makes some progress towards the final goal. Bogosort does not guarantee progress, and since it randomly shuffles the array, at one iteration we could end up at a nearly sorted array while the next shuffle takes us afar.</p>
<p>Slowsort is deterministic and convergent. The number of swaps made (inversions) during the execution is non-increasing which means once two items are swapped they are in the correct order relative to each other. In other words, we say that Slowsort never makes a wrong move.</p>

      <p>
        <span>Emergency Remote is a book of opportunity. It lights the way to turn a forced
          remote work situation into a great management success. It contains simple steps
          that will help you not only keep operating, but blow away the competition.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Some believe they can work from home as if they are in the office. "Just add
          some tools for video calls and everything will work just fine", they say.
          This cannot be further from the truth. Setting up video is to successful remote
          work as setting up tables is to successful onsite work. You'll probably use
          it, but it's not nearly enough.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Emergency Remote is divided into three succinct sections. The first discusses the
          underlying values required for remote work to function, the second ensures the
          right tools are set up, and the third describes the five immediate actions to
          perform for better remote work.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>It is an easy, quick read. In fact, the average reader will finish the book in
          less than 15 minutes. After following it you'll have enough space to learn
          from the vast resources on remote work </span><span>available </span><span>online and adjust them to fit your company.</span>
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
        <span>Remote work is composed of three pillars that are crucial to the success of the
          method. They are important to understand before going forward with
          implementation.</span>
      </p>
      
      <h2 id="h.rrpubh4i8p5v"><span></span></h2>
      
      <h2 id="h.1fqjja11bgze"><span>Trust</span></h2>
      
      <p>
        <span>Trust is your belief in a colleague's ability to deliver work in the best
          possible way. Note, this does not mean a guaranteed delivery every time, but the
          ability to deliver. It includes asking for help if needed, recovering from
          mistakes and improving for next time.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Trust is essential because trusting others allows you to focus on your actual
          work, knowing they'll deliver. When others trust you, you get that unique
          peace of mind, the freedom to do your work.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Without trust, employees will be agitated. Worried that their own work will be
          wronged by employees they rely on, either directly or indirectly. That is an
          impossible way to work, especially remotely.</span>
      </p>
      <h2 id="h.1cdix8fys4aq"><span> </span></h2>
      <h2 id="h.vvx9who9kf19"><span>Evergreen Communication</span></h2>
      
      <p>
        <span>Evergreen </span><span>C</span><span>ommunication achieves productive work and </span><span>always-available </span><span>conversations. Both are "evergreen"</span><span>,</span><span> meaning preserved. To accomplish </span><span>that</span><span>, </span><span>two things are needed.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>First</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>asynchronous (async) communication</span><span> —</span><span> communicati</span><span>on</span><span> without the expectation of immediate response.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Second</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>history preservation</span><span>. </span><span>C</span><span>onversation</span><span>s</span><span> should be kept whole and in orde</span><span>r</span><span>, forever.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Evergreen </span><span>C</span><span>ommunication is essential because it allows employees to always work on
          what's most important, always be up to date, and have the reasoning behind
          every decision at their fingertips. They can jump into any conversation that needs
          them, and answer without sacrificing productive work. New employees could even
          onboard themselves.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Without </span><span>Evergreen</span><span> </span><span>Communication</span><span>, we're back to square one. Having everyone present, either in a chat, call
          or physical room forces participants to stop ongoing productive flow. Incomplete
          summaries, as they always are, </span><span>c</span><span>ause information loss and make the reasoning behind decisions </span><span>v</span><span>ague at best.</span>
      </p>
      <h2 id="h.i59vuej2ah6f"><span></span></h2>
      <h2 id="h.30fd3thx8ylx"><span>Independence</span></h2>
      
      <p>
        <span>Independence is the state where the employee(s) working on a task needs little to
          no outside involvement. This does not mean that employees will work in silos. Some
          tasks require more than one person to perform. If most tasks require one person,
          it means they are small (as they should) and that team cooperation will take place
          when joining the individual tasks to form a whole.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>It is essential because it makes sure each and every task is self-contained. That
          is, the employees responsible for it have all they need in order to deliver, and
          the risk of them being blocked is reduced. Further, increasing employees'
          resources in this way increases innovation, which again contributes to
          production.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Without independence, productive work is undermined. The business will be tangled
          with permissions requests, employees will be blocked by their privileged
          counterparts, and innovation will halt at the face of bureaucracy. All of these
          are detrimental, more so in a remote environment, where bureaucracy is harder to
          deal with, and therefore should be prevented.</span>
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
        <span>You will only need four tools to be productive remotely. A tool used as a single
          source of truth and three tools used for the three forms of communication: async,
          hybrid and sync. That's it.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>All employees should have access to as much material as your company's level
          of transparency allows, without complex permissions or process.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Each tool will have an example using a specific brand. While many brands supply
          these tools, make sure to only use one for each categor</span><span>y</span><span>. Different teams prefer different tools, but they cause duplication and
          fragmentation, which harms productivity.</span>
      </p>
      
      
      <h2 id="h.ga1500ptl4sj"><span></span></h2>
      <h2 id="h.vkvqh8m4qqe0">
        <span>Single Source of Truth</span>
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        <span>The Single Source of Truth is a website or collection of files that always
          represent the up-to-date and true state of work. It must adhere to Evergreen
          Communication and track changes and their reasoning, allow rollbacks to previous
          versions and keep communications async.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Once this is set up, everyone should always update the work and communicate in
          regards to the single source of truth. Gone are the days of files scattered across
          various emails.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Example:</span><span>
          Google Docs for a law company will hold all strategies, contracts, company
          policies, and so on. Every change done for the client or </span><span>to</span><span>
          company policy will be reflected immediately to all involved. Changes are always
          tracked, previous versions preserved, and </span><span>d</span><span>iscuss</span><span>ions are evergreen</span><span>.</span>
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <h2 id="h.tqqlh9vccq1a">
        <span>Async Communication: Task Manager</span>
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        <span>Tasks should be managed using a task manager, a type of software. </span><span>They</span><span>
          should be discussed and when done, changes should be made to the source of truth.
          Task managers are completely async, have reproducible history to understand </span><span>past</span><span>
          decisions, and always show the state of work, making status meetings
          redundant.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>This is the hardest tool to choose, as it is company specific. Take </span><span>time</span><span>
          to test different options. If the one you have doesn't work for you, change
          it. Communicate this to your employees</span><span>. P</span><span>revent disruption </span><span>with gradual adoption</span><span>. </span><span>You will find one that works.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Example #1:</span><span> Trello or Asana for a law firm. </span><span>E</span><span>mployees could open tasks, involve others and</span><span> jump i</span><span>n to help. A paralegal may open a task "Fix typo in website", the IT
          person may reply "Currently overwhelmed", then a secretary may jump in
          "I've built website</span><span>s </span><span>before, can I help?". This kind of </span><span>exchange is impossible</span><span> to achieve without the three pillars</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>It</span><span>
          happens in remote companies every day, boosting the heart of the</span><span>ir</span><span> production.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Example #2:</span><span> GitLab for software companies. </span><span>These apps</span><span> often double as a source of truth </span><span>with</span><span> their code hosting function and as task managers </span><span>with</span><span> their ticketing (issues, pull requests) system.</span>
      </p>
      <h2 id="h.ga1500ptl4sj"><span></span></h2>

      <h2 id="h.siasagdslt5x">
        <span>Hybrid Communication: Chat App</span>
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        <span>While the bulk of communication should be done using the task manager, sometimes
          we need to quickly hash things out. This is where chat apps come into play. They
          are hybrid, neither async n</span><span>or</span><span>
          sync. While it's possible to reply later, it's not easy. </span><span>M</span><span>essages come and go</span><span>,</span><span> pushing people to </span><span>respond immediately</span><span>.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Therefore, for work talk, use these only for quick, ephemeral conversations. Any
          long lasting or high impact communications should use the task manager. Outside of
          work talk, chat plays a big role in socializing and enjoying each other's
          company, an important aspect to preserve when working </span><span>remotely</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>Avoid email or WhatsApp as much as you can. They are private by nature and make
          it harder for people to jump in if needed.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Example:</span><span> Slack</span><span> or any </span><span>app </span><span>with</span><span> private messages</span><span> and </span><span>public channels will do. Employees could publicly commend a team member for good
          work in the general channel, or offer feedback privately. They could hop into the
          memes and music channels for fun, ask in the IT channel if anyone noticed a system
          slowdown, or share research about </span><span>new</span><span> strategies in the marketing channel.</span>
      </p>
      
      <h2 id="h.50r9p5st2zyu"><span></span></h2>
      <h2 id="h.9yjvjddetok5">
        <span>Sync Communication: Video/Voice Calls</span>
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        <span>Sync communication makes sense in a few cases. Usually for brainstorms and when
          the team still isn't well acclimated to proper remote work. Keep it available,
          but try to avoid it as much as possible. Calls are fine …</span></p></div></div>

Haskell provides lightweight user space threads that get scheduled by the Run Time System (RTS) onto a limited number of operating threads in a so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)#M:N_(hybrid_threading)">M:N threading model</a>. To handle blocking there are a few options, <a href="http://www.wjwh.eu/posts/2020-07-10-haskell-thread-blocked.html">about which I have written before</a>. For system calls on file descriptors that can return <code>EAGAIN</code> or <code>EWOULDBLOCK</code>, the RTS provides an I/O (not to be confused with <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Introduction_to_IO"><code>IO</code></a>) event manager where threads can register interest in a file descriptor before putting themselves into a sleeping state. If and when the file descriptor becomes available for reading or writing, the event manager will <a href="http://www.wjwh.eu/posts/2020-07-10-haskell-thread-blocked.html">wake up</a> any threads that have registered interest in it. The event manager system contains a <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/blob/master/libraries/base/GHC/Event/Manager.hs">manager module</a>, which provides the interface for the rest of the Haskell code. This module will choose the most performant option from <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/blob/master/libraries/base/GHC/Event/Manager.hs#L169-178">a number of backends</a> available on the current system. So, it will choose the <code>epoll</code> backend on most Linux systems, the <code>kqueue</code> backend on BSD systems, etc. This article is about the design and first results of a new event manager backend based on the <code>io_uring</code> interface.</p>
<p><em>Side note: quite recently a native I/O manager for Windows systems was merged into GHC. Sadly, I don’t know enough about it yet to meaningfully include it into this article. As such, the information provided is only valid for POSIX-like systems.</em></p>
<p>The <code>io_uring</code> interface was added in the <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Linux-5.6-IO-uring-Tests">Linux kernel version 5.1</a> as an improvement to the earlier <code>aio</code> interface for asynchronous system calls. It operates by allocating two ring buffers that are shared between the kernel and the userspace program, known as the Submission Queue (SQ) and the Completion Queue (CQ). The program puts any number of system call requests (known as Submission Queue Entries (SQEs)) into the SQ and can submit any number of them to the kernel with a single system call. The kernel then goes off to do the things requested and when (or if) the request is complete the result will be put into the CQ as a Completion Queue Entry (CQE). This means that the userspace program can check if any CQEs are available merely by checking the CQ, without having to do any system calls. This potentially saves a lot of work on context switches between the kernel and userspace for I/O heavy programs like web servers. As of the time of writing, there are SQEs available for file reading/writing, accepting network connections, polling file descriptors and several more. The author of the <code>io_uring</code> interface has stated that he intends to eventually provide asynchronous versions of all system calls where it makes sense. To implement an I/O event manager backend with <code>io_uring</code>, we only need the SQEs for polling and cancelling previous poll requests, but it would be interesting to see how much of <code>io_uring</code> could be leveraged to provide “true” asynchronous system calls in the future.</p>
<h2 id="iouring-backend-design">IoUring backend design</h2>
<p>Any I/O event manager backend must conform to <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/blob/master/libraries/base/GHC/Event/Internal.hs#L25-51">the interface defined for it</a>, which looks like this:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a><span>data</span> <span>Backend</span> <span>=</span> <span>forall</span> a<span>.</span> <span>Backend</span> {</span>

<span id="cb1-19"><a href="#cb1-19"></a>    <span>-- | Register interest in new events on a given file descriptor, set</span></span>

<span id="cb1-22"><a href="#cb1-22"></a>                         <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Fd</span>    <span>-- file descriptor</span></span>

<span id="cb1-24"><a href="#cb1-24"></a>                         <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb1-25"><a href="#cb1-25"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-26"><a href="#cb1-26"></a>    ,<span> _beDelete ::</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> ()</span>
<span id="cb1-27"><a href="#cb1-27"></a>    }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>That seems pretty reasonable, only four functions! Actually, there is also a <code>new</code> function to set up the backend so it’s more like five functions. ACTUALLY actually, the <code>_beModifyFd</code> function has three different modes of operation depending on which of its arguments are <code>mempty</code>. It can be either “add a polling request”, “modify a polling request” or “delete a polling request” so it is more like seven functions. Still, that is quite manageable. The interface description even describes what each function should do and which arguments it takes, which is more than I usually got in my previous day job.</p>
<p>Luckily, <a href="https://github.com/bgamari">Ben Gamari</a> had already written Haskell <a href="https://github.com/bgamari/io-uring">bindings</a> for using <code>io_uring</code> that could be adapted for an I/O manager backend. He was also a huge help in finding a segfault-causing bug that I would never have caught myself. Many thanks!</p>
<p>An interesting implementation detail of <code>io_uring</code> is that every SQE has a <code>userdata</code> field that gets copied over verbatim into the CQE for its completion. As we can see in the type signature for <code>_bePoll</code> we need both the original file descriptor and the events to issue the callback. In the earliest version, the new backend generated a unique <code>Int</code> for each request and stored this information (along with a Bool indicating whether the poll request was a “multishot” or not) in a hashtable. This worked, but testing showed that throughput was only about half of what the <code>epoll</code> backend could provide. After some discussion on the <code>#ghc</code> IRC channel, we realized that it was possible to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_field">bitpack</a> all the required data into the 64-bit <code>userdata</code> field. This cleared up the code significantly and provided a nice speed boost as well.</p>
<p>The code of the new backend can be found <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/WJWH/ghc/-/tree/io_uring_manager">over here</a>. At its heart, it is a <code>popAndCallbackAllCQEs</code> function. It is implemented as follows:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>-- The workhorse of this backend. Pops CQEs off the ringbuffer</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a><span>-- and issues callbacks to waiting threads</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3"></a><span>popAndCallbackAllCQEs ::</span> <span>UringState</span> <span>-&gt;</span> (<span>Fd</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>EI.Event</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> ()) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4"></a>popAndCallbackAllCQEs state callback <span>!</span>poppedSoFar <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5"></a>  maybeCQE <span>&lt;-</span> withMVar (ringLock state) <span>$</span> \ring <span>-&gt;</span> popCq ring</span>
<span id="cb2-6"><a href="#cb2-6"></a>  <span>case</span> maybeCQE <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb2-7"><a href="#cb2-7"></a>    <span>Nothing</span>  <span>-&gt;</span> <span>return</span> poppedSoFar</span>
<span id="cb2-8"><a href="#cb2-8"></a>    <span>Just</span> cqe <span>-&gt;</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb2-9"><a href="#cb2-9"></a>      <span>let</span> (fd,originalEvents,isMultishot,hasCallback) </span>
<span id="cb2-10"><a href="#cb2-10"></a>                              <span>=</span> (deconstructUserdata <span>$</span> cqeUserData cqe)</span>
<span id="cb2-11"><a href="#cb2-11"></a>      when (hasCallback) <span>$</span> callback fd (convertEventBack <span>$</span> cqeRes cqe)</span>
<span id="cb2-12"><a href="#cb2-12"></a>      <span>-- if it was a multishot poll, resubmit. If it was an error,</span></span>
<span id="cb2-13"><a href="#cb2-13"></a>      <span>-- don't resubmit to prevent getting into an infinite loop of errors</span></span>
<span id="cb2-14"><a href="#cb2-14"></a>      when (isMultishot <span>&amp;&amp;</span> cqeRes cqe <span>&gt;=</span> <span>0</span>) <span>$</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb2-15"><a href="#cb2-15"></a>                void <span>$</span> registerAndPostPollRequest state fd originalEvents <span>True</span></span>
<span id="cb2-16"><a href="#cb2-16"></a>      popAndCallbackAllCQEs state callback <span>$</span> </span>
<span id="cb2-17"><a href="#cb2-17"></a>                <span>if</span> hasCallback <span>then</span> (poppedSoFar <span>+</span> <span>1</span>) <span>else</span> poppedSoFar</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This function pops CQEs off the CQ and after un-bitpacking the <code>userdata</code> field of the CQE, performs the callback. It then recurses until <code>popCq</code> returns <code>Nothing</code>, indicating that there are no more unread CQEs to be consumed. Even in this small bit of code it’s already clear how many edge cases can occur. Some backend-internal CQEs don’t have an associated callback, so for this case we should skip that. If a multishot poll request fails, blindly resubmitting might result in an infinite loop of erroring poll requests.</p>
<h2 id="test-results">Test results</h2>
<p>To test the relative performance of the <code>io_uring</code> backend compared to the <code>epoll</code> backend, I needed an application that spends as much of its time as possible on pollable I/O. The <code>network</code> package provides sample code for a simple echo server which I adapted into <a href="https://gist.github.com/WJWH/97a102791e6ee08d98cc20145d9ba29a">an extremely basic HTTP server</a>. This program was compiled twice: once with the <code>epoll</code> backend and once with the <code>io_uring</code> backend. Then two <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/"><code>t3.xlarge</code></a> VMs with 4 CPU cores and 16 GB of RAM were acquired from AWS, one to host the test programs and one from which to run the <a href="https://www.petefreitag.com/item/689.cfm"><code>ab</code></a> HTTP load generator. I ran <code>ab</code> against each program in batches of 10.000 requests at concurrency levels of 5, 50 and 500 concurrent requests. To average out any jitter, each test run was performed three times and the results averaged.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.wjwh.eu/images/uring_graph_white.png" title="Haskell logo"><br>
</p>
<p>As you can see, the <code>io_uring</code> backend provides about 7% more requests per second (in this toy benchmark) at 5 concurrent requests, about 9% more requests per second at 50 concurrent requests and about 1.8% more at 500 concurrent requests. Presumably, at very high levels of concurrent requests other bottlenecks start to dominate performance. After sharing these findings in the <code>#ghc</code> IRC channel, I was advised to increase the size of the GC nursery to 16 MB (up from the default of 1 MB) and track the RTS performance statistics with the <code>-s</code> RTS option.</p>
<p>It turned out that at low concurrency the backends performed much the same, but at higher concurrency levels the <code>epoll</code> backend started spending much more time in garbage collection than the <code>io_uring</code> backend. This was mostly caused by the amount of retained objects being much larger for <code>epoll</code>, and as we all know <a href="https://tech.channable.com/posts/2020-04-07-lessons-in-managing-haskell-memory.html">GC time is related to heap size in Haskell</a>. In one particular case, <code>epoll</code> had a maximum residency of no less than 1,021,622,432 bytes (almost a full gigabyte) while <code>io_uring</code> reported a maximum residency of only 1,553,680 bytes, a reduction in memory use of almost 98.5%! This also resulted in GC pauses of almost 200 ms for the <code>epoll</code> backend to traverse all that memory, while the <code>io_uring</code> backend reported a maximum GC pause time of only 12 ms. Since most programs will also do other things than just report a single in-memory string back to callers this result is unlikely in “the real world”, but it is still remarkable. I suspect that the difference is caused by the <code>epoll()</code> syscall returning all the available file descriptors in a big array that the backend then <code>forM_</code>s over to perform the callbacks. The <code>io_uring</code> backend on the other hand can pop CQEs off the CQ one at a time and reclaim the memory for that CQE almost …</p></div></div>

<p>I’m no longer active on Facebook, but at the moment, oddly, it’s my main goto option to find out at least some of the companies that share my data.</p>



<p>Facebook lets you see who shared your data with them. There are two interesting pages, buried and well-hidden, worth checking: <strong>Off Facebook activity</strong> and <strong>Businesses who uploaded and used a list</strong>.</p>



<p>Want to see which companies are sharing your data? continue reading.</p>



<h2><a href="https://www.facebook.com/off_facebook_activity/activity_list" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Off Facebook activity</a></h2>



<p>This one is very interesting and I recommend visiting the link to check our your own list. I won’t share the screenshot, but from what I gathered, all this information was leaked via apps on my iPhone, before I’ve disabled ad tracking. I’ve written about it before: <a href="https://blog.gingerlime.com/2020/does-apple-care-about-your-privacy/">Does Apple care about your privacy?</a> and I recommend reading it, if only to know how to disable ad tracking on your Apple devices.</p>



<h2><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=information_about_you&amp;section_id=interacted#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Businesses who uploaded and used a list</a> </h2>



<div><figure><img src="https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/dave_who-892x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/dave_who-892x1024.png 892w, https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/dave_who-261x300.png 261w, https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/dave_who-768x882.png 768w, https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/dave_who.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px"></figure></div>



<p>My list can be divided to roughly 3 categories:</p>



<ol><li>Companies I know and use. Amazon, Uber, etc. So whilst they know me and I did give them my details, I <strong>never explicitly gave them consent to share my details</strong>. With Facebook or with anyone… </li><li>Companies I’ve heard of, but never signed-up for, used nor shared any details with. <strong>How the f*** do they even have my details?</strong> not to mention share them with Facebook (or who knows what other companies)</li><li>Companies I’ve never heard of, but <strong>the name alone looks really dodgy</strong>. “Mindshare Biddable Digital” … you can imagine what a company with this name is doing. </li><li>Dave M. Rogenmoser. He probably deserves his own category. I don’t know him, never heard about him, and frankly now want nothing whatsoever to do with him. Dave, if you’re reading this, WTF are you doing sharing people’s personal details with Facebook? especially people who you don’t know and definitely didn’t give you consent to share details of.</li></ol>



<p>Ok, so this was 4 categories I guess… Although Dave might more realistically fall into the 3rd one.</p>



<h2>What does it mean?</h2>



<p>In case you can’t read the text on the image, this is what Facebook tells us about it</p>



<blockquote><p>These businesses uploaded a list to Facebook. Lists can contain contact information, for example an email address or phone number that is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=information_about_you&amp;section_id=interacted#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">hashed</a> so that Facebook does not learn any new identifying information about you. Lists can also contain advertising identifiers instead of contact information. Information from lists is matched against our existing list of users. The identity of users is not revealed to the business during the matching process.</p><p>Facebook uses these lists only to match the information to your profile and to deliver the ads chosen by the advertiser. Facebook does not keep the information shared in these lists. Advertisers can use lists to show you more relevant ads or to exclude you from ads that may be less relevant to you. For example, if you’re already a member of a gym then the gym could choose to exclude you from ads about becoming a member.</p><p>Facebook doesn’t learn any new identifying information about users when lists are uploaded. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=information_about_you&amp;section_id=interacted#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Learn More</a></p></blockquote>



<p>So, let’s decipher things a bit here, shall we?</p>



<h2>Hash data</h2>



<p>Technically, it’s true that Dave and his friends don’t share my personal details directly. i.e. they won’t upload my actual email address to Facebook. They will upload a <em>hash</em> of my email. But then, Facebook obviously holds its own giant list of hashed emails and other personal details, so then when two hashes match, Facebook knows that it’s me. That’s the way they can show me this list of companies.</p>



<p>So is this data sharing? I think every reasonable person would think so. Obviously now Facebook knows more about me. At the very least my (forced) association with those companies. Their claim that “Facebook doesn’t learn <em>any new identifying information</em>…” is technically true, but practically false, because this association is super valuable. Not only for allowing advertising to place ads, but I imagine to increase the richness of the user profile and what Facebook knows about you.</p>



<h2>Lookalike audiences</h2>



<p>I’m not 100% sure about this, but I think that’s another thing to worry about: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/164749007013531?id=401668390442328" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Lookalike audiences</a>. When companies upload lists of emails to Facebook, they not only do it in order to target those users directly, but rather to also discover <em>similar</em> people. People who are likely to be interested in their ads.</p>



<p>So whilst Facebook doesn’t reveal any extra information about me directly with advertisers who upload my details, these companies get a huge “prize” for sharing my data with them: These companies are then able to <strong>target ads to people with similar interests to mine</strong>.</p>



<p>Add the fact that now Facebook knows more about us, because they not only see how we interact on Facebook or sites that use the Facebook like buttons etc, this practice feeds even more knowledge (and golden opportunity) to Facebook. So if they know X people who (like me) use Amazon, Uber, and Share Now, perhaps they are also likely to be interested in using Grab? So both Facebook and those companies have a <strong>clear interest sharing my data. But are they allowed to?</strong></p>



<h2>Legitimate business and consent</h2>



<p>Let’s leave Facebook out of it for a moment… Are these companies allowed to share information about me with <em>any other company</em> (Facebook or otherwise), without my explicit and informed consent?</p>



<p>I’m not a lawyer, but here’s <a href="https://gdpr.eu/recital-40-lawfulness-of-data-processing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recital 40 of the GPDR</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>In order for processing to be lawful, personal data should be processed on the basis of the consent of the data subject concerned or some other legitimate basis, laid down by law, either in this Regulation or in other Union or Member State law as referred to in this Regulation, including the necessity for compliance with the legal obligation to which the controller is subject or the necessity for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.</p></blockquote>



<p>The way I understand it, personal data should be processed either based on “some other legitimate basis”, or on the basis consent.</p>



<p><strong>Legitimate basis</strong>, in very simple terms, is when the data is necessary to provide the service. For example, if I sign up to Amazon, they need my email to send me order confirmations. That’s a legitimate basis. But using my email for marketing or advertising stops becoming a legitimate basis. Why? because it is not <em>required</em> to provide the service that Amazon provides me.</p>



<p>So if Amazon wants to send me ads, or share my email for other purposes that aren’t realistically legitimate, they are <strong>required to ask for my informed and explicit consent</strong>.</p>



<h2>“But hey! They didn’t share your personal data! They only shared a hash…”</h2>



<p>Technically they “only shared a hash”, but this hash identifies me clearly. I believe it falls under personal data under the GDPR as well.</p>



<p><a href="https://gdpr.eu/eu-gdpr-personal-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to the GDPR, Personal information</a> is (emphasis mine):</p>



<blockquote><p>… any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who <strong>can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as</strong> a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</p></blockquote>



<h2>It gets even stranger</h2>



<p>If I dig a bit deeper into my list of companies, I saw that one of them actually shared my details with Facebook in order <em>not</em> to show me ads. This is actually one of the examples that Facebook gives when they explained about the Gym.</p>



<p>It’s definitely good for the Gym (they will not waste money on advertising someone who is already their member)</p>



<p>It’s definitely good for Facebook (they will sell more targeted ads, increasing the value of their platform to advertisers)</p>



<p>Is it good for me? some might say yes, because I won’t see the Gym ads any more. But at what price? I will still see other ads. And now Facebook knows that I’m a Gym member. I’m sure lots of advertisers would jump on the opportunity to sell me some Gym gear. I think I’m much worse-off here.</p>



<h2>What can we do about it?</h2>



<p>If you have a Facebook account, I highly recommend checking those two pages I linked to and seeing which companies are sharing your data.</p>



<p>The thing I wonder about most though, is what <em>other</em> companies my data is being shared with. Companies I have no way whatsoever to see such a list…</p>



<p>I guess the best thing to do is to contact these companies and ask them to stop it. Or to file a GDPR complaint. I would also recommend checking out <a href="https://noyb.eu/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NOYB</a> (None Of Your Business). It’s a privacy non-profit organization that does some great work in this area. Sign up and become a member if you want to support their work further.</p>

<blockquote><p>How can I ensure my customer won’t share the video they purchased? Can I protect the PDF I sell to be shared only once? How can I lock my daughter in a high tower, so that no worldly harm befalls her?</p></blockquote>



<p>The tension between sharing our creations and being paid was always tricky. But the digital world adds another layer of complexity – your creations can be copied and distributed also <b>after the purchase</b>, keeping you out of the loop of future profits.</p>



<p>A natural instinct is to seek the answer in the technology that permitted sharing in the first place – can I protect the content I sold, so that only the customer has access to it?</p>



<p>Yes, but you shouldn’t. Over-protecting your content focuses on extraction over providing value. Here are 10 reasons why (Digital Rights Management)[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management">1</a>] DRMs are a bad idea:</p>



<h3>1 – It is just impossible to prevent sharing</h3>



<p>Trying to effectively protect content against sharing is like fighting against skilled guerilla units in the digital jungle. Sure, you can deploy your defenses, but they will always find a sneaky way around them while you drain your resources.</p>



<ul><li>You will use streaming service to gate-keep your videos, They can use a project similar to `youtube-dl` to download any video file.</li><li>You will block downloading images on the page, they can just take a screenshot.</li><li>You can password protect a PDF, they can use a „virtual printer” to generate a new, open one.</li></ul>



<p>If you give a customer <b>any way </b>to access the content, that way can also be used to copy that content and/or record it.</p>



<p>This is a fundamental feature of the Internet. Content is meant to be easily reproducible and shared. The only way to win is to make it easier and more compelling to pay.</p>



<h3>2 – You are treating your customer like a thief</h3>



<p>Imagine if visiting your friend was like going through airport security. Did you bring any liquids? What’s that in your backpack? Oh no, your belongings are 300 grams too heavy, better pay for extra luggage!</p>



<p>Jumping through DRM hoops is sending a clear message to all your customers:</p>



<p><i>We don’t trust you. You have to go through this process because we think you may steal something. We’re watching you.</i></p>



<p>This message gets sent whenever a person who decided to pay you opens their purchase. It’s your biggest fans’ first experience with your product.</p>



<h3>3 – People who steal are not your customers</h3>



<p>Do you have a portrait of your ideal customer?</p>



<p>Is it a teenager sitting in a warez bulletin board all day and polishing his torrent workflow? If not – <strong>why are you focusing on them?</strong></p>



<p>People who download loads of content are not used to paying for it. When they won’t be able to find a free copy of <u>your</u> content – they will steal from your competitor or resign before they open their wallets.</p>



<p>And if you don’t know who your ideal customer is – maybe you should focus on that.</p>

<h3>4 – But they may become them</h3>



<p>Sure Artur – but what about when somebody buys something and then gives away to all their friends?</p>



<ol type="a"><li>What do you think about sharing books? Borrowing a blender? Some sharing is healthy and natural.</li><li>It actually benefits <b>you</b>.</li></ol>



<p><b>Bootleg content is a customer acquisition mechanism.</b></p>



<p>The most successful Internet entrepreneurs build sophisticated sales funnels. For example, they would have many interactions with the customer before they buy:</p>



<ol><li>A visitor interested in your field finds your article online.</li><li>After the second article, they sign up for your email list.</li><li>You provide consistent value and build up trust.</li><li>After a few months, you release a product and the follower becomes a customer.</li><li>Profit.</li></ol>



<p>Even if they try to “convert” their friends to trust you too, the friend lacks the relationship you have built. They didn’t receive your emails and they didn’t laugh at your corny jokes.</p>



<p>Demonstrating the full value of intellectual property requires giving it away. Once the friend sees the value you provide, they will either:</p>



<ol type="a"><li>Be blown away by the quality.</li><li>Decide it’s not for them and they will never be your customer.</li></ol>



<p>Both of these outcomes are ideal for you and save you considerable time in the signup funnel and marketing.</p>



<p>This is what trial period and discounts aim to accomplish, but they have side-effects. When you repeatedly discount, customers start treating the lower price as the ‘real’ one, and value the product less because ‘it must not be worth the full price’. Keeping a blind eye to questionable behavior gives you a way out. You can demonstrate how valuable your product is, without discounts that lead to price erosion.</p>



<p>People who “sneak onboard” often become customers themselves – and even the most loyal ones! The converted always are.</p>



<h3>5 – You are making it hard to enjoy your content.</h3>



<p>Open standards empower creators to build new tools or use the content in unpredictable ways. Things are better connected. These are the core assumptions under which the Internet was built. You will not be able to predict all the weird, fantastic, and inspiring ways your content will be accessed.</p>



<ul><li>I may read your PDF on an iPad, iPhone, Android tablet, Kindle, or printed out,</li><li>I frequently save workout or yoga videos to watch while being offline in the garden or on the road,</li><li>I like to read the text in my Pocket or Kindle apps.</li></ul>



<p>Any sort of „protection” breaks my ways of consuming your content and often makes it useless for me. Sometimes enough to give up on something I have paid for (<i>and that is the reason I stopped doing yoga, your honor</i>).</p>



<div>
<h4>Sign up to get Deliberate Internet straight to your inbox</h4>
<p>I write about the psychological and technical aspects of the Internet, focusing on remote work, online economy, and cognitive load. Every monday.</p>






</div>



<h3>6 – You are blocking people with disabilities from accessing it at all.</h3>



<p>I can manage the inconvenience with some grumbling – however, not everybody has that luxury. Tools that people with disabilities rely on are by nature incompatible with any sort of content protection schemes. Content protection’s entire purpose is restricting access to the narrow subset of users and use cases.</p>



<p>Mind you, that <u>you yourself will join</u> those “people with disabilities”. You will get older, lose a little clarity in your vision, and suddenly the new sexy apps developed by 20-year olds in their glass palaces will become confusing and unusable.</p>



<p>Helping my grandparents navigate the changing digital landscape is a sad and sobering experience. Any additional hoop that you make them jump through may render your content inaccessible.</p>

We will have eyesight issues<br>– ❓ We will get confused by new concepts<br>– ✋ Our motor skills will be worse</p><p>Let's make tech a little kinder for our future selves, please ? <a href="https://t.co/qxzfO3gLRv">https://t.co/qxzfO3gLRv</a></p></div>— Artur Piszek (@artpi) <a href="https://twitter.com/artpi/status/1218477669916053506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<h3>7 – You are turning your creation into a commodity</h3>



<p>The best online businesses rely on fostering the relationship between you and your customers. You share some free content, they are more receptive to trust you with their hard-earned money. It’s a dance of mutual respect and the first sale is only a part. If they like what you are doing, they will return for more, or even support you financially.</p>



<p>DRM software turns this delicate relationship into buying a sack of coal under the watchful gaze of security. <i>Not even a fistful too much! You are being watched</i>.</p>



<p>You are signaling to your customer that this is a purely monetary transaction. They are not entitled to even sharing your work with a friend, because they would be violating rules ?. Oh, the rules.</p>



<h3>8 – Are you really losing anything?</h3>



<p>If you are selling digital products, what is your marginal cost? How much do you pay to create another copy of your PDF, video, software?</p>



<p>When your content is being shared, it is <u>not stealing.</u> You don’t lose your income whenever somebody downloads a copy. As I mentioned – people who are likely to download illegal copies of your work are either never going to be your customers, or they will because they had a peek.</p>



<h3>9 – What is your true motivation for blocking the content?</h3>



<p>What is the core motivation for trying to protect your piece? Is it some misplaced sense of justice or is it legitimately best for your customer?</p>



<p>If that content truly makes you proud and you believe it would help them – what is the best outcome if the customer does not want to pay? Is this motivation coming from a place of fear?</p>



<ul><li>Fear of your work being „not good enough” to pay for?</li><li>Fear of the offer not being compelling enough?</li><li>Fear of not having enough paying customers to make it all worthwhile?</li></ul>



<p>Fear is not a good place to create amazing content people are going to love. This mindset will drag you down and prevent you from soaring into creative skies.</p>



<h3>10 – What do you choose to believe about people?</h3>



<p>Do you really want to believe that people are only waiting for an opportunity to steal? Or do you want to trust them to appreciate the value you provide?</p>



<h2>What can you do instead</h2>



<ol><li>Focus on the relationship with the customer. I have written a little more about it in<a href="https://piszek.com/2020/02/03/hospitality-vs-commodity/"> Your product is either hospitality or a commodity</a>.<br>I believe that all kinds of digital goods will be commoditized sooner or later. The only “moat” you can build is the customers’ trust.</li><li>Put the energy you would spend on DRM into innovation and creating new products. Once your old one gets shared, you should be already releasing a new one.<br>Subscriptions are an effective form of protection here – instead of sharing your content once, you drip the value to the customer – and they see the benefits of paying you.</li><li>Sell more. Get more paying customers – after all, it’s about how many customers <b>choose to pay you</b>, not how many choose not to.</li><li>Raise prices. Focus on the customer who is not driven to pay less, but the one who is driven to get more value. Paradoxically, more expensive products get downloaded less.</li></ol>



<p><strong><em>Now go, create, and sell.</em></strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><strong><em>Note: this web article is an older version of a paper which has now been published as an ICFP Pearl. You can find a preprint of that paper <a href="https://lptk.github.io/simple-sub-paper">here</a>.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>It’s probably better to read the paper rather than this post, as the paper contains more material, is more up to date, and is better explained!</em></strong></p> <p><strong>Algebraic subtyping</strong> is a new approach to global type inference in the presence of subtyping. It extends traditional Hindley-Milner type inference while preserving the principal type property — that is, it can always infer <em>the</em> most general type for any given expression. This approach was developed by <a href="http://stedolan.net/about/">Stephen Dolan</a> as part of his PhD thesis, along with Alan Mycroft.</p> <p>Algebraic subtyping was implemented in <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sd601/mlsub/">the <strong>MLsub</strong> type inference engine</a>. However, the design of MLsub seems significantly more complex than the simple unification algorithms used for traditional ML languages. MLsub has proven harder to grasp, even for people already familiar with compilers and type systems, such as myself.</p> <p>Dissatisfied with this state of affairs, I wanted to get to the bottom of the algebraic subtyping approach. What really is special about it, beyond the formalism? What are the simple concepts that hide behind the strange notions of <em>biunification</em> and <em>polar types</em>?</p> <p>This article is an answer to those questions. I propose an alternative algorithm for algebraic subtyping, called <strong>Simple-sub</strong>. Simple-sub can be implemented <strong>efficiently</strong> in <strong>under 500 lines of code</strong> (including parsing, simplification, and pretty-printing), and I think it is much more familiar-looking and easier to understand than MLsub.</p> <h4 id="---you-can-try-simple-sub-online-here---"><strong>⇨ ⇨ ⇨ <em><a href="https://lptk.github.io/simple-sub/">You can try Simple-sub online here!</a></em> ⇦ ⇦ ⇦</strong></h4> <p>This article is meant to be light in formalisms and easy to consume for prospective designers of new type systems and programming languages.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/LPTK/simple-algebraic-subtyping">The complete source code of Simple-sub is available on Github.</a></p>   <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2> <ol> <li> <p><strong><a href="#intro">Introduction</a></strong></p> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="#algebraic-subtyping-mlsub">Algebraic Subtyping in MLsub</a></strong></p> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="#algebraic-subtyping-simple-sub">Algebraic Subtyping in Simple-sub</a></strong></p> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="#simplifying-types">Simplifying Types</a></strong></p> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="#conclusions">Conclusions</a></strong></p> </li> </ol> <hr>  <p>The ML family of languages, which encompasses Standard ML, OCaml, and Haskell, have been designed around a powerful “global” approach to type inference, rooted in the work of <a href="https://doi.org/10.2307%2F1995158">Hindley</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016%2F0022-0000%2878%2990014-4">Milner</a>, later closely formalized by <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/582153.582176">Damas</a>. In this approach, the type system is designed to be simple enough that types can be unambiguously inferred from terms without the help of any type annotations. That is, for any unannotated term, it is always possible to infer a <em>principal type</em> which subsumes all other types that can be assigned to this term. For instance, the term $\lambda{x}. {x}$ can be assigned types $\mathsf{bool} \to \mathsf{bool}$ and $\mathsf{int} \to \mathsf{int}$, but both of these are subsumed by the polymorphic type $\forall a.\ a \to a$, also written <code>'a -&gt; 'a</code>, which is the principal type of this term.</p> <p><strong><em>Hindley-Milner</em></strong> (HM) type inference contrasts with more restricted “local” approaches to type inference, found in languages like Scala and C#, which often require the types of variables to be annotated explicitly by programmers. On the flip side, abandoning the principal type property allows these type systems to be more expressive and to support features such as object orientation and first-class polymorphism. Note that in practice, even ML languages like OCaml and Haskell have adopted expressive type system features which, when used, break the principal type property.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p> <p><strong><em>Subtyping</em></strong> is an expressive feature allowing types to be structured into hierarchies (usually a subtyping <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(order)"><em>lattice</em></a>) with the property that types can be <em>refined</em> or <em>widened</em> transparently following this hierarchy. This lets us express the fact that some types are more precise (contain more information) than others, but still have a compatible runtime representation, so that no coercions between them are needed. For instance, in a system where the type <code>nat</code> is a subtype of <code>int</code>, one can transparently use a <code>nat list</code> in place where an <code>int list</code> is expected, without having to apply a coercion function on all the elements of the list. Subtyping can be emulated using somewhat heavy type system machinery (which both OCaml and Haskell occasionally do<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>), but first-class support for subtyping gives the benefit of simpler type signatures and better type inference.</p> <p>For a long time, it was widely believed that pervasive implicit subtyping got in the way of satisfactory global type inference. Indeed, previous approaches to inferring subtypes failed to support principal types or resulted in the inference of large, unwieldy typing schemes which included sets of complex constraints, making their understanding by programmers difficult.</p> <p><strong><em>Algebraic subtyping</em></strong> was introduced by Dolan and Mycroft as an ML-style type system supporting subtyping and global type inference, while producing compact principal types. Here, <em>compact</em> refers to the fact that the inferred types are relatively simple type expressions without any visible constraints, making them easy to understand by programmer. This was achieved by carefully designing the syntax and semantics of the underlying subtyping lattice, allowing for simplifying assumptions in to be made the constraint resolution process of the type inference algorithm.</p> <p>However, <em>biunification</em>, the algorithm proposed by Dolan in order to implement algebraic subtyping, has been quite difficult to understand for many experts and non-experts alike. Indeed, on the surface it looks quite different from the usual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system#Algorithm_J"><em>Algorithm J</em></a> traditionally used for Hm type systems: it requires several additional concepts, such as bisubstitution and polar types, making it look more complicated.</p> <p>Thankfully, it turns out that algebraic subtyping admits a type inference algorithm, which I called <em>Simple-sub</em>, that is very similar to the familiar Algorithm J, and also much more efficient than biunification (or at least, than the basic syntax-driven form of biunification.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> In this article, I show that inferring algebraic subtypes is actually extremely easy, and can be done in under 300 lines of Scala code. Most of the complexity actually comes from simplifying the inferred type representations, which we will get to later.</p> <p>While the implementation we present is written in Scala, it is straightforward to translate into any other functional programming language.</p> <p><strong><em>The goal of this article</em></strong> is to recast algebraic subtyping into a simpler mold, allowing more prospective designers of type systems and programming languages to benefit from the great insights that this approach offers.</p> <hr>  <p>Let’s start by briefly reviewing what algebraic subtyping and MLsub are and what they are not, and by trying to assess their expressiveness.</p> <h2 id="term-language">Term Language</h2> <p>The term syntax of MLsub is given below. I have omitted boolean literals and if-then-else, as they can easily be typed as primitive combinators. I also used only one form of variables $x$, which will be sufficient for our use (Dolan’s MLsub formalism distinguishes lambda-bound variables from let-bound variables for technical reasons).</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>name</th> <th>formal syntax</th> <th>ML pseudo-syntax</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>variable</td> <td>$x$</td> <td><code>x</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>lambda</td> <td>$\lambda{x}. {e}$</td> <td><code>fun x -&gt; e</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>application</td> <td>$e\ e$</td> <td><code>e e</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>record creation</td> <td>$\{\ l_0 = e \,;\; … \,;\; l_n = e\ \}$</td> <td><code>{ l_0 = e; ...; l_n = e }</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>field selection</td> <td>$e.l$</td> <td><code>e.l</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>let bindings</td> <td>$\mathsf{let}\ x = e\ \mathsf{in}\ e$</td> <td><code>let x = e in e</code></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2 id="type-language">Type Language</h2> <p>The type syntax of MLsub, summarized below, consists in booleans, function types, record types, type variables, top $\top$ (the type of all values — supertype of all types), bottom $\bot$ (the type of no values — subtype of all types), type union $\sqcup$, type intersection $\sqcap$, and recursive types $\mu{\alpha}. {\tau}$.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>name</th> <th>formal syntax</th> <th>ML pseudo-syntax</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>primitives</td> <td>$\mathsf{bool}$, $\mathsf{int}$, …</td> <td><code>bool</code>, <code>int</code>, …</td> </tr> <tr> <td>function</td> <td>$\tau \to \tau$</td> <td><code>t -&gt; t</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>record</td> <td>$\set{\ l_0: \tau \,,\; … \,,\; l_n: \tau\ }$</td> <td><code>{ l_0: t, ..., t_n: t }</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>variable</td> <td>$\alpha $</td> <td><code>'a</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>top</td> <td>$\top$</td> <td><code>⊤</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>bottom</td> <td>$\bot$</td> <td><code>⊥</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>union</td> <td>$\tau \sqcup \tau$</td> <td><code>∨</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>intersection</td> <td>$\tau \sqcap \tau$</td> <td><code>∧</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>recursive</td> <td>$\mu\alpha. \tau$</td> <td><code>t as 'a</code></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2 id="informal-semantics-of-types">Informal Semantics of Types</h2> <p>While most MLsub type forms are usual and unsurprising, two kinds of types require our special attention: set-theoretic types (more specifically union and intersection types), and recursive types.</p> <h3 id="set-theoretic-types">Set-Theoretic Types</h3> <p>To a first approximation, union and intersection types can be understood in set-theoretic terms: the type term $\tau_0 \sqcup \tau_1$ (resp. $\tau_0 \sqcap \tau_1$) represents the type of values that are <em>either</em> (resp. <em>both</em>) of type $\tau_0 $ <em>or</em> (resp. <em>and</em>) of type $\tau_1$.</p> <p>MLsub uses these types to indirectly constrain inferred type variables; for instance, one type inferred for term $\lambda{x}. {\set{l = x - 1 \,;\; r = x}}$ could be $\alpha \sqcap \mathsf{int} \to \set{l: \mathsf{int} \,,\; r: \alpha}$. This type reflects the fact that the original argument, of type $\alpha$, is returned in the $r$ field of the result record, as the input type $\alpha$ ends up in that position, but also that this argument should be able to be treated as an $\mathsf{int}$, expressed via the type intersection $\alpha \sqcap \mathsf{int}$ on the left-hand side of the function type. Keeping track of the precise argument type $\alpha$ is important: it could be later substituted with a more specific type than $\mathsf{int}$, such as $\alpha = \mathsf{nat}$, which would give us $\mathsf{nat} \to \set{l: \mathsf{int} \,;\; r: \mathsf{nat}}$.</p> <p>On the other hand, there may be type signatures where some $\alpha$ becomes undistinguishable from $\mathsf{int}$. For instance, consider the term $\lambda{x}. {\mathsf{if}\ \mathsf{true}\ \mathsf{then}\ {x - 1}\ \mathsf{else}\ {x}}$, whose simplified inferred type would be just $\mathsf{int} \to \mathsf{int}$, as the seemingly-more precise type $\alpha \sqcap \mathsf{int} \to \alpha \sqcup \mathsf{int}$ does not actually contain more information (see the MLsub paper for details).</p> <p>The beauty of algebraic subtyping is that this sort of reasoning scales to arbitrary flows of variables and higher-order functions; for instance, the previous example can be generalized by passing in a function $f$ to stand for the $\cdot - 1$ operation, as in …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>It’s easier to manage 4 people than it is to manage one person. The primary reason for this is the inherent over-reliance in the relationship between a manager and a single report. Let’s dive deeper.</p>

<p>It’s not uncommon for a first-time manager to get a single direct report. Try it out. See how it goes. Here’s what this ends up looking like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The new manager is over-reliant on making sure their single report likes them and is doing well. If they give feedback that their manager stinks, that’s 100% bad feedback from your reports. If the report doesn’t do well, that’s 100% of your reports that aren’t succeeding.* If the report quits, you just lost your whole team.</li>
  <li>The manager’s over-reliance on the direct report’s success and happiness leads to risk-averse behavior, like not giving critical feedback or overcompensating. It also regularly leads to micromanagement.</li>
  <li>The single report is isolated. They don’t have any peers on the team to reach out to for help. If their manager is bad, they don’t have any corroborating voices. Anything that goes wrong is a they-said I-said debate. Any debate inside of the team is a faceoff with your manager.</li>
  <li>No one in this relationship has the ability to get context. With more reports, a manager gets clearer signals when they’re wrong. A report could look to teammates to corroborate or dissuade their ideas. With one report, disagreements have little additional evidence, so people have to either approach the situation with a supreme lack of ego, or they can just assume it’s the other person’s fault. Guess which option happens most.</li>
</ul>

<p>To further the problematic conditions, the single report will often be a very junior hire. This compounds the issue. Straight-from-college hires don’t have great context for what it means to be in industry, to have a manager, to work a job with no end-of-semester in sight. And hires aren’t expected to have as much autonomy in their formative early years. With these variables, the requirements on the manager are higher than average.</p>

<p>It’s not uncommon for these relationships to turn sour. The manager makes mistakes as they always do. The report makes mistakes as they always do. Fingers are pointed. Times are dire. If you ever hear someone call their manager a “first-time manager”, you know the relationship has reached a special level of hell.</p>

<p>To avoid this situation, consider doing the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Avoid having first time managers have a team of 1 individual contributor for a prolonged amount of time. That team size is an <a href="https://staysaasy.com/management/2020/06/21/goldilocks-management-structure.html">anti-pattern</a> for more reasons than just this one.</li>
  <li>Try and make sure the manager of a team with 1 individual contributor is also an expert in the domain area. Sometimes managers are explicitly not the domain expert by design, but when you have 1 report, a lack of domain expertise is one of the sure-fire ways to make mistakes and a sure-fire way for your report to get the idea that you’re no good.</li>
  <li>Avoid at all costs the combination of: new manager, 1 report, report is new-to-industry, manager is not a subject-matter expert.</li>
</ul>

<p>* Note: mangers should be very invested in their report’s success. But when the manager is <em>over-invested</em> it leads to all sorts of unsavory things, some of which are called out above. Another example is when a report is doing well-enough, but because the manager is <em>over-reliant</em> on their performance, they try to push the report beyond what they can or want to do.</p>

		<p>I still remember some of the (written down) expectations I faced when I joined a high-profile consultancy in 2001. One of them was:</p><blockquote>"to effectively solve <strong>poorly-defined</strong> problems"</blockquote><p>The "poorly-defined" is the interesting part here. But at that point in time, it made a lot of sense. We've been paid <em>mucho dinero</em> to tackle whatever was to be tackled, regardless of "minor inconveniences". We couldn't appear helpless, drifting, or simply not smart enough to immediately start smashing obstacles (you know, the style over substance ;P). A client doesn't really know what they want? Well, we'll deliver it anyway!</p><p>I think the intentions behind the statement were fine &amp; reasonable. Even culture-wise, it was quite smart: own the problem even if it's not served on a tray, with a map and guidebook.</p><p>But the execution often used to get skewed &amp; twisted. And so it still does in numerous other companies nowadays:</p><ul><li>instead of solving the most important/meaningful problem, we navigate our efforts in a way to focus on the ones we fill comfortable with (e.g., technical ones, not business ones)</li><li>we keep mixing (various, co-existing, but inherently separate) problems and get lost in the meanders of their overlapping impacts</li><li>we mistake problems with their visible symptoms because fixing a visible effect is frequently much easier/cheaper than going for the full score</li></ul><p>All of those are results of <strong>poor problem definition</strong> (&amp; framing, &amp; scoping, etc.). Obviously, there are tools, techniques &amp; practices to deal with such challenges. However ...</p><p><br>..., there's a separate category of poorly-defined problems that are even harder to deal with. They are called <strong>"wicked problems"</strong> &amp; they are the main topic of this blog post.</p><p>What's wicked problem (WP)? Quoting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem">Wikipedia</a>, a wicked problem is ...</p><blockquote>... a problem whose <u>social complexity</u> means that it has no determinable stopping point.</blockquote><p>It's not the only definition provided, but I find it the best - very short &amp; perfectly captures what distinguishes WP. Take note - the challenge here is not the domain, technical or mechanical but SOCIAL complexity. In my case, it was enough to grab my attention.</p><p>This concept of WP comes straight from sociology and it's best to illustrate it by listing the key properties of a wicked problem (again, quoting Wikipedia)</p><ol><li>The problem is not (properly/correctly) understood until <strong>after the formulation of a solution</strong>.</li><li>Wicked problems have <strong>no stopping rule</strong> (criteria of being "solved").</li><li>Solutions to wicked problems are <strong>not right or wrong</strong> (in a binary way).</li><li>Every wicked problem is essentially <strong>novel and unique</strong>.</li><li>Every solution to a wicked problem is <strong>a "one-shot operation"</strong> (it's not possible to try it out / evolve it).</li><li>Wicked problems have <strong>no given alternative solutions</strong>.</li></ol><p>The most common wicked problems come from domains of economics, politics, global ecology, etc. Take an issue of handling COVID-19 pandemics, controlling the national debt/inflation rate, qualifying any Polish team to UEFA Champions League, dealing with recent migration movements in Europe, reducing traffic jams in Warsaw or preventing alcoholism &amp; drug abuse among adolescents.</p><p>Everyone knows these are actual, significant problems. Everyone has an opinion (on what would work best in each case), but it's not possible to come up with a consensus &amp; agree on a common way to deal with literally any of those problems. Wicked problems polarize opinions, escalate conflicts, slow down or event prevent any actions &amp; in the end - infuse the environment with helplessness &amp; frustration.</p><p>To be honest, there's a fascinating piece of theory behind "wicked problems" ("super-wicked problems", so-called "social messes" - yes, it's an actual term!, divergent vs convergent problems, etc.), so feel free to take a deep dive (the Wikipedia page linked above is a GREAT starting point), but the purpose of this article is different than playing with the academic considerations.</p><p>My point is: any work environment (it doesn't even have to be dysfunctional) is capable of growing nearly every problem from a category of a "standard" <strong>into the "wicked" one</strong>. It doesn't take the whole nation but only a bunch of individuals (with colliding standpoints, misaligned goals &amp; overgrown egos) to paralyze the organization &amp; cause the disorder. Examples?</p><ol><li><em>"Which web framework would work best in our next project we're just about to start?"</em></li><li><em>"How to deal with the technical debt we've accumulated for the past 5 years?"</em></li><li><em>"We'd like to have a unified logging mechanism across all X teams, but how to get there?"</em></li><li><em>"We have a bunch of components created 'the old way' and some in 'the new way' - how do we fix this situation?"</em></li></ol><p>Do these look familiar? Don't problems like that keep popping up (every few weeks) at your guild/status meetings, make people vent out for 40 minutes, until they get exhausted and you can move to the next point in agenda without anything conclusive?</p><p>I thought so. Yes, these are <u>your local, wicked problems</u>.</p><hr><p>Everyone has encountered some of those. The goal is to avoid creating them if possible. Here are my suggestions on what could help you in succeeding in that field. Do your best ...</p><ul><li>to put ALL the politics, religion and other social topics OUT of work environment (to avoiding mixing in the problems which are inherently wicked!)</li><li>to make sure that the decision-making policy in your organization is clear (it's known who makes the decision (the "owner" of the problem) &amp; what kind of responsibility it means)</li><li>to avoid "direct democracy" (and all sorts of committees) as a form of decision making</li><li>to dissect very clearly the diverging (brainstorming, looking for alternatives, building up knowledge) and converging (eliminating options to determine the best direction) phases of decision making</li><li>to be able to separate (unequivocally) the facts from opinions - because we're emotionally very closely attached to the latter, but the decisions should be based on facts whenever possible</li><li>to have a dedicated role of someone keeping the "discussion hygiene" high (by avoiding re-iterating topics, getting de-railed with meaningless edge cases or watering down precise issues)</li><li>to build up the "bias towards action" - because one can always come up with a reason not to do something (as it's safer &amp; doesn't make you personally accountable), but action is the engine of progress</li><li>to work out a habit of dissecting problems into smaller but independent ones - so the burden of decision-making is more bearable, there are less factors to consider and the decision itself is reversible/adjustable</li></ul>

<p>This is just a story of my day. It was an incredibly boring day. Why do I write about it? I analyzed why it was so dull and uncovered a great insight. What is the most critical factor in software engineering productivity? I think it is the time it takes to deploy your app.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Beautiful start of the day</h2>

<p>I woke up at around 10 am. Not too bad, given that I’ve stayed late the night before – I have been trying to solve an engineering problem at work. The problem was adding a new feature to the gigantic project with a not so scalable architecture. The project was born out of the hackathon, so it’s nobody’s fault… Anyway, the engineering problem. It wasn’t even that hard because as soon as I woke up, I had it all figured out in my head. I just needed my morning coffee first.</p>



<p>I started coding right after my first sip. Something really happened in my head during sleep, because it felt so easy to write code. The solution was pretty obvious, and it did not introduce any unneeded complexity to an already chaotic code base. It looked good, so I ran the code locally. Oh, yes, I forgot to import the module here. Oops, this variable is NULL now, let’s fix that. Okay, it seems to work now. So I committed changes to my branch and created a PR. It’s 11 am on the clock. Pretty sweet as a start of the day, ha? Now what? Even if I solved the problem, it’s not going to do much good without getting into production. Now it’s time to get my code to the finish line.</p>



<p>My open PR had automatically triggered tests. We have all kinds of tests: unit, integration, code style, you name it. I knew I had some time because this process is not usually fast. However, I didn’t have enough time to shift my focus to another task or fully relax. So I kept on checking my messengers, social apps, and news feed. Then a message arrived in Slack. “Lint-check failed.” Oh, I hate those! I thought I had everything right! Okay, it looks like I forgot to remove this import, and it’s not used anymore. I removed one line from the code and committed my changes. 5 minutes wait, again. What’s going on on Twitter?</p>



<h2>We all hate waiting</h2>

<p>I did not notice how 15 minutes passed. Then I got another slack message – integration tests failed. At least my code style is right. So, I spent another 5 minutes fixing the issue (integration test actually did an excellent job catching a tricky bug, so I’m not mad at it). Then I committed my changes and played the waiting game again.</p>



<p>I understand the importance of tests, but 20 minutes, come on! Of course, I could’ve made some progress on another task, meanwhile. No, not really. I don’t know about you, but I hate switching focus. It takes so much time to get into a really focused state. So I’ve checked all my apps on the phone a couple times and found the bottom of the twitter feed before I saw a Slack notification about the successful deployment of my code. </p>



<p>Just to be safe, I need to test the app on production to see if the new feature works. From first glance, it did, but there was a small glitch. I had to update the code in the UI of a web application, nothing fancy, just changing a string. This turned out to be a header on the page, and I added redundant whitespace at the beginning, so now it looks weird. Okay, here we go again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now all tests passed, but the deployment took forever. I’m not sure what kind of computation is involved in moving a folder with files around 10 megabytes from my laptop to the server, but it sure feels like it could’ve trained a conscious AI by now. I don’t remember how much time it took for me to refresh the page and finally see the whitespace disappear, but it definitely took another cup of coffee. I managed to check my emails during this time, so I was productive, I guess. Anyway, it’s 2 pm, and it’s time for lunch.</p>



<h2>How much time we waste</h2>



<figure><img src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-5dffa44220fae3cb575331fd82a7013a.jpg" alt="The picture of a clock to illustrate time we waste when the deploy is slow." srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-5dffa44220fae3cb575331fd82a7013a.jpg 900w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-5dffa44220fae3cb575331fd82a7013a-300x200.jpg 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-5dffa44220fae3cb575331fd82a7013a-768x512.jpg 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-5dffa44220fae3cb575331fd82a7013a-360x240.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></figure>



<p>As you may have noticed, I’m complaining. That day I really spent around 1 hour actually solving an engineering problem, including bug-fixing time. But it took me 4 hours until I saw my changes in production. There are many days like this, so time adds up. I feel righteous anger because this thing is common in the industry, and many people experience the same thing.</p>



<p>So, what’s the solution? Not writing tests? Of course, not, tests are freaking great. The issue is more generic – it’s all those inefficiencies that are easy to introduce to the deploy time (I bundle tests and all CI/CD stuff in the deploy time). It’s easy to write an inefficient CI/CD job. Its intent could be positive, and at the time, it may seem like a great idea. But a little delay is multiplied by the number of people working on the project and frequency of changes they make. Because deploy time affects EVERY contributor and EVERY code change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Slow deploy means slow feedback loops. Imagine you’re an artist. Now imagine each time you move your brush on the canvas, you need to wait 5 minutes before the paint appears. That would be the most annoying thing ever.</p>



<h2><strong>The feedback loop (deploy) has to be fast</strong></h2>



<figure><img src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-3b673bff843c3985e1f74841e58ef65d.jpg" alt="The picture of an artist that compares painting and seeing result with the feedback loop of software deploy." srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-3b673bff843c3985e1f74841e58ef65d.jpg 900w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-3b673bff843c3985e1f74841e58ef65d-300x169.jpg 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-3b673bff843c3985e1f74841e58ef65d-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></figure>



<p>I believe that each developer who likes to solve creative problems needs to have a fast feedback loop. You change the code – “snap” – it’s updated on the server – “snap” – you see the result.</p>



<p>Please think about this next time you want to add something to the deploy time. And also, think about improving deployment speed next time you work on technical debts. If you cut just 1 minute for a project with 5 contributors, each of them contributing once a day (only on workdays), it saves more than 100 hours a year. And I don’t know how to count improved productivity because of not having to switch the focus, but for me, it would multiply this time by 2 at least. To create better software, we need to improve how we write software.</p>



<p>PS. There is a great talk that inspired me&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/36579366">https://vimeo.com/36579366</a>. You should check it out, it’s mind-blowing.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><img src="https://blog.grahamyooll.com/assets/images/copy-paste-twins.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>As seen in numerous pull requests, the conversation goes something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Me: “Interesting solution. Where did this come from?”</p>

  <p>Colleague: “I found it on Stack Overflow.”</p>

  <p>Me: “Did you copy/paste it?”</p>

  <p>Colleague: “Yes”</p>

  <p>Me: “Do you <strong>KNOW</strong> what it does?”</p>

  <p>Colleague: “Um… yeah.”</p>

  <p>Me: “What does it do then? What are the implications of this solution?”</p>

  <p>Colleague: “Let me find out…”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is what I call, the Copy/Pasta Driven Development® pattern.</p>

<p>Don’t know what to do? Google it. Find it. Copy it. Paste it. Profit?</p>

<p>Probably not.</p>

<p>Everytime you select code from a browser, followed by pressing cmd+C and then cmd+V, I surmise you are robbing yourself of precious time to up your knowledge.</p>

<p>Copy/pasting is even more harmful, I argue, to more junior developers. Junior developers need to be able to bang their heads against a problem a bit before realizing their pitfalls, eventually coming out of the deep end with a clearer vision of the tools they use. By copy/pasting, you short circuit this learning opportunity, and end up looking for the “easy answers” without understanding <strong>why</strong> that is the easy answer.</p>

<p>Before I continue, I must say that copy/paste is a very powerful concept, something that we all do. Almost magical. However, just like everything in life, too much of something can be detrimental.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.grahamyooll.com/assets/images/victor-garcia-0yL6nXhn0pI-unsplash.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>By copy/pasting, you are taking someone else’s answer to a very specific problem and using it for yours. On the face of it, that statement seems perfectly reasonable, right? But the trouble comes when you do not understand, or even worse, do not contemplate its interaction with your specific problem.</p>

<p>To build up the habit, referencing someone else’s answer to solve your given problem is perfectly valid. If you are to use the given solution, do not copy/paste it. Instead, line by line, type it out. While typing, go line by line figuring out what every variable, argument, loop, etc. is doing. Don’t know what that argument does? Look it up. Don’t get this loop? Write it out so you do understand it. The key here is not being able to understand the code you are writing, but being able to read code quickly. This practice will help with that.</p>

<p>Finally, yes, there are times to copy/paste. For instance, if you are doing something repeatedly and you understand its functionality, you probably can copy/paste. Even better, you should figure out how to automate that repetitive task. However, you should not be copy/pasting stuff that you don’t understand.</p>

<p>Take the couple of minutes to fully digest what is happening in the code you are executing. You will not regret it.</p>

<p>Bonus conversation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Colleague: “Hey, Andrew, this piece of code doesn’t work like it’s supposed to. Could you take a look? My tests are failing, and I don’t know why.”</p>

  <p>Me: “Where did this new line come from?”</p>

  <p>Colleague: “From this other file.”</p>

  <p>Me: “So, you copied it?”</p>

  <p>Colleague: “Yeah”</p>

  <p>Me: “Do you know what it’s doing then?”</p>

  <p>Colleague: “Not really…”</p>

  <p>Me: “Ok, then delete that code and start over without copy/pasting.”
10 minutes later I hear…</p>

  <p>Colleague: “Ohhhhhhhh!”</p>
</blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This is a post in a series of posts :</p>
<br>
<div><p>
As my regular readers know I reluctantly trust anything that isn't tested and battle proof. In the last 2 years, I applied the same logic that I apply to vulnerability research to the Data Privacy environment and proceeded to test a broad range of Data Subject Rights. Expect a few disclosures following this one.</p><p>

In true Information Security Fashion (insiders will understand) have attributed this weakness the ID :</p><ul>
<li><b>CDPWE-0001 - Does not designate a Representative in the European Union</b></li>
</ul>
<h3>
Introduction</h3>
<br></div>
<p>
When I searched Google for my name an interesting website came up in the results. A company called "Rocket Reach" allowed others to buy access to my personal data. I was intrigued as I have never given any consent for Rocketreach to store (or even sell) my data and I saw no other legal basis for RocketReach processing of my data.</p>
<div>

<p>
"Rocket Reach" a data broker that describes it's service as :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
"Connect directly with the right decision makers, using the world's largest and most accurate database of emails and direct dials.&nbsp;Real-time verified data for 430 million professionals across 17 million companies, worldwide.Trusted by over 5.0 million users — powering sales, recruiting, and marketing at companies large and small.</p>
<p>
Prospect, connect and converse with your leads at scale."</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>



<h3>
Issuing a DSAR</h3>
</p>
<p>
On the <b>5th of April&nbsp; 2019</b>, I asked Rocketreach access to my personal data (Data Subject Access Request) and asked for the purpose and the legal basis of processing. Instead of giving me access to my data and reply adequately, RocketReach decided to <b>delete/remove all traces of it </b>and informed me that it did so the same day.</p>

<p>
While it might be surprising to some, this is actually a common reaction to DSARs when the Data Controller realizes the data they have may have no real legal basis.</p>
<br>
<h3>
Filing a complaint&nbsp;</h3>
<p>
On the <b>05th of April 2019</b>, I filed a complaint with the Luxemburgish Data Protection Agency (CNPD). The reference for this complaint is #3018 (For those that want to request information/documents from the CNPD).</p>

<h3>
Waiting for roughly a year</h3>
<br>
<h3>
"We agree with you but we can't do anything, sorry, move on"</h3>
<p>
On the <b>6th of March 2020</b>&nbsp;(<span>1 year!</span>) the CNPD responded as follows (Original Version on top, the Translated version at the bottom).</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p><span lang="FR">Monsieur Zoller,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="FR">La

 revenir vers vous concernant votre réclamation du 5 avril 2019 à 
l’encontre de la société RocketReach.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="FR">Dans le cadre de l’instruction de votre réclamation, la

<p><span lang="FR">Par ailleurs, il ressort également de cette instruction 
que la société RocketReach est une société située aux Etats-Unis 
d’Amérique <b>ne disposant pas d’un représentant dans l’Union au sens de 
l’article 27 du règlement général sur la protection
 des données (RGPD). </b><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="FR">Au sujet des responsables du traitement établis dans des
 pays tiers, comme les Etats-Unis d’Amérique, nous souhaitons attirer 
votre attention sur le considérant (116) du RGPD qui précise que:</span></p>
<p>
«&nbsp;<i>Lorsque

 les frontières extérieures de l'Union, cela peut accroître le risque 
que les personnes physiques ne puissent exercer leurs droits liés à la

 De même, les autorités de contrôle peuvent être confrontées à 
l'impossibilité d'examiner des réclamations ou de mener des enquêtes sur
 les activités exercées en dehors de leurs frontières. Leurs efforts 
pour collaborer dans le contexte transfrontalier peuvent
 également être freinés par les pouvoirs insuffisants dont elles 
disposent en matière de prévention ou de recours, par l'hétérogénéité 
des régimes juridiques et par des obstacles pratiques tels que le manque

<p><span lang="FR">Dans le cas de votre réclamation cela signifie que, <b>bien

<blockquote><b>English Translation</b><p>
Mr. Zoller, </p><p>The National Commission for Data Protection (CNPD) would like to get back to you regarding your complaint of 5 April 2019 against the company RocketReach. </p><p>Rocket Reach has informed us that <b>it considers that it is the users of its services, and not itself, who are responsible for processing personal data processed on its website</b>.  Furthermore, it also emerges from this instruction that RocketReach is a company located in the United States of America that does not have a representative in the Union within the meaning of Article 27 of the General Regulation on Data Protection (RGPD).&nbsp;</p> <p>As regards data controllers established in third countries, such as the United States of America, we would like to draw your attention to recital (116) of the DPMR which states that: 'When personal data crosses the external borders of the Union, this may increase the risk that individuals may not be able to exercise their data protection rights, in particular to protect themselves against unlawful use or disclosure of such information.</p><p>Similarly, supervisory authorities may be faced with the impossibility to investigate complaints or activities outside their borders. Their efforts to work together in the cross-border context may also be hampered by insufficient preventive or remedial powers, heterogeneous legal regimes and practical obstacles such as lack of resources. »&nbsp;</p> <p>In the case of your complaint, this means that, although <b>we do not share RocketReach's view and to the contrary believe <span>that RocketReach is the data controller</span> </b>for the processing of personal data on its website, <b>we are unable to take any further action in relation to your complaint.</b> We do not have the authority to investigate and enforce any decision we would have to take in the United States of America.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>We regret to inform you that we consider it impossible for us to proceed with the processing of your case.</b></p></blockquote>
<div><p>In Summary -&nbsp; Rocketreach has <b>not met the requirement</b> of the GDPR to name an EU representative (Art27) to account for the processing of European Personal Data. <b>In their answer, the CNPD makes it sound like it is optional, it isn't.</b> Instead of pursuing Rocketreach locally on that basis alone, the CNPD just gives up arguing it has no jurisdiction in the US.</p></div>

<p><span>In other words, just don't designate a representative in Europe, build your business model around the exploitation of data from millions of European data subjects and you are fine?</span></p>

<p>
I&nbsp; am fully aware that I could engage in legal procedures myself.&nbsp; That's not in my interest (in this case). The overall question you should ask is: Do we need a European Institution that handles extra-territorial investigations and fines? <b>Why should it take the time, money, and energy from an individual when the DPA is supposed to defend the rights of the data subjects</b>?</p>
<p>
What the CNPD could have done according to [1]</p><ul>
<li><span><span>to impose a temporary or definitive limitation including a ban on processing;</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>to order the suspension of data flows to a recipient in a third country or to an international organisation.</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>to impose an administrative fine pursuant to Article 83, in addition to, or instead of measures referred to in this paragraph, depending on the circumstances of each individual case;</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>to order the controller or processor to bring processing operations into compliance with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate, in a specified manner and within a specified period;</span></span></li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-a0ba2051dedfb653ca45"><div><h3><strong>Building Beauty invites computer professionals to:</strong></h3><p><strong>Work, study, and conduct research with a network of&nbsp;Christopher Alexander’s colleagues and students</strong></p><p>The architect and urbanist Christopher Alexander, and his coworkers, produced a body of insights, practical methods, and research results, which inspired countless movements and products in the computer world -- from <strong>structured programming</strong> to <strong>design patterns</strong>; from the <strong>wiki</strong> to the <strong>sims</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>But these were side-effects. His major drive was to understand the <strong>nature of beauty</strong>, and the processes that create life and beauty in nature, so people could make beautiful things.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyone who wants to build beautifully, and anyone interested in resolving the countless troubles and problems in the world of computing, would benefit from understanding Alexander’s underlying research program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The most direct way to do that, and the most engaged approach, is to study the material <strong>with a network of people who worked closely with Christopher Alexander</strong>, and who are continuing to develop his approach to theory and practice.&nbsp;</p><p>Building Beauty is an architectural graduate program. Its goal is to provide the opportunity to join this network and pursue this research.&nbsp;</p><p>If you work in <strong>computing</strong>, we invite you to study this material with us in its <strong>original</strong> form, for the<strong> built environment</strong> -- and join in parallel seminars, projects, and conferences to explore a disciplined, rigorous, and authentic recasting of this material, within the world of technology. We will pursue research in the natural sciences and explore the nature of engineering, while growing beautiful projects that move us towards a better world.&nbsp;</p><p>Christopher Alexander made sure that his colleagues, no matter their background, went through&nbsp; fundamental, practical training on the nature of beauty. We've continued that tradition at the Building Beauty program. Now, in parallel, within our new Beautiful Software initiative, we’ll get everyone up-to-speed regarding ambitious technology that can assist in the spread of beauty. The first lesson is that putting nature, beauty, and feeling in the <strong>center</strong> of processes and practices will engender positive, revolutionary changes in the world we live in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The case for beautiful software</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>There are <strong>three</strong> strange facts that force us to consider <strong>good</strong> software to be (among other things) <strong>beautiful</strong> and <strong>natural</strong>, compelling us to examine closely what these mean.&nbsp;</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>People can tell the <strong>difference</strong> between something that is natural -- that is, <strong>not</strong> man-made -- and something that is a human artifact.</p></li><li><p>However it's measured, <strong>nature</strong> makes <strong>more complex</strong> products than we can. Of course, the human species is an 'artifact' of nature, so we can never win that game.</p></li><li><p>Among the products of nature and humans, we judge the <strong>best</strong> to be 'natural and 'beautiful'.</p></li></ol><p>Regarding (1) -- of course it’s possible to fool people: with a photograph, for example. But when we do so, we are merely re-emphasizing that there <strong>is</strong> a perceptual faculty that reacts to impressions of natural structure.&nbsp;</p><p>Regarding (2) -- nature produces beauty and adaptation wonderfully. It's enviable. But nature's precise physical and chemical mechanisms are terribly complex and hard to uncover, while the mechanisms behind good software must be clear, consistent, and comprehensible. So why study natural processes? Because nature doesn't only work at a single, low-level scale. Nature works with overlapping layers of means and ends, which we can make immediate use of, it turns out, when we direct our efforts towards beauty and feeling. We don't need to copy nature exactly. We just need to do better, and natural processes provide the clues.&nbsp;</p><p>Regarding (3) -- there are many human artifacts and processes, even extremely 'popular', 'successful', and 'productive' ones, that are neither beautiful nor natural. This may be a good indication of a harmful product or process. Things that are popular, dominant, and stimulating are not necessarily good. But, unfortunately, by habit, and power projection through our society, bad results are often called 'best practices'. Learning to question dogmas is one of the most important skills one can develop in life and in the sciences -- along with an ability to piece together theories that displace the dogmas. This process of enlightenment, in the broad sense, should never end.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, even the most beautiful and natural software will do harm if it was not created freely and cooperatively, for the purpose of healing and helping people and nature. <strong>Responsibility</strong> is rarely practiced in the creation of any technology, but we need it: we won't survive unless we become truly, doggedly responsible.&nbsp;</p><p>We'll be examining these ideas and practices in our seminars and projects. <strong>You are all invited.</strong></p><p><strong>To express your interest in joining us, please write to </strong><a href="mailto:software@buildingbeauty.org"><strong>software@buildingbeauty.org</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p></div></div></div>]]>

					<div><p>I have a strange relationship with hypomania. I LOVE IT but I know that what goes up must come down and when it comes down it <span><strong>REALLY</strong></span> comes down. And the next time is even worse than the last. The relief of coming out of depression and speeding towards hypomania is magical. Waking up and jumping out of bed, rushing to get dressed so I can go outside. So I can experience the sun on my skin, the air is fresh and the grass is greener than I remember. Everything is great. I want to share my happiness with my friends, family and the world. I laugh harder than I have ever laughed before. I very rarely wear make-up but when I’m hypomanic I absolutely must. I’m confident in every aspect of life. I even love going to work. I have the best ideas. I could definitely do that. My taste in music changes I’m forever searching for an up-beat song that has a fast beat that I can sing to, dance to. I’ll skip 100’s of songs until I find the one and when I do it’s AMAZING.</p><p>In social situations during a hypomanic episode you’ll often find me surrounded by people. I love talking and I love listening. People tend to be really drawn to me when I’m like this because I’m fun to be around and I make them laugh. I often go days with barely any sleep. I don’t need it. I don’t need to eat either.&nbsp; I can sleep when I’m dead, eating is a distraction from what I want to be doing and I have lots of things that I want to do. Sounds great right? How is this even considered a mental illness? Let me tell you… During this episodes one of my symptoms is hypersexuality.</p><blockquote><p><span><strong>Hypersexuality</strong></span> is defined as an increased need or pressure for sexual gratification. It can often be a symptom of mania, and may also include decreased inhibitions or a need for forbidden sex.</p></blockquote><p>For me I become preoccupied with the thought of having sex and I’ll pursue someone hard. Not just with my partner at the time but anyone who takes my eye. In fact, I don’t even need to feel that attracted to them. The thrill of flirting, the thrill of making them want me is my objective. I consider myself a straight female (Though I have had sexual encounters with women in the past) but it doesn’t matter. I’ll flirt and have sex with women too. I don’t want or need it to be intimate. It’s an hedonistic, animalistic desire to have sex. And if I don’t get it? It pisses me off. This again probably doesn’t sound like the end of the world does it? But what if you’re flirting and perusing your boss? A married man or you’re in a relationship yourself? Not so funny when it can fuck up your life and other peoples. </p><p>This behaviour has led me into dangerous situations. I have been sexually assaulted numerous times and now what would be defined as rape. At the time I had no awareness that it was. For this reason amongst others I never reported it. Victim blaming is prevelant in society. I saw it as me putting myself in a&nbsp; situation where it could happen, thus it was my own fault.</p><p>Reflecting on my teenage years I can now really see that hypomania was very present. After my dad died when I was 16. I stopped turning up at school I made friends with people much older than me. Many of them I’m still friends with and they really are great friends.&nbsp; But during this period of my life I ended up using recreational drugs EVERY weekend, ALL weekend.&nbsp; Not just a bit of weed but ecstasy and cocaine whilst drinking heavily too. Sometimes I took all of those drugs on the same night. I remember the day I turned 18. Finishing work, the guy I worked with (also my best friend at the time) handed me some money to buy ecstasy for the party were planning to have. I walked into my Mum’s house filled with family there to wish me happy birthday. I stood there and chatted to them, the whole time I had 200 ecstasy tablets in the front pocket of my hoody. I didn’t care. I didn’t care that taking one of those ecstasy tablets could have killed me. Because it wouldn’t would it? I’m indestructible. I’m having so much fun. Life is great.</p><p>If all that hasn’t persuaded you that hypomania is a bad thing… What about the racing thoughts? The irritation that consumes you and the full-blown anger that comes because of it? I’ve lost friends and I’ve upset people because something relatively minor has pissed me off and I have completely lost self-control. I can’t control what comes out of my mouth, I don’t have the restraint or the ability to filter what I say. I’ve thrown things, I’ve smashed things. I’ve screamed, caught my breath and screamed again.&nbsp; I’ve promised to do impossible tasks. I’ve spent money I didn’t have because I wanted, no needed those clothes,shoes and that new laptop. I have at least 15 bottles of shampoo in my bathroom, drawers full of make-up all that I very rarely use. The result of a hypomanic episode.</p><p>During some episodes the “fun bit” hasn’t come. Sometimes hypomania for me has had more psychotic and paranoid features such as hearing voices talking about me. My anxiety increases beyond its normal threshold to the point I have panic attacks. I can feel my heart beating so fast that it feels like it’s going to come out of my chest. I shake uncontrollably. And have lost control of my bladder. Yes I’ve actualIy pissed myself fully clothed where I stand. I can actually see my thoughts swirling around above my head so fast that they I can barely read them. I’ve found myself putting my hands over my head and squeezing just to get some sort of relief. Hypomania at some points has led to me trying to, or wanting to kill myself. Not so fun now is it? It’s hard not to get addicted to the euphoria of hypomania. I try to remind myself that there are very real consequences to these episodes when I consider not taking my medication just to feel that euphoria again.</p><p>When it’s all over I’m left to pick up the pieces, to fix (if they are even fixable) the stupid shit I’ve done. Hypomania isn’t fun when it’s over. The depression that comes after hypomania is possibly the worst type of depression. My mind is broken and so is my body. The embarrassment of my behaviour after some of these episodes is awful. I sink lower and lower after every hypomanic episode and it scares me that one day I will really hit the bottom of rock bottom and I’ll never get back out of it. Some of the worst things that have ever happened to me are the result of a hypomanic episode. I’m lucky I’m not dead. Seriously.</p><p>Fortunately, with a combination of medication, psychiatric help and maturing as a person dealing with the depression and hypomania has become easier and I can most of the time diffuse situations or at least deal with the fallout from them better than I have before. &nbsp;Taking diazepam for 7 days at the start of a developing hypomanic episode is necessity for me and can often stop it in its tracks.</p><p>The biggest thing I have learnt after having Bi-Polar is that <span><strong>SLEEP</strong> </span>and <span><strong>STRESS</strong></span> management are key to staying well. When one of those tips the balance, that’s when things start going wrong.</p><p>Although the original idea for this blog was meant to be cathartic release for me. I hope that in some way I can give people a platform to express themselves and the opportunity just to “get it all out” and I hope you feel less alone when reading my posts. Please feel free to engage with me on one of my various social media accounts. Even if it’s just to say Hi or tell me your story.</p><p><img src="https://www.barebipolar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sig1-copy-e1595458758796.png" data-src="https://www.barebipolar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sig1-copy-e1595458758796.png" alt="" width="160" height="76"></p></div>

		<p>I was on <a href="https://www.insideedition.com/zombie-animals-encounters-terrifying-creatures-rise-42966">Inside Edition last week to talk about zombies</a>.</p>
<p>That’s a weird sentence to type.</p>
<p>While the story was dramatic, television clips are notoriously difficult to discuss anything of real significance. I had two main messages I wanted to get across.<strong> One</strong>, that we can’t be sure what these animals are suffering from just by appearance (this message kind of got missed in the clips they chose) and because of that, message <strong>two</strong>: you shouldn’t approach a potentially diseased animal yourself, but instead call animal control or your local wildlife professionals to come help (at least they did include me saying not to approach these animals).</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/lGACWoZL0-PNLWs0LGJsYz8XoSs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WHSNF332IQZR5MZDXT5VKCWWTA.jpg" alt="" width="322" height="410"><figcaption>A “zombie” raccoon, probably infected with canine distemper virus. Photo by Robert Coggeshall.</figcaption></figure>
<p>In all likelihood, most of the animals they showed and that have been recently been <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/zombie-raccoons-are-terrorizing-city-youngstown-ohio-180968704/">“terrorizing” individuals in Youngstown, Ohio</a> are suffering from infection with <a href="https://www.avma.org/public/PetCare/Pages/Canine-Distemper.aspx">canine distemper virus</a>. This is a virus related to human measles, and like measles, is very contagious. From the name, it obviously affects dogs, but isn’t limited to only dogs. It can also infect raccoons, foxes, opossums, ferrets, and even wild <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/extinction-countdown/canine-distemper-could-wipe-out-siberian-tigers/">tigers</a>. Among animals, the distemper virus can be transmitted by bites or simple close contact, so it can spread quickly within groups of animals living together. The infected animals then either recover and develop immunity, or pass away from the infection.</p>
<p>The animals exhibiting “zombie” symptoms like those shown in the clip are just the tip of the iceberg. It’s likely that many other animals in the local population are also ill, but perhaps not dramatically so; like any infectious disease, there will be a spectrum of symptoms in infected individuals, so not every wild animal infected with canine distemper will “go zombie.”</p>
<p>Wildlife authorities have noted that these outbreaks of animals acting like “zombies” happen every few years: the virus will sweep through a population lacking <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-unforgiving-math-that-stops-epidemics-20171026/">herd immunity</a>, infect many of the individuals, and those who are infected but recover will be immune. A few years later, when the population again contains large numbers of susceptible individuals due to births of new animals, the virus can again cause an outbreak—and the cycle continues over and over.</p>
<p>While canine distemper infection doesn’t cause symptoms in humans, <a href="https://www.avma.org/public/Health/Pages/rabies.aspx">rabies absolutely does</a>—and that’s a key reason people need to avoid these animals and leave them to the professionals. Based on the symptoms alone, you can’t tell if an aggressive, strangely-behaving animal is suffering from distemper or rabies. And while distemper isn’t harmful to humans (though it <a href="https://pets.webmd.com/dogs/canine-distemper#1">definitely could be to your dog</a> if they’re not up-to-date on their vaccinations), rabies is almost 100% fatal if not quickly treated with anti-rabies immunoglobulin and prophylactic vaccination. In the rare cases who have survived after symptoms developed, it was only with <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5350a1.htm">extreme interventions</a> which are <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/six-year-old-dies-rabies-after-experimental-treatment-milwaukee-protocol-fails-782168">not always able to be replicated</a>.</p>
<p>Expect to see these epidemics of “zombie animals” on a regular basis in different locations around the country—but don’t try to be a hero. That never turns out well in the movies.</p>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594456981770_322570"><p>The Dodo – endemic to Mauritius, made extinct at some unknown point in the late 1600s (Roberts &amp; Solow 2003, Hume <em>et al</em>. 2004, Cheke 2006) – was a giant, flightless pigeon, closely related to Nicobar pigeons (<em>Caloenas</em>) and crowned pigeons (<em>Goura</em>). This affinity is demonstrated by numerous anatomical details (Fjeldså 1976, Janoo 1996, 2000, Livezey &amp; Zusi 2007, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0253000998?camp=1634&amp;creativeASIN=0253000998&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=tetrazoolo-21" target="_blank"><span>Parish 2013</span></a>) and also by genetics (Shapiro <em>et al</em>. 2002, Pereira <em>et al</em>. 2007). Just knowing about the Dodo’s affinities is useful, since there are a few aspects of Dodo anatomy where we can look to its extant relatives for guidance. Example: obvious sexual dimorphism in plumage (at least, visible to the human eye) is not present in those close living relatives.</p></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594456981770_123254"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594456981770_181526"><div><p>By far the most famous and influential of these are the paintings attributed to Roelandt Savery, in particular the giant 1626 painting which once belonged to writer and artist George Edwards. Supposedly based on a live bird kept in Holland, it’s today at the Natural History Museum, London (<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0007145721?camp=1634&amp;creativeASIN=0007145721&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=tetrazoolo-21" target="_blank"><span>Fuller 2002</span></a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0253000998?camp=1634&amp;creativeASIN=0253000998&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=tetrazoolo-21" target="_blank"><span>Parish 2013</span></a>). Incidentally, we’re not <em>completely</em> sure that Savery really was the creator of this painting but I will – from hereon – assume that he was for the sake of convenience. A second very famous Savery Dodo painting – this time by Roelandt’s nephew, Jan or Hans Savery – is on show at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History and might have been produced in 1631. Regardless, all of these ‘Savery’ Dodo paintings show grey (though read on), chunky, exceedingly bulky, short-legged birds with yellowish wing and tail plumes.</p><p>Despite claims that R. Savery’s 1626 painting was produced from life, it doesn’t match other images which more certainly were and it seems likely that it was based on taxiderm specimens or written accounts. For these reasons it (and other ‘Savery Dodos’) can’t and shouldn’t be taken as providing especially important insights into Dodo appearance or anatomy.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594456981770_187214"><div>

The drawings depict both a dead or stunned Dodo laid out on a table as well as one or more live Dodos in standing pose (Kitchener 1993a, Hume 2003, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0253000998?camp=1634&amp;creativeASIN=0253000998&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=tetrazoolo-21" target="_blank"><span>Parish 2013</span></a>). Another Dodo drawing from the early days of Mauritian discovery and exploration is that featured in the Dutch volume <em>Het Tvveede Boeck</em> of 1601. This reported a 1598 expedition led by Admiral Jacob Corneliszoon van Neck (<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0007145721?camp=1634&amp;creativeASIN=0007145721&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=tetrazoolo-21" target="_blank"><span>Fuller 2002</span></a>, Hume 2006, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0253000998?camp=1634&amp;creativeASIN=0253000998&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=tetrazoolo-21" target="_blank"><span>Parish 2013</span></a>) and hence the Dodo featured therein has often been called the Van Neck Dodo. A very influential illustration and account produced by the French naturalist Carolus Clusius in 1605 – it will be referred to a few times in this article – was apparently copied from a drawing in Van Neck’s journal, but the original has been lost.</p></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594456981770_43525"><div>

Mansur illustrated animals for Emperor Jahangir of the Mughul Empire who kept a menagerie at Surat, India; Jahangir’s scientific curiosity led him to order the creation of technically rigorous works which were meant to be as accurate and detailed as possible (Dissanayake 2004). As we’ll see, Mansur’s Dodo is one of the most significant depictions of the species in life. And, yes, it seemingly means that at least one live Dodo was present in an Indian menagerie during the 1620s.</p><p>The Dodos of Van Neck, Clusius and Savery are essentially the ‘originals’ from which virtually all later Dodos were copied, and both Kitchener (1993a) and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0253000998?camp=1634&amp;creativeASIN=0253000998&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=tetrazoolo-21" target="_blank"><span>Parish (2013)</span></a> produced genealogies showing how subsequent artists based their Dodos on those of these artists. Mansur’s Dodo was not treated in the same way since it was essentially unknown until Ivanov (1958) brought attention to its existence.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594456981770_58449"><div>

Peters sees stuff that no-one else can see, reports findings that no-one else finds, perpetually declares everyone else to be wrong, is vastly prolific, and has been very, very good at sharing and disseminating his stuff online. If Peters were reliable, trustworthy, careful, conscientious, and good at doing science, this would be great, and he would be a significant force for good. </p><p>But Peters is not reliable, or careful, or conscientious, or good at doing science. He is the opposite of those things. And yet he’s on a crusade whereby he aims to share his views – proclaimed by him as representing The Truth – as widely and frequently as possible, all the while decrying the mainstream palaeontological world as if it’s part of a conspiratorial cabal of blinkered elites. Peters is a significant source of miseducation, whose work floods the internet, and who aims to bamboozle those unaware that he’s peddling nonsense.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595584636582_546745"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595526977752_35989"><p>But at some point between the late 1990s and early 2000s, it became clear from his online writings and published articles that Peters had become <em>very strange</em>. Thanks to a unique kind of magic, super-powered vision, he claimed to find hitherto undetected babies, soft-tissue frills, umpteen new anatomical structures <em>and more</em> on pterosaur fossils. These claims were awfully reminiscent of those fringe announcements on the finding of skulls and bits of technology in NASA’s photographs of Mars or the moon, or of Jon-Eric ‘the fruitbat’ Beckjord’s proposals that frames of the Patterson-Gimlin film reveal hidden Bigfoots lurking in the shadows. Today, the Peters of 2020 thinks that at least some of these claims – documented in Peters (2004) and reported at conferences (e.g., the 2003 Society of Vertebrate Paleontology meeting at San Antonio, Texas, the 2006 Flugsaurier meeting at Munich) – should be ignored as “rookie mistakes” or “old laundry”. Making mistakes is part of science, we all do it. But claiming with confidence (in print and at conferences) that you’ve found a ton of incredible stuff that others have not is a red flag, especially when the Peters technique of finding stuff that on-one else can has the vile, distinct stench of pseudoscience about it. And despite arguments that those weird claims of the past were “rookie mistakes” or “old laundry”, the fact is that Peters has never stopped doing whatever it is that he does.</p></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595526977752_41793"><div>

By now, the proverbial cat (a vampire cat, covered in hitherto unseen babies and sporting a <em>Longisquama</em>-like frill of dorsal plumes and with a previously unnoticed long, tassel-tipped tail) was out of the bag, and it became less easy – although not impossible – for Peters to get his stuff into the literature, and presented at conferences. Several of his manuscripts – I believe submitted to such journals as <em>Nature</em> and <em>Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology</em> and mostly aimed at tackling big picture issues of reptile phylogeny – were rejected at around this time (for the record, I have not ever, not once, acted as a reviewer for a Peters paper).</p></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595584636582_203035"><div>

He stepped up his game online, giving us the outpouring that is ReptileEvolution.com and the updated daily, twice daily, thrice daily, infinity-times daily blog The Pterosaur Heresies. Though starting this grand online project with pterosaurs as his focus, Peters has expanded his interest to include reptiles of all sorts, mammals, all tetrapods and FISH as well. To those mammal, bird and fish experts who didn’t care about Peters when he was just ‘that weird pterosaur guy’, I say… well, now you know what it’s like.</p></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595584636582_92439"><div>

Or, restated: why can’t I just mind my own business and leave Peters alone? I will tell you why. If ‘the published literature’ is regarded as a synonym for ‘the accepted canon of human knowledge’, then efforts to curtail the spread of Peters’ ideas (e.g., <a href="http://bigcat.fhsu.edu/biology/cbennett/Bennett-PT-article.pdf" target="_blank"><span>Bennett 2005</span></a>) have been successful. His efforts to instigate paradigm change (that pterosaurs are lepidosaurs, that mammals are archosauromorph reptiles, that bats are civets, that mysticete whales are desmostylians and so on and on and on and on) have failed and are being ignored by working scientists. </p><p>If, however, you think that material shared online – in blog articles and so on – has some impact on what people think worthy of attention or allocation to memory, Peters is successful. Peters is not, dear reader, just doing his own thing in some quiet corner of the internet, beavering away in earnest, minding his own business. He is instead on some kind of eternal crusade to promote promote promote his ideas CEASELESSLY. I can confirm from working with students, the interested public and even other qualified scientists that his stuff is often assumed to be real science, on equal footing with that of those he criticises. All of which means that his efforts need countering. </p><p>My interest in the dissemination of knowledge and public education, and my respect for the due diligence of those people whose work is criticised, admonished or …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></section></div></div></div>

<h2 id="about-rengine">About reNgine</h2>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17223002/86880620-92814300-c10a-11ea-9b27-627f43934221.png" alt=""></p>

<p>reNgine is an automated reconnaissance framework meant for information gathering during penetration testing of web applications. reNgine has customizable scan engines, which can be used to scan the domains, endpoints, or gather information. The beauty of reNgine is that it gathers everything in one place. It has a pipeline of reconnaissance, which is highly customizable.</p>

<p>reNgine can be very useful when you want to perform the reconnaissance, gather endpoints, directory and file search, grab screenshots, and gather all the results in one place.</p>

<p>Suppose, if you have a domain hackerone.com, reNgine can perform the scan based on your scan engines, gather all the results in one place. reNgine makes it possible for use cases like, “I want to search the subdomain which has page title “Dashboard” and has page status as 200, and I quickly want to have a look at the screenshot”.</p>

<p>Another use-case could be, “I want to list all subdomains that use PHP, and the HTTP status is 200!”</p>

<p>On the endpoints part, reNgine is capable of gathering the URL endpoints using tools like <code>gau</code>, <code>hakrawler</code> which gathers URL from many sources like common crawl, Wayback engine, etc.</p>

<p>reNgine also makes it possible for the use case like, “search the URLs that have extension .php and HTTP status is 200!”</p>

<p><strong>Suppose if you are looking for open redirection, you can quickly search for <code>=http</code> and look for HTTP status 30X, this will give high accuracy of open redirection with minimal efforts.</strong></p>

<h3 id="what-it-is-not">What it is not</h3>

<p>reNgine is not a:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Vulnerability scanner!</li>
  <li>Reconnaissance with high accuracy (No! reNgine, uses other open-source tools, to make this pipeline possible. The accuracy and capability of reNgine is also dependent on those tools)</li>
  <li>Speed oriented recon framework with immediate results</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, at this point, reNgine does not give the best of the best result compared to other tools, but reNgine has certainly minimal efforts. Also, I am continuously adding new features. You may help me on this journey by creating a PR filled with new features and bug fixes. Please have a look at the <a href="#contributing">Contributing</a> section before doing so.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple example steps.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine.git
<span>cd </span>rengine
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Docker
    <ul>
      <li>Install docker based on your OS from <a href="https://www.docker.com/get-started">here</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>docker-compose
    <ul>
      <li>Installation instructions for docker-compose from <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">here</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>

<p>Assuming that you have followed the above steps and inside rengine directory</p>
<div><div><pre><code>docker-compose up <span>--build</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The build process may take some time.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you also can run the project with pre-built Docker images (with 2FA enabled, you have to <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens/new">create a new personal access token</a> with <code>read:packages</code> scope):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>docker login docker.pkg.github.com
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once the setup is done, you need to setup the password.</p>

<h3 id="register-account">Register Account</h3>

<p>Once the application is up and running, you need an account for reNgine. This can be easily created using <code>createsuperuser</code> from Django.
Open a new terminal tab, and run the following command:</p>

<p><code>docker exec -it rengine_web_1 python manage.py createsuperuser</code></p>

<p>You may now enter your username and password. Remember to keep a secure password.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>:warning: reNgine does fingerprinting, port scanning, and banner grabbing, which might be illegal in some countries. Please make sure you are authorized to perform reconnaissance on the targeted domain before using this tool.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the installation is successful, then you can run reNgine by using the command</p>


<p>The web application can then be accessed from <a href="http://localhost:8000/">http://localhost:8000</a></p>

<h2 id="vps-https-installation">VPS HTTPS Installation</h2>

<p>If you are considering to install on VPS with https, here is an awesome blog written by @J0_mart <a href="https://www.jomar.fr/posts/2020/07/en-install-rengine-with-nginx-and-ssl-auto-renew/">https://www.jomar.fr/posts/2020/07/en-install-rengine-with-nginx-and-ssl-auto-renew/</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
                
                    <p>Accidents, tragedies, or negative outcomes, all entice a usual reaction: whoâ€™s at fault for this? Who is to blame? Our instinct drives us in that direction. The reasoning seems pretty obvious: if something bad has happened, it must have been because of someone screwed up by being negligent or maybe they were malevolent all along.</p>

<p>However, sometimes thereâ€™s no one we should be blaming. If we think in calm and measured wayâ€”before scapegoatingâ€”it becomes obvious that no oneâ€™s guilty.</p>

<p>I recently saw the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUCfY270l7k">video of killing</a> of Haramabe, a silverback gorilla, by Cincinnati Zoo authorities. The video shows a disoriented, agitated gorilla dragging a toddlerâ€”who had fallen into the enclosure after climbing the 3-foot fenceâ€”with intense force. After deliberating for ten minutes, the Zoo authorities decided to shoot the gorilla. Silverback gorilla is an endangered specie and Harambe was only half-way through his expected lifespan. Naturally, the action invited a ton of angry reactions.</p>

<p>Whoâ€™s to blame?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Some say itâ€™s the zoo authorities. They point out that Harambe wasnâ€™t trying to hurt the child, and a tranquilizer could have been employed instead. The other camp questions the negligence of having a miniature fence.</li>
  <li>Some say itâ€™s the parents (the mother here). For letting the kid out of sight. Many, including prominent stars like Ricky Gervais, have targeted the mother for being an awful parent.</li>
  <li>The more misopedic ones blame the toddler and even question the decision of prioritizing a human life over the other.</li>
</ul>

<p>But thereâ€™s no one to blame if you ascertain all the facts of the case.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Silverback Gorillas are extremely powerful. It could be argued that Harambe didnâ€™t intend to harm the child, but even without effort, Harambe couldâ€™ve seriously hurt him. He was visibly getting more and more upset by the commotion.</li>
  <li>Tranquilizer darts take about ten minutes to work. The gorilla could have potentially injured the child in that time window, especially after being shot at.</li>
  <li>The fence could have been taller, but that only became obvious after the fact. The fence was erected in 1978 and they had no incident of visitors crossing till 2016. Additionally, the zoo passed inspections without being cited even once for the fenceâ€™s height.</li>
  <li>The mother had four kids with her. The toddler skipped fence when she was strapping the other kids to the stroller. Kids, especially if youâ€™ve multiple, canâ€™t be watched 24x7.  Parents are humans, not robots, and they have limited attention span. The fence climbing could have happened in a 10-20 sec window while she was focused on her other kids. (<a href="https://people.com/celebrity/witness-describes-moment-when-4-year-old-climbed-into-gorilla-enclosure/">ref</a>)</li>
  <li>Finally, kids that young are still impervious to dangers of their actions. They are still learning about the world and can unknowingly attempt something very perilous.</li>
</ul>

<p>To me, thereâ€™s no one to blame. It just an unfortunate incident that happened with no one at an obvious fault. You could invoke the moral culpability in keeping animals away from their natural habitat, but that is far removed from the incident.</p>

<hr>

<p>In 2009, Gene Weingarten, touched on a similar subject with his Pulitzer winning story, â€œ<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/fatal-distraction-forgetting-a-child-in-thebackseat-of-a-car-is-a-horrifying-mistake-is-it-a-crime/2014/06/16/8ae0fe3a-f580-11e3-a3a5-42be35962a52_story.html">Fatal Distraction</a>.â€� Around 15-25 times a year, a parentâ€”an â€œotherwise loving and attentive parentâ€�â€”forgets a child in the carâ€™s backseat resulting in a tragic death. Such a horrifying mistake would register as  gross neglect to must of us, but we should ask, can our disgust be more than the â€œlifelong sentence of guiltâ€� that the parent has to bear? This isnâ€™t wilful negligence, itâ€™s a mistake like any other.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Memory is a machine, and it is not flawless. Our conscious mind prioritizes things by importance, but on a cellular level, our memory does not. <strong>If youâ€™re capable of forgetting your cellphone, you are potentially capable of forgetting your child</strong></p>

  <p><em>â€”  David Diamond, professor of molecular physiology, University of South Florida</em></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>The search to blame someone can actually exacerbate the situation as Margarethe Wiersema, professor of management at University of California, observed in her <a href="https://hbr.org/2002/12/holes-at-the-top-why-ceo-firings-backfire">study of CEO firings</a>. Often, because of poor earnings and growth, the board of directors relent under the pressure and dismiss the CEO. However, having a new head doesnâ€™t translate to a turnaround; in fact, the decline could potentially accelerate.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Typically a CEO gets fired not because the board has thoughtfully and deliberately concluded that itâ€™s time for a change at the top but because investors, concerned about poor performance, demand a change. Board members, who have little idea how to address the underlying problems that got their company into trouble in the first place, seek to appease investors in the short term by handing them the CEOâ€™s head on a platter.</p>

  <p>â€¦</p>

  <p>Company performance relative to industry average failed to improve significantly after bringing in a new CEO. And performance lagged behind that of companies with routine CEO successions. I couldnâ€™t find a single measure suggesting that CEO dismissals have a positive effect on corporate performance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Itâ€™s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician%27s_syllogism">politicianâ€™s syllogism</a> at work:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We must do something</li>
  <li>This is something</li>
  <li>Therefore, we must do this.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>Rather than asking whoâ€™s to blame, the more productive thing is to assess a situation from everyoneâ€™s point of view, understand that humans are fallible, and think what we can do improve the future outcomes. Blame is an easy game, but compassion is harder.</p>

<h4>Gout termed as rich man’s disease caused a significant impact in Europe and US&nbsp;history.</h4>

<p>The king of the Holy Roman Empire laid siege on the city of Metz in France. The blockade would have been an instant victory if the king had barged into the city. Severe pain in his feet delayed the king to start an offensive. The delay caused the king to lose the battle. The entire European monarchy crashed with it. The Kings’s pain was due to a disease that impacted European history for years to come. The condition was Gout, also called as Foot grabber.</p>



<p>Gout has been part of the royal disease list for centuries. Gout is inflammation in bone joints and termed as the Arthritis of the rich. Gout has affected a meager portion of the world population but has influenced some of the world’s significant political events. Gout occurs due to excessive meat and alcohol consumption, which is the trademark of Europe’s aristocratic life. Gout is mostly formed in the feet and caused unbearable pain.</p>



<h4>Charles V’s Gout Problem and Fall of&nbsp;Europe:</h4>



<figure><img src="https://interestinghistoryforall.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/00cf6-0pfleiado4dmcexib.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Charles V.Source-Wikipedia</figcaption></figure>



<p>Charles V was the Holy Roman Empire in Europe and waged war against the French and led a successful crusade. During one of his campaigns, Charles V laid siege on the crucial town of Metz in France. Metz was the last major town in French control. Charles V had the habit of exhaustive drinking and meat consumption due to which Gout developed in his leg. On the siege day due to unbearable Gout pain, Charles V stopped the offensive and took rest. During the period of rest, the French reinforced the town. When he recovered and went for an invasion, Charles V lost the battle. After the loss and due to Gout pain Charles V abdicated the throne and split the Holy Roman Empire among his son and brother. Gout brought in the Holy Roman Empire’s downfall and cut Europe into two factions the Spanish Habsburgs and Austrian Habsburgs.</p>

<h4>William Pitt, the Elder, and US Independence:</h4>

<p>William Pitt, the Elder, was a British parliamentarian who influenced the British parliament. He was the grandson of the famous Thomas Diamond Pitt. William had Gout from a young age and skipped college graduation due to it. William Pitt spoke for the rights of the people in the American colony. When the British parliament voted on imposing taxes on tea, William Pitt spoke against the bill. He convinced many members to vote against the law. Unfortunately, on the final day of the debate, William could not attend the session, which passed the tax bill.<br>The high tax on tea created the Boston tea party and ultimately sown the seeds for the American revolution. Had Gout not caught William that day, American independence would not have happened.</p>



<p>Other famous personalities who had Gout are Cosmo de Medici, Benjamin Franklin, and Henry VIII.</p>



<p>Physicians came up with remedies to the Gout issue with stool or glass boot, but the relief was temporary. Gout got its portrayal as a rich man’s disease due to its patient history.</p>

            <p>
	Churches in Montreal are becoming concerned about hosting community groups after being hit with bills for municipal taxes.</p>
<p>
	Joel Coppetiers, the Minister at the Cote des Neiges Presbyterian church, was shocked when his institution first received a municipal tax bill in early 2015.</p>
<p>
	It was "the first indication that something had changed," said Coppetiers.</p>
<p>
	Provincial law exempts churches and manses from paying municipal taxes but Coppetiers was told that if a manse is vacant for several months between ministers, it's taxable.</p>
<p>
	Following that, city officials arrived for an inspection of every room in the church and how they were used.</p>
<p>
	"The indication is there's not an exemption for the church as a whole, there's only an exemption for those areas used for public worship and things directly related to it," said Coppetiers.</p>
<p>
	As a result, many churches in Montreal that host community groups, such as food banks, or Girl Guides or Boy Scouts, are facing mounting tax bills.</p>
<p>
	Coppetiers says the city has changed how it interprets the law.</p>
<p>
	"We're there to care and serve the community and this is part of it," said Coppetiers.</p>
<p>
	Coppetiers says taxes are due even when services are suspended for renovations.</p>
<p>
	The amount owed in taxes can increase swiftly if a church closes its doors.</p>
<p>
	When <a href="http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/trinity-memorial-church-in-ndg-closes-its-doors-1.3302321">Trinity Memorial Church in NDG </a>closed earlier this year, the city started enacting taxes immediately following the last service.</p>
<p>
	As a result churches feel pressured to sell swiftly, with Trinity Memorial being sold to Stanford Properties Group within two months.</p>
<p>
	The issue of places of worship owing taxes and fighting the city's exemptions office came as a surprise to city politicians, including Councillor Peter McQueen.</p>
<p>
	"Already our churches are in danger, they're having a number of financial problems and this is a further low blow," said McQueen.</p>
<p>
	The NDG councillor said his party, Projet Montreal, will study the exemption issue, but he said Montreal's Executive Committee needs to step up.</p>
<p>
	"If we don't do something you're going to see churches closed, churches possibly torn down, heaven forbid, certainly converted away from community use," said McQueen.</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile churches across the island are praying that the city will cease surprising them with taxes they can't afford.</p>

<p>Last Sunday the 19th July 2020 I launched <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a>, a Decentralised, Self-Hosted, Twitter™-like microBlogging Platform.</p>

<p>You can read about my previous <a href="https://www.prologic.blog/2020/07/20/ann-announcing-twtxtnet.html">Announcing twtxt.net post</a>.</p>

<p>Today however I want to share more about <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> and the software behind it <a href="https://github.com/prologic/twtxt">prologic/twtxt</a>; Why I’ve done all this, Why it is important to me and Why you should care.</p>

<p>——</p>

<h2 id="background-story">Background Story</h2>

<p>So before we go into the Why and How, let’s first of all talk about how we go here in the first place.</p>

<p>Back in ~2015 I got head hunted by <a href="https://facebook.com/">Facebook</a>™ and after turning them down twice (<em>three was a bit much!</em>) I accepted the offer and relocated my family to the Bay Area at the Menlo Park HQ ala Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>There I spent ~3.5yrs as a Production Engineer (<em>Google it, or think DevOps/SRE if you’re unfamiliar, but not an apt description</em>).
Meanwhile, while I was <em>trying</em> to be good at my new found ay job, interesting developments were happening in the Social Media industry. Not only was Facebook copping flack for the Cambridge Analytics series of events, but <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>™ was going through some changes as well…</p>

<p>Twitter (_allegedly, although I never really got into Twitter myself…)( was introducing new automated algorithms to change what users on their platform saw on their timeline. This has significant impact on usability of the original intended use of the platform. Naturally <em>some</em> users did not like this and sought out other avenues and solutinos.</p>

<p>One such avenue was <a href="https://github.com/bucket">bucket</a>’s <a href="https://twtxt.readthedocs.org/">twtxt</a>. As I understand it he created a very simple file format specification, a canonical client and unleashed this onto the world! 👏</p>

<p>This was all around ~2016. I was too busy at Facebook to notice :)</p>

<h2 id="present-day-2020">Present Day (2020)</h2>

<p>Fast forward to ~2020 (<em>20th July 2020 to be exact</em>) and a few weeks earlier while I was on holidays I was up late one night just poking around on the Internet (<em>as you do</em>) and looking for “Decentralized Social Media” software. I found quite a few; here are some of the better known ones:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://diasporafoundation.org/">Diaspore</a></li>
<li><a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Some other not so well known ones:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">ScuttleButt</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gnusocial.network/">GNU Social</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This this very blog’s underlying platform <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a> where I now write and publish longer pieces like on my <a href="https://prologic.blog/">Blog</a></p>

<p>There’s even an article on Wired entitled <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/decentralized-social-networks-sound-great-too-bad-theyll-never-work/">Decentralised Social Networks Sound Great. Too Bad They’ll Never Work</a>! Well I’m here to tell you  I formally challenge this and am here to throw the gauntlet down! 🧤</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By the way… I <em>might</em> have caught twtxt sooner back in ~2018 when I got back from the US, but I was also (<em>at that time</em>) too busy moving around, working and trying to get bak into our family home that was still being rented at the time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As I said I launched <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> (<em>the first of what I hope will be many instances</em>) on Sunday the 19th July 2020. I wrote the software <a href="https://github.com/prologic/twtxt">prologic/twtxt</a> in just a few short weekends in my “spare time” and licensed it under the very permissive MIT license.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>📕 If you haven’t already checked it out, created an account and played around. I would encourage you to do so! I run a freely available for anyone to use instance over at <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are non-technical and read this far… Firstly congratulations I like you already! Second, don’t worry, <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> is just a platform to voice/share your thoughts, wisdoms, rambling, short-form text or anything else you want. Think of it like a miniature Facebook or Twitter but without all the advertising or tracking.</p>

<p>I believe in this very simple analogy:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you buy a diary and a Parker™ Pen.
If you then write down your thoughts, wisdoms, experiences, rambling or whatever you want to and share this with others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who owns what you have written? The manufacturer of the paper? The manufacturer of the diary? The manufacturer of the pen?</p>

<p>🤔</p>

<h3 id="so-why-why-should-i-use-twtxt-net">So why? Why should I use twtxt.net?</h3>

<p>You should use <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> if you are the type of person that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enjoys writing and sharing interesting things with others.</li>
<li>Just have interesting things to say in general. Knowledge and Wisdom should be shared!</li>
<li>Are tired of all the issues of all the <strong>BIG</strong> Social Media giants that now plague the f<em>, g</em> and t*.</li>
<li>No longer <em>wish</em> to be the product of Facebook or Twitter and want to <strong>own</strong> your own posts and interactions.</li>
</ul>

<p>See whilst <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> is brand spanking new, there are a few principles that will always remain true even now and going forward:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>NO</strong> User behaviour tracking of any kind.</li>
<li><strong>NO</strong> Advertising anywhere  of any kind.</li>
<li>Absolutely <strong>must</strong> be capable of being self-hosted.</li>
<li>Absolutely <strong>must</strong> allow users to take their data somewhere else and use another <a href="https://twtxt.readthedocs.org/">twtxt</a> client</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="so-how-will-you-make-any-money">So how will you make any money?!</h3>

<p>Good question! Glad you asked. I probably won’t! But one of my primary goals is for users to “Self Host”.</p>

<p>What does this mean?</p>

<p>Well it simply means that you run your own server instance of the software that is behind <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a non-technical person (<em>which would be true of most people as there are only about ~1M software developers in the world</em>) then you’re probably asking yourself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But how do I do this?! I don’t know anything about computers! I just use apps!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well don’t worry. Even through (<em>at the time of writing this</em>) it’s really early days for <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> there are plans for the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>A paid single-user instance of <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> that is <strong>your very own</strong>, personalised to you, with your own domain name but with all the same features.</li>
<li>A paid multi-user instance of <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> with all the same features but more suitable to small communities, schools, villages, neighbourhoods, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>How much will this cost when it becomes available? Short answer is I don’t know. But I can tell you this, it will cost you less than what you are paying for Facebook and Twitter today (<em>remember that even through the f<em>, t</em>, g* are all FREE, there is an implicit cost, which is to say that you are implicitly paying for it as you are their product!</em>).</p>

<p>Let’s just say that once we’re ready to launch single-click hosted instances for the masses that it will cost you next to nothing. And if you can’t pay for your own instance, just use a friend’s instance or jump on any other instance you can find like <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a>!</p>

<h2 id="twtxt-net-today">twtxt.net Today</h2>

<p>So let’s talk about what <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> can do for you today.</p>

<p>Today you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Signup as a new user at <a href="https://twtxt.net/register">https://twtxt.net/register</a></li>
<li>Login at <a href="https://twtx.net/login">https://twtx.net/login</a></li>
<li>Make your first post by entering some prose of wisdom in the text box and hitting Submit!</li>
<li>You can follow other feeds by entering a Nickname for the feed and their URL in <a href="https://twtxt.net/follow">https://twtxt.net/follow</a></li>
<li>You can discover other users on the same instance as you by going to <a href="https://twtxt.net/discover">https://twtxt.net/discover</a></li>
<li>You can find interesting external feeds and even external users outside of the instance you’re on by going to <a href="https://twtxt.net/feeds">https://twtxt.net/feeds</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And most of all. You can have engaging, fun and interesting interactions with all sorts of people! <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> (<em>at the time of writing this</em>) is growing at a rate of ~2-3K requests per day and 3-5 new user signups per day. WOW! 😱</p>

<h2 id="twtxt-net-tomorrow">twtxt.net Tomorrow</h2>

<p>Now there’s still loads more work to do and all of this is happening in “spare time”. No one is paying me or contributors to do any of this. We do this out of the love and kindness of our hearts 💚</p>

<p>Nevertheless progress will continue and here’s what we have planned already:</p>

<ul>
<li>a Native Mobile iPhone / iOS App! 🎉</li>
<li><code>@mentions</code> where you can easily see who has mentioned you in a post (<em>we call them <code>twt</code>s</em>)</li>
<li><code>#hashtag</code> searching where you can see other similar posts that users tag.</li>
<li>Always continuing to improve the UI/UX and overall user experience.</li>
<li>Uploading images/photos! 📷 This will come pretty quickly actually because there is already a demand for this!</li>
<li>Instance&lt;-&gt;Instance interactions. Basically strengthening the first-class decentralised nature of <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a>. 👌</li>
</ul>

<p>——</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>So <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> is a <strong>FREE</strong> new type of Social Media that has a strong focus on Self-Hosting, Decentralisation without any of the bloat, tracking or advertising that we’ve all come to take for granted.</p>

<p>Join us today!</p>

Come, follow me down into the realm of gloom.” Goethe, <em>Faust</em></strong></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">In 1939, <em>Minneapolis Journal </em>photographer David Dornberg went on a “Camera Safari,” as he called it, through a large cave under downtown Minneapolis. He described it as “a ‘lost world,’ weird and spooky—the darkest spot for adventure into which my four years as a Journal cameraman ever led me.” Some may discount this as sensationalistic tripe, but read the testimony of Roger Kehret, a seasoned Minnesota caver with years of experience, in his 1974 booklet, <em>Minnesota Caves of History and Legend</em>: “When cavers think of remote hard to reach caves it brings to mind scenes of high mountains of the Pacific Northwest or the steaming jungles of the Amazon. The most remote and hard to get to cave that I have ever reached is found on Fourth Street near Marquette Avenue in down town Minneapolis, Minnesota.” This chapter describes my own ordeal to reach this lost world.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">Schieks Cave, as it has become known among urban explorers, has also been called “Loop Cave,” “Manhole Cave,” or “Farmers &amp; Mechanics Bank Cave.” It got the name from Schieks Palace Royale, a gentlemen’s club that now occupies the Farmers &amp; Mechanics Bank building, under which the cave is located. Journalist Kay Miller once described the nightclub as “topless above, bottomless below” because of the underlying cave, but there’s no humanly enterable physical connection between them.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">Schieks Cave is the largest natural cave under downtown Minneapolis, extending for a city block through the St. Peter Sandstone. Carl J. Illstrup, city sewer engineer, who discovered the cave in 1904, described it as a “cave shaped like an inverted bowl,” a description that seems puzzling to anyone who has actually been there. (It’s shaped more like a pancake that has gone awry on the griddle, if that helps.) In 1931, an enthusiastic journalist, Fitzsimmons, waxed poetical about “the beauties of the sewer system” and described Illstrup as “the ruler of this fantastic world.” The discovery of the cave in 1904, during which the crews braved “the lethal breath of deadly gases,” is presented as the highpoint of Illstrup’s life.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">The earliest known documentation of Schieks Cave is the 1904 Lund survey, which is good for showing the former “creeks” and “lakes” of the cave. Reportedly, the cave was kept a secret for years because city officials feared the public would think downtown Minneapolis was built on a thin shell that would plunge into a hole in the earth. Another concern was that burglars might have worked undetected and bored directly into the bank’s treasure vaults. By 1921 it was reported that “The entire business portion of the city is built over a series of subterranean lakes and caverns as mysterious and baffling as the Mammoth caves of Kentucky or catacombs of Rome.” The 1929 Lawton survey depicts the cave extensively modified by the construction of piers, walls, and artificial drainage systems. It also shows the 75-foot entrance shaft on Fourth Street and the 15-foot shaft from the cave to the underlying North Minneapolis Tunnel, a sanitary sewer.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;"><img src="http://gregbrick.org/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/DornbergMapLR.28352226_std.jpg" alt="1939 Dornberg map" width="738" height="631" data-mce-src="/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/DornbergMapLR.28352226_std.jpg"></span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">In 1952 the Twin Cities Grotto, local chapter of the National Speleological Society, visited Schieks Cave, and it was written up for the Sunday supplements. The late architectural historian David Gebhard, author of many architectural guidebooks, was a member of this club. In 1983, a successor organization, the Minnesota Speleological Survey (MSS), visited the cave, and their lurid account of the gloomy cave whose walls were black with cockroaches, and the roaring sewer that ran under it, only fired my enthusiasm to get there someday—one way or another. Perhaps even by climbing up from the sewers rather than down from the streets?</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">The earliest published account of someone visiting Schieks Cave without official sanction has been quoted above. In a chapter titled, “The Minnesota Rovers Great Manhole Cave Expedition,” Kehret went on to reveal how the Rovers, an outing club, dressed as sewer workers, surrounded the entrance manhole with barricades, and used a truck-mounted winch to remove the heavy, hexagonal lid (which in recent years has been welded shut). Getting there must have been more than half the fun, however, because Kehret said little about the cave itself, except that it was “almost filled with sand, concrete, pipes and other debris.”</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">In 1993, John and I examined the storm drains under the Minneapolis loop with the hope of getting into Schieks Cave. Located far below street level, the system drains to the Mississippi River by a large outfall in the milling district. With reference to the most famous sewer of Antiquity, it’s the very “Cloaca Maxima” of Minneapolis. Because no connection from the storm drains to the cave, or to the sanitary sewer known to run under the cave, was found, we shelved the project. Shortly thereafter I left for the University of Connecticut, where I did graduate work on barite mines.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">In 1996 a college student, along with several friends, began a series of attempts to get to Schieks Cave. He created a website, perhaps the first of its kind in this area, called “Minneapolis Draining Archive,” where he posted trip reports of these and other adventures. After exploring the storm drains without result, he tried wading upstream in the North Minneapolis Tunnel (NMT). This sanitary sewer, eight feet in diameter, carries the great river of human waste from the Loop, and runs directly under the cave, as noted above.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">NMT is the very gut of Minneapolis. Wading upstream is fatiguing owing to the swift, chest-deep current (2.5 feet per second), and the well-lubricated invert (floor). Occasionally one of them would lose his footing, even to the extent of full immersion in the warm, gray fluid, and get swept back to the starting point. He persevered to the extent of going two city blocks, with four blocks remaining to get to the cave. In desperation, he considered driving climbing pitons into the sewer walls, but nothing came of it. While NMT has been called a lot of things over the years, my favorite was the “Silk Road,” an allusion, you might imagine, to all the little bits of toilet tissue swirling through there. It took an effort to maintain a sense of humor in such grim surroundings.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">In 1999,<em> National Geographic Adventure</em> magazine commissioned a writer to report on urban exploration, which came to focus on the efforts to get to Schieks Cave. By this time I had met him and we agreed to join forces. I advocated an “upstream strategy”: to find a safe entrance to NMT upstream from the cave and “go with the flow,” rather than buck the current. The summer of 1999 was devoted to this task. In keeping with the magazine’s hip, youthful, target audience, however, my critical role in the exploration, without which it would not have succeeded, was to be downgraded to that of a “wizened elder” who “smokes cheap cigars.” All the locations appearing in the photo shoot, for example, were picked by me, and I was the only person who knew how to access them. But I was in my thirties at the time, a bit too long in the tooth for their demographic. By contrast, the youthful explorer was compared with world-renowned physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, apparently for things like crafting a make-shift sewer canoe out of “an old file cabinet.”</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">The first upstream entry point we investigated was the venerable Bassett Creek Tunnel. Running below this storm tunnel for a short distance was a sanitary sewer, the whole thing forming somewhat of a double-decker arrangement. The plan was to drop into the lower tunnel and head downstream to the cave. But upon removing the lids in the floor of the upper tunnel, and allowing the mephitic vapors to exhale, we got cold feet. The sewage just seemed to be moving too fast down there.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">More to be feared, however, was the inferred existence of a waterfall at some point along the sewer line. While at Bassett Creek the sanitary sewer was somewhat near street level, at Schieks Cave, NMT is 90 feet down. Somewhere along the way there had to be a big drop. And the small-scale sewer maps that we had didn’t indicate details of this nature.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">Tracing the sanitary sewer downstream by peeping through the holes on manhole lids, we found a “good lid” farther along, on a little used side street. The sewage was not moving so fast here, but it appeared deeper. Surrounding the manhole with orange cones, we descended a rope ladder and walked downstream. My thigh waders soon overtopped and filled with sewage, so that I appeared to have elephantiasis. Condoms, distended with raw sewage, dangled from the vaults above our heads. The hypothetical waterfall, located near Déjà Vu Nightclub, proved very real. Affixing a safety line to a pipe jutting from the walls, we approached the slippery brink of the cataract and peered into the abyss. I recalled the ending of Edgar Allan Poe’s <em>Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym</em>, where a chasm opened to swallow the hapless explorers.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">This sanitary waterfall marked the beginning of the deep NMT proper. From here, NMT ran under Schieks Cave and then on towards the treatment plant. We saw ladder rungs in the wall of the dropshaft, in the midst of the waterfall. We briefly toyed with the notion of sealing ourselves in trash bags, diverting the waterfall, and descending the ladder, but it all seemed just a bit too weird. Such situations are dangerous for another reason, namely, that the turbulence of the splattering sewage causes deadly gasses to bubble off. We gave up on that approach.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">In August, 1999, we investigated another tributary of NMT, running under the warehouse district. We found good lids situated among deserted construction sites, but here again we faced the daunting prospect of a waterfall. Soon after, the young explorer returned to the manhole with his buddies, descended into the tributary on a …</span></p></div></div></div></div>

        <div>

<p>Last week, my dad was asking me why I was proud of this triangle on my laptop.</p>
<p><img src="https://liamhinzman.com/img/vkTriangle.jpg"></p>
<p>I told him that rendering a triangle is complicated: it took me 3 days, and 1000+ lines of code to create the above image. This just made him more confused.</p>
<p>So I wrote this article explaining what the Vulkan graphics API is, how it works, and everything that goes into rendering a triangle with your GPU.</p>
<h2 id="what-vulkan-is">What Vulkan Is</h2>
<p>Vulkan is a graphics API that is designed to provide an accurate abstraction of how modern graphics processing units (GPUs) work. Unlike OpenGL, Vulkan is very verbose. Every detail related to the graphics API needs to be set up from scratch. The upsides to this are that you only use what you choose to, and you can better understand what’s going on in your application and in doing so achieve much higher performance.</p>
<p>This article is intended to be a concise overview of the fundamentals of Vulkan. It was written for somebody who knew Vulkan but has forgotten many of the details (i.e.&nbsp;future me). Most of the information here comes from the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2/html/vkspec.html">Vulkan 1.2 Spec</a>.</p>
<p>Note: This article uses the <a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Hpp/">C++ bindings</a> for Vulkan</p>
<h2 id="vulkan-in-a-nutshell">Vulkan in a Nutshell</h2>
<p><em>From a bird’s eye view, here’s how a Vulkan application works:</em></p>
<p>Vulkan can access <strong>devices</strong>, which let you control one or more <strong>queues</strong>. Queues are how you send a list of commands to the GPU, and they can be members of one or more <strong>queue families</strong>, each of which can do different things (e.g.&nbsp;draw the vertices of a 3D model).</p>
<p><strong>Command buffers</strong> are how you submit commands to a queue. Device commands are ‘recorded’ to a command buffer through Vulkan API calls, and can then be submitted once or many times (e.g.&nbsp;once every frame) to a queue to be executed.</p>
<p>That’s the TL;DR - now it’s time to dive into the details!</p>
<h2 id="genesis">Genesis</h2>
<p><strong><em>Instances and Devices</em></strong></p>
<p><em>In the beginning there was the Vulkan API. And the API was made flesh through <code>vk::Instance</code>, and from it sprung all per-application state.</em></p>
<p>You initialize Vulkan by creating an instance, which contains application state - information like what version of the Vulkan API you’re using, your application’s name, and which extensions and layers you want to enable. Extensions and layers provide behavior that isn’t included by default in Vulkan, like extended error checking and call logging.</p>
<p>With an instance you can examine the <strong>physical devices</strong> (usually GPUs) that are available. A machine might have multiple physical devices, and each of their properties (such as being a dedicated graphics card) can be inspected.</p>
<p>A common pattern for physical device selection is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>List all of the physical devices</li>
<li>Score each physical device on desired properties</li>
<li>Give physical devices without required properties a score of 0</li>
<li>Pick the physical device with the highest score</li>
</ul>

<p>With a physical device you can create a <strong>logical device</strong>.</p>
<p>A logical device is basically a physical device (which represents a GPU) that is initialized and ready for work. They’re what you use to create resources and <strong>queues</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="making-stuff-happen">Making Stuff Happen</h2>
<p><strong><em>Queues, Command Buffers, and Render Passes</em></strong></p>
<p>A queue is a list of commands that the GPU executes.</p>
<p>Each queue can only have certain types of commands (some can have multiple types, others just one), and this is specified when a queue is created.</p>
<p>The four types of queue operations are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Graphics</strong> —&gt; Drawing the vertices of a model</li>
<li><strong>Compute</strong> —&gt; Ray tracing, cloth simulation</li>
<li><strong>Transfer</strong> —&gt; Loading textures and buffers</li>
<li><strong>Sparse</strong> —&gt; Loading part of a ‘mega-texture’</li>
</ul>
<p>A physical device will give you access to several queues of different <strong>queue families</strong>, and when you create a queue it will be an index to a queue of a matching queue family on the device. Queue families are queues that have the same properties as one another (e.g.&nbsp;perform both graphics and compute operations).</p>
<p>Commands are submitted to queues by first recording a series of commands into a command buffer and then submitting the entire command buffer to a queue with <code>vk::Queue::submit()</code>.</p>
<p>Note: Command buffers are usually re-recorded every frame (and not reused) to account for the change in workload in an application (e.g.&nbsp;drawing a new 3D model after an event).</p>
<p>Also, you can submit multiple command buffers to a single queue. This is useful because it <em>can</em> allow you to ensure that one set of commands from a command buffer completes execution before another command buffer in the queue starts (more on this later), and it allows you to take advantage of multi-core CPUs by recording each of the command buffers in parallel on multiple threads.</p>
<p>Finally, commands recorded in command buffers can perform:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Actions</strong> —&gt; draw, dispatch, clear, copy, query operations etc</li>
<li><strong>State setting</strong> —&gt; bind pipelines / buffers, push constants etc</li>
<li><strong>Synchronization</strong> —&gt; set / wait events, pipeline barriers etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Some commands perform just one of these tasks, while others do several. A <strong>render pass</strong> is needed to execute certain commands, including drawing.</p>
<h3 id="render-passes">Render Passes</h3>
<p>A render pass consists of one or more <strong>subpasses</strong>, along with several <strong>framebuffers</strong>. Framebuffers represent a series of memory attachments (e.g.&nbsp;color, depth etc) that each subpass can read from and write to.</p>
<p>A command in a subpass might write to a color buffer, which will allow for later subpasses / render passes to read from it. This allows for techniques like deferred rendering.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://learnopengl.com/img/advanced-lighting/deferred_g_buffer.png" alt=""><figcaption>Color attachments after initial render pass in deferred rendering (LearnOpenGL)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Deferred rendering is a story for another day, but the gist of it is that you can store most of the geometry information in an initial render pass, and <em>defer</em> expensive rendering operations like lighting for later.</p>
<details>
<summary><b> Example code for recording to a command buffer and render pass </b></summary>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>// Create a command buffer</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a>vk::CommandBuffer cmd;</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4"></a><span>// Start recording to the command buffer and render pass</span></span>
<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5"></a>cmd.begin(vk::CommandBufferBeginInfo());</span>
<span id="cb2-6"><a href="#cb2-6"></a>cmd.beginRenderPass(vk::RenderPassBeginInfo());</span>
<span id="cb2-7"><a href="#cb2-7"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-8"><a href="#cb2-8"></a><span>// Bind a graphics pipeline (covered later)</span></span>
<span id="cb2-9"><a href="#cb2-9"></a>cmd.bindPipeline(vk::PipelineBindPoint::eGraphics, graphicsPipeline);</span>
<span id="cb2-10"><a href="#cb2-10"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-11"><a href="#cb2-11"></a><span>// Bind vertex buffers containing info needed to draw vertices</span></span>
<span id="cb2-12"><a href="#cb2-12"></a>cmd.bindVertexBuffers(<span>0</span>, <span>1</span>, vertexBuffers, offsets);</span>
<span id="cb2-13"><a href="#cb2-13"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-14"><a href="#cb2-14"></a><span>// Draw the buffer currently bound to this command buffer</span></span>
<span id="cb2-15"><a href="#cb2-15"></a>cmd.draw(vertices.size(), <span>1</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>0</span>);</span>
<span id="cb2-16"><a href="#cb2-16"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-17"><a href="#cb2-17"></a><span>// Stop recording to the render pass and command buffer</span></span>
<span id="cb2-18"><a href="#cb2-18"></a>cmd.endRenderPass();</span>
<span id="cb2-19"><a href="#cb2-19"></a>cmd.end();</span></code></pre></div>
</details>
<p>Last thing! Some commands that perform actions (e.g.&nbsp;draw vertices) do so based on the current state (e.g.&nbsp;the currently bound array of vertices) set by commands since the start of the command buffer. This means that in the above code example, <code>cmd.draw()</code> will operate on the current state set by <code>cmd.bindVertex()</code> in the previous line. This “synchronization guarantee”, that one command will finish executing before the next one starts, is usually not true.</p>
<h2 id="synchronization">Synchronization</h2>
<p>GPUs are optimized for operation throughput, and because of this (with a few exceptions) <strong><em>commands are not executed in the order they were recorded in.</em></strong> The first command that performs an action in a command buffer isn’t guaranteed to finish executing before the last action command in that buffer. The first command buffer submitted to a queue won’t necessarily finish any commands before a later command buffer starts. The same thing applies to command buffers submitted on different queues and multiple subpasses.</p>
<p>At places the Vulkan spec is confusing on this topic, but the TL;DR is that this is true unless a <strong>synchronization object</strong> is used (or with state setting commands within a single command buffer).</p>
<p>There are a few different types of synchronization objects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Fences</strong> (GPU to CPU sync) —&gt; EX: ensure there are only two rendered frames at a time in the swap chain (i.e.&nbsp;double buffering)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Semaphores</strong> (GPU to GPU sync across queues) —&gt; EX: wait for frame to finish rendering before presenting it</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Barriers</strong> (Sync within a command buffer / pipeline) –&gt; EX: start compute shader execution as soon as the vertex shader is finished</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Subpass Dependencies</strong> (Sync between subpasses) –&gt; EX: wait for the normal and albedo attachments to complete before starting the lighting rendering subpass.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Synchronization is closely tied to the <strong>graphics pipeline.</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-graphics-pipeline">The Graphics Pipeline</h2>
<p>The graphics pipeline is what takes the meshes and textures of 3D models (along with other information) and turns them into pixels on your 2D screen. Each stage of the graphics pipeline operates on the output of the previous stage.</p>
<p>There are two types of stages in the graphics pipeline: fixed-functions and shaders.</p>
<p><strong>Fixed-functions</strong> complete operations that can be tweaked with parameters, but the way they work is predefined. Anything in the …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A common use case for any software product is the ability to run a certain business logic whenever a particular event gets triggered. This event could occur in the form of a webhook fired by a 3rd party service to your server or it could be generated via your product itself. The point being this event triggers a transaction in your system and the loss of even a single transaction is not acceptable.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>This seems straightforward enough when dealing with a low rate of such events, but if your server receives these events at the rate of 200 requests per second and each of these events require significant resources for processing them, it is no longer a trivial thing to do.</p><p>We had a similar requirement while building our <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/whatsapp-chat-button" target="_blank">product</a> which is a tool that helps e-commerce merchants notify their customers when orders are confirmed/shipped via WhatsApp. To implement this we register webhooks to receive order lifecycle events whenever a new e-commerce store signs up with our product.&nbsp;</p><p>This did not seem like a big deal at first until we released that if we acquire even a handful of stores that have a very high volume of orders, the number of webhooks we will receive is going to increase exponentially and if we need the product to scale, we would have to queue up the events and process them asynchronously instead of processing it the moment we receive a webhook.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Expectations from a message queue system</strong><br></p><p>There are 4 primary things that are needed if you want to queue up messages and process them asynchronously.</p><p>‍<br></p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Monitoring</strong>: A dashboard where you can view all the current asynchronous jobs and make sure all of them are running smoothly and there is no clog anywhere.</li><li><strong>Error handling</strong>: The ability to retry failed transactions without having to receive the event again.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Zero loss</strong>: None of the events must be lost and must stay in the queue until they are picked up.</li><li><strong>Scalability</strong>: If the volume of messages goes up, handling them should be as simple as adding another worker to the pool.</li></ol><p><strong>Available methods for doing this</strong><br></p><p>The above mentioned problem is not something new and has already been solved in many ways. Here are a few that I am aware of.</p><ol role="list"><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/" target="_blank">AWS SQS</a> as the queue and AWS Lambda as the handler for the jobs in the queue.</li><li><a href="https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/" target="_blank">Celery</a> is a great framework that solves exactly this and it has compatibility with AWS SQS, Redis and Rabbit MQ.</li><li><a href="https://python-rq.org/" target="_blank">Python-rq</a> with Redis as the queue.</li></ol><p>I immediately ruled out the first method because it would involve too much vendor lock in with AWS and out of the remaining 2 methods, I personally got a little bit spooked by Celerys documentation as it seems a bit overwhelming for my simple use case of being able to deploy worker programs that pick up items from a queue and process them.</p><p>Therefore I decided to <a href="https://python-rq.org/" target="_blank">go with python-rq</a> as it was something I had previously tinkered with, so let's go through each of the expectations that I listed earlier and see if python-rq satisfied all of them.</p><p><strong>Monitoring</strong><br></p><p>To quote one of the lines from the python-rq documentation, “Monitoring is where RQ shines”.&nbsp; You get access to a dashboard where you can view jobs that are currently being processed, pending jobs and failed jobs.</p><figure id="w-node-2f944d69418b-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f1d0765a977f73edea652de_BbkLnSZEcAQHbsz0e0tZvReFQzpRB1-tVoLDh3cKhIOpqKbD-h7ByCKokqzSMK-KwHnEYlkiQH56Yq4TKg9z5rtKDLO7e4DgCOWWHgn7foxSa_6Lk10DEhBBUsvyG8tnrmcJo8Vl.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>RQ dashboard for viewing status of jobs</figcaption></figure><p>If you do not specify any queue while deploying the service, there is one queue created called “default” and all the jobs you enqueue will go into this queue.&nbsp;</p><p>Alternatively you can define as many queues as you want, and put jobs into the respective queues based on their priority. All of this is very well documented.</p><p>If you need to monitor some more things like how many jobs are queued at a given time in the form of a time series database or the maximum queued jobs within a given time range, you could export these metrics using <a href="https://github.com/mdawar/rq-exporter" target="_blank">rq_exporter</a> and display them on a <a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank">grafana</a> dashboard.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Error handling</strong><br></p><p>Python-RQ has several ways to retry failed jobs, you could specify a retry count while enqueuing the job itself as mentioned in their documentation.&nbsp;</p><p>You could also specify a time interval between each retry if you don’t want the job to be retried immediately.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly you can also specify different time delays between each retry and achieve a system where if a job fails,&nbsp; you retry after 10 minutes and if it fails again, you could retry after 20 minutes, etc.</p><p>Even if you don’t specify any retry count, there is a default safety net built in where the failed jobs go into a “failed” queue and the same is displayed on the dashboard. You can retry them manually by clicking on “Requeue”.</p><p>You can even see the stack trace of the failed job so that you can make changes to the code if required before retrying the job.</p><figure id="w-node-6b3d732c052e-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f1d07659bfb9af7bf8dec02_F7KGjCLUhQ6nGEDjK-qpq4jooON2TyQkDBLzi1ova-tz3zSVAgimJ9mIycGnvHcxcCnAUr0Wl5pIHO7OzVEtJLR2D3go52skcan8DTAkYWA05o1AXUmH4ojKFfbT2qXSPBOUUG79.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Failed jobs displayed on RQ dashboard</figcaption></figure><div><p>Python-rq also allows you to define a custom exception handler at the time of starting your workers which you can use to do stuff like sending an alert to yourself over email/slack whenever there is an exception.&nbsp;</p></div><p><strong>Zero loss</strong><br></p><p>When you restart python-rq it does a warm shutdown where new jobs from the queue are no longer accepted and existing jobs will finish running completely before shutting down the service. This ensures that there is no loss in data.</p><p>The producer program which is responsible for enqueuing the jobs must make sure that as soon as an event is received, it is immediately enqueued before running any other logic and this will ensure that there is no loss due to the producer failing to enqueue a job in time.&nbsp;</p><p>Since all the jobs will be saved in the Redis database and Redis has its own methods for prevention of data loss, this pretty much ensures that all your transactions will be executed.</p><p><strong>Scalability</strong><br></p><p>The Beauty of this setup is that if your application scales and you start receiving too many events, the server responsible for enqueuing the events will not face any lag and the only implication of this is that there might be a lag between the time a job is enqueued and the time it is executed.&nbsp;</p><p>If you need to reduce this lag, all you have to do is deploy another RQ worker that listens on the same Redis queue and the tasks will automatically get shared between all the existing workers that are subscribed to that queue. Based on how your traffic scales, you can keep deploying new workers on new instances without having to change anything else.</p><p><strong>Scheduling tasks with python-rq</strong><br></p><p>An added advantage of this infrastructure is that it also takes care of the case where one has to schedule a task to be executed at a later time. There are of course many ways of achieving this including cron jobs, but having this ability within your queuing infrastructure is very handy because all the other aspects like error handling and monitoring automatically get applied to this as well.&nbsp;</p><p>To add job scheduling abilities to python-rq, you would have to install <a href="https://github.com/rq/rq-scheduler" target="_blank">rq-scheduler</a> and run it as a separate service. This service will take care of picking up jobs that are to be executed at a given point in time and enqueue them into the queue that python-rq listens on.</p><p><strong>Closing notes</strong><br></p><p>For our particular use case, we receive close to 200 transactions per second and because they all go straight into a queue, 99% of these requests have a response time of 25 milliseconds or less.</p><figure id="w-node-2247ea7692bf-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f1d07651bda1c0398075cb6_oDk9wAzBCG3Dmao13tDK-uvkRTWHWk16MZrwMP7IjpnbbKTFElg35xOjtS6KtMfN6epWMPbyH25HySChqv-szF4bu5qGAMeOqxuQyD1Sx3sSwX92G3qdOsR2e09uGv1EnGxSWYW6.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Server response time for enqueing jobs</figcaption></figure><p>As for the performance of the workers, we have currently deployed 5 workers and their capacity based on their free time vs busy time looks something like this.</p><figure id="w-node-bd68bbc03805-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f1d0765b5a619cd968b387a_zlVorXocx5iEHbrrk0QC_84rfs2IvRLyaKmaFUbMYyGXKw6NTApQfqaxkZPRMaMHX19BOo4510pTC4HuaWGpbzhHVnUFsMdV8jk33AQUU6fDdR42Lv-vaI8zHnJwsRWD5l3QiR89.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>RQ&nbsp;worker capacity</figcaption></figure><p>The blue shade represents workers being busy and the rest of the time workers are free.

        <p>With the unveiling of iOS 14 following WWDC 2020, Apple has again updated its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml?changes=latest_minor">Core ML framework</a> with even richer interfaces for training, running, and fine-tuning machine learning models on users’ devices. Among these improvements, neural network models can now  support <a href="https://lukereichold.com/blog/posts/3d-mnist-swift-for-tensorflow/#3d-convolutional-networks">3D convolutional and pooling layers</a>, which are the backbone of many popular video classification models. Today, we’ll walk through <strong>how to take a pre-trained, off-the-shelf video classification model and get it running on iOS!</strong></p>
<p><em>For an incredibly thorough overview of the other new ML advances for Apple platforms introduced this year, I recommend Matthijs Hollemans’ article,  <a href="https://machinethink.net/blog/new-in-apple-machine-learning-2020/">Apple machine learning in 2020: What’s new?</a></em>.</p>
<p>Requirements: Xcode 12.0 beta or later</p>
<p>💡 <strong>Follow along with <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11Cr8w_T53bPLHPvLfZteAxHhtjgBS-LH#scrollTo=cJdRBFjQRYOJ"><strong>the completed Colab notebook</strong></a> and <a href="https://github.com/lukereichold/VisualActionKit/tree/0.1.0"><strong>Swift package on Github</strong></a>.</strong></p>
<h2 id="-fetching-the-pre-trained-model">⬇ Fetching the pre-trained model</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/kinetics-i3d">Inflated 3D Convnet (or I3D)</a> is an architecture created by DeepMind researchers to perform human action classification for videos. We will use the I3D model that has been pre-trained on DeepMind’s <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/kinetics">Kinetics 400 dataset</a>. That is, given a tensor containing frames of a video, this model will output probabilities that the given video belongs to any one of 400 respective action classes (e.g. “air drumming”, “making tea”, “bench pressing”, etc).</p>
<p>As this is a TensorFlow model, our goal is to convert it to an <code>MLModel</code> that can be consumed natively on Apple platforms. To get started, we’ll open up <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11Cr8w_T53bPLHPvLfZteAxHhtjgBS-LH#scrollTo=gTW3l22wUdHD">a new Colab notebook</a> and import <a href="https://github.com/apple/coremltools"><code>coremltools</code></a>, Apple’s Python library for model conversion, editing, and validation.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>!</span>pip install coremltools<span>==</span><span>4.0</span>b1
<span>import</span> coremltools <span>as</span> ct
</code></pre></div><p>Next, we’ll fetch the <code>kinetics-i3d</code> repo and run the included sample evaluation script which loads the pre-rained RGB video classification model, performs an inference on a sample video (so we know that it’s working), and then exports the frozen TensorFlow model as <code>frozen_model.pb</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>!</span>git clone https:<span>/</span><span>/</span>github<span>.</span>com<span>/</span>lukereichold<span>/</span>kinetics<span>-</span>i3d
<span>%</span>cd kinetics<span>-</span>i3d<span>/</span>

<span>!</span>python evaluate_sample<span>.</span>py <span>-</span><span>-</span>eval_type rgb
</code></pre></div><p>Next, we’ll grab the class labels from the repo, where each of the 400 strings corresponds to a potential action in a video.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>with</span> open(<span></span><span>"</span><span>data/label_map.txt</span><span>"</span>) <span>as</span> f:
  class_labels <span>=</span> f<span>.</span>read()<span>.</span>splitlines()

  <span>assert</span> len(class_labels) <span>==</span> <span>400</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="-converting-the-frozen-model-to-core-ml">📲 Converting the frozen model to Core ML</h2>
<p>Finally, we’ll use the <code>coremltools</code> package to convert our frozen TensorFlow model to an <code>mlmodel</code> that can be directly consumed by iOS and macOS applications.</p>
<p>The model expects a tensor of shape <code>(1, NUM_FRAMES, 224, 224, 3)</code>, that is, an array of RGB frames, each of size 224 x 224 and – according to the <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/kinetics-i3d">model’s original specification</a> — pixel values rescaled to between -1 and 1.</p>
<p>We’d like to make the number of frames dynamic, so that our model works for any video containing between, say, 25 and 300 frames. Therefore, we create a <code>TensorType</code> with a flexible shape that will be passed into the converter.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">range_input <span>=</span> ct<span>.</span>TensorType(shape<span>=</span>(<span>1</span>, ct<span>.</span>RangeDim(lower_bound<span>=</span><span>25</span>, upper_bound<span>=</span><span>300</span>, default<span>=</span><span>250</span>), <span>224</span>, <span>224</span>, <span>3</span>))
</code></pre></div><p>Also, to make using our classifier model easier to consume, we tell the model about our explicit class labels so that these are explicitly visible within Xcode.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">config <span>=</span> ct<span>.</span>ClassifierConfig(class_labels)

<span># This is where the magic happens:</span>
mlmodel <span>=</span> ct<span>.</span>convert(<span></span><span>"</span><span>kinetics-i3d/frozen_model.pb</span><span>"</span>, source<span>=</span><span></span><span>'</span><span>tensorflow</span><span>'</span>, classifier_config<span>=</span>config, inputs<span>=</span>[range_input])
</code></pre></div><p>We can also choose to add additional metadata to our model:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span># Optionally, add metadata to be visible in Xcode.</span>
mlmodel<span>.</span>license <span>=</span> <span></span><span>"</span><span>Apache-2.0 License</span><span>"</span>
mlmodel<span>.</span>author <span>=</span> <span></span><span>"</span><span>Google Inc.</span><span>"</span>
mlmodel<span>.</span>version <span>=</span> <span></span><span>"</span><span>1.0</span><span>"</span>
mlmodel<span>.</span>short_description <span>=</span> <span></span><span>"</span><span>Convolutional neural network performing human action recognition on video data, trained on the Kinetics 400 dataset.</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>🎉 With the conversion successfully performed, we’ll save our new <code>mlmodel</code> to disk! It’s now ready to be imported into an Xcode project.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">mlmodel<span>.</span>save(<span></span><span>'</span><span>kinetics_i3d.mlmodel</span><span>'</span>)
</code></pre></div><figure>
    <img src="https://lukereichold.com/blog/Kinetics_Xcode_MLModel.png"> 
</figure>

<h2 id="-consuming-the-model-with-visualactionkit">📦 Consuming the model with VisualActionKit</h2>
<p>As of Swift 5.3, we’re now able to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/bundling_resources_with_a_swift_package">bundle resources with a Swift package</a>, so <a href="https://github.com/lukereichold/VisualActionKit"><code>VisualActionKit</code></a> was created to leverage this new functionality by effectively acting as a convenience wrapper around our <code>kinetics_i3d.mlmodel</code>. It offers the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accepts an <code>AVAsset</code> as input</li>
<li>Pre-processes the asset’s data into a format the model expects, including resizing each frame of the video to 224 x 224 pixels using the <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/kinetics-i3d">custom resizing strategy outlined in original I3D model repo</a>.</li>
<li>Builds an <code>MLMultiArray</code> tensor containing the asset data</li>
<li>Feeds the input tensor into our model and asynchronously returns the resulting predictions.</li>
</ul>
<p>To install this package for use in our own apps, we add the following to our app’s <code>Package.swift</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="swift"><span>let</span> package = Package(
    ...
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: <span>"</span><span>https://github.com/lukereichold/VisualActionKit.git</span><span>"</span>, from: <span>"</span><span>0.1.0</span><span>"</span>)
    ],
    ...
)
</code></pre></div><p>Now, we can perform action classifications on any provided videos, regardless of the source or input format! Here’s some example usage:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="swift"><span>import</span> <span>VisualActionKit</span>

<span>let</span> url = Bundle.module.url(forResource: <span>"</span><span>writing</span><span>"</span>, withExtension: <span>"</span><span>mp4</span><span>"</span>)
<span>let</span> asset = AVAsset(url: url)

<span>try</span> Classifier.shared.classify(asset) { predictions <span>in</span>
    print(predictions)
    <span>//</span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>l</span><span>a</span><span>s</span><span>s</span><span>L</span><span>a</span><span>b</span><span>e</span><span>l</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>w</span><span>r</span><span>i</span><span>t</span><span>i</span><span>n</span><span>g</span><span>"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>p</span><span>r</span><span>o</span><span>b</span><span>a</span><span>b</span><span>i</span><span>l</span><span>i</span><span>t</span><span>y</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>.</span><span>9</span><span>9</span><span>7</span><span>8</span><span>8</span><span>1</span><span>2</span><span>3</span><span>3</span><span>6</span><span>9</span><span>2</span><span>1</span><span>6</span><span>9</span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>And that’s it!</p>
<p><strong>Outside of this specific action classification model, we can use these same steps to convert any arbitrary pre-trained model</strong> to run on Apple platforms by using <code>coremltools v4</code>.</p>
<p>Additionally, different than what we did here, if we were interested in <em>training our own action classifier from scratch</em> – without touching any Python or model conversion code – we also have ability to do so now. For more info, I recommend checking out the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10043/">2020 WWDC session covering Create ML</a>. Until next time!</p>

																				<p>HANOI: Vietnam has detected its first locally transmitted case of coronavirus in nearly 100 days, authorities said on Saturday, in a country whose swift and full lockdown won praise for controlling the spread of the disease.</p><p>“Patient 416” is a 57-year-old retired Vietnamese man in the southern city of Danang, and the first case of community transmission since April 16.</p>
<p>Local health officials have tested 105 people who had been in close contact with him, the Ministry of Health said.</p>
<p>The man had taken his mother to a hospital in the days before after showing symptoms of the sickness, authorities said, but gave no confirmation of how he was infected in a country where the virus appeared to have been stamped out for several months.</p>
<p>Vietnam has not recorded a single death from Covid-19.</p>
<p>“The patient is currently on ventilator support due to respiratory failure,” the ministry said, adding that his family believe his contacts with others were limited.</p>
<p>“He didn’t go out of the city and only stayed at home to look after his grandchild and interact with neighbours, he didn’t make contact with strangers,” it said.</p>
<p>Danang has been packed with local tourists returning to its beaches and restaurants since Vietnam lifted its lockdown.</p>
<p>Despite sharing a long, ungovernable border with China, Vietnam has recorded just 416 virus cases, including the latest from Danang.</p>
<p>Communist authorities were quick to lock down the country after the virus emerged in China, with a rigorous state quarantine and contact-tracing system put in place.</p>
<p>International flights remain strictly limited with a two-week mandatory quarantine laid out for visitors.</p>
<p>Some analysts say the tough response to the virus will help the economy as foreign investment and local consumer confidence bounces back.</p>									</div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
  Years ago, a colleague of mine read an article on Google's bitpacking algorithm for storing indexes and an idea was
  born to create a standalone text index and search solution (similar to Apache Lucene). This idea was brought to life
  in a C++ application called <a href="https://github.com/wheresvic/zsearch">Zsearch</a>. In hindsight it was a little
  bit ahead of its time as a few years later we saw the emergence of a more powerful Elasticsearch that did all that
  Zsearch could do + a lot more. Anyways, this is a story of how we hunted down a memory leak in our application.
</p>

<div>
  <p><a href="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/020-c++-memory-leak.png">
    <img alt="" src="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/020-c++-memory-leak.png">
  </a></p><p>
    Can you find the leak?
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  The idea behind Zsearch was to see how big of an index we could fit into ram with the data being stored in a key/value
  database, which in our implementation was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LevelDB">leveldb</a>. Since RAM was a
  precious commodity back in the day, we really wanted to find the right balance between keeping all of our data
  structures in RAM vs. leveldb. During our initial load testing on a linux box, we found a linear memory growth and
  therefore suspected a memory leak. We then tried to find a memory leak using the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>running a load test in a function and calling the function multiple times to test memory usage</li>
  <li>logging in destructors to check whether objects were being deallocated</li>
  <li>debugging the application using valgrind</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Unfortunately for us, there were no memory leaks detected and eventually when testing on a mac, we found that memory
  stabilized at the expected peak. We therefore concluded that it was just the linux memory allocator that was acting
  weird. In reality, the memory allocator was doing what it was supposed to do but it did give us a good lead regarding
  how some of the C++ standard library was implemented. It turns out that one of our threads was making copies of an stl
  Map, which is ridiculously inefficient and something that we ended up reworking to keep our memory consumption on
  point :).

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>The four noble truths in Buddhism forms the core of the Buddha’s teachings. These are explained in the very first sermon delivered by Buddha, known as&nbsp;<em>dhammacakkappavattana sutta</em>, which in English loosely translates to, “Settings the wheel of dhamma or the truth in motion.”</p> <p>Understanding <strong>the four noble truths</strong> is a vast subject that needs a detailed and thorough explanation, and it’s impossible to cover it in a single blog post. However, the information I present here will serve as an introductory text for those who wish to understand Buddha’s teachings.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-box-3"></span></p><p>What differentiates Buddha’s teachings from others is that he mentions that his teachings should be understood through direct experience rather than simply believing what he says.</p><p>The experiences that he talks about can be verified through different mindfulness practices and meditations. These find mention in the texts (<em>suttas</em>) and practiced by a lot of people all across the world.</p><p>Four noble truths form the foundation of a deep-rooted philosophy that can be applied to daily practical life. The primary focus of his teachings is on the&nbsp;<em>here and now</em>. Although these teaching were delivered sometime around 500 BCE, they have stood the test of time and are still applicable today.</p><p>At first glance, you may find Buddhism to be very pessimistic, as it starts with the concept of dukkha or suffering. Dukkha is a word of the Pali language, which is a combination of two words:&nbsp;<em>du</em>&nbsp;means “hard,” and&nbsp;<em>kkha</em>&nbsp;means “to endure.”<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-medrectangle-3"></span></p><p>Translation of dukkha in English, referred to as the suffering, is a gross oversimplification of the term. Unfortunately, there is no direct equivalent in the English language. It has a much deeper meaning, which we shall explore next.</p><h2><span id="The_First_Noble_Truth_There_is_Suffering_or_Dukkha"></span>The First Noble Truth: There is Suffering or Dukkha<span></span></h2><p>The word dukkha is much more subtle than the English word suffering. It constitutes injury, sickness, old age, mental pain, death, sorrow, grief, anguish, and more. It further includes minor frustrations such as disappointments, dissatisfactions, and irritations encountered in daily life.</p><p>It also includes even the most subtle sources of stress like:</p><ul><li>Having to work for longer hours than usual occasionally.</li><li>Not being appropriately apricated for the efforts put into a piece of work.</li><li>Not being correctly greeted by a friend or a colleague at work.</li><li>Having to give more than you receive in a relationship.</li><li>Being rudely spoken to in a demeaning tone.</li><li>Being made fun of in a covert manner.</li><li>Getting irritated standing and waiting in a queue for a cup of coffee.</li><li>Frustration when the server at the coffee shop hands you a latte instead of the cappuccino you asked.</li></ul><p>I can go on and on, but you get the idea. All of this is dukkha. Now you may argue that this is just a normal part of daily living. How can you call it dukkha or suffering? It happens to all of us, and it’s normal, right?</p><p>You may argue that the real dukkha is passing away of a loved one, or losing a job overnight, or losing all of your income because of the collapse of the economy, or getting a divorce. These are more pressing matters. And yes! You’re right. All of the above are dukkha.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p><p>But here’s what most people don’t understand. The minor frustrations and dissatisfaction that we encounter in our daily lives have a cumulative adverse effect on our psyche. It grows very slowly in a subtle manner.</p><p>While the death of a loved one hurts a lot initially, the wounds heal with time. The created void may never go, but eventually, much of it is filled up with time. However, the subtle injuries caused to our psyche go undetected in many of the cases.</p><p>Over time, these frustrations get accumulated to such an extent that one resorts to ending one’s life to escape the pain. The problem is that we have normalized ailments like stress, anxiety, and depression, as a part of daily life.</p><p>For example, you might argue that losing a job is much worse than being rudely spoken too. Now, this would depend on your personality.</p><p>But in general, I have observed that people soon forget about the hardships they face during the times of unemployment. But even after years, they still remember the incident where they were ill-treated or rudely spoken too.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-box-4"></span></p><p>Once you get a new job, you forget about the pain of losing your old job. But the incidents of offensive and demeaning behaviors go directly into your subconscious.</p><p>These get accumulated over time and create great mental suffering, and sometimes even manifest as a disease in the physical body.</p><p>Again, you may argue that one cannot escape these unpleasantries of life. And yes! You are right again. But the question is – How much do you intend to suffer these unpleasantries? What we call as ups and downs of life are merely just events. There’s nothing good or bad about them.</p><p>Yet we suffer! And still, continue to suffer.</p><p>Buddha explains that there are three kinds of dukkhas:</p><ol><li>The first is simple to understand suffering, like sickness, injury, old age, death, grief, despair, sorrow, etc. It includes both physical and mental pain. We have already covered this kind of suffering above.</li><li>There is a second kind of suffering that is caused by change. Everything is subject to change and finally comes to an end. There is no such thing as a permanency. However, the mind craves for permanency, and therefore, the suffering arises. For example, expecting secure attachments in relationships, friendships, work, etc.,  results in unhappiness.</li><li>Finally, the third kind of suffering buddha talks about is suffering due to the conditioned states. The word used for this suffering is “<em>Sankara.”</em>&nbsp;Unfortunately, there is no parallel English word that can describe it. There are five conditioned states, also known as the five aggregates, or&nbsp;<em>skandhas</em>, where one is physical, and the other four are mental.</li></ol><p>Now here’s something to think. If you notice carefully, there’s a contradiction between the statement of the first noble truth and the fourth noble truth.</p><p>The first noble truth says that all in this world is suffering, while the fourth noble truth says that there is a way out of it. How can both of these statements be true?</p><p>You see, the statement of the first noble truth is not an absolute, because the dukkha is born out of ignorance or&nbsp;<em>avidya</em>. Hence, one perceives this world as dukkha. The understanding of the fourth noble truth enables us to experience the world as it is.</p><p>Now that we know what dukkha is let’s get to the next section: the origin of suffering.</p><h2><span id="The_Second_Noble_Truth_%E2%80%93_The_Origin_of_Suffering"></span>The Second Noble Truth – The Origin of Suffering<span></span></h2><p>The origin of suffering is attachment (or L<em>obha</em>) to three kinds of cravings, also known as Tanha (or Trishna in Sanskrit).</p><h3><span id="The_Kama_Tanha_Craving_for_Sensory_Pleasures"></span>The Kama Tanha: Craving for Sensory Pleasures<span></span></h3><p>This kind of craving or thirst comes with the attachment to sensory pleasures. We always seek things that excite our senses. For example, we get exciting seeing a nice car, and a strong desire to acquire it arises from within. In Buddhism, this is the beginning of dukkha.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-large-leaderboard-2"></span></p><p>Anything that satisfies the craving of the five senses: vision, smell, hearing, taste, and touch – is Kama Tanha. The main reason behind this is that these cravings only give temporary satisfaction.</p><p>The moment you set your attention to sensory pleasure objects, that very moment marks the beginning of suffering. The problem with this kind of craving is that it is insatiable. The more you have, the more you want.</p><p>Another example would be eating your favorite food or dessert. Even after you’ve finished eating, you crave more. For some, this craving comes back after a day or two, while for others, it comes back instantly.</p><p>However, the past conditioning of the mind is so intense that we do not see anything wrong with it. A few minutes of compulsive behavior now and then, generally speaking, creates long term health consequences.</p><h3><span id="The_Bhava_Tanha_Sense_of_Wanting_To_Become_Something"></span>The Bhava Tanha: Sense of Wanting To Become Something<span></span></h3><p>Bhava Tanha is the desire to achieve permanence in some way. One example would be the desire to continue in the heavenly realms as consciousness after death. In this case, the attachment to life and existence is so high that the very thought of not existing after death scares people.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-leader-1"></span></p><p>Similarly, becoming a monk with the desire to attain enlightenment is also Bhava Tanha. Practicing meditation, chanting, reciting mantras, performing rituals in the desire to achieve the&nbsp;<em>nirvana</em>&nbsp;(the freedom from the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth) is again Bhava Tanha.</p><p>It is easy to misunderstand this Tanha. For example, when I started my spiritual practice a couple of years ago, I found myself falling into this trap.</p><p>As I read more into the philosophical aspects of these scriptures, I was so impressed that I immediately started giving sermons to the people around me, even when they didn’t ask for it.</p><p>I had built such strong identifications with these philosophical ideas that I used to get upset when people showed disinterest.</p><p>But my thirst for being the “most knowledgeable” and “all-knowing” had blinded me. I was always keeping a check on how other people perceived me. And I didn’t like it when people disagreed with my ideas.</p><p>What I realized was that I had fallen into the same worldly trap once again. I was indirectly seeking recognition as a spiritual teacher. The desire to be known as the great teacher was deluding me. This desire for being recognized and praised is also Bhava Tanha.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-netboard-2"></span></p><h3><span id="The_Vibhava_Tanha_Desire_To_Get_Rid_of_Things"></span>The Vibhava Tanha: Desire To Get Rid of Things<span></span></h3><p>There is another type of Tanha that is the exact opposite of Bhava Tanha. It is known as Vibhava Tanha, that is the desire to get rid of things.</p><p>This craving generally happens when we fail in our endeavors, such as building a profitable business or attaining spiritual enlightenment. We quickly get disillusioned by the present circumstances and become opposed to it, believing it to be the root cause of our suffering.</p><p>Therefore, we create a desire to get rid of things that leads to unhappiness. For example, it is seen that people who get disillusioned with money and fame turn towards spirituality in search of solace. The problem is that they create another desire to seek peace in …</p></div></div>

<h2><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadavlev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nadav Lev</a> is far from your average VP of R&amp;D</strong></h2>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><em>Nadav, pictured left, with his dev team celebrating an FC Barcelona win in Barcelona on the Axonius company retreat.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>His first “job” writing code was in the elite Israeli military intelligence agency <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_8200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unit 8200</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similar in function to the United States NSA, 8200 has been called&nbsp; “the foremost technical intelligence agency in the world.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every Israeli serves in the military after high school. Only a select few get into 8200.</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>I’ve been working with Nadav for about 15 months. I knew right away he was different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His brain moves fast and his speech is efficient – even when speaking with me in English which is his second language. He’s tough like you would expect from a military man. But also warm. After his team had been using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://linearb.io/" target="_blank">LinearB</a> for a few months, he would ask me <em>“do you want this feedback the Israeli way or the American way?”</em> I’m pretty sure he reserves the “Israeli way” for people he trusts so I chose to take it as a compliment 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p>His approach to building elite dev teams is different too. He’s not afraid to run his own playbook.</p>







<h3><strong>“Elite” software development team defined&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Before we get into Nadav’s leadership and team building secrets, it helps to understand how he thinks about elite teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Nadav’s top 6 not-so-obvious characteristics of an elite dev team:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>The team exhausts themselves to find the best solution to problems, not just any solution</li><li>“Automation-first” is built into the culture and day-to-day decision making of everything</li><li>Important ideas and steps get documented with a high level of quality and reverence&nbsp;</li><li>Discussions are mostly about the future, sometimes about the present, and rarely about past&nbsp;</li><li>When mistakes are made the first instinct is to create new process (not accuse)&nbsp;</li><li>They <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://linearb.io/blog/how-to-introduce-data-driven-culture-to-your-dev-team/" target="_blank">align engineering metrics to business goals</a>&nbsp;</li></ul>



<figure><blockquote><p>His #1 characteristic of a great team: <strong>They make other teams around them better.&nbsp;</strong></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Nadav played basketball growing up. He talks about great dev teams the way basketball analysts describe great point guards. <em>“Their play and their leadership make everyone around them better.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><em>Steph, Kemba, and Dame are three of the best.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>“It’s also important to look at the elite team through the eyes of the developer.”</em> Nadav said. <em>“Not everyone knows how it feels.” </em>Nadav pointed out some not-so-obvious things that feel differently about being a member of an elite dev team:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>You can be yourself and admit your mistakes freely without fear&nbsp;</li><li>It feels like everyone on the team is smarter than you – in a good way</li><li>Teammates behave the same to each other when the manager is not around</li><li>Teammates are regularly solving problems for you before you know you have one</li><li>Every time CI is not perfectly green, by the time you notice, someone is already fixing it</li></ul>







<h3><strong>Journey from top secret to top start-up</strong></h3>



<figure><p><strong>ALERT: </strong>Nadav’s story and secrets outline an actionable playbook for the following audiences:&nbsp;<br><strong>➜</strong> Developers looking for the path to get <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://linearb.io/blog/promoted-from-dev-to-team-lead-8-things-they-didnt-tell-me/" target="_blank">promoted to team lead</a><br><strong>➜</strong> Engineering leaders getting ready to scale up their existing team<br><strong>➜</strong> Engineering leaders coming in to build a new team from scratch<br><strong>➜</strong> Dev teams looking to advance from good to great</p></figure>



<p>Today, Nadav is Vice President of Research &amp; Development for the hot security start-up <a href="https://www.axonius.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Axonius</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was curious about his journey to get there so I asked him about his first project in 8200. He gave me a wry smile and said <em>“<strong>classified</strong>.”</em> It involved writing code and he was by himself. That’s all he could tell me without killing me 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>It must have gone well because after that first project he got to choose what he wanted to work on next and they assigned a second person to help him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It continued like that for a while. He kept impressing his bosses with cool, top secret tech. They kept assigning more people to help him on his next project.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“I started almost every team I was on but was never the formal leader. I got offers to be a team lead but I refused. <strong>I was having too much fun doing cool, hands-on shit</strong>.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Why did he keep moving from project to project? If the project went well, why not stay on to maintain it? <em>“<strong>Builders gotta build</strong>.<strong>”</strong></em>  Yes. They surely do 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nadav stayed with his unit for 6 years – double the required term of 3 years. During that time he met <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deansysman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dean Sysman</a>. Later, when Dean was CTO of a security start-up called Cymmetria, he recruited him to join.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“The final project I started in the army eventually had 50 people working on it. I felt great about what I accomplished and I was ready for a different challenge.”</em> It was time to build something new. He joined Cymmetria as senior developer.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Early on, I figured out that while we have awesome technologists, probably among the brightest in the world, <strong>no one knew how to manage development, release, and write good code. So I took charge</strong>.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sound familiar? This time when Nadav was offered the role of team lead he took it. <em>“The change was minimal. I was already documenting all of our sprint processes, leading our ceremonies, our testing approach… doing it de facto.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I asked if he liked being a lead, his eyes lit up and he got closer to the camera.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>He liked it. They raised series A funding and he scaled the dev team from 2 to 10. After three years they had built every feature on their wish list and the company was succeeding. Nadav wanted a new project and decided it was time to move on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eventually, he got in touch with Dean Sysman again who was now CEO of a new security start-up called Axonius. Dean didn’t want Nadav to be a dev or team lead. He wanted him to be his VP of R&amp;D.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Things moved even faster this time. In the 24 months after Nadav joined, Axonius exploded:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>The number of people in Axonius grew by 5X</li><li>Nadav scaled the number of people in R&amp;D by 5X</li><li>They won the <a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/about/press-releases/axonius-named-most-innovative-startup-at-2019-rsa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coveted RSAC most innovative start-up award</a></li><li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/axonius-nabs-58m-for-its-cybersecurity-focused-network-asset-management-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">They raised a whopping $95 million dollars</a> from top-tier investors&nbsp;</li></ul>







<h2><strong>7 secrets from 8200 for building elite dev teams</strong></h2>



<p>Naturally, after hearing this impressive story, I asked Nadav what he learned on the journey. Many of his fundamental beliefs for building and scaling teams trace back to his days in 8200.</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>**Name Redacted**, Captain Nadav Lev, and **Name Redacted**</figcaption></figure>







<h3><strong>Secret #1: Learn to lead without a mandate or official title&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Leading people without title or authority…&nbsp; Easy to say. Incredibly hard to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“I had to learn to get developers to do what I think was right without formal authority over them.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>So how exactly does he do it?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Nadav explains indirect leadership and how it can help you build teams and get promoted.</em></strong></p>



<iframe width="560" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HjI5uUuV6Qw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>







<h3><strong>Secret #2: “If you can’t stand the heat then don’t get into the kitchen.”&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Part of leading, especially when you don’t have the title, is putting in the work. <em>“Initially, at Cymmetria, I was doing my job plus creating process documents, writing training guides, building automation, helping everyone… It worked for me in the army so I did it again.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Isn’t that a lot of hours? I asked.<strong> </strong><em>“If you can’t stand the heat then don’t get into the kitchen.”</em></p>



<p>Ladies and gentlemen, that was Nadav giving it to me the “Israeli way” 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Nadav shares the truth about how much time indirect leadership takes.</em></strong></p>



<iframe width="560" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NaJcEtRYdVI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>







<h3><strong>Secret #3: The smarter the person, the more “why” matters&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>According to Nadav <em>“It’s easier to influence average employees. They’re more likely to follow your requests on face value. Your best people are actually harder to manage because they will push back if they don’t understand why you’re asking them to do something.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Nadav explains how to manage highly intelligent people using “why”</em></strong></p>



<iframe width="560" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yH9OBaGysZ4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>







<h3><strong>Secret #4: Become great at every job yourself before you hire anyone&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p><em>“I had a boss in the army tell me ‘if you want to be the best leader you can be, you must know the job of every person you work with, better than that person.”</em></p>



<p><em>“I was furious with this because it contradicted every leadership idea I knew of.”</em> I get it. I can think of about eight Harvard Business Review articles I’ve read that might disagree.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But over time Nadav saw the merit in this approach. Remember, your best employees will push back until they know why 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nadav explains <em>“In order to work with people effectively you have to understand them completely. In order to understand them, you have to understand their job. What are their difficulties? What are they trying to achieve? How are they being measured? How do they perceive you? If you walk a mile in their shoes, you will find that understanding them becomes much easier.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Now I understand. It’s not about control. It’s about empathy. It also doesn’t mean you have to DO every job better than the people that work for you. You just have to KNOW every job better. Like a coach of a basketball team. They understand what great looks like even if they never played at a high level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Nadav started at Axonius, he took this idea to the extreme, and started his tenure there in the most contrarian way I can imagine.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“My plan was to spend my first few weeks meeting everyone, learning, getting comfortable with the people. However, I realized that if I do that, I won’t have the time then to build all the processes and infrastructure we need. So I discarded my initial plan and put my heart and soul into personally building everything our team needed to succeed.”</em> </p>



<p>In two weeks he:</p>



<ul><li>Wrote 200 pages of code for an end-to-end, automated product testing mechanism</li><li>Integrated coding standard enforcement tools for consistency and shorter reviews.&nbsp;</li><li>Remodeled the Confluence knowledge base to make it easier to find stuff.&nbsp;</li><li>Wrote a guide instructing how to set up a new environment.&nbsp;</li><li>Configured Jira for maximum ease and transparency.&nbsp;</li><li>Wrote a 20 page training program from scratch.</li></ul>







<p>He literally told the CEO <em>“I’m going to start but please don’t put me in charge of the team yet.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is that crazy or genius? Nadav argues it was the best thing he could have done.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>

<p><span>Millions of users use Uber’s applications everyday across the globe, accessing seamless transportation or meal delivery at the push of a button. To achieve this accessibility at scale, our mobile apps require low-latency and highly reliable network communication, regardless of where customers use our services.</span></p>
<p><span>The network communication for all of Uber’s mobile applications are powered by the edge and the mobile networking infrastructures. The edge infrastructure provides secure connectivity for the HTTPS traffic originating from the mobile apps to the backend services. Uber’s edge infrastructure combines the global presence of public cloud platforms that help reduce app latencies with the additional ability to fallback to our own managed data-centers when required for enhanced reliability.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On the mobile side, a core component of our networking stack is the failure handler that intelligently routes all mobile traffic from our applications to the edge infrastructure. Uber’s failure handler was designed as a finite state machine (FSM) to ensure that the traffic sent via cloud infrastructure is maximized. During times when the cloud infrastructure is unreachable, the failover handler dynamically re-routes the traffic directly to Uber’s data centers without significantly impacting the user’s experience.</span></p>
<p><span>After rolling out the failover handler at Uber, we witnessed a 25-30 percent reduction in tail-end latencies for the HTTPS traffic when compared to previous solutions. The failover handler has also ensured reasonably low error rates for the HTTPS traffic during periods of outages faced by the public cloud infrastructure. Combined, these performance improvements have led to better user experiences for markets worldwide.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In this article, we share the challenges faced in designing the mobile failover handler for Uber’s applications, and how the design evolved as we operationalized the system across our users globally.</span></p>

<h2><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure</span></h2>
<p><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure comprises front-end proxy servers that terminate secure TLS over </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol"><span>TCP</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC"><span>QUIC</span></a><span> connections from the mobile apps. The HTTPS traffic originating from the mobile apps over these connections are then forwarded to the backend services in the nearest data-center using existing </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_pool"><span>connection pools</span></a><span>. The edge infrastructure spans across public cloud and privately managed infrastructures as shown in Figure 1, below, with the front-end proxies hosted both within public cloud regions and in Uber’s managed data-centers:&nbsp;</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_8070" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8070"><a href="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2nd-.gif"><img src="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2nd-.gif" alt="" width="1200" height="541"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8070">Figure 1. Uber’s edge infrastructure powers our mobile applications by routing mobile traffic either over the cloud infrastructure or directly to Uber’s managed data-centers.</figcaption></figure>

<p><span>Hosting the edge servers on public cloud enables us to leverage its widely deployed network of </span><a href="https://networkencyclopedia.com/point-of-presence-pop/"><span>Points of Presence</span></a><span>, or PoPs. </span><span>Terminating the QUIC/TCP connection closer to the user generally </span><span>results in better performance, translating to lower latency and error rates for the HTTPS traffic. In addition, the cloud’s front-end servers support newer, more </span><a href="https://eng.uber.com/employing-quic-protocol/"><span>performant protocols</span></a><span> that further lowers the latencies during poor network conditions. As such, it is critical we maximize the amount of HTTPS requests from mobile routed via the cloud regions to ensure the best possible user experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, if app requests are always routed to the cloud, we risk significant service interruptions during both&nbsp; local- and global-level disruptions. Such connectivity issues can be </span><a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi20spring_burnett_prepub.pdf"><span>attributed</span></a><span> to various components of the public clouds or the intermediate ISPs. Issues due to DNS service, load balancers, BGP routing, mis-configurations of network middleboxes, cloud outages etc. can lead to DNS or QUIC/ TCP connection timeouts. When disruptions occur, Uber’s platform must have the ability to dynamically failover and reroute incoming requests to our private data centers to ensure uninterrupted service.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The front-end servers hosted in the cloud and data-centers are registered as different </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name"><span>domain names</span></a><span>. By selecting the most appropriate domain-name, the mobile apps can route requests either through the cloud regions or directly to the Uber data-centers.</span></p>

<h2><span>Mobile Failover handling</span></h2>
<p><span>To facilitate highly performant and reliable app experiences for our users, we built an in-house failover handler that resides within the mobile networking stack as an interceptor placed above the core HTTP2/QUIC layers. As HTTPS requests are generated from the application, they pass through the failover handler, that rewrites the domain-name (or host-name) before they are processed by the core HTTP library. This ensures that the HTTPS traffic can be dynamically routed to the appropriate edge servers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Asynchronously, the failover handler continuously monitors the health of the domains and switches the domain if required based on the errors received from the HTTPS responses. The logic that decides when to switch the domains is the core component of the failover handler, and the main topic of discussion in this article.</span></p>
<p><span>The failover handler uses network errors for HTTPS responses as the signal to detect reachability issues with the domain. The fundamental challenge when designing the failover handler was distinguishing between errors on the user’s end due to mobile connectivity failures and errors on our end due to edge infrastructure unavailability or unreachability.&nbsp; This problem is further exacerbated due to the high usage of cellular/ LTE networks for Uber’s applications, especially at global scale. Mobile networks are </span><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/00aa/a84be127c04a21b5f5f8dc5d2426921654e2.pdf"><span>less reliable and stable</span></a><span> than their wired counterparts, prone to intermittent failures, connectivity issues, and congestion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Receiving temporary DNS errors or QUIC/ TCP connection timeouts for our primary domain (domain-name for the edge servers hosted within cloud regions) does not necessarily mean that it is unavailable; in most cases, this failure is actually due to an intermittent loss in connectivity. Imagine, for instance, going into a tunnel and losing mobile service. In such a scenario, switching the domain from a primary domain to a back-up domain does not help and may result in </span><i><span>lower</span></i><span> performance once connectivity recovers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Round robin-based failover handler</span></h3>
<p><span>A few straight-foward solutions we tested failed to address this challenge effectively. An earlier iteration of our failover handler used a round robin-based system configured with a list of domains. The first domain was the primary domain that provided the best possible performance. The primary domain was followed by back-up domains, typically Uber’s managed data-center servers, to ensure ability to fallback when the primary domain is unavailable. On receiving a specific network error—DNS errors, timeouts, TCP/TLS errors, and so on—the system switched the domain to the next in the list for all subsequent HTTPS requests.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While this round robin solution met our availability requirements, it had a few drawbacks regarding performance:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Aggressive host switches:</b><span> A few intermittent network errors cause the system to switch domains. Excessive switching across domains may result in unnecessary DNS lookups and connection setups causing additional delays.</span></li>
<li><b>Substantial requests routed to non-performant domains</b><span>: In the event of network errors, the system settles on one of the domains in the list with equal probability after the network recovers. We saw significant sessions settle on the lower-performing back-up domains, despite the primary domain being available. The system would only transition back to the primary domain following another round of network errors.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Threshold-based failover handler</span></h3>
<p><span>To avoid excessive domain switching, we also experimented with a threshold-based failover handler. Instead of triggering failover based on a single network error, the threshold-based solution switches domains only after encountering a minimum number of network errors.&nbsp; However, it proved hard to find a threshold value that worked efficiently across different applications, regions, and network types (LTE, WiFi etc.). Setting the value too low caused unnecessary switching, but setting it too high delayed recovery in scenarios where the primary domains were actually unavailable. Besides, this system did not completely solve the drawbacks of the previous approach.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Edge-driven failover handling</span></h3>
<p><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure has automated recovery mechanisms to mitigate domain failures, such as DNS re-mapping. In this situation, excessive errors on our primary domain triggers a reconfiguration of the domain-name to IP address mapping for the affected domain. DNS propagation is not instantaneous though, since the revised mapping must propagate across all DNS nameservers globally.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Oftentimes, the unreachability of the primary domain is also limited to a small region, a city, or a specific mobile carrier, and cannot be effectively mitigated by DNS mapping updates alone. Mobile apps have a better context of the connectivity conditions and can react in real-time. Hence, we determined that a device-local failover handler is necessary to ensure connectivity in addition to our edge-driven failover handling mechanisms.</span></p>

<h2><span>Failover handler design</span></h2>
<p><span>When designing Uber’s failover handler, we wanted to ensure we hit three main criteria that was lacking in existing solutions we assessed:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Maximize the usage of primary domains: </b><span>&nbsp;We needed our failover handling solution to operate in a way to preferentially route traffic to the primary domains, which typically offer the best performance. Maximizing the amount of HTTPS traffic going through these domains ensures lower latency and a better user experience overall.</span></li>
<li><b>Effectively differentiate between network errors and host-level outages: </b><span>The system required a robust mechanism that could confidently identify actual domain failures and lower the probability of switching to an alternate host because of intermittent mobile network connectivity issues.</span></li>
<li><b>Reduce degraded experience during primary domain outages: </b><span>Our failover …</span></li></ol></div></div>

	<div>
	<p>It's worth discussing <em>how</em> all this works so you understand the 
	challenges that are being overcome here. The ability to run multiple DOS 
	programs at once is a pretty neat trick, given that this software heralds 
	from an era of computing that was <em>just barely</em> ahead of what the 
	Apple ][ was doing in 1978. If you want to skip this, <a href="#Windows_1.0">go ahead</a>.</p>
	<p>The root of the problem is that the IBM PCs basic architecture 
	crystallized a very long time ago, in 1981. In a world where ten kilobytes of RAM counted for 
	about what a gig does now, there was not a lot of room for "overhead" and 
	the idea that you would run two programs simultaneously was generally 
	unrealistic except at the high end of the computing world, which most PC 
	buyers were nowhere near. You needed every bit (<em>ha</em>) of memory you could get, and when 
	memory became more affordable a few years later, it was too late 
	to change anything.</p>
	<p>After just a couple years on the market, MS-DOS had become the 
	unquestioned OS of choice for the PC<a href="#footnote1">*</a> 
	and developed a monumental stable of software, every bit of which<em> </em>
	was essential to someone, somewhere, and could not be easily replaced. Thus 
	began one of the longest tails in technology history, as the PC industry and 
	Microsoft began contorting themselves to try not to 
	break compatibility with old software while still moving forward with advanced 
	functionality.<br>
	<sub><a name="footnote1">*</a>(specifically, since there were MS-DOSes for 
	other architectures, and other OSes for the PC)</sub></p>
	<p>Because DOS was developed under constraints very similar to those 
	in the 
	late '70s that gave us the "bitty boxes" (C64, Apple ][, ZX 
	Spectrum, etc.) it was not built with any kind of "supervision" in mind. In 
	other words, there was no abstraction level above the current running program. 
	DOS was more like a set of tools than what we think 
	of as an operating system now - specifically, it had no "process management"; no concept of "processes" at all, in fact.</p>
	<h2><strong>DOS</strong></h2>
	<p>When the machine booted, the part of DOS that was considered "the OS" - 
	the code for accessing disk drives, writing text to screen, etc. - was copied 
	into memory, and then execution was handed off to the command interpreter, COMMAND.COM, 
	which was an application like any other, at which point you could begin 
	entering commands to use the computer.</p>
		<p>At this point, DOS was no longer "running" in 
	any meaningful way. The code was "resident," meaning it was present in the 
		computer's memory, but 
	the processor wasn't&nbsp; executing any of it. Instead, the CPU was busy executing 
	whatever the current program was - if you were at the command prompt, then 
		all the code the PC was executing was part of COMMAND.COM. When you launched another application, COMMAND.COM was 
	vacated and replaced by that other application.</p>
	<p>In other words, while an application was running, DOS was almost totally out of 
	the picture. The only time execution returned to DOS itself was when the 
	application requested a "service" from DOS, like accessing a disk drive, at 
	which point it would tell the CPU to go execute one of DOS' stored routines 
	for this, and when that routine was done, control would return to the 
	application. This meant that,<em> generally speaking</em>,<em> </em>the current 
	program 
	had absolute control of the PCs execution and it's memory. It could in fact choose to 
	overwrite DOS itself, obliterating it out of memory, and DOS couldn't do a damn thing about it.</p>
	<p>The currently running app also had the option to speak directly to hardware. 
	The 
	whole purpose of DOS was to abstract things like that so programs wouldn't 
	need to know the details of the system they were running on, but since the 
	IBM PC was <em>extremely</em> consistent hardware-wise in its early 
	incarnations, it was entirely 
	optional for developers to take advantage of that, and often 
	there were reasons - of performance, perhaps - to bypass DOS and do things 
	directly.</p>
		<p>DOS provided disk access routines, 
	but the app could blow right by them and shoot commands straight to the 
	floppy drive if it wanted. DOS provided routines for printing text and clearing the 
	screen, but the app could just write directly to video memory. I can't speak to how common this kind of behavior actually was, but it 
	certainly wasn't rare, and it speaks to a larger problem - DOS apps simply 
	expect total control over the system.</p>
		<p>If you run two DOS apps at once, they're 
	going to stomp on each other, because each one thinks it's in charge of the 
		whole machine. The first one would store data in the same spot that the 
		second one stored program code, and thus one would overwrite the other 
		and crash it. So DOS was a single-tasking operating system - you could 
		run one program at a time, and when you wanted to run another, you had 
		to exit, return to the command prompt, and then launch your other app.</p>
		<p>Consequently, if you were working on something 
	in Microsoft Multiplan and wanted to go look up some data in dBase, you had to quit completely 
	out of Multiplan and then start dBase, which would take over the system and totally 
	overwrite the previous app. To get back to where you were you'd have to exit 
		dBase, restart Multiplan, load your document and find your place again - 
		in the process, totally forgetting what you were there to do in the 
		first place, because it's so many steps and takes so long.</p>
	<p>Right from the get-go, PC users wanted to be able to look at one program, then rapidly 
	switch to another. On its face this seems to mean "run two programs at once," 
	which is what we do now, but that's not quite the full story. Let's touch on how 
	that works nowadays, however.</p>
	<h2><strong>Multiprocessing</strong></h2>
	<p>To be clear, you <em>cannot</em> run two programs "at once" on a 
	computer. Some would call this semantics, but it's important in a very real 
	way, <em>especially</em> when talking about 80s-era PCs.</p>
		<p>Modern multicore CPUs get very close to true parallel processing by 
		letting separate programs run on separate cores, but of course, nobody has a CPU so big 
	that they have one core per process. And even if you did, programs still 
		have to share other 
	resources - the system bus, hard drives, and so on. Access to these 
	resources has to be carefully managed so that only one application can use 
		them at a time, and each one has to be cleaned up after before another 
		one can use the same resources. Otherwise, one program could leave the 
		hardware in a state where the commands that the next program sends put 
		it in an unusable state and crash the machine, or corrupt data.</p>
	<p>Even with all our modern pipelined cleverness, you have the 
	fundamental problem that a CPU, and a computer in general, has a limited 
	amount of physical hardware and can't dedicate some to each individual 
	program that's running. When you have more processes running than you have silicon, the only option left is to share 
	resources by dividing up the amount of time that each process gets to use the hardware 
	- this is one of the oldest concepts in computing, and goes back to the late '50s.</p>
	<p>The fundamentals of this process are simple: At 
	any given moment, one program has near-total control of the entire 
	system, to execute its code and use all the resources, and then after it 
	executes for a bit, it goes into a paused state and control is handed off to 
	the next program, which does its work and then hands off to the next. This 
	continues in a round-robin fashion, so that every program gets to use the 
	hardware for a certain portion of every second.</p>
	<p>Modern implementations take this to a fever pitch with all the complex 
	machinations used to make this process efficient, but the fundamentals have 
	never changed; this is how your PC is operating right now.</p>
	<p>One big hurdle to overcome in implementing this is that programs don't just execute 
	instructions in a vacuum. As code is executed, there are side 
	effects. Some are values internal to the CPU, like the&nbsp; status of CPU registers and the current 
	position of the instruction pointer. This is called "CPU state," amd is specific to 
	each running program. When you switch from one program to another, you have to 
	save that information - called "context switching" - and restore it when you 
	come back. Storing this info takes extra time and memory.</p>
		<p>Another hurdle is the state of other hardware. If two programs are 
		talking to the hard drive, you can't let them both just blindly issue 
		commands every time they get control of the CPU. The first process might 
		start a data read that the second process interrupts with a data write, 
		confusing the hard drive controller. So when switching from one process 
		to another, you also have to save the state of these other hardware 
		resources - and possibly even delay switching tasks until those hardware 
		requests are complete.</p>
	<p>If you have enough RAM to store this state, and if your apps don't need too many cycles per second to appear responsive, you can do all this and the user 
	will feel like they're "running multiple programs at 
	once."</p>
	<p>Now, in business applications - the 
	driving force behind the first couple decades of computing - actual 
	"multiprocessing" of this type is not as important as simple usability - users 
	just don't want to have to close one program in order to open another, as they 
	did throughout the DOS days. That, ultimately, is the goal: it 
	doesn't matter if the computer is perfectly speedy, or if programs can run 
	simultaneously, it just matters that 
	users not have to lose all their work in one program simply in order to look 
	at another.</p>
	<h2>Multitasking</h2>
	<p>This desire was of course tremendous right from the start of computing. Who wants to 
	be stuck in one program at a time? So, almost from the 
	earliest days of the IBM PC, software was created to enable task switching 
	with various degrees of success.</p>

When programming for full operating
systems, like any desktop, mobile, or higher-end embedded platforms, the answer is easy—threads.
They're built into the OS, and you typically <em>have</em> to use them to take advantage of features like
multiple CPU cores. Or, when programming for an embedded target, you may reach for a lightweight
<abbr title="Real-Time Operating System">RTOS</abbr> like <a href="https://freertos.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">FreeRTOS</a>, which gives you full threads without much work.</p>
<p>But what if you have a 16MHz microcontroller with 2 KB of RAM?</p>
<p>The Arduino Uno is known for being ubiquitous, cheap, and easy to program. Although there are more
and more reasons to use competing products, such as the various ARM Cortex-M and Espressif boards
(which I use almost exclusively), the Microchip (formerly Atmel) ATMega series is sometimes still
preferred for low power applications, cutting cents off a <abbr title="Bill of Materials">BOM</abbr>, and its widespread support.</p>
<p>Typically, one checks in a loop repeatedly to see if the task is ready to activate. This can be
checking if there's data in a serial buffer, if a certain time period has passed, or a <abbr title="General-Purpose Input/Output">GPIO</abbr> pin has
toggled. However, I'm going to present an alternative to doing this—<code>async</code>/<code>await</code>.</p>

<p>Many modern languages are implementing <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>. C# was one of the first big languages to do
it, and then Python, JavaScript, Dart, Kotlin quickly followed. The big difference between threads
and <code>async</code> functions is that <code>async</code>hronous code is handled by the program itself, usually
cooperatively, while synchronous operations on threads rely on the OS to do it. The first obvious
reason for it, then, is when threads aren't available—just like what we're about to get into soon.
However, asynchronous code is typically faster than synchronous code because it is able to avoid the
overhead of spawning threads and context switches, as well as the memory overhead, as the amount of
space needed on the stack can be calculated ahead of time.</p>
<p>Internally, the compiler turns the code into a state machine, typically using the language's
generators feature if it has one. Here, every time you write <code>.await</code> and the data is not available
immediately, the compiler inserts a <code>return</code> statement, and adds a parameter that allows you to jump
right back to where it was. Rust uses <code>Pin</code>ning, where it is guaranteed that the generated struct
that holds the stack will always be in the same place in memory at all times. This avoids a problem
where a pointer is taken to a local variable, the function returns and comes back, and is suddenly
pointing to something completely different.</p>

<p>C++20 has similar features to Rust's <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> with the <code>co_await</code> keyword, although the
<a href="https://blog.panicsoftware.com/co_awaiting-coroutines/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">available documentation</a> is <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/02_execution/04_executor.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">not quite as good as Rust's</a>.
However, there's a total of... <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/search?q=%22co_await%22&amp;tab=forum" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">1 search result</a> on the Arduino forums, <em>and</em> it's
in German with no code. And even if there <em>was</em> code, it would be largely unaccessable as Arduino
ships with an old compiler:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>❱ ~/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avr-gcc/*/bin/avr-gcc --version
avr-gcc <span>(</span>GCC<span>)</span> <span>7.3</span>.0
Copyright <span>(</span>C<span>)</span> <span>2017</span> Free Software Foundation, Inc.</code></pre></div>
<p>GCC 7.3.0 ships with <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html#cxx17" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">"almost full support"</a> for C++17 (although not by default), but a
total of 0 C++20 additions. And if you're on PlatformIO, you'll have even less luck:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>❱ ~/.platformio/packages/toolchain-atmelavr/bin/avr-gcc --version
avr-gcc <span>(</span>AVR_8_bit_GNU_Toolchain_3.6.2_1759<span>)</span> <span>5.4</span>.0
Copyright <span>(</span>C<span>)</span> <span>2015</span> Free Software Foundation, Inc.</code></pre></div>
<p>However, Rust has been able to compile <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> code for <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/11/07/Async-await-stable.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">almost a year now on the <em>stable
compiler build</em></a>. There's been steadily increasing interest in using these
features on embedded platforms with Rust, and many projects have been using it as a result.</p>
<h2 id="pseudo-asyncawait">Pseudo-<code>async</code>/<code>await</code></h2>
<p>These libraries actually implement a <em>very</em> similar thing to <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> with a state machine,
and jumping to different positions in code based on where it's already been. For example,
<a href="https://github.com/bxparks/AceRoutine" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AceRoutine</a> has a macro, <code>COROUTINE</code>, that internally converts the function into a state machine
that jumps to different places using <code>goto</code>. This is actually almost identical to how tools like
Babel in the JavaScript world convert <code>async</code> functions to traditional functions that can be used
with old browsers.</p>
<p>However, there are a few very critical problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local variables are not preserved across yields</strong>.</li>
<li>You can't use certain statements in some libraries (not AceRoutine), such as <code>switch</code>.</li>
<li>Destructors don't run properly, and will <strong><code>free</code> uninitialized memory</strong> if not done correctly
(due to the first point).</li>
<li>Tasks can't return values.</li>
</ul>
<p>These limitations are because simple preprocessor macros, which is the only option in C/C++, are
only "glorified copy-paste", and have no real computing power. Although <code>async</code> is built into the
Rust compiler, it wasn't before, and a (less-than-ideal, but still usable) macro could implement
most of the feature itself. Hopefully, new C++20 features will lead to more use in the embedded
world.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>It looks like there's a few packages (known as "crates" in the Rust world) to interface with the
hardware:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/avr-rust/ruduino" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ruduino</a>, which only supports the Arduino Uno</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Rahix/avr-device" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">avr-device</a>, which provides low-level hardware control</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">avr-hal</a>, which provides higher-level board and <abbr title="Microcontroller">MCU</abbr> support, and depends on avr-device</li>
</ul>
<p>Although <a href="https://github.com/avr-rust/ruduino" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ruduino</a> is by the avr-rust team that worked on getting Rust working on AVR, I ultimately
decided to go with <a href="https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">avr-hal</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It supports many more boards, and has a structure that allows it to expand further</li>
<li>
<p>It supports <a href="https://docs.rs/embedded-hal/0.2.*/embedded_hal/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">embedded-hal</a>, which allows us to share code between boards: for example, the
<a href="https://docs.rs/apa102-spi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>apa102_spi</code></a> crate will let us control APA102 LED strips on an Arduino Uno and a Raspberry Pi
running Linux, using the exact same code!</p>
<ul>
<li>embedded-hal also has a bigger focus on nonblocking operations, which is exactly what we're
looking for</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It has a cleaner and safer API</li>
</ul>
<p>To set that up:</p>
<p><strong>(Update 2020-07-26)</strong>: this is much simpler now with the latest nightly. All that is required:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>rustup <span>install</span> nightly
rustup +nightly component <span>add</span> rust-src</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="compiling-and-running">Compiling and Running</h2>
<p>We can compile by running</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>cargo +nightly build -Z build-std<span>=</span>core --release --target avr-atmega328p.json

cargo +nightly build --release</code></pre></div>
<p>Then, to upload it to a device, assuming that you have <code>avrdude</code> installed, run:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>avrdude -v -patmega328p -carduino -P/dev/ttyACM0 -b115200 -D -Uflash:w:target/avr-atmega328p/release/examples/serial.elf:e</code></pre></div>
<p>Change the upload path (<code>target/avr-atmega328p/release/examples/serial.elf</code>) to meet what you want
to upload.</p>
<h2 id="if-you-only-have-the-arduino-ide-installed">If you only have the Arduino IDE installed</h2>
<p>Enable "Show verbose output during: upload" in the Arduino IDE. Observe the build logs for an
<code>avrdude</code> command—it should look something like:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>/path/to/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avrdude/6.3.0-arduino17/bin/avrdude -C/path/to/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avrdude/6.3.0-arduino17/etc/avrdude.conf -v -patmega328p -carduino -P/dev/ttyACM0 -b115200 -D -Uflash:w:/tmp/arduino_build_721874/Blink.ino.hex:i</code></pre></div>
<p>Copy that command, but delete everything after <code>-Uflash:w:</code>. Then, without spaces, add the path to
your binary. This will typically be <code>target/avr-atmega328p/release/project_name.elf</code>, or
<code>target/avr-atmega328p/release/examples/example_name.elf</code>. Finally, add <code>:e</code>. Your final command
will probably look something like:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>/path/to/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avrdude/6.3.0-arduino17/bin/avrdude -C/path/to/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avrdude/6.3.0-arduino17/etc/avrdude.conf -v -patmega328p -carduino -P/dev/ttyACM0 -b115200 -D -Uflash:w:target/avr-atmega328p/release/project_name.elf:e</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="what-about-converting-to-hex-first">What about converting to hex first?</h3>
<p>Arduino typically converts the compiled binary to raw hex, and many AVR-Rust projects have
<a href="https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal/blob/bfc5dfe67107a68b4a673e54532354af126cb3ba/mkhex.sh#L32" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">followed that pattern</a>. However, there's generally no need to do that, as <code>avrdude</code>
has the ability to upload ELF binaries directly.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="onto-async-operations">Onto <code>async</code> operations</h2>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, <a href="https://docs.rs/embedded-hal/0.2.*/embedded_hal/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">embedded-hal</a> is implemented in such a way that asynchronous operations is
quite easy. When you attempt to read or write a value, you can get three results:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>WouldBlock</code>: I can't complete this operation right now.</li>
<li><code>Ok</code>: The operation succeeded. If reading something, this gives you the read value.</li>
<li><code>Err</code>: An error occurred while performing this operation.</li>
</ul>
<p>This maps very nicely to Rust's <code>Future</code> trait, which is used to implement asynchronous code. For
example, reading from a serial port is implemented like this:</p>
<div data-language="rust"><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>poll_read</span><span>(</span>
    <span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>:</span> Pin<span>&lt;</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>Self</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>

<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> Poll<span>&lt;</span>Result<span>&lt;</span>usize<span>,</span> T<span>::</span>Error<span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>match</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>Ok</span><span>(</span>byte<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>*</span>ptr <span>=</span> byte<span>;</span>
                Poll<span>::</span><span>Ready</span><span>(</span><span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
            <span>}</span>
            <span>Err</span><span>(</span>nb<span>::</span>Error<span>::</span>WouldBlock<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> Poll<span>::</span>Pending<span>,</span>
            <span>Err</span><span>(</span>nb<span>::</span>Error<span>::</span><span>Other</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> Poll<span>::</span><span>Ready</span><span>(</span><span>Err</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
        Poll<span>::</span><span>Ready</span><span>(</span><span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Although there's a bit of weirdness in terms of checking if the buffer is big enough, for the most
part, this works pretty well.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="why-do-i-always-return-1-byte-read">Why do I always return 1 byte read?</h3>
<p>I'm mostly mirroring the <code>AsyncRead</code> and <code>AsyncWrite</code> in the <code>futures</code> crate, which typically is
used on machines with full operating systems. Typically, the overhead of a syscall is somewhat
high, so you might request e.g. 1024 bytes at a time. Obviously, that isn't the case for an 8-bit
<abbr title="Microcontroller">MCU</abbr>. However, I'm keeping that pattern for ease of porting and to allow for networking, e.g. the
Arduino Ethernet shield.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, I copied and pasted the <code>AsyncReadExt</code> and <code>AsyncWriteExt</code> traits from the <code>futures</code> crate as
well. The way this is set up is that you just implement the low-level functions, and the <code>Ext</code>
traits take care of the more user-friendly functions. This is done instead of default
implementations to allow the main trait to be small in case it is added to the standard library,
much like how <code>Future</code> is in <code>std</code>/…</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190503172035/https://www.augur.io/">Augur</a> (2013-2017) was a commercial browser fingerprinting service, offered primarily to AdTech companies.  In this post I will analyze their tracking script and describe how it works and what information it collects.  The original copy of the script (<a href="https://cdn.augur.io/augur.min.js">https://cdn.augur.io/augur.min.js</a>) is no longer up; however, the Internet Archive still has a copy at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609184536js_/https://cdn.augur.io/augur.min.js">https://web.archive.org/web/20170609184536js_/https://cdn.augur.io/augur.min.js</a>.</p>

<h2 id="deobfuscating">Deobfuscating</h2>
<p>A first glance at the script shows a bunch of seemingly random characters (including emojis).  The was a hint to me that they were probably passing a big string into some deobfuscation function and <code>eval</code>ing it.  Passing the script through <a href="https://beautifier.io/">beautifier.io</a> shows exactly that.  The deobfuscation function has the following contents:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>        ...
        if (!''.replace(_(12), String)) {
            var z = {};
            for (i = 0; i &lt; 686; i++) {
                var y = x(i);
                z[y] = r[i] || y
            }
            t = _(15);
            y = function(a) {
                return z[a] || a
            };
            o = o.replace(t, y)
        } else {
            for (j = a[a.length - 1] - 1; j &gt;= 0; j--) {
                (r[j]) ? o = o.replace(new RegExp('\b' + (j &lt; 63 ? c.charAt(j) : c.charAt((j - 63) / 63) + c.charAt((j - 63) % 63)) + '\b', '\x67'), r[j]): 0
            }
        }
        return o.replace(_(11), "\n").replace(_(16), "\"")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To get the deobfuscated output, we can just copy the return statement but replace <code>return</code> with <code>console.log</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>        console.log(o.replace(_(11), "\n").replace(_(16), "\""));
        return o.replace(_(11), "\n").replace(_(16), "\"")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, we can just run the script in our browsers developer console and copy-paste the large output. The deobfuscated version can be found at <a href="https://pastebin.com/5Gdgxkxu">https://pastebin.com/5Gdgxkxu</a>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I was shocked to find that Augur was silently collecting user’s Facebook information and all emails put in forms.  Apparently, this has been reported on <a href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2018/04/18/no-boundaries-for-facebook-data-third-party-trackers-abuse-facebook-login/">before</a>.  Otherwise, their fingerprinting was pretty comprehensive, but did not really feature any innovative or novel techniques.</p>

		<p>Do you want to learn how to utterly destroy SJWs in an argument? How about those fascist, right-wing Nazis?</p>
<p>Well, you’ll have to figure out how to do that on your own.</p>
<p>But if you’re one of those buzzkills who wants to give your argumentative opponent a fair shake, the philosopher Daniel Dennett has some advice. In his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intuition-Pumps-Other-Tools-Thinking/dp/0393348784/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr="><i>Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking</i></a>, he provides four simple rules (adopted from those crafted by the game theorist Anatol Rapoport) for criticizing the views of those with whom you disagree:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<blockquote><p>You should attempt to re-express your target’s position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, ‘Thanks, I wish I’d thought of putting it that way.’</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>You should list any points of agreement (especially if they are not matters of general or widespread agreement).</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>You should mention anything you have learned from your target.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of rebuttal or criticism.</p></blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>An immediate effect of taking such an approach, Dennett says, is that your opponents “will be a receptive audience for your criticism: you have already shown that you understand their positions as well as they do (you agree with them on some important matters and have even been persuaded by something they said).”</p>
<p>Dennett admits that not all opponents are worthy of such respectful treatment, but when they are it pays off to be as charitable as possible. “It is worth reminding yourself,” he says, “that a heroic attempt to find a defensible interpretation of an author, if it comes up empty, can be even more devastating than an angry hatchet job. I recommend it.”</p>
<p>And so do I.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>From time to time newly graduated hackers ask me: <em>“Do you have any advice for beginning my career?”</em></p><p>I’ve found myself repeating 3 principles over and over again. On reflection, I realized these principles apply more broadly. I <em>think</em> they might answer the question <em>“Do you have any advice on for beginning my life as an adult?”</em></p><p>I thought I’d share these ideas with you here. The style and the examples I wrote are career-oriented, but I think the core ideas will still help in your decision making. I hope you enjoy them : ).</p><p><em>What should you do?</em> is one of the hardest questions to answer when you start out.</p><p>The default path is to follow what’s popular or prestigious. That can lead to a bunch of problems: What’s prestigious is already highly competitive. When you compete with smart people in a game that has established rules, just keeping up will take most of your time. That leaves little time to explore what interests you. When you don’t explore what interests you, you won’t understand things as deeply, and that leaves you with an undifferentiated skillset.</p><p><strong>The solution here is to follow your taste.</strong> Popularity and prestige are lagging indicators. Your taste, especially as a young, curious person, is a signal for <em>what will be</em> popular in the future. Regardless though, when you follow you taste, you’ll find yourself much more interested in the problems you’re solving. When you’re interested in the problems you’re solving, you’ll discover deeper truths, build deeper expertise, a differentiated skillset, and have more fun along the way.</p><p>Now, you may be wondering: <strong>What if you don’t even know what you’re interested in?</strong></p><p>Don’t worry. You just need to tune into and strengthen your taste. To do that, just do <em>anything</em>. Once you do <em>anything</em>, ask yourself, what part of that thing do you  find interesting?</p><p>Start going deeper there, and all of a sudden, you’ll discover a wealth of interests.</p><p>Next up, you may be wondering: <strong>What if your interests keep changing?</strong></p><p>Don’t worry. It’s totally fine. Just follow it. You’ll be surprised how things will serve you down the road. As long as you’re working hard and you’re learning, it’s a good use of time.</p><p>You may also wonder: <strong>What if your interests <em>are</em> what’s popular and prestigious today?</strong></p><p>That’s great. Follow that, but instead of competing, start sensing what actually interests you in that field and go deeper.</p><p>The ideas may seem career oriented, so you may be wondering: <strong>What if I just want to travel and explore the world?</strong></p><p>That’s great too! It’s your taste, telling you that you want to travel. Follow it and see where it leads you.</p><p>As you discover your interests, you may find that they’re not necessarily popular. Yet, when you go deeper and do your thing, something magical will happen…which leads us into the second principle:</p><p>As you explore and follow your taste, you’ll discover a subset of people who share your core interests and values.</p><p>Nurture those relationships. Some of these people will be your friends for life. Many of those people will become very successful in the future.</p><p>The people you know will show you what’s possible and work alongside you in deepening, exploring, and innovating on your shared interests.</p><p>You may be wondering: <em>what if you live in the middle of nowhere, and there aren’t people who get you?</em> Do your best to go to the center of wherever your community is. That may be SF for hackers or Los Angeles for entertainers or Paris for artists, the list goes on. You know where it is for you.</p><p>Now, this may sound impractical to you, but you’ll be surprised with what you can do. You can start off online in the meantime.</p><p>One common pitfall here is <em>focusing only on successful people in your field.</em> This misses the point. Sure, reach out to those successful people, but remember that the young, curious, interested people right next you, <em>will become those successful people in the future.</em> You have tons of time to spend together, so it’s great way to deepen your relationships. I’m not saying that you shouldn’t reach out to successful people (you definitely should), but to remove “success” as a criteria altogether for choosing who you spend your time with.</p><p>Now, you may be wondering, <em>how do you deepen those relationships?</em> That leads to us to the third principle:</p><p>As you form your community, new ideas and ways to collaborate will spring up. Take those opportunities: work together, support each-other and play. Over time, which you have a lot of right now, you will form a tight tribe of friends.</p><p>As a happy side effect, you’ll become exposed to new fields, new technologies, interesting problems, and interesting opportunities. Start taking them, and you’re well on your way to a career that’s <em>made for you.</em></p><p>One common issue here is a lack of self belief. This may lead you into choosing what you think “you are capable of”, rather than what you’re interested in. One way to get around this is to just experiment: let yourself dream and work with your friends, even if the problems seem fantastically hard.</p><p>There are a lot of examples I can give you if you’re interested in what I’m interesting in: From <a href="https://m.stopa.io/my-favorite-books-11e6b5a3ac0a" target="_blank">my favorite books</a> to <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html" target="_blank">Paul Graham’s essays</a> to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paradigms-Artificial-Intelligence-Programming-Studies/dp/1558601910" target="_blank">Norvig’s Paradgims of AI programming</a>, to <a href="https://m.stopa.io/favorite-rich-hickey-talks-6bcb23da6ff2" target="_blank">Rich Hickey talks</a>. But, instead I encourage you to think: <em>what interests you right now?</em></p><p>If you’re up for it, I’d love to know your answer: <strong><em>what interests you right now?</em></strong> Feel free to leave your answer in the comments or to email me directly, I’d be curious to hear : )</p><p>There’s a slew of people who have influenced and mentored me. These ideas are just as much them as me.</p><p>On the idea of taste specifically, the big shoutout has to go to Paul Graham. A lot of my thinking about this was inspired by reading his essays over and over when I started out. I highly suggest reading them.</p><p><em>Thanks to Daniel Woelfel, Talha Baig, Martin Raison, Irakli Safareli, David Magaltadze, Joe Averbukh, Julien Odent, for reviewing this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Imposter syndrome has been something I've dealt with my whole life. And it seems to follow me, no matter what position I'm in or where I go.</p><p>In middle school, I was in awe of high schoolers and how much they seemed to know. When I became a high school student, I was intimidated by college students who had started to creep their way into the working world. Now, as a college student in that position, I feel like an imposter around students with impressive resumes, including those who interviewed me to join different student organizations.</p><p>It was after joining one of those organizations that I started to see how wrong my perceptions were. These students weren't superhuman figures, they were just kids with hobbies, interests, and really cool personalities.</p><p>At that point, I'd realized the fact that's helped me get through future instances of imposter syndrome: <em>everyone's a human being, just like you and I.</em></p><p>That includes Jeff Bezos, your job interviewer, your high school teacher, your mentor. They're all humans, who've probably gone through the same experiences you have. At some point, your job interviewer was the interviewee. They know your heart's racing, that there are thick beads of sweat building up around your temple, that your brain is just 70% in the game —&nbsp;because they've been there.</p><p>This lesson has helped me in so many places. At work, I'm constantly confused with our massive codebase. Asking questions was a pretty scary thing, especially at the beginning. I didn't want to seem like I didn't know what I was doing, or that I wasn't capable. Plowing through the unknown headfirst didn't work so well for me —&nbsp;I later found out that those confusing things I'd spent 3 hours on could be answered in a minute from someone who knew better. And there was never any judgement, because they'd been there themselves.</p><p>So don't sweat things too much. There's no need to put others on a pedestal. Just see them as another person, not too different from yourself, in a position you want to get to. Reach and ask for help; chances are, they'd be happy to.</p></div><div><div><p><a href="https://roland.imprint.to/">Roland's Notes</a></p><p>My thoughts, stories, and ideas</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kNtacp8-GoI" width="320" youtube-src-id="kNtacp8-GoI"></iframe></p><p>Nintendo's latest Direct hit yesterday to mixed reactions. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNtacp8-GoI" target="_blank">video</a>, at the time of writing, has 68,000 dislikes and 87,000 likes. Fans were disappointed at the lack of any major announcements given the drought in Nintendo Directs in recent months. The showcase highlighted <i>Shin Megamei Tensei 5</i>, <i>Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster</i>, some DLC for <i>Cadence of Hyrule</i>, <i>Rogue Company</i> and&nbsp;<i>WWE2K Battlegrounds</i>. That was it. No <i>Doom Eternal</i>, no <i>Bravely Default II</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>While I expect Nintendo will undoubtedly release more smaller Nintendo Directs in due course, there is a much greater issue here.&nbsp;</p><h3>Everyone is talking about the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X</h3><p>Nintendo needs to step up to get gamers talking about the Switch again. Right now, the hot topics are the next generation of consoles coming later this year. <a href="https://www.staticcatgames.com/2020/07/will-july-23rd-mark-success-or-failure.html" target="_blank">Microsoft's event on the 23rd</a> is on everyone's lips, for example. If Phil Spencer and co show off a lot of gameplay for <i>Halo: Infinite</i> and other first party games, this could turn out to be an incredible event.&nbsp; Microsoft's Xbox Series S/Project Lockhart is supposedly going to be unveiled in August, adding even more impetus.&nbsp;</p><p>I wouldn't be surprised if Sony released more information to combat the impact of Microsoft's event, perhaps even the price and launch date.&nbsp;</p><h3>What can Nintendo do to get the buzz going again?</h3><div><ul><li>Mario games in celebration of the 35th anniversary.</li><li>Announce <i>Breath of the Wild 2</i>.</li><li>Nintendo 64 games coming to the Switch.</li><li>New [insert old IP] here - imagine the reaction if a new <i>Wave Race</i> or <i>F-Zero </i>was announced?</li><li>Announce a Game Boy Classic.</li><li>Announce<i> GoldenEye 007</i> coming to the Switch.</li><li>Say "<a href="https://www.staticcatgames.com/2020/07/what-next-for-nintendo.html" target="_blank">Switch Pro</a> - coming 2021"</li></ul><p>What about Todd Howard showing a video of him playing <i>Fallout 3</i> (or 4) on the Switch? That would be incredible.&nbsp;</p><p>If Nintendo really wanted to do something EPIC, all it has to do is release a video of Phil Spencer playing <i>Halo: Infinite</i>...on a Switch running xCloud.&nbsp;</p></div><p><b>BOOM!&nbsp;</b></p><p>And the crowd goes wild.</p><h3>Closing thoughts</h3><p>There is always the risk of complacency. Nintendo could decide not to do anything until September, which might be damaging. I expect Sony will release more info about the PlayStation 5 at some point, especially since we don't know the price or launch date. There might be more gameplay footage to come. Microsoft might have a busy August if they announce the Xbox Series S/Project Lockhart then. Nintendo could make a splash by announcing <i>Super Mario Galaxy 1 &amp; 2 </i>on the Switch or S<i>uper Mario Sunshine Remastered. </i>That would guarantee a lot of interest and pre-orders.&nbsp;</p><p>What do you think? Is Nintendo on the right track or should it do more to get everyone talking about the Switch and their games?</p><h2>If you liked reading this post, please check out some of my others</h2>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article">
           <div itemprop="articleBody">
            
  <div id="double-entry-accounting-for-developers">

<p>Hordak is inherently aimed at software developers as it provides core
functionality only. Friendly interfaces can certainly be built on top of it, but
if you are here there is a good chance you are a developer.</p>
<p>If you are learning about accounting as developer you may feel – as I did – that
most of the material available doesn’t quite relate to the developer/STEM mindset. I
therefore provide some resources here that may be of use.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>According to this <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23964513">Hacker News discussion</a>, some of what follows may be either incorrect
or abhorrent to those with a good knowledge of accounting practices. I still
feel the following is useful, and that taken as a whole it describes a working
double entry accounting system.</p>
</div>

<div id="in-a-little-more-detail">
<h2>In a little more detail<a href="#in-a-little-more-detail" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I found <a href="http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/accounting/tutorial.html">Peter Selinger’s tutorial</a> to be very enlightening and is less terse than the functional description above.
The first section is short and covers single entry accounting, and then shows how one can expand that to create double
entry accounting. I found this background useful.</p>
</div>
<div id="examples">
<h2>Examples<a href="#examples" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You live in a shared house. Everyone pays their share into a communal bank account
every month.</p>
<div id="example-1-saving-money-to-pay-a-bill-no-sign-flipping">
<h3>Example 1: Saving money to pay a bill (no sign flipping)<a href="#example-1-saving-money-to-pay-a-bill-no-sign-flipping" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You pay the electricity bill every three months. Therefore every month you take £100
from everyone’s contributions and put it into Electricity Payable account (a liability
account) in the knowledge that you will pay the bill from this account when it eventually arrives:</p>
<p>These accounts are income &amp; liability accounts, so neither balance needs to be flipped (flipping
only applies to asset &amp; expense accounts). Therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Balances before:<ul>
<li><em>Housemate Contribution</em> (income): £500</li>
<li><em>Electricity Payable</em> (liability): £0</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Transaction</strong>:<ul>
<li>£100 from <em>Housemate Contribution</em> to <em>Electricity Payable</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Balances after:<ul>
<li><em>Housemate Contribution</em> (income): £400</li>
<li><em>Electricity Payable</em> (liability): £100</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This should also make intuitive sense. Some of the housemate contributions will be used to pay the electricity
bill, therefore the former decreases and the latter increases.</p>
</div>
<div id="example-2-saving-money-to-pay-a-bill-with-sign-flipping">
<h3>Example 2: Saving money to pay a bill (with sign flipping)<a href="#example-2-saving-money-to-pay-a-bill-with-sign-flipping" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>At the start of every month each housemate pays into the communal bank account. We
should therefore represent this somehow in our double entry system (something we ignored in
example 1).</p>
<p>We have an account called <em>Bank</em> which is an asset account (because this is money
we actually have). We also have a <em>Housemate Contribution</em> account which is an
income account.</p>
<p>Therefore, <strong>to represent the fact that we have been paid money, we must create a transaction</strong>.
However, money cannot be injected from outside our double entry system, so how do we deal with this?</p>
<p>Let’s show how we represent a single housemate’s payment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Balances before:<ul>
<li><em>Bank</em> (asset): £0</li>
<li><em>Housemate Contribution</em> (income): £0</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Transaction:</strong><ul>
<li>£500 from <em>Bank</em> to <em>Housemate Contribution</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Balances after:<ul>
<li><em>Bank</em> (asset): -£500 * -1 = <strong>£500</strong></li>
<li><em>Housemate Contribution</em>  (income): £500</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the bank account is an asset account, we flip the sign of its balance.
<strong>The result is that both accounts increase in value.</strong></p>
