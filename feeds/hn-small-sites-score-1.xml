<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><img src="https://serhack.me/images/bitcoin-getting-started/social_oasis.jpg"><figcaption><h4>A man looks for Bitcoin Oasis</h4></figcaption></figure><p>If you have heard about blockchain or cryptocurrency, then the term that initially comes to mind is <a href="https://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a>. Launched 12 years ago, it was the late 2017 bull run that created a media frenzy that propelled Bitcoin into the mainstream and our modern day lexicon.</p><p>Often labeled as the “original” cryptocurrency, <a href="https://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a> has been the catalyst (directly and/or indirectly) behind many new innovations in the blockchain and digital asset space, most notably <a href="https://ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a> and <a href="https://getmonero.org/">Monero</a>. Shortly after the late 2017 bull run lost its steam, interest in these new technologies started to fade ― but here we are in 2021 with Bitcoin having risen like a phoenix from the ashes. As you would assume, an appetite for the blockchain and digital asset space has returned and now it is more important than ever that we understand what exactly is behind this unique asset, Bitcoin.</p><p>This article is meant to be a guide for individuals who are new to cryptocurrency and want to learn about <a href="https://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a>, specifically its use case and the different ways to become involved in the broader blockchain and digital asset space. My goal is to educate you on the basics and make sure that you walk away with a newfound perspective and understanding of <a href="https://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a>.</p><h2 id="what-is-bitcoin">What is Bitcoin?</h2><p>Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash whose transactions are recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. In late October 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto (whose identity is still unknown) published a white paper titled <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"><em>Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System</em></a> on bitcoin.org (registered in August 2008) and subsequently posted it to <a href="https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-October/014810.html">a cryptography mailing list</a>. On January 3, 2009, the Bitcoin network was created when Satoshi Nakamoto mined the initial block of the chain, which is called the genesis block.</p><p>In essence, Bitcoin is a decentralized type of “digital money” that can be used by anyone around the world, at any time, and without restrictions or a central authority. Bitcoin is not backed by any bank or government and originally allowed users to freely send and/or spend it anywhere without trusting third parties.</p><p>At inception, the price of Bitcoin was approximately $0.01 and, as of today, the price has surpassed $40,000 per coin ― with many believing that it can grow exponentially higher to levels between $100,000 and $250,000 in the next year or so.</p><figure><img src="https://serhack.me/images/bitcoin-getting-started/extras_1_blockchain-80.jpg"><figcaption><h4>The transactions data are memorized through a chain-of-blocks</h4></figcaption></figure><p>Given that Bitcoin exists and operates within the confounds of the Internet, all user balances are kept on an immutable and fully transparent blockchain. Put simply, each Bitcoin transaction is broadcasted to the Bitcoin network and grouped with several other transactions in the form of a block, which the network’s miners validate. Once the block is accepted, the transactions get recorded on the blockchain (which, as you may recall, is a public ledger). Whenever this process is successfully completed, the network distributes new Bitcoin to miners for each block that has been validated ― this is referred to as a block reward.</p><p>The peculiarity of the blockchain is its distribution and decentralized properties, as all the nodes share a valid copy of the public ledger. In the Bitcoin network, nodes play a very important role ― think of them as “protectors” who are constantly monitoring Bitcoin’s blockchain to distinguish legitimate Bitcoin transactions from illegitimate ones. The basic job of a node is to prevent attempts to double-spend Bitcoins that have already been spent elsewhere. In addition, the process of mining is essential to validating transactions, as it ensures the overall trustworthiness and security of the payment network.</p><h2 id="advantages-and-limitations">Advantages and Limitations</h2><p>Members of the cryptocurrency community, who range from the tech savvy to your average retail investor, have adopted various perspectives regarding the fundamental driver of Bitcoin’s value (both in financial and non-financial terms).</p><p>On one side, there are the Bitcoin Maximalists who believe that Bitcoin is the ultimate financial innovation and will assume a mainstream role in global society ― to maximalists, other cryptocurrencies and traditional financial instruments are inferior. On the other side, you have cryptocurrency enthusiasts who believe Bitcoin’s technology is outdated and that other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, have more expansive utility.</p><p>These arguments and differences of opinion (as it relates to Bitcoin) can often become confusing, so let’s dig deeper into some of the most common discussion points with hopes that you can decipher for yourself.</p><h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3><ul><li>A blockchain is managed autonomously using <strong>a peer-to-peer network</strong> and cannot be shut down ― the only way to stop it is through shutting down or banning Internet access. (Note: Even though a blockchain or Bitcoin cannot be shut down, some jurisdictions have imposed restrictions on citizens that limit or ban the holding or trading of Bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrencies.)</li><li>There is no need to trust a third party. <strong>You are your own bank!</strong></li><li>Relatively quick and cheap transactions without intermediary fees (around 10 minutes on average per transaction), when compared to most leading cryptocurrencies.</li><li>Increasing adoption by merchants and individuals across the globe.</li><li>Largest market capitalization and name recognition, which will continue to promote its growth and (hopefully) price stability.</li></ul><h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3><ul><li><strong>Lack of anonymity</strong> as transactions that take place in the Bitcoin network, along with many other leading cryptocurrencies, are fully transparent and can potentially be linked via chain analysis. In addition, strict AML/KYC regulations require many of the leading cryptocurrency trading exchanges to verify your most sensitive personal information.</li><li>Slow and expensive transactions, when compared to lesser known cryptocurrencies that can be sent within seconds and at a fraction of the cost.</li><li>Irreversible transactions. Once a transaction is sent, you cannot undo or cancel the transaction.</li><li>Achievement of its status as a currency will be challenging due to its volatile nature (i.e. swings in price) and regulations.</li><li>The core technology has some subtle limits that make Bitcoin outdated in comparison with other cryptocurrencies.</li></ul><p>Along with Bitcoin Maximalists and cryptocurrency enthusiasts, you have many individuals who simply like to be long-term holders of Bitcoin (because they believe in the fundamentals and value proposition) and others who speculate on the short-term price (e.g. day traders).</p><p>Whatever side you are on, there is no question that Bitcoin has established itself as a serious contender in the financial world and is here to stay for the time being. There may be other alternatives, but the granddaddy of cryptocurrencies still has the spotlight!</p><h2 id="how-to-obtain-bitcoin-from-an-exchange">How to Obtain Bitcoin from an Exchange</h2><p>Now that you have an understanding of Bitcoin and its utility, you may be interested in purchasing some. If that is the case, you have come to the right place as buying it is now easier than ever due to the growing number of exchanges and companies making Bitcoin accessible to the masses.</p><p>Some of the most well-known exchanges that allow you to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are <a href="https://coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a>, <a href="https://www.gemini.com/">Gemini</a>, <a href="https://www.kraken.com/">Kraken</a>, <a href="https://binance.com/">Binance</a>, and <a href="https://www.huobi.com/en-us/">Huobi</a>. While all of these exchanges list Bitcoin, not all of them offer the same cryptocurrencies ― so, it is recommended to open accounts across a few exchanges to ensure that you are provided adequate exposure.</p><p>Once you have created an account on an exchange, you can transfer your local fiat money via ACH or bank wire to the exchange. From there, you can purchase Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency in exchange for your local fiat money. In addition, after purchasing Bitcoin, you can exchange it for another cryptocurrency that you might not be able to purchase with your local fiat money. While some exchanges offer credit card purchases of Bitcoin, please keep in mind that the fees associated with this transaction are typically very high.</p><figure><img src="https://serhack.me/images/bitcoin-getting-started/extras_2_exchange-80.jpg"><figcaption><h4>You can exchange central currencies (EUR, USD) to BTC, but sacrificing privacy.</h4></figcaption></figure><p>Using any of the exchanges listed above is the easiest and most convenient way to purchase Bitcoin, as the majority of the other cryptocurrency exchanges do not support fiat currencies. This being the case, you can only exchange other cryptocurrencies (like Ethereum or Monero) for Bitcoin. <a href="https://cash.app/">Cash App</a> and <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/crypto">PayPal</a>, some of the largest financial technology companies, offer its users the ability to purchase Bitcoin. While this is extremely convenient for users of these platforms, the downside for PayPal (not Cash App) is that your Bitcoin must remain on its platform, so you cannot transfer or send it. Remember: Not your keys, not your coins.</p><p>If you are not keen on using any of the methods described above, Bitcoin ATMs are a great alternative. There are over 14,000 physical ATMs worldwide, most of which can be found in major cities at peculiar locations such as a shopping mall, burger restaurant, or a bar. All you need to do is deposit cash and enter your Bitcoin address. Once you have completed the transaction, the funds will be sent to you. This is a very simple process and typically does not require any identity verification, but beware of high fees!</p><h2 id="who-accepts-bitcoin">Who Accepts Bitcoin?</h2><p>Over the years, many individuals and businesses have begun accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment. From time to time, you might have noticed stickers on a shop’s window that says “Bitcoin accepted here.” As mentioned above, after the bull run of late 2017 died down, overall interest in cryptocurrencies (especially Bitcoin) amongst merchants began to wane. Today, Bitcoin and the broader digital asset space has bounced back from a pricing perspective and, with this, so has the interest amongst merchants who have triggered another wave of increased acceptance, most notably <a href="https://apnews.com/article/financial-markets-elon-musk-bitcoin-061817c6795e75d1c3c9e9d6cfc4a911">Tesla</a> disclosing that it has invested approximately $1.5 billion into Bitcoin and that the company plans to accept Bitcoin as payment for its electric vehicles.</p><p>There have been a few prominent …</p></div></div>

<div itemprop="text">
<p>Even though interviewing for a software engineering job can be intimidating and frustrating (with whiteboard exercises, remote coding challenges, and even full days of onsite interviews), it’s a lot easier when you know what to expect and are well-prepared.</p>
<p>I’ve interviewed a few hundred software engineering candidates in the past 10+ years and designed hiring processes. My experience is limited to startups and mid-sized companies, so take everything you read here with that in mind. My advice may not get you into <a href="https://www.facebook.com/careers/facebook-life/how-we-hire" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a> or <a href="https://careers.google.com/how-we-hire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a> but will definitely increase your chances at mid-sized companies with a good culture!</p>
<p>In the first part of this article, I’ll give some context, then give you an actionable list to improve your experience and chances in your next interview</p>
<p>If you’re only interested in the actionable list, feel free to skip ahead to it.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-think-about-the-technical-interview-might-be-incomplete"><span id="What_you_think_about_the_technical_interview_might_be_incomplete">What you think about the technical interview might be incomplete</span></h2>
<p>First and foremost, a technical interview is almost never only technical. Up to a certain (and honestly, very useful!) level growing as a ‘coder’ is not that complicated. Many candidates perform pretty well if we purely look at their coding skills.</p>
<p>The thing is, you’ll rarely work alone in isolation on your own codebase. You’ll have teammates, you’ll need to agree on things with them, you’ll build on others’ code and others will build on your code. You’ll need to build solutions with a certain level of quality, in a future-proof way, for extensibility, and with performance in mind. Depending on your role and level, you’ll need to architect systems. You’ll need to mentor other engineers. You’ll need to onboard new team members. You’ll need to proactively reach out to other teams in the company and understand their points of view and problems. You’ll talk to product managers, UX researchers, designers, even customers sometimes. You’ll need to manage projects, make tradeoffs and decisions, and align other engineers with that.</p>
<p>Read my article about&nbsp;<a href="https://ochronus.online/technical-interview-myths/">the most common 11 technical interview myths</a> – you’ll get a better view of how people think on the other side of the table.</p>
<h2 id="types-and-stages-of-technical-interviews"><span id="Types_and_stages_of_technical_interviews">Types and stages of technical interviews</span></h2>
<p>Most companies use a combination of these steps:</p>
<ul><li>Screening call with a recruiter – We’re interested in your basic motivations; we’d like to have a gut feeling about what you’re looking for and do some sanity check here. You might get asked about your salary requirements, support you need for visa or relocation, timelines (when could you start, etc.). Some recruiters will also ask you whether you have applied elsewhere, so they know how urgent this is for them and you.</li><li>Screening call with the hiring manager – Expect some deeper dive into your experience on multiple fronts – tech and ‘soft skills’ alike. As a hiring manager, I’ll prepare by checking out your CV for talking points, maybe even your LinkedIn profile, and definitely GitHub. I’m not trying to judge you; I’m just looking for points of connection. I’ll answer any questions you have about the role, the company, the culture, potential teams you’d be joining, etc. My ultimate goal with this is twofold: would we be a good match for your (and vice versa) and whether I think you’d be successful in the role.</li><li>Remote technical screening – An alternative, or at some places precursor to the online coding exercise. This is with a human on the other end of the line – solving tech problems together; usually, you walk them through your solution.</li><li>Online coding exercises (LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.) – I know you all hate this. We need such a step to filter out people who can’t even code at all early on. You’d be surprised about the number of such applicants. I avoid algorithm/data structure exercises here and try to come up with somewhat interesting ones. Some companies use a much heavier set of exercises and judge your technical skills solely on this. While I disagree with that strategy, you need to get prepared for this, too.</li><li>Take-home assignment – this is one of the most polarizing interview steps for engineers. Some hate it, claiming it’s just free labor for the companies, and it takes too much time. Others love it because they feel they have the freedom to give it much time, really showing off their skills in their own comfortable environment. <a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/take-home-assignment-mistakes-which-will-guarantee-someone-else-gets-the-job-36bcee1cec1d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whichever camp you’re in</a>, you can expect some companies requiring this. You usually get a somewhat specified problem to solve, and you’re given different levels of freedom on how to solve it – some companies don’t mind you choosing whichever stack you like; others will even specify the framework.</li><li>Onsite workshop / remote workshop – I think this is the most interesting of all steps (well, for me, at least). It’s about solving problems together with people from the company in a simulated environment. You’ll need to show your communication, decision-making, and even prioritization skills here. Sure, people will look at your code’s quality, too, but ‘soft skills’ are just as important here. We’ll get strong signals about how it would be to have you on the team.</li></ul>

<p>Take the guesswork out of the equation. If you feel you don’t have enough information to prepare for your technical interview, just ask for more! We’re here to help you succeed. I really mean it. Sometimes we aren’t doing a great job with sharing enough information proactively about the interview steps but that’s not intentional! I’m always happy to help you prepare better – ask about anything, please. You’re doing both of us a favor with that. Simply ask during the previous technical interview step or just drop me or the recruiter an email at any time.</p>

<p>Make sure you arrive at your technical interview on time. If you can’t, for some reason, please let us know, we’ll happily reorganize for another time, no hard feelings (sh*t happens). Showing up on time isn’t only about respecting each other’s schedule – interview time slots are usually 100% utilized and by arriving 10 minutes late you’re reducing your own chance to be successful. You’re also making it more stressful for yourself than necessary. If you need time for commute or for your Zoom/Google Meet setup, think ahead and give yourself a buffer before the start. You’ll also love the extra 10 minutes before the interview to tune in and get calmer.</p>

<p>The biggest mistake you can do is thinking you understand the problem or what’s asked of you and jumping right into coding in the technical interview. Take your time, carefully read the problem statement, distill it, don’t think of solutions just yet. When you feel you understand what’s asked of you or when you thought about clarifying questions to ask, communicate. <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/paraphrasing-summarizing.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paraphrase</a> what you understood from the problem statement so you can verify it with your interviewers. Only when you’re on the same page can you shift into solution mode. Even if you come up with the best solution ultimately if you skip this step I’ll remember and have doubts about how it’d be to work with you. Thinking aloud is really useful here – it will help you and help me too to understand what’s on your mind.</p>

<p>Even if you know your trade and you’re the best engineer in the world, if you fail to communicate clearly during the technical interview we’ll have no way of knowing. This takes practice for most people, so take your time and prepare! Use standard terms that other engineers can relate to, avoid passive voice, and be able to articulate what’s going on in your mind while you’re thinking. If you need some time to think quietly, say so, don’t just fall silent suddenly. We’re trying our best to communicate our expectations around this but it might be a bit late when you’re in the interview. Trust me on this one, practice here goes a long way.</p>

<p>While you’d think the technical interview is about you answering questions, expect that you will need to ask a lot of them, too! When you are in the interview and something is not clear don’t default to thinking “Oh god, I should know this, I should understand” – sometimes we are interested in how you behave in such situations, and sometimes we’re just simply not good enough in giving enough context. If you’re stuck, a good technique is to ask for clarification! It’s also 100% OK to say things like “I didn’t quite get that. Could you rephrase please?” or “I’m not sure I understand what you’re asking”. These are good signals! I expect my team members to behave like this. These are not signals of you failing. I know it feels like that, but trust me, it’s just your brain playing tricks on you. I highlight this during the interview several times, to make sure the candidate feels safe asking such questions. Another technique I wholeheartedly welcome is paraphrasing – e.g. “What I understood from what you said is that I should implement this using co-monads” (said nobody ever).</p>

<p>Make us see that you’re deeply proficient in at least one technology. This can be a programming language, for example. Also, demonstrate that you know the adjacent technologies – most companies are looking for so-called <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidmichels/2019/09/27/going-pi-shaped-how-to-prepare-for-the-work-of-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">T-shape</a> engineers. This means that mentioning other aspects of the problem and the solution goes a long way. For example, if you’re asked to implement a service in NodeJS, mention how you’d deploy, monitor, and scale it, even if that’s not explicitly asked. No need to go into too many details (unless people ask you). If you’re only focused on a single piece of the puzzle I’ll have a hard time seeing how you’d perform well in a changing environment (where you’ll need to make connections and work on multiple zoom levels and be ready). This is a very generic statement and might not be true in the case of highly specialized roles, of course. On the other hand, if …</p></div></div></div>

<p>Roughly three years ago we started <a href="https://instagram.com/treetalks.lk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TreeTalks</a>, it was a very simple idea, we deliver cacti, succulents and indoor plants to people who ordered them online.</p>
<p>Our main target group was people and companies who wanted to have a cacti, or an indoor plants. People who are working in offices loved to have an indoor plant to decorate their desk, companies loved to gift plants for their employees.</p>
<p>We also implemented the idea around gifting, people can gift an indoor plant to their friends, partners, friends etc. Every pot will be customised according to their needs, everything will be hand-painted, and it will include a message or a quote suggested by the user.</p>
<p>The idea was a niche one, and there was only one other similar small business who was doing somewhat similar idea. And our business grew and grew, people were happy to get an indoor plant as a gift, especially a customised one. </p>
<p>Well, you get the idea. Business was great, business was growing. Yet there was something that always bothered in the back of my mind, and I knew it was just a matter of time before the inevitable.</p>

<p>In one of Peter Thiel books called <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0804139296/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0804139296&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gogrubit-20&amp;linkId=109fe33fe9ea7fdaaa1eb6e3bf26c48e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zero to One</a>, </strong> he outlines several characteristics that define a monopoly.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Branding – </strong>Something that Apple does so well. Their brand is recognised everywhere, there is no company that does branding better than Apple.</li><li><strong>Proprietary technology – </strong>A monopoly should have a proprietary technology, for example Google. Google’s monopoly on search is built on top of their proprietary search algorithm. There is no other company in search that has an algorithm better than Google.</li><li><strong>Network effect – </strong>Something Facebook and its group of companies have in common. Even if someone else come up with a better solution, still they can’t beat Facebook because of it’s network effect.</li><li><strong>Economics of scale – </strong>Amazon is a good example for a monopoly with economy of scale. Amazon even though started out as a website to sell books online had the potential to sell just about anything they want though their website. The books were just the foot on the door, once they started expanding they had the potential to expand in to anywhere they wanted.</li></ul>
<p>So once I first read these principals by Peter Thiel, I know that my business had nothing. Three was very low barrier to entry, anyone could do it, and there was nothing proprietary in what we did, no network effect, we had nothing.</p>
<p>So what this meant was that, anyone was able to copy our business and do what we did. </p>
<h2>What copycats do</h2>
<p>For the first two years, there was no competition. People tried to come up with places that offered similar service to ours, but none of them succeeded.</p>
<p>But since we are living in a pandemic, and people need to find some extra income, more and more people started copying our business. And copying our business was easy, why?</p>
<ul><li>There is no barrier to entry</li><li>No one need to invest a big capital</li><li>There are were only few resources needed to get started</li><li>No special skill needed, anyone with drawing skills can do it</li><li>No propriotory technology</li></ul>
<p>Now when I scroll through Facebook and Instagram I see someone starting an instagram page or Facebook page to do exactly what we are doing.</p>
<p>And one or two copycats are easy to manage, however, just like everything else copycats also have a network effect. When a person see someone copying something, they also feel like copying it. They too want to jump in and to cash in when there is opportunity. </p>
<h2>Copycats drags the price down</h2>
<p>Copycats when there are plenty creates competition among themselves. I know that competition is a good thing, when we started TreeTalks, and when there was one other business doing the something, we had a nice completion amongst ourselves, each tried to better the other, and grab more fans on social media. But this was a healthy competition, the competition between the two pushed us to the limits and created the best versions of ourselves.</p>
<p>However, the competition that we have today, competition among copycats is not a healthy competition. It’s a fight to sell the product at the lowest price possible. And customers also want the lowest price, but there is a limit where one should not cross, and need to have a reasonable profit to the effort that you put it.</p>
<p>The same thing can be seen in freelancer platforms like Fivver and WpWork etc. Freelancers (specially from South Asia) tend to drag the price down to a point where professional developers, designers would not like to offer.</p>
<p><strong>Copycats and competition, even though is good for consumer can be bad for the growth of an industry. </strong></p>
<h2>I knew this day would come</h2>
<p>I knew this day would come, I’m happy that I created a small niche brand in our country, and made a decent income along the way. And I guess like all good business it’s time to pivot. The brand that we created, and the customers we gained must be used as the foot on the door for us to get into something better.</p>
<h2>Think before you start</h2>
<p>When you start something, always think about what Peter Thiel said. Make sure your business ticks at least one or more points of a monopoly. </p>
<p>If it does then awesome, but if it doesn’t that’s also fine. But make sure to keep it in the back of your mind that you should always be ready to pivot, or change the direction. Because copycats are coming to get you.</p>
<p>Always try to be a monopoly.</p>

<p>This document is summarised in the table below. It shows the linear models underlying common parametric and “non-parametric” tests. Formulating all the tests in the same language highlights the many similarities between them.

<div id="the-simplicity-underlying-common-tests">

<p>Most of the common statistical models (t-test, correlation, ANOVA; chi-square, etc.) are special cases of linear models or a very close approximation. This beautiful simplicity means that there is less to learn. In particular, it all comes down to <span>\(y = a \cdot x + b\)</span> which most students know from highschool. Unfortunately, stats intro courses are usually taught as if each test is an independent tool, needlessly making life more complicated for students and teachers alike.</p>
<p>This needless complexity multiplies when students try to rote learn the parametric assumptions underlying each test separately rather than deducing them from the linear model.</p>
<p>For this reason, I think that teaching linear models first and foremost and <em>then</em> name-dropping the special cases along the way makes for an excellent teaching strategy, emphasizing <em>understanding</em> over rote learning. Since linear models are the same across frequentist, Bayesian, and permutation-based inferences, I’d argue that it’s better to start with modeling than p-values, type-1 errors, Bayes factors, or other inferences.</p>
<p>Concerning the teaching of <em>“non-parametric”</em> tests in intro-courses, I think that we can justify <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie-to-children">lying-to-children</a> and teach “non-parametric”" tests as if they are merely ranked versions of the corresponding parametric tests. It is much better for students to think “ranks!” than to believe that you can magically throw away assumptions. Indeed, the Bayesian equivalents of “non-parametric”" tests implemented in <a href="https://jasp-stats.org/">JASP</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06941">literally just do (latent) ranking</a> and that’s it. For the frequentist “non-parametric”" tests considered here, this approach is highly accurate for N &gt; 15.</p>

<h3> Theory: As linear models</h3>
<p>Model: the recipe for <span>\(y\)</span> is a slope (<span>\(\beta_1\)</span>) times <span>\(x\)</span> plus an intercept (<span>\(\beta_0\)</span>, aka a straight line).</p>
<p><span>\(y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x \qquad \mathcal{H}_0: \beta_1 = 0\)</span></p>
<p>… which is a math-y way of writing the good old <span>\(y = ax + b\)</span> (here ordered as <span>\(y = b + ax\)</span>). In R we are lazy and write <code>y ~ 1 + x</code> which R reads like <code>y = 1*number + x*othernumber</code> and the task of t-tests, lm, etc., is simply to find the numbers that best predict <span>\(y\)</span>.</p>
<p>Either way you write it, it’s an intercept (<span>\(\beta_0\)</span>) and a slope (<span>\(\beta_1\)</span>) yielding a straight line:</p>
<div>
<pre><code># Fixed correlation
D_correlation = data.frame(MASS::mvrnorm(30, mu = c(0.9, 0.9), Sigma = matrix(c(1, 0.8, 1, 0.8), ncol = 2), empirical = TRUE))  # Correlated data

</div>
<p>This is often simply called a <strong>regression</strong> model which can be extended to <strong>multiple regression</strong> where there are several <span>\(\beta\)</span>s and on the right-hand side multiplied with the predictors. Everything below, from <a href="#t1">one-sample t-test</a> to <a href="#anova2">two-way ANOVA</a> are just special cases of this system. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p>As the name implies, the <strong>Spearman rank correlation</strong> is a <strong>Pearson correlation</strong> on rank-transformed <span>\(x\)</span> and <span>\(y\)</span>:</p>
<p><span>\(rank(y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot rank(x) \qquad \mathcal{H}_0: \beta_1 = 0\)</span></p>
<p>I’ll introduce <a href="#rank">ranks</a> in a minute. For now, notice that the correlation coefficient of the linear model is identical to a “real” Pearson correlation, but p-values are an approximation which is is <a href="https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/simulations/simulate_spearman.html">appropriate for samples greater than N=10 and almost perfect when N &gt; 20</a>.</p>
<p>Such a nice and non-mysterious equivalence that many students are left unaware of! Visualizing them side by side including data labels, we see this rank-transformation in action:</p>
<div>
<pre><code># Spearman intercept
intercept_spearman = coefficients(lm(rank(X2) ~ rank(X1), D_correlation))[1]

# Spearman plot
P_spearman = ggplot(D_correlation, aes(x=rank(X1), y=rank(X2))) +
  geom_smooth(method=lm, se=FALSE, lwd=2, aes(color='beta_1')) + 
  geom_text(aes(label=label_rank), nudge_y=1, size=3, color='dark gray') + 
  geom_segment(x=-100, xend=100, 
               y=intercept_spearman, yend=intercept_spearman, 
               lwd=2, aes(color='beta_0')) + 
  scale_color_manual(name=NULL, values=c("blue", "red"), labels=c(bquote(beta[0]*" (intercept)"), bquote(beta[1]*" (slope)")))

# Stich together using patchwork
(theme_axis(P_pearson, legend.position=c(0.5, 0.1)) + geom_text(aes(label=label_num), nudge_y=0.1, size=3, color='dark gray') + labs(title='         Pearson')) + (theme_axis(P_spearman, xlim=c(-7.5, 30), ylim=c(-7.5, 30), legend.position=c(0.5, 0.1)) + labs(title='         Spearman'))</code></pre>

<div id="rank">
<h3> Theory: rank-transformation</h3>
<p><code>rank</code> simply takes a list of numbers and “replace” them with the integers of their rank (1st smallest, 2nd smallest, 3rd smallest, etc.). So the result of the rank-transformation <code>rank(c(3.6, 3.4, -5.0, 8.2))</code> is <code>3, 2, 1, 4</code>. See that in the figure above?</p>
<p>A <em>signed</em> rank is the same, just where we rank according to absolute size first and then add in the sign second. So the signed rank here would be <code>2, 1, -3, 4</code>. Or in code:</p>
<pre><code>signed_rank = function(x) sign(x) * rank(abs(x))</code></pre>
<p>I hope I don’t offend anyone when I say that ranks are easy; yet it’s all you need to do to convert most parametric tests into their “non-parametric” counterparts! One interesting implication is that <em>many “non-parametric tests” are about as parametric as their parametric counterparts with means, standard deviations, homogeneity of variance, etc. - just on rank-transformed data</em>. That’s why I put “non-parametric” in quotation marks.</p>
</div>
<div id="r-code-pearson-correlation">
<h3> R code: Pearson correlation</h3>
<p>It couldn’t be much simpler to run these models in R. They yield identical <code>p</code> and <code>t</code>, but there’s a catch: <code>lm</code> gives you the <em>slope</em> and even though that is usually much more interpretable and informative than the <em>correlation coefficient</em> <em>r</em>, you may still want <em>r</em>. Luckily, the slope becomes <code>r</code> if <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> have identical standard deviations. For now, we will use <code>scale(x)</code> to make <span>\(SD(x) = 1.0\)</span> and <span>\(SD(y) = 1.0\)</span>:</p>
<pre><code>a = cor.test(y, x, method = "pearson") # Built-in
b = lm(y ~ 1 + x) # Equivalent linear model: y = Beta0*1 + Beta1*x
c = lm(scale(y) ~ 1 + scale(x))  # On scaled vars to recover r</code></pre><p>

I’m not diabetic or even prediabetic. But when I stumbled on the chance to wear a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) as part of a challenge partnered with Levels, I jumped on it. I’ve been conscious of blood sugar my whole life because I suffered from spells of hypoglycemia as a child.</span></p><p><span>Hypoglycemia is when your blood sugar drops below 70mg/dL. I still don’t know why it happened, but it wasn’t fun. When my glucose levels dropped too low, I’d experience cold sweats, lightheadedness, trembling hands, and an elevated heart rate. These symptoms were likely the result of my body releasing epinephrine (adrenaline) to stabilize my blood glucose.</span></p><p><span>Over the years, I started to pick up on which foods caused my blood sugar to crash. The biggest culprits were cereal for breakfast and sweet tea later in the day. Every time I ate a big bowl of cereal before school (usually Frosted Mini-Wheats or Honey Nut Cheerios), I would crash around 10:30 a.m. like clockwork. Sometimes the crashes were so bad that I thought I might pass out, so I’d call my mom to check me out of school.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-200x200.jpg" data-src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-200x200.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" data-srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-200x200.jpg 200w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture.jpg 512w" data-sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-200x200.jpg 200w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture.jpg 512w"></p><p><span>Experiencing low blood sugar not only made it hard to focus but was, quite frankly, a scary experience for someone who didn’t understand what was going on. After missing a few classes from these episodes, my mom decided it was time to change my diet.</span></p><p><span>I went from eating cereal in the mornings to eggs, bacon, and fruit (berries or avocado) and cut out the sweet tea (tough to do for a boy raised in Alabama). Once I made those changes, the crashes stopped, and I had energy throughout the day.</span></p><p><span>At the time, I didn’t fully understand why the switch worked, but I did understand even at a young age that consuming a bunch of carbs and sugar wasn’t good for me. Since then, I’ve become fascinated with maintaining a healthy lifestyle and finding ways to improve my health. My curiosity for seeking ways to optimize my diet is what eventually led me to put a CGM on my arm.</span></p><h2>The Challenge</h2><p><span>I first learned about the 28-day </span><a href="https://www.wearablechallenge.com/"><span>Wearable Challenge</span></a><span> from following </span><a href="https://twitter.com/jwmares"><span>Justin Mares</span></a><span> on Twitter. I’ve followed Justin for quite a while since he knew a lot about the health-and-wellness space after founding two health food companies, </span><a href="https://www.kettleandfire.com/"><span>Kettle &amp; Fire</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://perfectketo.com/"><span>Perfect Keto</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>In October, Justin shared an </span><a href="https://twitter.com/jwmares/status/1315696415213936641"><span>interesting tweet</span></a><span> about a weight-loss challenge that only required participants to track their blood glucose with a </span><a href="https://www.levelshealth.com/"><span>Levels</span></a><span> CGM. After reading the tweet, I knew this was something I had to try. Even though the challenge focused on weight loss, I enrolled immediately because I wanted to experiment with a CGM to see how my body reacts to my diet.</span></p><p><span>The challenge required me to keep my glucose levels below 120mg/dL even after a meal. For every day I went over, I’d lose $25 (talk about having skin in the game). The challenge started with a three-day grace period, so I could experiment with my diet to see how it impacted my glucose without getting penalized.</span></p><p><span>(For context, according to the</span><a href="https://www.idf.org/component/attachments/attachments.html?id=728&amp;task=download"> <span>International Diabetes Federation (IDF) guidelines</span></a><span>, your glucose values are “normal” if they stay below 140mg/dL after meals and return to pre-meal levels within two to three hours. Since this is a challenge geared towards weight loss, the upper limit was set slightly lower.)</span></p><p><b>Related article: </b><a href="https://www.levelshealth.com/blog/what-should-my-glucose-levels-be-ultimate-guide"><b>What should your glucose levels be? Here’s the ultimate guide to healthy blood sugar ranges</b></a></p><p><span>To help stay in the target range, each member of the challenge had access to a WhatsApp group chat to support each other. The group chat was a place for members to share what diet was working well, vent their frustrations when they failed, and provide a positive environment for motivation and encouragement. This aspect was less useful for me (I ended up muting it after a few days) because my goals were different. Still, I could see how much other members appreciated the accountability and support.</span></p><h2>What I Learned</h2><p><span>Overall, I found the challenge to be a learning experience filled with joyful moments of self-confirmation, times of utter disappointment, and a few surprises in between.</span></p><h3>The Good</h3><p><span>The best news was discovering that my typical breakfast of three eggs, bacon, and half an avocado drizzled in olive oil caused almost no glycemic response, nor did my afternoon snack of raw almonds. The app showed that these foods consistently hit a perfect score. Since I eat these foods most often, it was comforting knowing that I had a strong foundation.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3.png" data-src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3.png" alt="" width="400" height="600" data-srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3.png 400w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3-267x400.png 267w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3-133x200.png 133w" data-sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3.png 400w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3-267x400.png 267w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3-133x200.png 133w"></p><p><span>The challenge also confirmed my belief that eating a low-carb paleo/keto-inspired diet consisting of mostly meat, vegetables, and healthy fats (olive oil, coconut oil, and butter/ghee) was optimal for maintaining consistent glucose levels.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3.png" data-src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3.png" alt="" width="350" height="500" data-srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3-140x200.png 140w" data-sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3-140x200.png 140w"></p><p><span>Over the past four years, I’ve made a conscious effort to cook meals that avoid simple carbs, vegetable oils, and sweeteners, and it felt really good knowing I’d been making the right choices.</span></p><h3>The Not-So-Good</h3><p><span>The foods with the most considerable impact on my blood sugar were white rice and craft beer, although I can’t say I was surprised. Unfortunately, I love both of these things (so long Chipotle burrito bowls). It was disappointing to finally have to stare down the truth instead of continuing to live in willful ignorance.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1.png" data-src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1.png" alt="" width="350" height="500" data-srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1-140x200.png 140w" data-sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1-140x200.png 140w"></p><p><span>I was also disappointed to learn how much sweet potato spikes my blood sugar. I knew sweet potatoes had a lower </span><a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/glycemic-index-and-glycemic-load-for-100-foods"><span>glycemic index (GI)</span></a><span> than regular potatoes, but they still pushed me over the limit. I plan to keep them in my diet but will be more conscious about how often I eat them.</span></p><h3>The Surprising</h3><p><span>The biggest surprise of the challenge was discovering that quality tequila (G4 Reposado) had almost no effect on my blood sugar. Tequila that is 100% agave has zero carbs because of the distillation process (an average craft IPA has around 13g of carbs). Since beer is my usual go-to if I want a drink, I was happy to learn there was a healthier substitute I already enjoyed.</span></p><p><span>I also recognize I need to be careful here. Just because I didn’t experience a glucose spike doesn’t mean I didn’t have a biological response. </span><a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/85/6/1545/4632987"><span>Research suggests</span></a><span> that alcohol decreases the liver’s ability to make new glucose, so it can trigger hypoglycemia, especially if you’re fasting or in a ketogenic state.</span></p><p><b>Related article: </b><a href="https://www.levelshealth.com/blog/alcohol-and-metabolic-fitness"><b>What does alcohol do to my glucose levels?</b></a></p><p><span>Another big surprise was discovering that my glucose levels aren’t just impacted by <em>what</em> I eat but also <em>when</em> I eat. I confirmed this because I meal prep twice a week to save time by eating the same meal multiple days in a row. (You may find that boring; I find it efficient.)</span></p><p><span>Eating the same thing for lunch and dinner on several challenge days was great for understanding how my body responds to food at different times of the day. All else being equal, my glucose spikes more after dinner than it does for lunch—sometimes by as much as 20mg/dL!</span></p><p><span>Even more surprising was noticing how little change there was from eating the same meal from day to day, but then having a large variance between lunch and dinner. I’m sure there’s a reason why, but I couldn’t tease a convincing explanation out of the data.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1.png" data-src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1.png" alt="" width="350" height="500" data-srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1-140x200.png 140w" data-sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1-140x200.png 140w"></p><h2>What’s Changed</h2><p><span>Since the challenge ended, I’ve made a few adjustments to my diet. I’m not one to make radical changes (like cutting out a particular food from my diet forever), but now I’m more careful when I still want to splurge. Here are some of the changes I’ve made:</span></p><ul><li aria-level="1"><span>If I’m going to drink, I opt for quality spirits (neat or on the rocks) over craft beer or cocktails loaded with sugar.</span></li><li aria-level="1"><span>I’ve reconsidered the idea of a cheat day. I still plan on enjoying the occasional night of pizza and beer or tacos and margaritas, but a cheat day isn’t just a day. Now that I’m aware that the effects of an unhealthy meal can last for 2-3 days, I better make sure that the meal is worth it.</span></li><li aria-level="1"><span>I need to avoid any sweetened beverage, no matter how “healthy.”&nbsp; Smoothies, sweetened kombucha, and sweetened coffee wrecked my glucose levels, even though they’re often touted as healthy choices. Better to eat my sweets after a hearty meal than to drink them.</span></li><li aria-level="1"><span>I’m now more conscious of what I order when I eat out. For example, I opt for the salad at Chipotle instead of the burrito bowl. I’ve also switched to eating more sashimi instead of sushi to avoid eating as much rice.</span></li></ul><p><span>Even though the challenge only lasted 28 days, I learned more about my diet and lifestyle in those four weeks than I had from any previous blood test or book on dieting. The challenge confirmed that I already eat a healthy diet, but I need to make a few changes to ensure a healthy life for decades to come.</span></p><p><em><span>To learn more about the 28-day </span><a href="https://www.wearablechallenge.com/"><span>Wearable Challenge</span></a><span><a href="https://www.wearablechallenge.com/">, click here</a>.</span></em></p><p><em>Adapted from an original post <a href="https://lawsonblake.com/continuous-glucose-monitoring-levels-health/">here</a>.&nbsp;</em></p></div></div></div></section><section id="blog-single-content-related" data-ani-anchor=""></section></main>         </div>]]>

<p>It's been more than three years since I've been hooked into Crystal Lang. For
those who don't know, Crystal promises to be able to write high-level code,
borrowing syntax from Ruby while adding strongly-typed yet inferred parameters
and avoiding the null exception problem. It also provides a complete and powerful <em>stdlib</em> and uses concepts from new generation languages like Go Lang. </p>
<p>Oh, and a powerful on-compile time macro system making runtime reflection obsolete! </p>
<p>Did it fulfill its promises? Yes. At some costs.</p>
<p>I started developing in Crystal Lang out of curiosity and pleasure, as I thought
this is a fun language to work with. 
Then I challenged myself to see what I was able to write, and it ended up with <em><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/anykeyh/clear">Clear</a></em>, an ORM I've built from scratch.</p>
<p>Eventually, I started working on a booking platform. Getting free hands on the technical side, I decided to design the backend in Crystal. </p>
<p>Nine months later and an app finished, I can give some insight about using Crystal in a professional environment; the <strong>good</strong>, the <strong>bad</strong>, and the <strong>ugly</strong>, and how to develop an app in a language that is still considered confidential and in a pre-release state.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The good</h2>
<p>Crystal kept its promise in being a very expressive language. It allowed me to
write clean high-level business code, allowing to lower the gap between clients
requirement and code syntax. Big <em>oui</em> here!</p>
<pre><code>
post <span>"/contact_us"</span> <span>do</span> <span>|env|</span>
  form = ContactUsForm.from_json(env.request.body.not_nil!)
  Mail.deliver ContactUsEmail.new(form.email, form.title, form.message)
<span>end</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The customer had some very complex rules when bookings were moved or canceled,
and I was aware that two teams of developers had given up on this project prior
to my work. </p>
<p>I decided to go for a Controller - Business Logic - Model 3-tier on
the backend and keep the View and Presentation on the frontend (using Typescript
and MithrilJS). </p>
<p>Because Crystal is strongly typed, the work to be done on spec
and coverage of the code is strongly reduced, in comparison to a Ruby or Python
code. </p>
<p>80% of the bugs occurring in those script languages have their root cause
laying in lose parameter type or nullable type. Both cases are covered at
compile time in Crystal. Basically, I wrote only 120 test cases on this
application, covering the different business cases of the user. In Ruby, for an
application of this scale, I would be around 250 to 400 tests.</p>
<p>At release, the application faced very few bugs. 
Some edges case we forgot with the client were failing. But so far, the compiler did an excellent job in preventing most of the bugs. </p>
<p>Because the language is compiled, it is wonderful to use within a Kubernetes cluster: The app starts in less than 200ms, allowing horizontal scaling, health-check and automatic restart of the app much more convenient than a big Rails application. </p>
<p>Memory usage is relatively low, peeking to ~250Mb and I never experienced any memory leak whatsoever. </p>
<p>And it runs fast. Really fast. For those who used to work with Rails, Django, or Laravel,
we are comparing snails with a cheetah there. </p>
<p>Actually, it runs so fast that I decided to do some complex data aggregation and transformation directly in Crystal instead of PostgreSQL.</p>
<h2 id="the-bad">The bad</h2>
<p>The major challenge I faced in keeping a good pace and being productive was the
compilation time. It takes around 20 seconds to compile/run spec on my i7 8750H.
We are talking of an app with ~9000 LOC, few shards (library), for a grand total
of probably less than 100k LOC. This compilation time is mostly due to the very
dynamic nature of Crystal lang, the work needed to be done at
compile-time  (<em> macro and type inference being the culprits </em>) , and the lack of
incremental compilation at the time of writing this article. 20 seconds seems
not much, but during a whole working day, it builds-up leading to a
non-negligible loss of productivity. For the defense of the language, the
problem is also at the developer level: it is just enough to lose focus, browse
few tabs on Reddit, check a video on Youtube, and can - too often! -  snowball
to minutes or more. Guilty I am!</p>
<p>Another challenge was the usage of the young library ecosystem. The language is
still confidential and some shards  (the name which is given to libraries in the Crystal
world) are not working with the latest version of Crystal, or lack of support,
as some authors just gave up on the language or have little to no time to
maintain them. 
I can't complain, as I am too responsible for this, as I gave little maintenance the last months over <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/anykeyh/clear">Clear ORM</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-ugly">The ugly?</h2>
<p>During development, I faced a few but worrying bugs, where the compiler was
literally crashing without any idea of where the problem came from. It also
happens that using some complex features of the language, like inheriting from
generic classes could lead to segfault during execution after a while. Issues
were raised and the Crystal Lang team fixed everything on short notice.</p>
<p>Since now, I'm not able to build the backend using <code>--release</code> flag due to
segfault at compile time. 
This is not a problem <em>per se</em>, as even without the optimization, the backend spends like 90% of its time waiting for PostgreSQL. </p>
<p>I still get a random crash of the application I gave up fixing for now.
Basically, the app can't access anymore to the PostgreSQL database after a
while.
This occurs on average between 3 to 30 days of running; I defined an
<code>/healthcheck</code> endpoint throwing a simple <code>SELECT 1</code>; to check the connection, called each second by Kubernetes.</p>
<p>With multiple pods redundancy, and thanks to low
memory foot-print and quick start-up time, pods defaulted got evicted and
recreated in a matter of seconds.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p><strong>If I did this app using Rails, would have I been more productive?</strong></p>
<p>It's hard to say, as I spent quite a lot of time debugging, improving, and
maintaining Clear ORM within the scope of this project. I think the
productivity difference would have been negligible.</p>
<p>What you would win by having a strict compiler avoiding your hours of debugging 
and specs definition, you lose by the compile-time, the need to rewrite some 
basic functionality you could get via gems. </p>
<p><strong>Would I recommend people using Crystal?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are aware that something might break, as the ecosystem is still young.</li>
</ul>
<p>Avoiding monolithic application patterns will certainly reduce the compile-time
problems. Having micro-service architecture is a must-have if you want to
develop with Crystal, as each service will take much less time to compile, test
and deploy. </p>
<p>The low memory footprint and fast execution time fit perfectly with
this architecture. If you come from the Ruby world, you will feel at ease with
the syntax but will have to learn new design patterns of face issues with
compile-time or overly complex macro/code.
A common mistake is to try to use open hash, JSON, or collection to realize too late that strongly typed language doesn't like open structures</p>
<p><strong>Compared to Go Lang or Rust, how do Crystal fits?</strong> </p>
<p>Go Lang is very dull and <em>feels</em> austere in my opinion. It's not a bad
technology, but it feels not enough magical for my personal taste.
Rust is great but it remains less elegant to write business code with it. 
The magic Rust does with the memory still adds a burden in terms of readability,
with reference, lifecycle, and other symbols polluting the essence of the code
in my opinion. </p>
<p>Knowing that the Crystal Lang team is aware of most of the
problems above and working hard to release the v1.0 of the language, I'm
confident the language will know a bright future and all the traction it merits.</p>

			<p>Note: <em>I wrote a quite complete article on the Zen but for some reason it went down in seo history. I am tired seeing people write ‘in-depth’ article with commentaries from the top of their head and materials they pulled out of their pockets. I’m publishing the article in here.  The commentary part is built from the sayings of Brett Cannon, Guido, Chris Angelico, Nick Coghlan, Raymond Hettinger &amp; co. Warning: read only if you are a fan of Python. Last notes: I do hope learners will get a great glimpse of how the Zen can help them structure their code and give them better insight and foresight. It’s a documentation  of how practically the Zen is applied in Python decisions.</em></p>

</ul>
<p>The Zen of Python saw light for the first time in 1999. It’s one of the many aspects that adds to the awesomeness of Python. It’s a set of expressions which corners the spirit of the language. It was enounced by Tim Peters, a reputable software engineer, master Pythonista and Python’s ‘most prolific and tenacious core developer’ in the words of none other than Guido [18]. This article bases itself mostly on the saying of core devs and highly reputable members. It makes a great gift to all those interested in the history of the sysadmin script which took the world by (pleasent) surprise.</p>

<p>The way the Zen came about was unique. It was a reflection from the unknown Patrick Phalen about the Python feel [1]:</p>

  … the more I use<br>
  and learn about the language, the more I find myself appreciating the<br>
  nice balance and heft Guido gave to it. Yet there doesn’t seem to be a<br>
  single document that sums up that “aesthetic,” but rather it<br>
  tends to appear piecemeal, over time, mostly in the Wisdom of Chairman Tim.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It was a call to infuse the Python spirit into aliens from Perl Land and beyond. It requested some 10 to 20 lines which sums up the Python view</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Would both Guido and TIm Peters be willing to collaborate on a short<br>
  paper — call it “The Python Way” for lack of a better title — which<br>
  sets out the 10-20 prescriptives they might offer to those who come to<br>
  Python from other languages and immediately want to find a way to bend<br>
  it into uncomfortable positions — (implement closures, etc.).
</p></blockquote>
<p>It was a request to prevent Pythonistas from falling into the error of campaigning for changing the language. It advocated for imbuing yourself with the language’s flow and change your ways and views instead of the other way round. In the original mail, it quoted Fredrik Lundh as saying “sure looks like the ‘community’ thinks that changing the<br>
language is more important that using it…” [5]. Patrick clarifies:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  What I have in mind is sort of a very brief Strunk-&amp;-White-like<br>
  “Elements of Style” for Python, which suggests fundamental idiomatic<br>
  recommendations for operating within the spirit of the language. A<br>
  distillation of Python Zen is what I’m talking about — something to go<br>
  off and contemplate when the “fix Python now” decibels become a bit<br>
  much.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The Zen school lays out hints and guidelines. You understand by your own exercise and by the company of someone seasoned in the craft</p>
<blockquote><p>
  it de-emphasizes mere knowledge of sutras and doctrine and favors direct understanding through spiritual practice and interaction with an accomplished teacher or Master.[2]
</p></blockquote>
<p>The Zen was a request to help Python people achieve the Python state of mind so that your code resonates well with the structure behind, conveying in the process the associated beauty, elegance and finesse. Those guidelines if well impregnated would make your code revered whithin the circle of true monks.</p>
<p>But, curiously enough, Tim tells [19]:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  If I were to change anything, I’d drop the reference to “Zen”.  That wasn’t<br>
  part of the original, and was added by someone else.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the title is not from the author [23]</p>
<p>Strunk &amp; White is the name of two people, viz William Strunk and Elwyn Brooks White. Strunk wrote <em>The Elements of Style</em>, acclaimed by the Times as one of the most influencial books since 1923 [3]. White who was Strunk’s student and reviser after the professor’s death describes the book as:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  a forty-three page summation of the case<br>
  for cleanliness, accuracy, and brevity in the use of English [4]
</p></blockquote>
<p>The effect of the book is described below, he being Strunk:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  he omitted so<br>
  many needless words, and omitted them so forcibly and with such eagerness and obvious<br>
  relish, that he often seemed in the position of having shortchanged himself — a man left<br>
  with nothing more to say yet with time to fill, a radio prophet who had out-distanced the<br>
  clock. Will Strunk got out of this predicament by a simple trick: he uttered every sentence<br>
  three times
</p></blockquote>
<p>One effect of applying the Zen would then also be lighter code files.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1484108678824-e6543e2e4230?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=752&amp;q=80" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></p>

<p>Master Tim heard the plea, approved the demand and responded accordingly [6]</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Clearly a job for Guido alone — although I doubt it’s one he’ll take on<br>
  (fwiw, I wish he would too!).  Here’s the outline he would start from,<br>
  though <wink>:
</wink></p></blockquote>
<pre><code>Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
</code></pre>
<p>The 20th was left for Guido to fill in:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  There you go:  20 Pythonic Fec^H^H^HTheses on the nose, counting the one I’m<br>
  leaving for Guido to fill in.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Venerable Tim shares exactly how the lines came about [15]:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  It was a throwaway python-list post. But like all great triumphs of literature, it was written during commercials breaks while watching professional wrestling on TV, and munching on a ham sandwich. All true!
</p></blockquote>
<p>Yet, the author is emphatical: It’s complete and more than meets the demand [6]:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  If the answer to <em>any</em> Python design issue<br>
  isn’t obvious after reading those — well, I just give up <wink>.
</wink></p></blockquote>
<p>The above also reveals the purpose of the Zen: To address design issues. And it’s not a simple matter. Guido says [18]:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  In many ways, the design philosophy I used when creating Python is probably one of the main reasons for its ultimate success.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The Zen only gives the outlines, in contrast to Strunk and White which gives explanations and examples in addition. Thus the need for commentaries. These help the non-initiated without being a replacement for the company of the bright minds.</p>
<p>In a time of fluctuating and steered standards, the reference in the actual PEP8 document to Strunk and White in the usage of the English language caused a bitter, ugly and messy thread [7]. It caused some of the best people of the community to forego following  python-list [8], a casual reminder that being too open without limit hurts.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593297372323-2ba78409d0b1?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=750&amp;q=80" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></p>

<p>The Zen has become an important piece of the Python programming language. If you don’t know the Zen, you won’t strike the right chord to communicate with the community. Raymond Hettinger advises:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Before creating more tracker items, please take time to learn about how Python’s history, how it is used, and its cultural norms.  In particular, read the Zen of Python, consider what is meant by duck-typing, what is meant by “a consenting adults language”, what is meant by over-specification, etc.  Python is quite different from Java in this regard. [13]
</p></blockquote>
<p>There’s also a practical aspect to it. It’s popular because it works [14]. It’s the golden guiding principle in pretty much everything Python.</p>
<p>Finally are the Zen points rules? What are they really. Many people take the Zen for rules. The ‘most opinionated linter ever’ at one time actually included the Zen to back their views [9]. It was situations like these which prompted me to write: The Zen Of Python Is A Joke And Here Is Why [10]. It was nice enough for Michael Kennedy and Brian Okken to call it a ‘must read’ on PythonBytes [11].</p>
<p>According to Nick Coghlan, the Zen gives you the idea, not everything [12]:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  This<br>
  challenge is reflected in the fact that the Zen of Python is<br>
  deliberately self-contradictory, as it articulates competing design<br>
  principles to take into consideration, rather than being able to<br>
  provide ironclad rules that avoid the need for human judgement in<br>
  determining which of those design guidelines are most salient in any<br>
  given situation.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Self contradiction is also coincidentally, one of the criticised aspect of Strunk and White [17].<br>
The Zen also goes beyond coding, such as shaping the thought pattern of features [12]:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The thing we work toward as core developers, and aspiring core<br>
  developers, is good design intuition that aligns with the Zen of<br>
  Python. That doesn’t mean we’re all going to be able to perfectly<br>
  articulate that intuition in every case, and even when we can, those<br>
  explanations are themselves generally going to be backed by intuition<br>
  rather than rigorous scientific research.
</p></blockquote>
<p>If ever i myself would have added a 20th one it would have been: “Use your judgement.”. But Nick illustrated it better.</p>
<p>As for the famous <code>import this</code> command, it was Barry Warsaw’s pick. He sneaked it in a this.py in 2001 along with the ROT13 obfuscation [16]. He also mentionned that it was a time ‘when the Python community had a sense of humor’.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1561739091-9d698cb277ec?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=750&amp;q=80" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></p>

<p>Now the time is ripe to see what the Zen actually means. But before we should know that whatever the words<br>
and concepts mean in the Zen is not …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div class="page"><h2>Intro</h2><p>People use computer simulations to both understand the world and design for it. Those who need to know where a satellite will be at some future time build simulations of the forces acting on the satellite and propagate its motion from some known location and velocity. Those who design robots create simulations of the environments their robots will experience in order to test how the robots make decisions and move. And those designing power plants simulate weather, energy demand, and system failures to determine the best design for a range of conditions and uncertainty.</p><p>However, despite the importance and widespread applicability, few receive education on the subject. The best information is scattered in places one might not know to look, and even most simulation textbooks are narrowly targeted to specific applications or tools. The inevitable result is that many simulations suffer from basic problems that have easy solutions.</p><p>This article will set out the critical aspects of building good simulations — that is, simulations that are accurate, easy to develop and analyze, and fast. The first sections deal with how a simulation evolves over time, as this is the core of any simulation. Further sections deal with details that make simulations easier to develop, faster, and applicable to a large number of variations. The target audience is engineers, scientists, and programmers, whether new to creating simulations or experienced. A tiny amount of vector math and calculus is assumed, making this text accessible to first- and second-year undergraduates. By the end, the reader should be able to begin building quality simulations, avoid common pitfalls, communicate the reasons for their decisions to peers, and know where to look for additional resources on specific topics and for the mathematical rigor behind it all.</p><p>We'll start with the motivation for understanding the core of how systems evolve over time.</p><h2 id="TToDt">From \(t\) to \(t+\Delta t\)</h2><p>Let’s get started with a really basic example. Let’s say we have a little moon orbiting a big planet. At some time, we know its position and velocity, and from this we want to simulate the future trajectory.</p><figure><img src="http://www.anuncommonlab.com/articles/how-simulations-work/img/moon_illustration.png"><figcaption>Planet and moon</figcaption></figure><p>We know the planet pulls on the moon with gravity, so the moon’s acceleration at any point in time is:</p><p>$$\vec{a}(t) = -\frac{GM}{r(t)^2} \hat{\vec{r}}(t)$$</p><p>Here, \(\vec{a}(t)\) is the acceleration vector, \(\vec{r}(t)\) is the position of the moon with respect to the center of mass of the planet, \(\hat{\vec{r}}\) denotes a unit vector in the direction of \(\vec{r}\), \(r\) denotes the magnitude of \(\vec{r}\), and \(GM\) is the gravitational constant of the planet (remember high school?). Let’s ignore all other forces that might act on the moon for now, since this is overwhelmingly the biggest. How do we turn this into a simulator? It might seem obvious: if we know \(\vec{r}(t)\) and \(\vec{v}(t)\) for some \(t\), then at some time later, \(t + \Delta t\), if \(\vec{v}\) and \(\vec{a}\) are nearly constant across this \(\Delta t\), we would have:</p><p>$$\vec{v}(t + \Delta t) \approx \vec{v}(t) + \vec{a}(t) \Delta t$$
$$\vec{r}(t + \Delta t) \approx \vec{r}(t) + \vec{v}(t) \Delta t + \frac{1}{2} \vec{a}(t) \Delta t^2$$</p><p>Perhaps by taking a series of small \(\Delta t\) and updating the position and velocity along the way, we'll generate the future trajectory. That certainly seems easy enough, so let's try it out. We'll pick a moon in a circular orbit about the planet. It has a period, \(T\), of 30 time units (we can call them days, but it doesn't really matter) and is located at 1 distance unit from the planet. Since it's a circular orbit, the velocity has magnitude of \(2 \pi / T\) and is perpendicular to the vector from the planet to the moon. Finally, \(GM = \left(\frac{2\pi}{T}\right)^2\). We'll take a series of time steps, each \(\Delta t\) in length. Let's use \(\Delta t\) = 1 time unit, so there should be 30 time steps in the orbit, bringing the moon exactly back to where it started. Here are the results using the “multiply by \(\Delta t\)” method above, plotted on top of the actual future trajectory.</p><figure><img src="http://www.anuncommonlab.com/articles/how-simulations-work/img/moon2.png"><figcaption>Initial simulation</figcaption></figure><p>It's not a very good circle. What went wrong?</p><p>Let's zoom in on the very first time step. Note that as the moon moves, the acceleration should change to always point towards the planet, but since we've assumed the acceleration is constant across \(\Delta t\), the acceleration in this step is always to the left in this figure. This doesn't affect the position all that much, but look at the velocity compared to the true velocity (since this system has a closed form solution, we can compare to an exact value for truth). The stepped velocity wasn't “pulled back” towards the planet enough (since it always pulled left). The result is that the moon is now going a little too fast and to the outside of the true trajectory. This image is not to scale so that we might better see the small difference in the two velocities at the upper left.</p><figure><img src="http://www.anuncommonlab.com/articles/how-simulations-work/img/moon1.png"><figcaption>First time step</figcaption></figure><p>As this continues, the velocity will always have a systematic error, leaning to the outside with every step. The error builds up rapidly, and so our simulated trajectory is not useful. Of course, we used a really big time step. Only 30 time steps for the whole trajectory? That seems ambitious. Let's cut the time step down by a factor of 2. And then by another factor of 2. And then again, again, again, and again.</p><figure><img src="http://www.anuncommonlab.com/articles/how-simulations-work/img/moon3.png"><figcaption>Multiple time steps</figcaption></figure><p>With our smallest time step above we're now taking 1920 time steps, and still the error is huge (given that these are planets).</p><p>Now let's fix it. Note that the stepped trajectory is always to the outside, no matter how small the time step. What if we used some method of stepping that wouldn't have this outward tendency? Something that would take a step, see that the new acceleration is significantly different from the acceleration of the previous step, and figure out what the acceleration was across the time step? Fortunately, some great mathematicians have figured out excellent, all-purpose ways to do this. For example, applying one of the most common and all-purpose methods (it's not tailored to orbits in any way), we can achieve less error than our most precise time step above with only 11 steps. Yes, 11. These are plotted as dots on top of the true trajectory below. Let's find out how.</p><figure><img src="http://www.anuncommonlab.com/articles/how-simulations-work/img/moon4.png"><figcaption>Multiple time steps with a much better solution</figcaption></figure><h2 id="ODEs">Ordinary Differential Equations</h2><p>First, we need to establish what types of things we're going to propagate. When we have systems with some <dfn>state</dfn> (like position and velocity) at some time and we calculate the derivatives of that state (velocity and acceleration for the example) at that time, we call this an <dfn>ordinary differential equation</dfn> (ODE) (and when we're dealing with motion, we call this the <dfn>equation of motion</dfn>). We usually stick all of the parts of the state together into a column matrix and call it the <dfn>state vector</dfn>.</p><p>$$ x(t) = \begin{bmatrix} \vec{r}(t) \\ \vec{v}(t) \end{bmatrix}$$</p><p>Then we have this for the time derivative:</p><p>$$ \frac{d x(t)}{dt} \equiv \dot{x}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} \vec{v}(t) \\ \vec{a}(t) \end{bmatrix}$$</p><p>Then we describe the ODE something like this:</p><p>$$ \dot{x}(t) = f(t, x(t))$$
which just states that the derivatives depend on time and the current state and nothing else. It's also common to drop the explicit dependence on time, because it's generally understood. For our example, we have:
$$ \dot{x} = f(x) = \begin{bmatrix} \vec{v} \\ -\frac{GM}{r^2} \hat{\vec{r}} \end{bmatrix} $$</p><p>When we're keeping track of position by simulating its acceleration, it's a <dfn>second-order system</dfn>, because acceleration is the second-derivative of position. However, in terms of the state vector, \(x\), it's a <dfn>first-order system</dfn> (we calculate \(\dot{x}\) and not \(\ddot{x}\)). This can cause confusion, so we should just remember that the system is ultimately second-order, and we're just conveniently packaging up everything into \(x\) so as to use first-order techniques on \(x\).</p><p>In general, \(f(x)\) is our model of something, which might be nonlinear and even stochastic. The only assumption we make about the whole system is that it's differentiable (smooth-ish). It probably doesn't have a closed-form solution or we'd use the closed-form solution instead of simulating (our circular orbit of course has a closed-form solution, but that's just so that we can compare our simulation to something exact).</p><p>We'll talk about other types of systems (things that aren't ODEs) later. For now, this gives us plenty of great material since a plethora of physical systems are described as ODEs that boil down to \(\dot{x} = f(x)\), such as equations of motion, chemical reactions, thermodynamics, population growth, etc. Having a generic framework to describe these systems therefore lets us describe the solvers in a generic way, making them applicable to a great number of different problems.</p><h2 id="FixedStep">Fixed-Step Solvers</h2><p>In the orbit example, we held the acceleration constant across the time step, and this ultimately created a systemic bias to one side. Of course, we could easily have seen that the acceleration wasn't constant across the time step. For instance, we could have propagated by one time step, re-calculated the acceleration, and used this updated value to determine how the acceleration had changed across the time step, allowing us to revise the step. Drawing from this motivation, an excellent solution was created by Carl Runge and Martin Wilhelm Kutta a long while back. They proposed taking a series of small steps forward, using the derivatives along the way to determine the effective derivatives across the entire time step in such a way that the errors could be made very, very small.</p><h3>Runge-Kutta Fourth Order Method</h3><p>The most common Runge-Kutta method is known as “the” fourth order method, and we'll call it RK4. It involves calculating the derivatives four times like so:</p><ol><li>First, calculate the derivative at \(t\), 
$$ k_1 = f(t, x(t)) $$</li><li>Form an intermediate update of the state, 
$$ x(t + \frac{1}{2} …</li></ol></div></div>

<hr>

<p>Just yesterday, I released my <a href="https://github.com/makeworld-the-better-one/dither">dithering library</a>, written in Go.
It’s the product of many hours of research, experimentation, and refactoring. I’m
excited that it’s finally out, and to see what people create with it. Personally I’d like to create a CLI dithering
tool at some point that uses it.</p>

<p>Creating this library required research into the different algorithms for dithering, and how to implement them.
Unfortunately, not all of that knowledge is easily found. It’s spread across blog posts, Wikipedia pages without
citations, old books, and code comments. Recently, Surma wrote an article called
<a href="https://surma.dev/things/ditherpunk/">Ditherpunk — The article I wish I had about monochrome image dithering</a>.
It is an invaluable resource that combines lots of knowledge about dithering into one place. The main thing missing
from the post, however, is going beyond “monochrome”. Surma shows us how to dither with a 1-bit palette of black and
white, but what about more shades of gray? What about colour images? With this blog post I’d like to explore those
techniques, taking them out of my code and into English, so you can easily apply them elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>First off, please read Surma’s post.</strong> It explains what dithering is, how it works, and many different algorithms.
I don’t feel the need to explain these again, but merely add on what I’ve learned.</p>

<h2 id="before-we-start">Before we start</h2>

<p>An HN commenter <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26122642">informed me</a> that you cannot accurately represent
linear RGB with just 8-bits (0-255), you need at least 12. Because of this, I have updated the blog post to use
16-bit color (0-65535), and will be updating the library shortly. Make sure you do this in your code too!</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Dithering operations consist of at least two steps, applied to each pixel. Sometimes there are further steps, like
“modify these nearby pixels”, but these are the basic ones.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Modify the pixel’s colour value.</li>
  <li>Find the colour in the palette that is “closest” to that modified value and use that on the output image.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, we know from Surma’s post that step 1 must be done with linear RGB values. Otherwise, different values will be
affected differently – for example adding 5 to each colour won’t affect all colours the same way.</p>

<p>But what about step 2? How do we find the closest colour in the palette? In 1-bit dithering we don’t have to worry
about this, because anything above 0.5 is white, and anything below is black. But when your palette colours can be
anyhere in a 3D space, it is something that needs to be figured out.</p>

<p>Perhaps surprisingly, we’re not looking for a way that matches human perception. In fact, we are using Euclidean
distance with linear RGB values, which doesn’t match human perception at all! Why is this?
Thomas Mansencal (<a href="https://github.com/KelSolaar">@KelSolaar</a>) explains it best:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can factor out the observer [the human] because what you are interested in here is basically energy
conservation. The idea being that for a given pool of radiant power emitters, if you remove a certain number of
them, by how much must the radiant power of the remaining ones be increased to be the same as that of the full
pool. It is really a ratio and doing those operations in a linear space is totally appropriate!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This helped it click for me. Dithering can be thought of as trying to reconstruct the “radiant power” of the original
pixel colours, while restricted to a certain set of “emitters”, aka the palette colours. It is only with linearized
RGB values that we can properly measure the radiant power.</p>

<h2 id="random-noise-grayscale">Random Noise (grayscale)</h2>

<p>Random noise is a good one to start with, to show the differences between 1-bit dithering and larger palettes.</p>

<p>Surma does this by basically just adding a random number from -0.5 to 0.5, and then thresholding it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>grayscaleImage</span><span>.</span><span>mapSelf</span><span>(</span><span>brightness</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
  <span>brightness</span> <span>+</span> <span>(</span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>random</span><span>()</span> <span>-</span> <span>0.5</span><span>)</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0.5</span> 
    <span>?</span> <span>1.0</span> 
    <span>:</span> <span>0.0</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In my library, there are two separate random noise functions. One is for grayscale, and one is for RGB. The grayscale
one looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>gray</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>rand</span><span>.</span><span>Float32</span><span>()</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>max</span><span>-</span><span>min</span><span>)</span><span>+</span><span>min</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The math with <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> is just to put the random value in the desired range. If we clean that up it’s more
understandable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>gray</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>rand</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>rand()</code> just represents a function that does whatever range we want, -0.5 to 0.5 in this case.</p>

<p>So, obviously this is quite similar to what Surma does. The heavy lifing of the dithering in this case is done by the
other code, the part that finds the best palette colour.</p>

<p>The main thing that’s worth noting here is how the rounding works. <code>roundClamp</code> rounds the value to an integer, and then
clamps it to the range 0-65535. But how is the rounding done?</p>

<p>Another <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26122642">HN commenter</a> shared <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/articles/1UCRko23/">this link</a>
which discusses different rounding methods, and the problems with the way rounding is often done. The best solution is to
use a rounding function that does this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given a number exactly halfway between two values, round to the even value (zero is considered even here).</p>

  <p>round( 1.7 ) –&gt; 2 round( 2.7 ) –&gt; 3<br>
round( 1.5 ) –&gt; 2 round( 2.5 ) –&gt; 2<br>
round( 1.3 ) –&gt; 1 round( 2.3 ) –&gt; 2</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not really about dithering, but this is a pretty important point to get things right mathematically.
Make sure you do it! Otherwise your outputs will be biased.</p>

<h2 id="random-noise-rgb">Random Noise (RGB)</h2>

<p>Back to random noise, but for colour this time.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>rand</span><span>.</span><span>Float32</span><span>()</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>maxR</span><span>-</span><span>minR</span><span>)</span><span>+</span><span>minR</span><span>))</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And simplified:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>randR</span><span>())</span>
<span>g</span> <span>=</span> <span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>g</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>randG</span><span>())</span>
<span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>randB</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Pretty simple, it just adds randomness in each channel. This can be done with grayscale images too, but it won’t
work very well, because grayscale colours only actually have one dimension. So it will just not add as much
randomness as you would expect.</p>

<p>Also note that usually you’ll want the random ranges to be the same for R, G, and B.</p>

<p>Here’s an example:</p>

<h2 id="ordered-dithering">Ordered Dithering</h2>

<h3 id="modifying-threshold-matrices">Modifying threshold matrices</h3>

<p>Most of the resources online that talk about ordered dithering talk about a “threshold matrix”. “Thresholding” is
how these matrices are applied for 1-bit dithering. You divide the matrix by whatever number is specified, scale
it to the colour value range, and compare it to each pixel in the image. If it’s less than the matrix value, make
it black, otherwise white. Obviously this doesn’t work with any other kind of palette. So what’s the solution?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_dithering">Wikipedia</a> offers an answer. Unfortunately there’s no citation,
but I’ve confirmed independently that it works. Here it is with some of my own math added as well.</p>

It’s the amount the matrix will be applied to the
image. The closer to zero it is, the smaller the range of input colors that will be dithered. Colors outside
that range will be quantized. Usually you’ll want a strength of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1.0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1.0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, to apply the matrix and dither fully, but
sometimes reducing it can be useful, to reduce noise in the output image. It is inversely proportional to contrast –
that is, when you reduce the <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>s</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">strength</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, it is visually similar to increasing the contrast.</p>

<p><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>s</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">strength</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> can also be negative, from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> to <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>1.0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">-1.0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. This is useful in certain cases where the matrix usually
makes things bright, like what Surma describes with Bayer matrices.</p>

<p>Note that <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>65535</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">65535</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is multiplied by <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>s</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">strength</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> because the colours in my code are in the range <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mn>0</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>65535</mn><mo stretchy="false">]</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">[0, 65535]</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. If yours
are different you can change that number.</p>

<p><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">max</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is the value the entire matrix is divided by. It represents the maximum value of the matrix, and normalizes
it by dividing. Usually this is the product of the dimensions of the matrix. It can also be the
largest value in the matrix plus one.</p>

<p>The result of applying this operation to each cell of the matrix is a new, precalculated matrix, which can be added
to a pixel’s colour value for dithering. Adding 0.5 does not need to happen in this case. In my library, I call the
function that does this <code>convThresholdToAddition</code>, because that’s essentially the purpose of this – converting
a threshold matrix into one that can be used for addition.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is designed for matrices that range from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> to <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>x</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">max - 1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. If you’re using a matrix you found that
starts at <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, you’ll usually just want to subtract one from each value when you program it, then apply the operation
I described above.</p>

<h3 id="using-a-modified-matrix">Using a modified matrix</h3>

<p>Now that you’ve modified the matrix so it can be used for addition, it needs to be applied to the image. This is pretty
simple. Use modulus so the matrix values are tiled across the image, and add the same value in the R, G, and B channels.
If you’re using a grayscale image you can just apply it in the one channel, or still use RGB. Since the same value is
being added it doesn’t make much of a difference. Like always, make sure to clamp the values to the proper colour range.</p>

<p>Doing all of this definitely works with colour images, but it’s not the greatest. Here’s an example, where the palette
is red, green, and black.</p>

<p>As you can see, it doesn’t really emulate any of the yellow in the first example, while Floyd-Steinberg can. Once yellow is added
to the palette it looks pretty good though.</p>

	<div>
		
<p>A few days ago, <a href="https://www.emiratesmarsmission.ae/">Emirates Mars Mission (Hope)</a>, and <a href="https://destevez.net/tag/tianwen/">Tianwen-1</a> performed their Mars orbit injection burn (MOI). <a href="https://amsat-dl.org/">AMSAT-DL</a> made a livestream for each of the two events, showing the X-band signals of the spacecraft as received with the <a href="https://amsat-dl.org/en/20-meter-antenna/">20m antenna at Bochum</a>.</p>



<p>In the case of Tianwen-1 the signal was pretty strong even while the spacecraft was on the low gain antenna, and we could clearly see the <a href="https://youtu.be/1myQ5tIig0w?t=6593">change in Doppler rate as the thrusters fired up</a>. However, in the case of Emirates Mars Mission the signal <a href="https://youtu.be/413DdMua8ec?t=2641">disappeared as soon as the spacecraft switched to the low gain antenna</a>. In fact <a href="https://eyes.nasa.gov/dsn/dsn.html">DSN Now</a> reported a received power of -155 dBm with the 34m DSS55. That was a large drop from the -118 dBm that it was reporting with the high gain antenna. Therefore, nothing could be seen in the livestream waterfall until the spacecraft returned to the high gain antenna, well after the manoeuvre was finished.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, a weak trace of the carrier was still present in the livestream audio, and it could be seen by appropriate FFT processing, for example with <a href="https://github.com/miek/inspectrum">inspectrum</a>. I put up a <a href="https://twitter.com/ea4gpz/status/1359152918004461574">couple</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/ea4gpz/status/1359161368289701888">tweets</a> showing this, but at the moment I wasn’t completely sure if what I was seeing was the spacecraft’s signal or some interference. After the livestream ended, I’ve been able to analyse the audio more carefully and realize that not only this weak signal was in fact the Hope probe, but that the start of the burn was recorded in perfect conditions.</p>



<p>In this post I’ll show how to process the livestream audio to clearly show the change in drift rate at the start of the burn and measure the acceleration of the spacecraft.</p>



<p>The idea with this post is that anyone can reproduce what I’m going to show. After all, the only data I’m using is the audio of a livestream that is recorded in Youtube. For convenience, I include with my code the segment of data I’m using, which is a 5 minute segment that starts 7850 seconds into the audio of the full video. If you want to start from scratch, you can use any webpage or application to download the audio of the full video, and work with that. In my case I used a webpage to download the audio in 320kbps MP3 format, then converted it to an 8ksps WAV file, and used <a href="https://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a> to read the WAV file and extract the 5 minute segment.</p>



<p>In the figure below you can see the waterfall of the first minute of the 5 minute clip I cut. The spacecraft signal can be seen as faint diagonal lines between 700 and 800 Hz. They are quite weak and have some fading, but hopefully you can see them.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_start.png"><img width="644" height="438" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_start-644x438.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_start-644x438.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_start-300x204.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_start.png 730w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>There is something that is convenient to remark about the Doppler correction system that was used at Bochum for the livestreams. First, the system used the trajectory of the the spacecraft, ignoring the burn, to compute the expected Doppler. Therefore, the expected Doppler computation would be quite good before the burn started, but as soon as the thrusters fired it would diverge more and more from reality.</p>



<p>Second, rather than constantly adjusting the tuning to correct for Doppler and keep the signal exactly centred, the system performed discrete jumps of fixed size with the goal of keeping the signal inside a certain band, roughly 350 Hz wide. This had the effect of creating a sawtooth wave in the waterfall and the audio. As the signal arrived to one edge of this imaginary band, the Doppler correction performed a frequency jump to put the signal at the other edge of the band.</p>



<p>This can be seen quite clearly in the livestream of Tianwen-1. At the <a href="https://youtu.be/1myQ5tIig0w?t=0">beginning of the livestream</a>, the drift rate was quite low, since the spacecraft was well away from periapsis. Therefore, the period of the sawtooth was long. As the spacecraft approached periapsis and the drift rate increased, the period of the sawtooth <a href="https://youtu.be/1myQ5tIig0w?t=4667">kept reducing</a> until it was quite short <a href="https://youtu.be/1myQ5tIig0w?t=6023">right before the burn</a>. However, note that the amplitude of the sawtooth (this is, the width of this imaginary frequency band) is always the same.</p>



<p>The next figure shows the waterfall of the audio when the burn starts. It is a bit difficult to see, but hopefully you’ll be able to see two or three lines at the left around 800 Hz, and then a couple of lines going up in steps and with less slope, near the middle of the image.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_burn.png"><img width="644" height="438" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_burn-644x438.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_burn-644x438.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_burn-300x204.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_burn.png 730w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>When the burn starts, the drift rate increases (i.e., changes from negative to less negative), since the retrograde burn accelerated the spacecraft towards Earth. As the Doppler correction keeps tuning in steps to correct for a more negative drift rate, we get steps upwards. This is the same that happened at the <a href="http://youtu.be/1myQ5tIig0w?t=6593">start of the burn of Tianwen-1</a>. In that case the drift rate became almost zero, and then positive, since the thrust-to-mass ratio of Tianwen-1 is higher than that of Hope.</p>



<p>The resolution of the plots shown above, and those that come later is 0.98 Hz per FFT bin (FFT size of 8192 with a sample rate of 8ksps) and 64ms per time step (due to the use of overlapping FFT, and an advance of 512 samples per FFT).</p>



<p>In what follows, the idea is to undo the Doppler correction done at Bochum to join back the pieces of the sawtooth wave and also correct for the drift rate in order to get a signal of constant frequency that we may see clearly in a spectrum plot. To do this, we just need to create a sawtooth that has the same (or almost the same) phase, amplitude and period as the one that the Doppler correction created, and then use that sawtooth to control the frequency of a local oscillator with which we mix the audio signal. I have adjusted the parameters of the sawtooth by hand until I obtained something where the resulting signal before the start of the burn had a constant frequency and had no (or very brief) jumps.</p>



<p>The result of this correction can be seen below. We see the signal before the burn as a flat line at constant frequency, slightly above 800 Hz, and then the signal rising up as the burn starts. The vertical white line marks the moment in which the start of the burn happens, which is at 184.96 seconds into this 5 minute segment. The right panel contains the spectrum plot of the data in the left of the waterfall (to the left of the white line). The signal can be seen very clearly, with an (S+N)/N of about 5dB, which would give an estimated CN0 on the order of 3 dBHz.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_before_burn.png"><img width="644" height="427" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_before_burn-644x427.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_before_burn-644x427.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_before_burn-300x199.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_before_burn-768x510.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_before_burn.png 856w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>If we now change the drift rate correction, we can make flat the signal after the burn. We see that the drift rate is not constant, but rather it increases slightly with time, so it is not possible to find a drift rate that makes the line totally flat. I have chosen a drift rate that makes the line flat at approximately 20 seconds after the start of the burn. The  right panel shows the spectrum of the right part of the waterfall (after the white line). Again, we have some 5 dB of (S+N)/N.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_after_burn.png"><img width="644" height="427" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_after_burn-644x427.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_after_burn-644x427.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_after_burn-300x199.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_after_burn-768x510.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emm_after_burn.png 856w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>We have seen how by correcting the drift rate the “corner” of the Doppler curve, which marks the exact moment in which the thrusters started firing, can seen in the waterfall, whereas with the waterfall of the original audio signal it was impossible to see this corner. The moment in which the corner happens corresponds to 2:13:54.96 into the video, which by looking at the timestamps that appear in the screen shown in the video we can associate with 15:41:38 UTC (with a precision of perhaps one or two seconds). Since the light-time delay for this burn was 637 seconds, this means that the burn started at 15:31:01 UTC. This matches the official report of a start at 15:30 UTC, because it is possible that ullage motors fired one minute before the main burn, as we saw in <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/08/tianwen-1-tcm-1/">Tianwen-1’s TCM-1</a>.</p>



<p>The drift rate before the burn is -19.5 Hz/s, and when the burn starts it changes to -8 Hz/s. Such a drift rate change gives a line-of-sight acceleration of -0.41 m/s². This is just the projection of the acceleration vector onto the line-of-sight. In order to compute the full acceleration, we assume that it happened along the velocity vector of the spacecraft (with respect to Mars), and compute the projection of the unit velocity vector and the unit line-of-sight vector to Earth at the start of the burn. This computation ignores light-time delays, but is good enough for our purposes, since the line-of-sight vector changes slowly enough. The projection is 0.86.</p>



<p>This means that we only see 86% of the total acceleration in the Doppler drift rate. Therefore, the total acceleration must have been around -0.48 m/s². This contrasts to the theoretical acceleration of -0.58 m/s² that 720 N of thrust (since the spacecraft has 6x 120 N thrusters) applied to 1250 kg of mass produce (here the mass comes from a dry mass of 550 kg and 700 kg of fuel, assuming that the probe already spent in mid-course corrections 100 kg of its initial 800 kg).</p>



<p>Working backwards, we see that the measured acceleration of -0.48 m/s² would correspond to a thrust of 594 N. In fact, while I <a href="https://twitter.com/ea4gpz/status/1359081278079987712">worked out the planning of the manoeuvre on Twitter</a>, I noticed that the publicly stated burn length of 27 minutes was way too long to achieve the target orbit with a thrust of 720 N. To have a burn of 27 minutes that gave me the required apoapsis altitude I had to use a thrust of 658 N.</p>



<p>Note that all these calculations about the acceleration are just estimates, since we don’t know exactly the mass of the spacecraft, and our estimate of 1250 kg could be wrong by up to 10%. In any case, I think it is always good to go through these calculations to show what can be achieved with simple Doppler measurements and to check that the signal we observed matches what we expected.</p>



<p>The calculations and plots in this post have been done in <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/jupyter_notebooks/blob/master/EMM/MOI/Bochum%20MOI%20recording.ipynb">this Jupyter notebook</a>. The data file with the 5 minute segment of the livestream audio is included in the same repository. The results that I have shown are intended to be easily reproducible. It is possible to run the notebook with the supplied data or to start from scratch by downloading the audio from the livestream video on Youtube.</p>

<p>How things have (and have not changed). I'm still a command-line junkie with at least two xterm windows open. I'm still using a 3x3 virtual desktop. However, instead of fvwm, it is now LXDE. I've also switched from FreeBSD to Linux and I'm running Lubuntu as my distribution.</p>

<p>There are a lot of indispensable GUI tools that I use. These include Firefox, lyx, Gimp, KeepassX, Shutter, viking, dia, Wireshark, calibre, audacity, Handbrake and VLC. But where possible I still prefer to script things. My main development languages are still shell, Perl and C.</p>

<p>My shell is now bash. The vi keystrokes are burned into my fingertips and, as long as vim can be ported to new systems, that will be my text editor until I pass on. My mail client is now mutt (definitely not a web client) and my mail is stored locally, not on someone else's server.</p>

<p>The only issue I have is that, since a job change, I now have to deal with Windoze things. Thus, I have VirtualBox, libreoffice and Wine to help me do that.</p>

<p>I started with Unix on a Pyramid 90x. I now have a smart phone that blows the 90x out of the water on performance, RAM and storage. But I'm so very happy that, somewhere down underneath, there is still a Bourne shell and an operating system that does open(), close(), read(), write(), fork() and exec()!</p>

<p>Nearly every solar power panel sold in the European Union has its origins in China’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/24/china-uighurs-europe-sanctions-381080" target="_blank">oppressed Xinjiang region</a>.</p>



<p>The solar industry and Brussels lawmakers argue Europe’s renewable energy push should not come at a human cost amid long-standing international concern over reports China has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-rights-un-idUSKBN1KV1SU" target="_blank">detained 1 million people</a> with Muslim backgrounds in camps in Xinjiang and is putting them to work.</p>



<p>“Everybody knows what’s going on in China, and when facilities are based there you have to accept that there’s a high possibility that forced labor will be used,” said Milan Nitzschke, president of <a href="https://www.prosun.org/en/mission-en/" target="_blank">EU ProSun</a>, an alliance of solar businesses seeking to promote sustainable, solar manufacturing based in the EU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the U.S. has already rolled out sanctions against products such as cotton and tomatoes originating from Xinjiang, the European Commission has avoided confronting China with any trade measures. </p>



<p>It has fallen to lawmakers in the European Parliament to try to push Brussels to implement trade bans, on all industries including solar panels, if companies are implicated in human rights abuses.</p>



<p>“Import bans need to complement as a last resort if forced labor is involved in the production, like in Xinjiang," said Green MEP Anna Cavazzini.</p>



<h3>Suspicions about every panel</h3>



<p>For the past decade Beijing has been carrying out a campaign to <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1256994">detain and “reeducate”</a> the Muslim-majority population of the Xinjiang region.</p>



<p>Human rights groups have alerted that state-run reeducation centers <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1408155">double as forced labor camps</a>, with detained people obliged to work in low-skilled, labor-intensive sectors such as cotton picking. But recent reports out of the region suggest the Xinjiang government has also been focusing on “upskilling” the workforce and putting them to work in more specialized sectors.</p>



<p>That’s of particular concern to the global solar industry given Xinjiang’s outsized role in the production of <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=62601">polysilicon</a>, a material used to make photovoltaic (PV) cells.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Nearly every silicon-based solar module — at least 95 percent of the market — is likely to have some Xinjiang silicon in,” said Jenny Chase, head of solar analysis at BloombergNEF.</p>



<p>Industry analyst Johannes Bernreuter added that last year roughly 45 percent of the global supply of solar-grade polysilicon came from the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Raw polysilicon is transported to factories — usually outside Xinjiang — and melted into cylinders, known as ingots. Because it’s blended with polysilicon produced in other regions, it’s difficult to trace material that could potentially come from forced labor camps in Xinjiang, Chase and Bernreuter said.</p>



<p>For any single solar panel “the mathematical probability is relatively high" it has some material produced in the province, said Bernreuter.</p>



<h3>An open secret</h3>



<p>Beijing <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/china-cotton-forced-labour-trfn-idUSKBN28P2CM" target="_blank">insists</a> the camps — which it calls “vocational training facilities” — are simply “helping people of all ethnic groups secure stable employment” and argues that this is “entirely different from forced labor.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The China Photovoltaic Industry Association <a href="http://www.chinapv.org.cn/association_news/922.html" target="_blank">said</a> accusations of forced labor in Xinjiang were ”the lie of the century fabricated by several institutions and people from Western countries.”</p>



<p>In Europe, industry players said the potential use of forced labor to produce material included in solar panels imported into the EU was an open secret.</p>



<p>Industry group SolarPower Europe said it was investigating the situation in Xinjiang with its membership and looking at different options to ensure no forced labor was used in the PV manufacturing process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We cannot accept that such practices take place in the solar PV sector, which is a leader in sustainability and a key enabler of the energy transition,” said SolarPower Europe CEO Walburga Hemetsberger.</p>



<p>The group said its members were using supply chain management guidelines, certifications and standards to ensure that forced labor was not used, and that it was evaluating how to encourage best practices across the industry.</p>



<h3>Distancing measures</h3>



<p>If the EU’s solar sector wants to distance itself from solar components manufactured under questionable circumstances in Xinjiang, it would have several ways of doing so.</p>



<p>Bloomberg NEF’s Chase said one option would be to continue accepting components made with polysilicon from China, but insisting that material produced in Xinjiang be exempted from the mix blended in factories.</p>



<p>“There’s plenty of non-Xinjiang polysilicon,” Chase said — around a quarter of the global market in 2021 is expected to come from the U.S. and the EU. But she said enforcing the exclusion would be complicated and likely make little difference for the plight of any workers. </p>



<p>Xinjiang polysilicon would simply shift to the domestic market and customers in the EU and the U.S. “will pay an almost unnoticeable amount more for modules,” said Chase. “Honestly, it is unlikely to be a big deal for solar, but good news for companies that make silicon outside Xinjiang.”</p>



<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, European manufacturers believe the answer is repatriating the industry back to the EU and using tariffs if necessary.</p>



<p>“Solar components can be produced in Europe,” EU ProSun’s Nitzschke said. “The companies making them were here until 2012 but they went bankrupt when the tariffs used to address Chinese overproduction and public financing were removed, allowing their companies to undercut us in terms of price.”</p>



<p>Nitzschke argued the EU should revise its trade deals and ensure that the same standards on human rights and forced labor that apply in Europe be extended to imported products. “We can’t have a level playing field if there’s ethical leakage, and you could prevent it by applying tariffs to products that don’t meet our standards.”</p>



<p>SolarPower Europe’s Hemetsberger said she didn’t favor trade tariffs due to their often counterproductive effect on European solar growth. "The best way of ensuring that imported goods abide by strict human rights protocols and ethical standards is improving the level of transparency of the global value chain so that EU-based suppliers can make informed decisions."</p>



<p>The European Commission has said the EU’s solar capacity needs to <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/strategies/2030_en#:~:text=2030%20climate%20and%20energy%20framework%20%2D%20existing%20ambition,32.5%25%20improvement%20in%20energy%20efficiency" target="_blank">grow five-fold by 2030</a> to meet its climate targets. Hemetsberger said there was a “solar manufacturing renaissance” underway in Europe.</p>



<p>“Nearly all areas of the supply chain can be produced in Europe,” said Gunter Erfurt, CEO of <a href="https://www.meyerburger.com/en/company/about-meyer-burger/management/" target="_blank">Meyer Burger</a>, a Swiss-German solar module production company that aims to reestablish solar’s industrial supply chain on the Continent, pointing out that solar-grade polysilicon is <a href="https://www.wacker.com/cms/en-us/about-wacker/wacker-at-a-glance/profile-and-organization/wacker-polysilicon.html" target="_blank">already produced</a> at several sites in Germany.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I have a lot of respect for the Chinese strategy because 10 years ago they understood what Europe is still struggling to grasp: that solar is the future,” he said. “EU leaders speak of batteries, electric mobility, hydrogen … But where is the electricity to produce those things supposed to come from? We are already the technological frontrunners, what we need now is financing to bring production back.”&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Growing pressure on Brussels</h3>



<p>Solar panels are yet another example of goods made with forced labor entering the EU market, raising <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1572638">criticisms from lawmakers and NGOs</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Joerg Wuttke, president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China, expects the EU to step up scrutiny of imports from Xinjiang, including solar power panels.</p>



<p>“The pressure is piling on the Commission and member states that they have to use unilateral means to send China a message, such as screening of imported products,” said Wuttke.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brussels <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-china-inestment-agreement-soft-approach-odds-us/">is taking its time</a> when its comes to tackling goods made with forced labor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Commission is working on <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1496802">a new tool</a> — due diligence legislation — which would make EU companies accountable if their suppliers breach labor and climate laws. But MEPs would like the Commission to go even further to tackle serious situations such as the one in Xinjiang. Last month, the European Parliament’s legal affairs committee <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1590418">called on</a> the Commission to introduce an import ban for “products related to severe human rights violations.”</p>



<p>“The EU due diligence legislation has a key role to play in that as it will help ensure that human rights are respected throughout our supply chains,” said MEP Cavazzini. She backs an import ban if suppliers are shown to be involved in human rights abuses.</p>



<p>The Commission is <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12548-Sustainable-corporate-governance" target="_blank">set to</a> come up with its supply chain responsibility proposal by June after a public consultation ended this week.</p>



<p>According to Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders, who is in charge of the file, new rules are likely to focus on so-called Tier 1 suppliers and to make reference to the International Labor Organization’s core conventions, which China committed to ratify under the new investment deal concluded with the EU.</p>



<p>“Expanding the use of renewables is of utmost importance in order to stop the climate crisis. But it cannot come at the cost of human rights,” said Cavazzini.</p>

We do not want just to show what they are, but also why they are important and how you can use these metrics to fix problems or track success in your SaaS business.</p><h2 id="10-metrics-for-saas">10 Metrics for SaaS</h2><h2 id="1-mrr-monthly-recurring-revenue">1. MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)</h2><p>MRR, or Monthly Recurring Revenue, is a vital metric for SaaS businesses with the subscription model. Once someone subscribes, you have new recurring revenue and, consequently, a new metric to track.</p><p>You determine your MRR by totaling your monthly revenue from subscriptions. More often than not, startup costs and fees are not accounted for in the MRR metric, which is something to keep in mind.</p><p>MRR comes with both benefits and costs. An advantage is that, once someone subscribes, there is no worry about one-off selling. MRR helps you track the month-to-month revenue easily because it’s predictable.</p><p>Now, let’s look at a more informative list so you can better compare the pros and cons:</p><h3 id="what-are-the-costs-of-mrr">What are the costs of MRR?</h3><ul><li>Churning</li><li>Increased demand for customer retention</li><li>Potential delay in ROI</li></ul><h3 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-mrr">What are the benefits of MRR?</h3><ul><li>Creates a predictable monthly revenue stream</li><li>Enables community involvement and promotes a loyal fanbase</li><li>Shows the strengths and weaknesses of sales</li><li>Helps create reliable business decisions based on results</li></ul><p>For example, you can’t download the entire Netflix catalog and access the services offline because your not purchasing and licensing the software directly. MRR is a vital metric for Netflix to track because they are required to maintain the software.</p><p>Dan Tyre, the sales director at HubSpot says:</p><blockquote>MRR is the most important metric for financial growth. There are other important metrics like growth rate, retention, average sales price, and rep productivity, but at the end of the day, the most important metric is the amount of monthly recurring revenue customers are willing to put on their credit card or pay through an invoice</blockquote><p><strong>Mamoon Hamid, Social Capital:</strong></p><blockquote>Every SaaS company should live and die by MRR, because that’s something that you can’t go without.
<cite></cite></blockquote><h2 id="2-churn">2. Churn</h2><p>When making butter, churning is part of the process. The same applies to SaaS companies. Let me explain.</p><div itemscope="" itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><h3 itemprop="name">What is Churn?</h3><p itemprop="text">Simply put, churn is the loss of subscribers. Let’s face it. You are going to lose some customers. Accounting for that loss allows you to see what is going wrong and how you can improve your customers’ retention.</p></div><p>This is the reason the churn metric is important for SaaS companies.</p><p>Two types of Churn are vital to SaaS companies. Customer Churn and Revenue Churn. While both are important and connected, they play different roles in business decisions.</p><h3 id="customer-churn">Customer Churn</h3><p>Customer churn is the loss of customers. If you are using a yearly subscription model, it is best to note these losses every month or quarter. Finding out why these subscribers canceled their subscriptions gives valuable information to improve customer retention.</p><p>Are customers canceling their subscriptions because it isn’t of any use to them? Did they have a problem with customer service? Taking account of the different personalities, needs, and wants of lost subscribers saves you from inevitable catastrophes in the future.</p><p>HubSpot wrote an insightful article titled: <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/service/how-to-reduce-customer-churn" target="_blank">Customer Churn: 7 Tips to Stop the Attrition</a>.</p><p>Here are some of the key takeaways and an outline of the reasons customers churn:</p><div><ul><li><strong>Pricing</strong>: is it genuinely worth the cost?</li><li><strong>Product/Market fit</strong>: does the product truly fit the market?</li><li><strong>User experience</strong>: is your product buggy, glitchy, or crashing?</li><li><strong>Customer experience</strong>: did your customer have a bad experience?</li><li><strong>Underappreciated Brand Values</strong>: do your values not align with the market?</li><li><strong>Competitor Intervention</strong>: are you keeping up with your competitors?</li><li><strong>Plateaued Growth</strong>: are you moving towards profit over customer growth?</li></ul></div><p>Brian Balfour Founder/CEO of Reforge Former VP Growth at HubSpot:</p><blockquote>If your retention is poor then nothing else matters</blockquote><p>To calculate customer churn, simply take the number of people that canceled their subscription for the month, quarter, or year.</p><p>HubSpot writer Sofia Bernazzani recommends monthly or quarterly calculations and a more in-depth look at the <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/service/saas-metrics" target="_blank">customer count</a>.</p><p>You can get the churn rate by taking the total number of churned customers and dividing them by the total number of customers from last month, quarter, or year.</p><p><strong>Churn Rate = Total # Churned Customers / Total # Customers of Previous Month</strong></p><h3 id="revenue-churn">Revenue Churn</h3><p>Revenue churn is just as important as customer churn. While it is important to track customers that are leaving, which subscription they were also using matters.</p><p>If there is a variable option for subscriptions, tracking revenue churn can show which plan or subscription is churning the most.</p><p>For example, a business has a $100 option and a $200 option for their subscription plan. If more people are canceling the $100 subscription vs. the $200 subscription, you can change something to retain more users or try upselling them with the $200 subscription.</p><p>Revenue churn can potentially point you in the direction of a problem. Either the prices or the features need readjusting.</p><h2 id="3-arpa-average-revenue-per-account">3. ARPA (Average Revenue per Account)</h2><p>It is crucial to know which products customers enjoy and produce revenue and which products they avoid. You can track growth and revenue on a unit-by-unit basis through an understanding of the ARPA metric.</p><p>ARPA is the Average Revenue per Account. This metric for SaaS companies can also be the Average Revenue per User or Unit. Tracking your ARPA is beneficial for investors to find products that generate strong revenue.</p><h3 id="how-do-you-track-arpa">How do you Track ARPA?</h3><p>You can track your ARPA by taking your MRR (listed above) and dividing that by the number of customers you have. Tracking your ARPA can be done on your billing cycle, be that annually, quarterly, or monthly.</p><p><strong>MRR / # of Customers = APRA</strong></p><h3 id="new-vs-existing-accounts">New vs. Existing Accounts</h3><p>While tracking ARPA, new and existing accounts will be mixed. It is beneficial to separate these two into Average Revenue per New Account and Average Revenue per Existing Account. This allows you to compare the behavior of new customers currently learning the product vs. existing customers that already have a grasp of the product.</p><p>The way to calculate both of these remains the same. The only difference is that you divide the work for more data.</p><h2 id="4-ltv-customer-lifetime-value">4. LTV (Customer Lifetime Value)</h2><p>What is the potential value of a customer? It depends on how long they stay subscribed. Finding out the Customer Lifetime Value, or LTV, gives you the average financial value of a specific customer or an average customer.</p><h3 id="how-to-calculate-ltv">How to Calculate LTV</h3><p>To calculate your LTV, you will need three metrics. These are the following:</p><ul><li>churn rate</li><li>customer lifetime rate</li><li>ARPA</li></ul><p>First, find the customer lifetime rate. This can be found by taking the number 1 and multiplying it by your churn rate. For example, if you have 20 customers and lose 1, your churn rate is 5%, and your customer lifetime rate would be 20 (1 / .05 = 20)</p><p>Second, find your average revenue per account (ARPA). This can be done by taking your total revenue, or MRR, and dividing the total number of customers you have. For example, if your revenue is $50,000, divide it by 20 customers. The ARPA is then $2,500 (50,000 / 20 = 2,500).</p><p>Last, your LTV will be your ARPA multiplied by your customer lifetime rate. In this example, our LTV is $50,000 (2,500 x 20).</p><p>An LTV gives you information on the worth of an average customer. You must account for this SaaS growth metric because you want to know how much an average customer gives you over the lifetime of their involvement. It allows you to make financial, marketing, and customer service decisions. Also, it can impress investors with the value of your company.</p><p>A useful practice is to increase ARPA (customers paying more) and to retain more customers (reduce churn).</p><p><strong>Here are some questions you should ask yourself after evaluating the LTV metric</strong>:</p><ul><li>Which customers should you spend your marketing resources on?</li><li>Who are your best customers?</li><li>How much time and resources should you spend on acquiring a new customer?</li><li>Who do you tailor your service to?</li></ul><h2 id="5-cac-customer-acquisition-cost">5. CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)</h2><p>You have to spend money to make money. Hearing this can cause heads to turn. CAC, or Customer Acquisition Cost, tracks the amount you spend on average to acquire a customer.</p><p>You pay for ads, you have a sales department with salaries, you sponsor an event. These are all costs to gather new customers. Without customers, there is no business. The cost of acquiring these customers makes up your CAC.</p><div itemscope="" itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><h3 itemprop="name">How do you determine your CAC?</h3><p itemprop="text">When determining your CAC, you first want to total all the expenses to gather customers. Once you have that, divide it by the total number of customers you have. This is similar to finding out your MRR, except with expenses instead of revenue.</p></div><p><strong>CAC = Total Sales and Marketing Expenses / Total # of Customers</strong></p><h3 id="ltv-vs-cac">LTV vs. CAC</h3><p>There is no point in having a CAC without knowing the LTV. This is because balancing the CAC and LTV is crucial for any business. While the LTV shows you the value of a customer, the CAC shows you the cost of one.</p><p>For any business, you want the value of the customer to be higher than the cost to acquire one. How much higher is determined on a case-by-case business. See-a-see what I’m saying?</p><p>Essentially, the LTV is what you make, and the CAC is what it takes. Because of this, you want to get your CAC as low as possible. It is not so much about the exact numbers, but the ratio between them.</p><p>A healthy business should get the ratio of LTV to CAC above 3 (3:1). …</p></div></div></div></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p><em>Also in this series: <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/chinese-businessmen-let-reality-be-the-teacher/">Let Reality Be The Teacher</a>, <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/chinese-businessmen-superstition-doesnt-count/">Superstition Doesn't Count</a>, <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/chinese-businessmen-maybe-strategy-matters/">Maybe Strategy Matters</a>, <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/chinese-businessmen-cash-flow-is-king/">Cash Flow Is King</a>.</em></p><p>I met my friend Samuel in the first year of secondary school, way back when we were beginner teenagers. Samuel’s dad was a traditional Chinese businessman. He ran a pharmaceutical import business, supplying a handful of pharmacists around Kuching, population 300,000, the small city on Borneo that we both grew up in.</p><p>Over the years, Samuel’s father expanded the business into other interests: small real estate holdings, food &amp; beverage outlets, retail shops selling mobile phone kits, clothes, phone data plans and packages. If a business unit wasn’t doing too well, he was quick to shut things down. I observed most of this through my friend’s eyes; Samuel was being groomed to take over the company. Every year when I returned to Kuching, I discovered that Samuel’s father’s business empire had grown, inch by hard-won inch.</p><p>In Malaysia, where I was born, and in Singapore, where I did university, there is this trope of Chinese business acumen that we grew up with. Group identities are built around tropes, because tropes are the stories that we tell ourselves. This particular trope is a cultural one, born from the history of overseas Chinese.</p><p>The idea of a savvy business leader emerging from a humble background, thriving despite adversity, is one of the strongest touchstones in the stories that make up who we are. It is in the family histories of all those Chinese who migrated out of China; it is the story of our grandfathers, uncles, and (occasionally) aunties, making a living on distant shores; if we have no direct relationship to a relative in business, it is the stories that we are familiar with through our friends and <em>their</em> families.</p><p>This idea of a ‘Chinese businessman identity’ is what makes up a race-based superiority complex, as Amy Chua argues in <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Triple_Package">The Triple Package</a></em> — it is the reason certain racial identities help with certain types of achievement. When a Chinese person feels down-and-out in the education system, he has a path that allows him immediate respect in his society: that of doing business. The ones who succeed are lauded by their families and friends. The ones who don’t do so well are still seen as engaging in a respectable pursuit.</p><p>Over time, my friends and I referred to those Chinese peers who did well in business as having ‘Chinese businessman wisdom’. We used this phrase in the following way: “He’s not really into startups. He’s into business. He has Chinese businessman wisdom.” and “If even half of the people doing startups today have Chinese businessman wisdom, we would have a lot more successes on our hands.”</p><p>In other societies, and in other cultures, this might be phrased in a different way: “he’s business savvy”, or “he’s built for business”. But this phrase resonates with us because we are surrounded by positive examples of successful (and not so successful) Chinese businessmen, many of them seem to be built of the same mould. Nearly <em>all</em> the major tycoons in South East Asia are Chinese: Robert Kuok of Malaysia, Ng Teng Fong from Singapore, Mochtar Riady of Indonesia; the list goes on. They are described as thrifty, low-key, savvy, cunning, pragmatic, and respected — even begrudgingly! — by the communities they run businesses in.</p><p>Which then begs the question: “what exactly <em>is</em> Chinese businessman wisdom?” And how do you gain more of it?</p><h2 id="-business-sense-">‘Business Sense’</h2><figure><img src="https://commoncog.com/blog/content/images/2018/09/annie-spratt-224881-unsplash--1-.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Traditional Chinese Shophouse frontage.</figcaption></figure><p>One aspect of the Chinese businessman wisdom trope is the idea that some people are born with business sense, and others are not.</p><p>Samuel’s dad is fond of saying that his brothers tried their hand at business before he did, and nearly all of them failed. He was the only one from his family who succeeded.</p><p>My maternal grandfather, who ran a car workshop on the island of Labuan for most of his adult life, was dinged for not being business savvy enough. The stories I heard of him are mostly about how he was kinder than he needed to be, and charged less than he could have charged. He <em>did</em> eventually sell off the business to retire in Kuching, and I’m now experiencing the terror of doing a business on my own, so I respect him tremendously; I think he’s done alright for himself. But the perception of ‘business savvy’ or ‘not business savvy’ as an inborn trait, unchangeable by circumstance, is hardcoded into our culture; an inalienable part of the ‘traditional Chinese businessman’.</p><p>I reject this notion almost as strongly as I reject the notion of pre-ordained destiny.</p><p>(This shouldn’t be a surprise to you — this entire blog is built around the idea of a keeping only the ideas that are <em>useful</em> to your future career. Believing in ‘business sense’ as an unchangeable, in-born trait is not actionable in a way that another belief might be; therefore reject it in favour for the actionable belief.)</p><p>A more acceptable version of this ‘business sense as an inborn trait’ meme is the one articulated by Robert Kuok in his memoirs:</p><blockquote>To me, talent and instincts in business are inborn and cannot be learned in the classroom. The best comparison I can give you is the game of soccer. The best soccer players are born with great innate talent. Even if a person is not born with the ability to be a top soccer player, he can learn to be a good soccer player through good coaching. But he will never be one of the great stars of the game, such as a Pele or a Messi, who are gifted people with inborn skills augmented by good coaching.</blockquote><p>This rings true to me, as it gels with my experience for writing and for Judo — the two other skills I am most familiar with. In <em>On Writing</em>, Stephen King makes a similar case:</p><blockquote>There are no bad dogs, according to the title of a popular training manual, but don’t tell that to the parent of a child mauled by a pit bull or a rottweiler; he or she is apt to bust your beak for you. And no matter how much I want to encourage the man or woman trying for the first time to write seriously, I can’t lie and say there are no bad writers. Sorry, but there are lots of bad writers. Some are on-staff at your local newspaper, usually reviewing little-theater productions or pontificating about the local sports teams. Some have scribbled their way to homes in the Caribbean, leaving a trail of pulsing adverbs, wooden characters, and vile passive-voice constructions behind them. Others hold forth at open-mike poetry slams, wearing black turtlenecks and wrinkled khaki pants; they spout doggerel about “my angry lesbian breasts” and “the tilted alley where I cried my mother’s name.”<p>Writers form themselves into the pyramid we see in all areas of human talent and human creativity. At the bottom are the bad ones. Above them is a group which is slightly smaller but still large and welcoming; these “are the competent writers. They may also be found on the staff of your local newspaper, on the racks at your local bookstore, and at poetry readings on Open Mike Night. These are folks who somehow understand that although a lesbian may be angry, her breasts will remain breasts.</p><p>The next level is much smaller. These are the really good writers. Above them—above almost all of us—are the Shakespeares, the Faulkners, the Yeatses, Shaws, and Eudora Weltys. They are geniuses, divine accidents, gifted in a way which is beyond our ability to understand, let alone attain. Shit, most geniuses aren’t able to understand themselves, and many of them lead miserable lives, realizing (at least on some level) that they are nothing but fortunate freaks, the intellectual version of runway models who just happen to be born with the right cheekbones and with breasts which fit the image of an age.</p></blockquote><p>I’ve long made peace with the idea that I might never become a Steinbeck or a Hemingway, but that with a lot of effort and a bit of luck, I am satisfied with the idea that I might become good. It’s only fair that the same could be said about business.</p><h2 id="rationality-and-business">Rationality and Business</h2><p>I’ve long suspected that much of business ability may be explained by rationality. This stems from experience: I ran the Vietnam office of a Singaporean company for three years, and I got to see a number of ‘traditional Chinese businessmen’ up close. In some of these cases, they were our clients; in others, we were competitors with opportunistic traditional Chinese businessmen, and received our licks in a race for customers.</p><p>(We also drove a few of them to bankruptcy, but that’s another story for another day).</p><p>The best businessmen we dealt with were always relentlessly pragmatic. They were rational in their actions — or at least, they were rational in the sense that they did what was necessary for the survival of their businesses. I remember a client who managed to get a <em>ton</em> of free add-ons out of us, which he did so skilfully none of us realised what was going on for months on end. (He’s over 50 years old and very very good; my old company remains in business with him). I also remember our discovery that a major competitor in our space had been gutted by its management, and turned into a real-estate investment company in Singapore.</p><p>But rationality alone didn’t explain everything that I saw. The question that most interested me was the following paradox: first, that the most successful Chinese businessmen were often the least educated ones. Second, that Chinese businessmen as a group were more superstitious than most, but that this didn’t seem to have much of an effect on their ability to run their businesses! And finally, that the vast majority of Chinese businesspeople did not think too far ahead. They optimised locally, and by keeping close tabs on the bottom line, shut down lines of business that weren’t performing as well.</p><p>The paradox was driven by my misguided attempt to figure out what made the successful ones successful, and to see if I could copy them. If intelligence were a deciding factor, then the educated Chinese businessmen were more likely to do better. If rationality were truly a …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Daniel Vassallo has rapidly become a highly respected figure in the bootstrapper/Indie Hacker community. One of
his (many) impressive feats to date was growing his Twitter following from zero to ~24k in around
nine months. This despite the fact that he was an ex-Amazon software engineer with no marketing experience.
More important than the actual follower numbers are his engagement levels, which
have led to him making six figures on various products.</p><p>Daniel created a video course explaining how he grew his Twitter audience called <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/twitter-audience">"Everyone
Can Build a Twitter Audience"</a>. I wanted to recap &amp; summarize
the key points as building an engaged audience is highly beneficial
for online course creators. Takeaways and thoughts are my own, and the links below are <strong>not</strong> affiliate/referral links.</p><h2><a href="#undefined"></a>Preamble - Why Care About Twitter</h2><p>Love it or hate it, Twitter can be incredibly effective for marketing products. Whilst other platforms
such as LinkedIn or Instagram can also be highly effective, this post is focused purely on Twitter. Twitter can be
particularly effective for marketing info products such as courses, ebooks, communities, podcasts, and newsletters. Over the last
years, I’ve seen a huge increase in business-related people sharing their stories and lessons
through Twitter.
Accounts like <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio">@levelsio</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ajlkn?lang=en">@ajlkn</a>,
and <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11">@patio11</a> have gained thousands of Twitter followers while they
shared the performance of their startups/SaaS/projects.</p><p>Daniel says: </p><blockquote><p>My Twitter account might be the most valuable asset I own.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://coursemaker.org/assets/twitter_audience/course_gumroad_page.png" alt="course image"></p><h2><a href="#undefined"></a>1. Start By Defining Success</h2><p>One of the things I really liked about the course was the deliberate definition of "success" in
terms of a Twitter audience. What Daniel boils it down to is:</p><blockquote><p>An audience who want to hear what you have to say</p></blockquote><p>Daniel suggests focusing more on tweet engagement than follower numbers. He advocates

Establish + Ratchet Your Credibility</h2><p>Credibility is the foundational theme of the course. Credibility prompts the following reaction:</p><blockquote><p>You want to hear more from this person, you have more questions for them and think they are likely to have the answers</p></blockquote><p>Daniel argues that you don't necessarily have to be an expert in a topic to build credibility (although that
definitely helps), but rather you need to have some noteable experience of the topic and some "skin
in the game". Here are some of the examples he gives:</p><ul><li>His own self-employed journey after leaving a $500k job at AWS</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/searchbound">This guy</a> who's been buying/selling domains for years</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/simonsarris">Simon Sarris</a> who tweets about how he built his own house (he looks
to have expanded his account to other topics since the course was made)</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/shl">Sahil, the founder of Gumroad</a> who tweets about startup life, finding
co-founders, and investment.</li></ul><p>What all of these accounts share in common is that their authors have done something relevant and
built up some form of tacit knowledge that others would find interesting or valuable.</p><p>Unlike many other social media commentators, Daniel suggests that rather than focusing exclusively
on one niche, you can gradually "ratchet" your credibility by expanding to other areas. In his case,
he began talking about his own personal finances. Note that this was always with the caveat that
it's based on personal experience rather than some vast "official" expertise. </p><p>Once you build credibility in one domain, it becomes
easier to build it in others. However, everything must start with some baseline of credibility.</p><blockquote><p>Sometimes it’s just a matter of showing what you’ve done, and how you’ve done it</p></blockquote><h2><a href="#undefined"></a>3. Your Profile</h2><p>Your bio should tell people:</p><ul><li>Why they should follow you</li><li>Weave in your credibility (pinned tweet is a good way to do this)</li><li>Tell people what you will be tweeting about</li><li>It's easier to use your real name, though you can go anonymous (only do so if you
really need to, e.g. to avoid conflicts at work)</li></ul><p>Daniel doesn't believe much in hashtags.</p><h2><a href="#undefined"></a>4. Tweeting &amp; Helping People Find You</h2><p>There are two types of tweet:</p><ol><li>Tweets where you are giving value</li><li>Tweets where you are asking for something (questions, polls, visit my product)</li></ol><p><strong>You should always know which of the two types your tweet is</strong></p><p><strong> You need to do a lot of giving before asking </strong> </p><p>Daniel waited until had around 6k followers before asking for anything.</p><ul><li>Minimize retweets (tend to fall into the "asking" category - not always, but probably 90%)</li><li>Avoid excessive automation or autogenerated templates - tweets should look like they come from a human</li><li>In the beginning, when you have no credibility, it’s most important to tweet in ways that
promote your credibility</li><li>Retweets won't be enough to get followers.</li><li>Reply to other people’s tweets where you feel you can add value to the original tweet </li><li>Don’t be too pushy with putting links to landing pages etc. Just add value for the target audience.</li><li>Turn on tweet notifications so you can be one of the first to reply - this really moved
the needle for Daniel early on.</li><li>Talk to people - reply to DMs</li></ul><p><img src="https://coursemaker.org/assets/twitter_audience/tweet_notifications.png" alt="tweet notifications"></p><h4><a href="#undefined"></a>What To Tweet About</h4><ul><li>Reflect at the end of the day about interesting things that happened during that day</li><li>Things that took you a lot of effort to figure out</li><li>Inspiration from talking to people</li><li>It's easier to get people to read a tweet thread rather than a blog post</li></ul><blockquote><p>Find the intersection of what interests you, your audience, and what you have credibility on</p></blockquote><h2><a href="#undefined"></a>5. Things to Avoid</h2><ul><li>Too much authenticity can be boring/uninteresting (e.g. talking about your favorite food)</li><li>You don’t have to share everything!</li><li>Talking about things you don’t have credibility on</li><li>Don't ask people to go to another link (very often)</li><li>Don't buy followers</li><li>Don't follow for a follow</li><li>Don't tag a bunch of people hoping they’ll notice you</li><li>Don't be a nuisance </li><li>Don't chase retweets</li><li>Don't ask for retweets</li><li>Don't get banned (assume trolls will look through your history)</li><li>Don't get addicted</li></ul><p>The above dos and don't will optimize what is fundamentally a funnel:</p><p><img src="https://coursemaker.org/assets/twitter_audience/twitter_funnel.jpg" alt="twitter funnel"></p><h2><a href="#undefined"></a>Useful Tools Daniel Vassallo Mentions in Everyone Can Build a Twitter Audience</h2><ul><li><a href="https://followerwonk.com/">followerwonk</a> - Twitter analytics and metrics</li><li><a href="https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/">TweetDeck</a> - column view with different users that you follow</li><li><a href="https://mailbrew.com/">mailbrew</a> - summarises tweets in an email</li></ul><p>Happy tweeting!</p></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-b9f64a9b22f91d323d73"><p>In this post we're going to take a look at a way of comparing two probability distributions called Kullback-Leibler Divergence (often shortened to just KL divergence). Very often in Probability and Statistics we'll replace observed data or a complex distributions with a simpler, approximating distribution. KL Divergence helps us to measure just how much information we lose when we choose an approximation.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_3_1494396184641_57224"><p>Let's start our exploration by looking at a problem. Suppose that we're space-scientists visiting a distant, new planet and we've discovered a species of biting worms that we'd like to study. We've found that these worms have 10 teeth, but because of all the chomping away, many of them end up missing teeth. After collecting many samples we have come to this empirical probability distribution of the number of teeth in each worm:</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_3_1494396184641_5321"><p><br>While this data is great, we have a bit of a problem. We're far from Earth and sending data back home is expensive. What we want to do is reduce this data to a simple model with just one or two parameters. One option is to represent the distribution of teeth in worms as just a uniform distribution. We know there are 11 possible values and we can just assign the uniform probability of \(\frac{1}{11}\) to each of these possibilities.&nbsp;</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_3_1494396184641_9620"><p>Clearly our data is not uniformly distributed, but it also doesn't look too much like any common distributions we know. Another option we could try would be to model our data using the <a href="https://www.countbayesie.com/blog/2015/3/17/interrogating-probability-distributions">Binomial distribution</a>. In this case all we need to do is estimate that probability parameter of the Binomial distribution. We know that if we have \(n\) trials and a probabily is \(p\) then the expectation is just \(E[x] = n \cdot p\). In this case \(n = 10\), and the expectation is just the mean of our data, which we'll say is 5.7, so our best estimate of p is 0.57. That would give us a binomal distribution that looks like this:</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_3_1494396184641_14237"><p>Comparing each of our models with our original data we can see that neither one is the perfect match, but which one is better?</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_3_1494396184641_18631"><div><p>There are plenty of existing error metrics, but our primary concern is with minimizing the amount of information we have to send. Both of these models reduce our problem to two parameters, number teeth and a probability (though we really only need the number of teeth for the uniform distribution). The best test of which is better is to ask which distribution preserves the most information from our original data source. This is where Kullback-Leibler Divergence comes in.</p><h2>The entropy of our distribution</h2><p>KL Divergence has its origins in information theory. The primary goal of information theory is to quantify how much information is in data. The most important metric in information theory is called Entropy, typically denoted as \(H\). The definition of Entropy for a probability distribution is:</p><p>$$H = -\sum_{i=1}^{N} p(x_i) \cdot \text{log }p(x_i)$$</p><p>If we use \(log_2\) for our calculation we can interpret entropy as "the minimum number of bits it would take us to encode our information". &nbsp;In this case, the information would be each observation of teeth counts given our empirical distribution. Given the data that we have observed, our probability distribution has an entropy of 3.12 bits.&nbsp;The number of bits tells us the lower bound for how many bits we would need, on average, to encode the number of teeth we would observe in a single case.</p><p>What entropy doesn't tell us is the optimal encoding scheme to help us achieve this compression. Optimal encoding of information is a very interesting topic, but not necessary for understanding KL divergence. The key thing with Entropy is that, simply knowing the theoretical lower bound on the number of bits we need, we have a way to quantify exactly how much information is in our data. Now that we can quantify this, we want to quantify how much information is lost when we substitute our observed distribution for a parameterized approximation.</p><h2>Measuring information lost using Kullback-Leibler Divergence</h2><p>Kullback-Leibler Divergence is just a slight modification of our formula for entropy. Rather than just having our probability distribution \(p\) we add in our approximating distribution \(q\). Then we look at the difference of the log values for each:</p><p>$$D_{KL}(p||q) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} p(x_i)\cdot (\text{log }p(x_i) - \text{log }q(x_i))$$</p><p><br>Essentially, what we're looking at with the KL divergence is the <a href="https://www.countbayesie.com/blog/2015/3/19/expectation-and-variance-from-high-school-to-grad-school">expectation</a> of the log difference between the probability of data in the original distribution with the approximating distribution. Again, if we think in terms of \(log_2\) we can interpret this as "how many bits of information we expect to lose". We could rewrite our formula in terms of expectation:</p><p>$$D_{KL}(p||q) = E[\text{log } p(x) - \text{log } q(x)]$$</p><p>The more common way to see KL divergence written is as follows:</p><p>$$D_{KL}(p||q) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} p(x_i)\cdot log\frac{p(x_i)}{q(x_i)}$$</p><p>since \(\text{log }a - \text{log b} = \text{log }\frac{a}{b}\).</p><p>With KL divergence we can calculate exactly how much information is lost when we approximate one distribution with another. Let's go back to our data and see what the results look like.</p><h2>Comparing our approximating distributions</h2><p>Now we can go ahead and calculate the KL divergence for our two approximating distributions. For the uniform distribution we find:</p><p>$$D_{kl}(\text{Observed } || \text{ Uniform}) = 0.338$$</p><p>And for our Binomial approximation:</p><p>$$D_{kl}(\text{Observed } || \text{ Binomial}) = 0.477$$</p><p>As we can see the <em>information lost</em> by using the Binomial approximation is greater than using the uniform approximation. If we have to choose one to represent our observations, we're better off sticking with the Uniform approximation.</p><h3>Divergence <em>not</em> distance</h3><p>It may be tempting to think of KL Divergence as a distance metric, however we cannot use KL Divergence to measure the <em>distance</em> between two distributions. The reason for this is that KL Divergence is <em>not symmetric</em>. For example we if used our observed data as way of approximating the Binomial distribution we get a very different result:</p><p>$$D_{kl}( \text{Binomial} || \text{Observed}) = 0.330$$<br>Intuitively this makes sense as in each of these cases we're doing a very different form of approximation.</p><h2>Optimizing using KL Divergence</h2><p>When we chose our value for the Binomial distribution we chose our parameter for the probability by using the expected value that matched our data. But since we're optimizing for minimizing information loss, it's possible this wasn't really the best way choose the parameter.&nbsp;We can double check our work by looking at the way KL Divergence changes as we change our values for this parameter. Here's a chart of how those values change together:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_3_1494396184641_28671"><div><p><br>As you can see, our estimate for the binomial distribution (marked by the dot) was the best estimate to minimize KL divergence.</p><p>Suppose we wanted to create an ad hoc distribution to model our data.&nbsp;We'll split the data in two parts. The probabilities for 0-5 teeth and the probabilities for 6-10 teeth. Then we'll use a single parameter to specify what percentage of the total probability distribution falls on the right side of the distribution. For example if we choose 1 for our parameter then 6-10 will each have a probability of 0.2 and everything in the 0-5 group would have a probability of 0. So basically:</p><p>$$[6,11] = \frac{p}{5}; [0,5] = \frac{1-p}{6}$$</p><p>Note: Because \(log\) is undefined for 0, the only time we can allow probabilities that are zero is when \(p(x_i) = 0\) implies \(q(x_i) = 0\).</p><p>How could we find the optimal parameter for this strange model we put together? All we need to do is minimize KL divergence the same way we did before:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_3_1494396184641_34372"><p><br>We find that the minimum value for KL Divergence is 0.338 found when \(p=0.47\). That value for the minimum KL divergence should look pretty familiar: it's nearly identical to the value we got from our uniform distribution! When we plot out the values of our ad hoc distribution with the ideal value for \(p\) we find that it is nearly uniform:</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_3_1494396184641_37635"><div><p>Since we don't save any information using our ad hoc distribution we'd be better off using a more familiar and simpler model.&nbsp;</p><p>The key point here is that we can use KL Divergence as an objective function to find the optimal value for any approximating distribution we can come up with. While this is example is only optimizing a single parameter, we can easily imagine extending this approach to high dimensional models with many parameters.</p><h2>Variational Autoencoders and Variational Bayesian methods</h2><p>If you are familiar with neural networks, you may have guessed where we were headed after the last section. Neural networks, in the most general sense, are function approximators. This means that you can use a neural network to learn a wide range of complex functions. The key to getting neural networks to learn is to use an objective function that can inform the network how well it's doing. You train neural networks by minimizing the loss of the objective function.&nbsp;</p><p>As we've seen, we can use KL divergence to minimize how much information loss we have when approximating a distribution. Combining KL divergence with neural networks allows us to learn very complex approximating distribution for our data. A common approach to this is called a "Variational Autoencoder" which learns the best way to approximate the information in a data set. Here is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05908">a great tutorial </a>that dives into the details of building variational autoencoders.</p><p>Even more general is the area of Variational Bayesian Methods. In other posts we've seen how powerful <a href="https://www.countbayesie.com/blog/2015/3/3/6-amazing-trick-with-monte-carlo-simulations">Monte Carlo simulations</a> can be to solve a range of probability problems. While Monte Carlo simulations can help solve many intractable integrals needed for Bayesian inference, even these methods can be very computationally expensive. Variational Bayesian method, including Variational Autoencoders, use KL divergence to generate optimal approximating distributions, allowing for much more efficient inference for very difficult integrals.

<p>The hardware and software worlds may seem poles apart, and in many ways, they indeed are. But there’s a wealth of knowledge that each can learn from the other. Despite the seemingly massive differences in the final product, they share more in common than you might expect. </p>



<p>Computer engineers at places like Intel, just like software engineers, spend most of their time sitting at their desks, writing (verilog) code that implements the desired system behavior. They then compile (synthesize) their code in order to generate lower-level outputs (digital circuits and physical layouts). And finally, they write automated tests that exercise their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_under_test" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SUT</a>, to ensure that the code is functionally correct. Sound familiar?</p>



<p>I know all this intimately, given my own past as a hardware engineer, and my later transition into software development. After finishing my Master’s degree in Computer Architecture, I spent over 5 years working at Intel and Sun as a Hardware Verification engineer, before turning down a senior-staff role at Apple, in order to reboot my career as a software developer.</p>



<p>In the past 5 years, I’ve worked in some great software teams at places like Google, and have also led development for multiple personal projects in my free time. The programmers that I’ve met and worked with are undoubtedly smart, and possess a number of skills that my hardware colleagues should strive to emulate. However, one thing I’ve noticed is that when it comes to testing, their instincts have been… off. Way off. </p>



<p>Here’s my attempt to distill the lessons I’ve learnt from my Hardware days, and how they can be applied to improve our Software testing methodologies and outcomes.</p>



<p><em>Disclaimer: this post is focused on non-UI programming, where functionality can be 100% covered without the need for “eyeballing”. Front-end/UI testing is a whole other beast that I wouldn’t comment on or touch with a ten foot pole.</em></p>







<p>The elephant in the room in most software companies, is the perceived importance of testing. In hardware, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://anysilicon.com/verification-validation-testing-asicsoc-designs-differences/" target="_blank">pre-silicon verification</a> is a first-class citizen in the development process. Dedicated verification engineers earn 6 figure salaries, sit next to their RTL design counterparts in all planning meetings, and enjoy careers that are just as prestigious and lucrative. In comparison, at most software companies I’ve come across, testing is treated as a 2nd class citizen – being a “test engineer” (or worse, “tester”) is often maligned as being less prestigious or lucrative.</p>



<p>This difference in culture isn’t an accident of nature. It’s a natural consequence of the much higher stakes in the hardware world. Because the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tape-out" target="_blank">tapeout</a> process is so expensive and time consuming, finding even a single bug can delay your product launch by months, and cost you millions of dollars in additional expenses. Or worse: finding a bug after your customers have already purchased and installed the chips, can result in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_FDIV_bug" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="extremely expensive product recalls (opens in a new tab)">extremely expensive product recalls</a>. Even if the fix is a simple one-line code change.</p>



<p>The consequences of software bugs can certainly be disastrous. But at least the fix is extremely cheap logistically – code deployments and software patches are vastly faster and cheaper than manufacturing and distributing new silicon. Hence why hardware organizations take testing much more seriously than comparable software companies.</p>



<p>The results do speak for themselves. Hardware products that are in the hands of customers, have an order-of-magnitude fewer bugs. The percentage of bugs that are caught prior to release, is vastly higher in the hardware industry as compared to the software industry.</p>



<h4>A Better Way</h4>



<p>It is tempting to say that hardware teams are better at testing, purely because of their greater financial investment. That software teams are already operating at their most ideal, and that improvements in testing-quality can only be had through sacrifices in time/cost. </p>



<p>Such a view is unjustifiably optimistic about the current state of affairs, and pessimistic about our potential for improvement. Over the past decades we have vastly improved our software-development practices and methodologies. There’s no reason to believe that we have now achieved a state of nirvana where no further improvements are possible.</p>



<p>Even though many programmers tend to short change it, testing-methodology is itself a skill set. One that is learned over time by an entire industry, at a rate proportional to its level of investment. And in this sense, the hardware industry is miles ahead when it comes to testing best-practices. Not because they are “smarter” in any way, but simply because their survival depends on it.</p>



<p>You wouldn’t expect a football player to be able to jump as high as a basketball player.<br>You wouldn’t expect a restaurant to take cleanliness as seriously as a hospital.<br>You definitely shouldn’t expect a software organization to master testing best-practices, the way a hardware company has.</p>



<p>If you want to master the art of testing, talk to a hardware verification engineer.</p>







<h2>The 0th Law of Testing: Only the Paranoid Survive</h2>



<p>If it hasn’t been tested, it doesn’t work. <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="“If this isn't absolutely true, it is certainly a good working assumption for project work.” (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.hyperthot.com/pm_princ.htm" target="_blank">“If this isn’t absolutely true, it is certainly a good working assumption for project work.” </a></em>This rule forms the foundation for most other lessons listed here.</p>



<p>Word of Warning: The universe of all possible inputs and corner-cases is infinite. Hence, you will never attain 100% coverage via empirical testing. You will never cross the finish-line. If you ever think that you are “done” with testing, you’re in for a surprise. All you can do is chase as much coverage as can be attained, with the amount of time and resources available.</p>



<h2>Manual Testing is not good enough</h2>



<p>Things I’ve heard developers say:</p>



<p><em>“This is so important, that we have to test it manually. I don’t trust an automated test to do the job.”</em><br><em>“Don’t worry about trying to build automated tests. We’ve been manually testing these changes.”</em></p>



<p>What a Hardware engineer would say instead:</p>



<p><em>“This is so important, that we have to build an automated test suite for it. I don’t trust human testers to do the job.”</em><br><em>“Maybe run a few tests manually as a final sanity check, but don’t spend too much time since it’s been auto-tested pretty well.”</em></p>



<p>Running a couple tests by hand and eyeballing the results, might work in a college VLSI class. But it’s going to get you laughed at in industry. Manual testing cannot be code-reviewed on GitHub. Manual testing is subject to human error, whether due to oversight or laziness. Manual testing is extremely time and labor intensive, when subjected to every single release.</p>



<p>There might be specific exceptions where a test cannot be automated. But these should be the exception – not the norm. Reliability ultimately comes from the strength of your automated test suite, not how much manual testing you’re doing. Anything important enough to test by hand, is important enough to build an automated test suite for.</p>



<h2><strong>Testing Two Inputs in Isolation != Testing Them Together</strong></h2>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>Suppose your team is implementing and testing the following method:</p>


<pre title="">public static double myCustomDivider(double numerator, double divisor);
</pre>


<p>Alice:<em> “Do we have tests checking correct behavior for negative inputs?”</em><br>Bob:<em> “I have a test where the numerator is negative, and another test where the divisor is negative”</em><br>Alice: <em>“Do you have a 3rd test where they are both negative?”</em><br>Bob: <em>“No, and we don’t need that. We’ve already covered both cases individually.”</em></p>



<p>You laugh, but I’ve heard variations of this said far too many times, by far too many senior developers.</p>



<p>If the 2 inputs are completely decoupled, maybe it makes sense to assume we don’t need to test them in combination. But often times, 2 inputs which are assumed to be decoupled, aren’t nearly as decoupled as people think. And even if the implementation is indeed decoupled at the time of writing the test, it can often evolve to become coupled at a later time. As the saying goes: <em>“It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.”</em></p>



<p>As a general heuristic: If 2 inputs are both being parsed within the same method, there is definitely value in testing them in combination.</p>



<p>Perhaps you’ve decided that the risk-reward tradeoff merits not writing tests to cover some combinations. This is certainly a reasonable decision to make, depending on the particular project circumstances and the events being considered. But do so cognizant of the risk you’re taking on. Do not delude yourself into thinking that there’s no value in testing combinations of multiple events.</p>



<h2>Testing Output_A for Event_1 != Testing Output_A for Event_2</h2>



<p>Suppose you find yourself needing to test the following addPerson method:</p>


<pre title="">public int getAge(String name);
public int getHeight(String name);
public int getWeight(String name);

// Returns true if a previous value was overwritten
public boolean addPerson(Person person);
</pre>


<p>And so you write the following tests:</p>


<pre title="">@Test

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hook="post-description"><article><div><div data-rce-version="8.17.5"><div dir="ltr"><div><p id="viewer-foo"><span>A few streets away, there's this famous bakery. Before COVID-19 changed everything in 2020, the store was always full. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, they got shut down for a few weeks in Spring 2020. Customers weren't allowed to come in and order. These days only a handful of people can come in at a time. During sunny days, customers don't mind waiting outside in the queue. But on rainy days, rarely somebody drops by. It has been a massive hit for the business and still takes time to recover from it. </span></p><p id="viewer-b3ecc"><span><strong>Worst of all</strong>: They may get shut down again if cases rise. How could this business possibly survive in uncertain times? COVID-19 cases could rise again quickly, causing another shutdown.</span></p><p id="viewer-7uac9"><span>If we look at the situation from a birds-eye perspective, the bakery itself would be allowed to produce goods; the only restriction is customer contact. </span></p><p id="viewer-e8dpj"><span>Since the brick-and-mortar store is small, only one or two customers at a time could come inside. Also, the owner needs to keep staff safe, reducing contact with customers as much as possible. The long queues on sunny days prove that there's a demand for pastries and bread. Yet, it's unpleasant for customers to queue up, possibly having to wait for 20 minutes or longer, before it's their turn. On top of that comes the uncertainty of not knowing if their favorite pastry is still available once they can place an order.</span></p><p id="viewer-4km9g"><span>Now, if COVID-19 cases would rise again, no customer would be allowed to come inside the store. The only way of conducting business during these times would be curbside-pickup. Some customers have been trying to order ahead via phone. The staff answers the phone, takes their order, and prepares everything. Still, customers have to wait in line. Accepting orders via phone is taking away time from working off the queue. On top of that, it's error-prone, as sometimes customers are mumbling or order slips get lost. </span></p><p id="viewer-1nkek"><span>What could the bakery do instead? If order-ahead and curbside-pickup were the default mode of doing business, how could they optimize for a pleasant customer experience and secure the revenue they desperately need? As some of the customers ordered ahead via phone, let's start by making this process easier for the customers and less time consuming for the staff. Instead of calling ahead, it should be possible to place an order with the bakery even the night before. The customer could be sure they'd get their favorite bread and pastries the next morning, without a long time waiting and without risking unnecessary exposure to other people.

<p>This week I had a discussion with one of my friends on how to choose a programming language. It was triggered by multiple discussions I had with our customers on their engineering strategy in the last six months and one question that came multiple times was should we use X programming language for our new initiatives. Some customers were thinking of moving from .NET stack to Java, some banks were thinking about moving to Golang because their technical leaders have watched Monzo talks on Golang, for some it was from Java to Kotlin, and some were thinking of dumping JavaScript for Typescript.</p>



<p>To come up with the answer I try to find answers to following questions in context of the organization:</p>



<ul><li>What is the maturity of the programming language with respect to its community and ecosystem? Should they spend their one innovation token on this language?</li><li>How easy it is to find available talent in the market for that programming language?&nbsp;</li><li>How easy it is for the organization to acquire production engineering know-how for a programming language?</li><li>What are the productivity and efficiency gains that can be achieved from using a programming language? Are those gains aligned with the organization goals?</li><li>What are the use-cases an organization wants to solve with the programming language?</li><li>What is the future of a programming language? For a big enterprise it is important if the language can last for a decade.</li><li>What is the learning curve of the programming language? Can existing staff be upskilled?</li></ul>



<p>There is no correct answer to these questions. Most engineering organizations will end up using multiple programming languages. For example an organization may choose Golang as a general purpose language to build backend services, Python for scripting and data related work, Typescript for building web frontend. It is also possible that an engineering organization might choose Python for building most services and for few where performance and efficiency is important it chooses Golang. I think the important point is defining a small list of programming languages for the organization and documenting when you will choose which programming language.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I use a decision matrix like the one shown below to come up with one possible answer. Depending on which factors are important to the organization they can give them weights and that will impact the score of the language. In the image shown below, language 1 is the winner.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/WGB2gGPDUN24IZXig5kZSGzKwcpwSIfP5dzPMp5gxTpIGw5g5rRlqcsWPSTYDY0QWf6U0D14oL9dfTeRZlDanEwK54XjJIirmMeIGTL62skChi8YxVTBZcpeJyRbnveFCKYW3d7U" alt=""></figure>



<p>As I was writing this post a few more questions came to my mind.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Does a programming language help us write less buggy software?</li><li>Does a programming language have some constructs that help us reduce the essential complexity of the system?</li><li>What constraints does a programming language impose and how do they impact the business goals?</li><li>Can a programming language be a competitive advantage for an organization?</li><li>Can a programming language influence the quality of the development team, the quality of code, and practices they follow?</li><li>Does a programming language influence engineering organization culture?</li><li>Can a programming language over time help average Joe become a good software engineer?</li><li>What makes a programming language future safe? Can we predict it to safeguard us?</li><li>Should a language choice depend on NFRs that you want to achieve?</li><li>How does a programming language influence behavior of a team?</li></ul>



<p>I don’t have answers to all of the above mentioned questions. I am hoping there is academic research done on the above but I am yet to read those papers.</p>



<p>I did some research on why different organizations choose certain languages and I found the following key points.</p>



<ol><li>Gitlab – Ruby – <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2018/10/29/why-we-use-rails-to-build-gitlab/">Link</a><ul><li>GitHub, a source of inspiration for GitLab, was also based on Rails, making it a logical pick considering his interest in the framework.</li><li>Ruby on Rails ecosystem allows you to shape a lot of functionality at a high quality</li><li>We need a lot of functionality and Ruby on Rails is a way to do it</li><li>Consistent coding practices. You are guided to do the right thing.</li><li>Big community of Ruby gems</li></ul></li><li>CockroachDB – Golang – <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/why-go-was-the-right-choice-for-cockroachdb/">Link</a><ul><li>its support for libraries, interfaces, and tooling positioned it as the right choice for CockroachDB</li><li>Go was designed to scale to large code bases with an emphasis on simplicity and orthogonality of features. The enforced code style, the simple imports and automated import management, the wide variety of linters, the straightforward (and minimal) set of programmatic idioms…all of these attributes of Go are important for clean, understandable code.</li><li>When comparing to Java, we appreciate the tight focus on implementation instead of OOP and abstraction: interfaces can be added when needed, not as an initial, often unnecessary, step.&nbsp;</li><li>When comparing to C++, we appreciate automatic memory management and how there’s rarely more than one way to get something done, for example with static and one-time initializers.</li><li>Go gives better control over memory allocation that impacts garbage collection.</li></ul></li><li>Asana – TypeScript – <a href="https://blog.asana.com/2014/11/asana-switching-typescript/">Link</a><ul><li>Clean JS</li><li>Community Support</li><li>Errors at compile time instead of runtime</li><li>Static typing</li></ul></li><li>American Express – Golang – <a href="https://go.dev/solutions/americanexpress/">Link</a> and <a href="https://americanexpress.io/choosing-go/">Link</a><ul><li>For their assessment, they chose to build a microservice in four different programming languages. They then compared the four languages for speed/performance, tooling, testing, and ease of development.</li><li>While Go may not have been the fastest language tested, its powerful tooling helped bolster its overall results. Go’s built-in testing framework, profiling capabilities, and benchmarking tools impressed the team.</li><li>Reasons<ul><li>Simple and straightforward</li><li>Encourage best practices</li><li>Concurrency</li><li>Tooling</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Nubank – Clojure – <a href="https://building.nubank.com.br/working-with-clojure-at-nubank/">Link</a><ul><li>Nubank provides services in the finance domain, which is very close to mathematical functions — and functional programming is an excellent fit for both scenarios.</li><li>Clojure, on the other hand, has simple constructs that allow us to focus on the problem we are solving, making evolving the system a small incremental challenge, which doesn’t get that much harder over time.</li><li>Most of our codebase can be understood locally, looking at any given pure function, understanding its outputs for any given set of inputs. There’s rarely any need to reason about or recreate the internal state of objects. Data moves through the system in a composable, inspectable, consistent, and immutable way (without hiding it inside of objects).</li><li>Functional code is much easier to test, and that gives us the confidence to deploy an average of over 50 changes per day in a mission-critical domain.</li><li>Nubank has acquired Cognitect, the US-based software consultancy behind the Clojure programming language and the Datomic database</li></ul></li><li>Janestreet – Ocaml – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1CmGbOGb2I">Link</a> , <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2038036">Link</a> , and <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/does-jane-street-use-other-programming-languages-aside-from-ocaml/2761/5">Link</a><ul><li>Brevity of the language and the powerful type system that makes OCaml code very readable</li><li>Powerful abstraction capabilities that reduce boilerplates</li><li>Static type system for ensuring code correctness</li><li>He spoke about some of the fancy type tricks like parametric polymorphism, algebraic data types, type inference, phantom types and type indexed values that add to the expressivity of code.</li><li>Also OCaml hits the sweet spot between expressiveness of code and the performance numbers. The very much tunable GC makes things easier to control.</li></ul></li><li>Starling Bank – Java – <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/starling-bank/">Link</a><ul><li>Exceptions are noisy and difficult to ignore</li><li>Reliable ecosystem (user base, tooling, job market, etc)&nbsp;</li><li>Integrations with legacy third parties (SOAP etc)</li></ul></li><li>KhanAcademy – Golang – <a href="https://blog.khanacademy.org/go-services-one-goliath-project/">Link</a><ul><li>Kotlin was more performant</li><li>Golang used much less memory</li></ul></li><li>Lyft – TypeScript – <a href="https://eng.lyft.com/typescript-at-lyft-64f0702346ea">Link</a><ul><li>Popularity</li><li>Type safety</li><li>Less Bugs</li><li>Productivity</li></ul></li><li>Medium – Golang – <a href="https://medium.engineering/rex-mediums-go-recommendation-microservice-e077bc9582a">Link</a><ul><li>More efficient use of the CPU. While Node is single-threaded, Go is much better suited for the combination of I/O and CPU-intensive operations required to build a ranked feed. Splitting our work onto separate Goroutines means we can avoid the issue of the CPU getting hogged by one single request and other requests getting starved.</li><li>Opinionated. Go makes it pretty hard to write “bad” code. A typed language that is also highly opinionated in terms of code styling means that even a newbie to Go (which I was when we started writing Rex) can quickly start writing clean and readable code.</li><li>Prior experience with Go. While much of Medium’s codebase is written in Node, we already had a few smaller-purpose microservices in Go. Adding another microservice in a language that we as a company have familiarity with makes building and maintaining this new service much easier.</li></ul></li><li>Instagram – Python – <a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/web-service-efficiency-at-instagram-with-python-4976d078e366">Link</a><ul><li>Simplicity</li><li>Practicality</li></ul></li></ol>



<p>I hope this post helps you understand that there is much more to choosing a programming language.</p>

          <p>February 12, 2021</p>

<p>Monty Python’s “Bicycle Repair Man” is a fitting allegory for the information security industry. It is filled with supermen and -women who fight bad guys with their super powers, such as threat hunting, attribution and TTPs. The big question however is, are enough of us looking after our own infrastructure, our “bicycles”?</p>

<p>The SolarWinds case is no different, as in the heat of the moment everybody is focused on attributing the malice and all things related. My position is that in addition, we should also pay attention to what may have led into this situation, which oftentimes simply is poor security posture due to a failure in people, processes or technology.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even more precisely, the crux of the problem often lies in poor IT processes related to patching, access control or other “boring stuff”, such as keeping X.509 certificates from expiring.</p>

<h2 id="how-dare-you-say-that-out-loud">How dare you say that out loud?</h2>

<p>Simply, because for more than a decade I’ve been helping people in their mission to reduce incidence of suspected compromise, publicly exposed vulnerable services or open services which may be unintentionally exposed to the Internet - at nation scale and through automation.</p>



<p>SolarWinds is a company, whose mission is to make the IT administration simpler and more secure at scale. This is a great mission and I fault the company not with what they have built or how secure their products are.</p>

<p>The challenge seems to be the fact how well they have their own people, processes and technology in line with what they enable their customers to achieve through their products.</p>

<h2 id="can-you-show-me-the-proof">Can you show me the proof?</h2>

<p>Yes, as the proof is in the open for everyone to see. Look at their publicly available network assets and connect the dots between the assets and known vulnerabilities observed through Shodan. I did this with the help of our research into 86 specific known and vetted issues on Shodan and matched the data against the SolarWinds assets and the picture is quite clear and unflattering.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-you-singling-them-out">Why are you singling them out?</h2>

<p>Their case is actual and well known and if a tragedy on such a scale can contribute to the common good, then we should seize the opportunity. On 2021-01-12, we reached out to SolarWinds to confirm that the network assets we used for the evaluation actually belong to them. We even offered them the findings to help them mitigate them. Unfortunately, they did not respond to our requests and we are now publishing our results in this blog post.</p>

<p>Given the constraints I lay out below, they clearly have not done their due diligence and as a result we have this mess, where threat actors must have had a field day in gaining initial access to the company - no zero days needed.</p>

<p>I implore you to reflect that in addition to threat signatures and TTPs about the malice, we need to start looking at the security posture of organizations as well - and not just after a high profile breach such as this one. The information I present below after all, is public and most likely used by threat actors every single day.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the vulnerabilities I detail below, plague most organizations on the Internet. Picking three prominent US defense contractors at random, I found most of the same issues related to their network assets as well, namely General Dynamics, Harris Corporation or Northrop Grumman.</p>

<h2 id="so-whats-the-evidence">So what’s the evidence?</h2>

<p>As stated above, I used the 86 vetted queries from Shodan against the publicly available network asset information related to SolarWinds. In essence, I used the same approach as the cyber rating companies do, which means that they rely in large part on publicly available IP network registration information when producing their ratings of you.</p>

<p>To be reproducible, the uncertainties related to the interpretation of the results must at least account for the following four things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>That the network asset in question belongs to the right party, which in this case study should be SolarWinds.</li>
  <li>That the service in question may be honeypot, whose intention is to monitor for scanning and/or exploitation of the emulated service.</li>
  <li>That the service implementation based version matching suffers from patch backporting, which means that the detection or assessment method cannot solely rely on a simple version banner.</li>
  <li>That the party doing the interpretation has to be able to understand the impact, as just having all the Shodan matches against a network asset alone makes interpretation difficult in practice.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-are-the-observations-then">What are the observations then?</h2>

<p>In this case, I used evidence from the last 6 months mapped against the publicly available network asset attributable to SolarWinds. Mapping the 86 topics against those assets with automation, I was able to detect seven distinct vulnerabilities in their infrastructure, as follows:</p>

<p><img src="https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/swell-rail.cloudvent.net/hash-store/0f84f98834724a9d07eea6fba20806d4.png" alt="" width="1390" height="532" data-cms-original-src="/images/content/image1-1.png"></p>

<h4 id="expired-x509">Expired X.509</h4>

<p>If you have ever done systems administration of any type of Internet facing services, you have battled against time and expiration of X.509 certificates, which prove the identity of your service to its users. You’re probably thinking right now that wait, we should be talking about vulnerabilities, about CVEs, right? Remote code execution, the sexy stuff. My favorite retort to that is the following: the Equifax data breach which exposed the PII of 147 million people was largely caused by expired X.509 certificates in critical monitoring systems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>shodan dork: ssl.cert.expired:true&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="sslv2">SSLv2&nbsp;</h4>

<p>The arms race against crypt analysis has accelerated over the past couple of years. This means that cryptographic hashes or ciphers perfectly acceptable five years ago have become obsolete. SSL version 2 is a cryptographic protocol, which hasn’t met the requirement for Internet facing services for even longer. Its use was prohibited by RFC 6167 in 2011.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="exposed-snmp">Exposed SNMP&nbsp;</h4>

<p>Simple Network Management Protocol is very handy for gathering low-level information about networked devices and their status, especially in the switch and router space. As demonstrated by OUSPG PROTOS project in 2002, SNMP, whatever the version, is not and will not be a protocol fit for the Internet. Access to SNMP implementations must be access controlled to those devices, which are under your control, no matter which version of the protocol the device is speaking. Google “c06-snmp test suite” and assess the ramifications yourself, if you need more background on the issue. Moreover, threat actors have abused SNMP for reflected DDoS attacks for years, since sending a single spoofed UDP packet with the source address of the target will yield a huge amplification factor to their DDoS traffic.</p>

<h4 id="exposed-telnet">Exposed Telnet&nbsp;</h4>

<p>Before the advent of SSH, telnet was the de facto protocol for remote management or shell access to systems or devices. In 1995, a Finnish engineer called Tatu Ylönen invented SSH, which made the telnet obsolete overnight. 25 years later, however, telnet is still going strong for some reason. There simply is not any Internet facing use case for the service, period.&nbsp;</p>

<p>shodan dork: port:23</p>

<h4 id="exposed-mysql">Exposed MySQL&nbsp;</h4>

<p>Even if MySQL database engine is the de facto component as a backend service for many an Internet facing service, exposing it directly to the Internet without any further access control in front of it is inviting disaster. Recently, there was a major data breach in Finland, which allegedly resulted from the database backend being directly exposed to the Internet without any further access control in front of it. Layered security is not just a fancy buzz word. In many cases the database backend doesn’t even need to be reachable over the network at all, but when it does, access to it must be locked down to only those hosts, which actually need it.</p>

<h4 id="cve-2015-0204-aka-freak">CVE-2015-0204 a.k.a. FREAK</h4>

<p>Compliance with US cryptographic export controls lies at the heart of this vulnerability. An Internet facing service simply should not support negotiation of an encrypted connection, which is possible to decipher using $100 worth of cloud computing resources. We could even rename this vulnerability, man-in-the-middle made easy.</p>

<h4 id="cve-2019-10149">CVE-2019-10149&nbsp;</h4>

<p>Exim is a popular Mail Transfer Agent, MTA, used in many mostly linux-based servers. It has had a mottled history with information security and in 2019, a serious flaw was discovered in it, which leads to remote code execution.

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>I know maintaining and repairing “bicycles” is tedious. This work, however, is the thing that will keep you safer and make it more difficult for the threat actors to attack you. I’m not saying that the threat actor’s initial access in the case of SolarWinds could’ve been prevented by addressing the specific issues I highlighted above, but it would’ve made it more difficult.</p>

<p>Building security in and making it layered is the only foundation you can build on that gives you predictability in a much more coherent way than investing in the magic security technology X that exploits the hype of the day. Building security in, means investing in people and processes as well.</p>

<p>One of the big challenges is that this type of information security work is not viewed as glorious or sought …</p></div></div>

                    <p>Much has been covered about developer salaries based on coding language, location, job title, and so on. However, little has been done to chart the rise and fall of developer salaries over the years.</p><p>Tracing developer salaries over the last 20 years was an interesting endeavor. Researching the topic meant changing the language I used to search for data. <br>Back in the early 2000s, tech and software were referred to as “Information Technology” (IT) or “Information and Communications Technology” (ICT), developers were still referred to as “IT workers” and little was mentioned about the many specialized roles we have today.</p><p>To go back in time, I mainly referred to data published by the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/tables.htm">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> as they offered the most comprehensive year on year data. I looked at data from alternate years, from 2001 to 2019.</p><h2 id="starting-in-the-year-2000">Starting in the year 2000</h2><p>At the turn of the century, <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2000/07/21/career/q_degreecompsci/">CNN Money</a> reported that the average starting salary for an entry-level computer programmer was $40,800.</p><p>Fresh graduates were also paid differently based on the degrees they held:</p><ul><li>Computer engineering: $49,505</li><li>Computer science: $48,740</li><li>Information science: $38,900</li><li>Management information systems: $41,800</li></ul><p>Due to the shortage of skilled workers going into tech fields, salaries in America for IT graduates became more and more competitive. Salaries in 2000 were already 10% higher than the previous year and, apart from information science majors, were well above the <a href="https://www.naceweb.org/job-market/compensation/salary-trends-through-salary-survey-a-historical-perspective-on-starting-salaries-for-new-college-graduates">national average starting salary</a> of $39,824.</p><figure><img src="https://codesubmit.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/cs-grads-2000-2.png"><figcaption>The "IT Industry" looked different in 2000 than it does today</figcaption></figure><p>The following table shows the average annual salary for developers, programmers, and other IT-related job functions, across all industries in the year 2000:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><table>

That year, while wages did not fall despite the dot-com burst, around 400,000 Americans working in IT-related roles lost their jobs going into 2001.</p><p>2008 was when the stock market crashed. Similar to the dot-com burst in 2001, wages in 2008 remained relatively unchanged. However, roughly 111,000 Americans working in IT-related fields lost their jobs going into 2009. </p><p>2008 was also the year when wages began to increase at a slower rate compared to previous years. While individuals enjoyed an average of $5,000 increase every two years previously, after 2008, wages only increased by $2,000 every two years. </p><p>Generally speaking, from 2001 to 2011, individuals working in tech had at least a 21% increase in wages over time. Systems Software Engineers experienced the largest jump in wages, an increase of 35%.</p><p><strong>Average salary increase from 2001-2011:</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><table>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="what-to-expect-in-the-future">What to expect in the future</h2><p>In the years to come, industry experts expect <a href="https://medium.com/predict/are-programmers-headed-toward-another-bursting-bubble-528e30c59a0e">low-level coding and programming jobs to become obsolete</a> with the development of new tools that remove the need to code completely. Take for example the role of Web Developers when it comes to building websites. With popular CMS tools like WordPress and Squarespace, almost anyone can build a website for their business, reducing the need for people who know “just a little bit of front end web development”. </p><p>As automation takes away the need for “basic” coding jobs, new skills or a combination of skills will be needed in the future for roles that don’t even exist yet. The need for field experts and true problem solvers will never disappear. The key is to adapt and learn as new technologies emerge. </p><p><strong>Additional sources:</strong><br><a href="http://www.oecd.org/digital/ieconomy/1939833.pdf">OECD Technology Outlook Report 2000</a><br><a href="http://www.oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/37620123.pdf">OECD Technology Outlook Report 2004</a><br><a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/it_outlook-2010-sum-en.pdf?expires=1612698150&amp;id=id&amp;accname=guest&amp;checksum=7DC9765AA37510F78D7BBDA7FF42254D">OECD Information Technology Outlook Summary 2010</a><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iGfVr1j-VStKVwSWvVvSo3qbwwHTL_V9tPttpeBTmK4/edit?usp=sharing">BLS data in Google Sheets</a></p>

<h2>About Metrics</h2>



<p><strong>Vidal: </strong>[00:07] Kan you are an expert in engineering metrics. I was really impressed that the discussion we had about engineering metrics last week. Could you tell people how did you get so interested in engineering metrics?</p>



<p><strong>Kan: </strong>[00:20] It wasn’t specifically about engineering metrics. What made me interested in this topic was there were engineers, and we are proud to say that we are logical. We acknowledge data, and we make decisions better based off of data. But once we look into an engineering organization, the application yes, we have lots of data, and we make really good decisions on the application. </p>



<p>But once we go into the process of how do we actually do this engineering process? We don’t have the data, and we don’t use anything. Everything is mostly based on gut feeling. And that made me uncomfortable. I wanted to figure out why engineering among all different organizational teams, such as sales or marketing, did not use any data, whereas every single other one did. So I went into that problem, and that led me to metrics itself.</p>



<p><strong>Vidal: </strong>[01:19] How long have you been working in this field of engineering data and metrics?</p>



<p><strong>Kan: </strong>[01:24] So I had been working on this for more than a year and a half full-time talking to people of understanding why they are using metrics. What is the reason and how does it make our lives better?</p>



<h2>The Goal of Metrics</h2>



<p><strong>Vidal: </strong>[01:39] What is the goal of metrics? Why should we care about these?</p>



<p><strong>Kan: </strong>[01:43] Why do we track anything? Why do we have metrics? The base reason is to align people to a specific goal. For companies, this is revenue. We have a single goal, to make sure that the company is profitable. That is our metric to track.</p>



<p>And this goes into every different even if you’re like having, let’s say you want to lose weight, you have a goal. And the metric represents that, which is how many kilos are you at the moment? For engineering, this was missing. So I was really interested in what should the engineering organization track.</p>



<p><strong>Vidal: </strong>[02:21] You’ve also spoken with hundreds of engineering managers.&nbsp; And that’s how we connected. What are some common mistakes or misunderstandings that managers have on this topic?</p>



<h2>Common Mistakes</h2>



<p><strong>Kan: </strong>[02:32] So there are a few mistakes that they do. The first one is the obvious one, which is big brother. You’re tracking all of my actions, and that sounds like big brother. You don’t want to be tracked — it feels from an engineer’s perspective, it doesn’t feel good. And there’s a reason for this. People have tracked engineers with the wrong metrics. There’s this guy called <a href="https://amzn.to/39W8NhG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Eliyahu Goldratt. He wrote the book, The Goal.</a> And in his book, he specifically mentioned that <strong>if you track anybody with metrics that can not control that they won’t care.</strong></p>



<div><figure><a href="https://amzn.to/2N4jp5f" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/519C2Gz-v2L.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/519C2Gz-v2L.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></a></figure></div>



<p>And that is what happens in engineering metrics. They try to track engineers with metrics that they don’t control. That is the biggest mistake that I have seen. The second biggest mistake is tracking metrics, which doesn’t and result into the organization success. </p>



<p>So an example of this is the number of commits. That has no correlation whatsoever with the company’s success, and a lot of companies track the number of commits and other ones lines of code. These are numbers. You can track them, but it doesn’t mean anything, and it won’t make your company successful because of this. The engineers themselves —&nbsp; they know it internally. They know that it doesn’t represent the company’s success and they feel like “I’m just being tracked by an arbitrary number.” And it goes back into something that doesn’t matter. </p>



<p>So you need to make sure that you’re tracking two different things. One is that the team can control those metrics. The second point is those metrics actually align with the company’s goals.</p>



<p><strong>Vidal: </strong>[04:13] I think that’s a great point. Yes. If you can’t really control the metric, what do you, what are you going to do? Just pray that it changes? </p>



<h2>Two Best Practices</h2>



<p><strong>Vidal:</strong> We talked about some of the mistakes people make. What do you understand to be some of the best practices? What should people do?</p>



<p><strong>Kan: </strong>[04:26] Specifically for engineering teams, I will be by default, I’ll mention about product engineering. That is where we have figured out what metrics to track. I don’t know about R &amp; D or other departments of engineering, so there’s a distinction between that for product engineering, what are the best practices of tracking.</p>



<p>It goes into the team level. <strong>If you track the individual level, what happens usually is you don’t get the signal of the process. You get the signal of the person, and it’s a shaky number.</strong> A person might work hard today, but tomorrow they might do design, and the next day they might actually have lots of meetings.</p>



<p>And if you try to track it by a single number, you’ll get lots of spiky graphs and that won’t result into actionable results. But if you do that in team level, You will actually get a really good understanding of what the process is. And if I do any kind of iteration in my process, you can see that change in that team’s habits and in that team’s metrics. So that is one best practice that I can say. <strong>Don’t track individuals, track teams</strong>. </p>



<p>The second best practice is, this goes into the mistakes as well, make sure that the team can control the metric itself. Most of the teams that I have seen tried to put product metrics inside engineering organizations.</p>



<p>How I will describe it in this way, monthly active users. I have seen quite a few engineering teams being judged on monthly active users. There are other metrics such as JIRA tasks completed, or it’s usually goes into story points completed. Story points completed is again, it looks fine. You think that it represents the delivery of that specific team.</p>



<p>The problem with story points is it’s inaccurate. It’s inaccurate because the engineers do not fill it in at the correct time. And this produces such a chaotic environment where you don’t get actionable insights from tracking story points to be able to do that. </p>



<p>There is a workaround. It’s not like you cannot do it. You can do it. You need to make sure that story points are accurate and people are not gaming. So there are, those are a bit hard problems to solve. I have seen people solving those problems but <strong>I would generally recommend not tracking product-related metrics for engineering.</strong></p>



<p>There are much, much better metrics to track.&nbsp; We can go over that if you want.</p>



<h2>Metrics for Product Engineering Teams</h2>



<p><strong>Vidal: </strong>[07:00] I’d like to. I think that’s a great point you make about confusing the product metrics.&nbsp; What are some of the appropriate metrics to track for product engineering teams?</p>



<p><strong>Kan: </strong>[07:10] Okay. Let’s go from the fundamentals again. Back to the conversational starting point. I said the metrics they need to represent organization success. What that means is decreased churn, increased revenue. What metrics represent this? </p>



<p>In product engineering, imagine a car. This is the product itself, the organization itself. The driver is the product manager. They can make decisions on where to go on the road. But they don’t decide on the speed. The speed is decided by engineering.&nbsp;The engineering organization is the engine of this car. And how do we make sure that the car goes fast?</p>



<p>That is the <strong>number of successful iterations</strong>. <strong>That is the core metric that product engineering teams should track</strong>. What does the number of successful iterations mean? The number of iterations is quite obvious in the sense of, okay, if I do a deployment, then I did an iteration. I gave value to customers. </p>



<p>But if you just track that metric, what happens is we have seen this in multiple companies. The engineering manager says, “Hey let’s iterate faster. How can we iterate faster?” And the team response. “Let’s not write&nbsp;tests. We spend 20% of our time writing tests…” and that doesn’t work out. Then you have a faulty product.</p>



<p>It’s not a successful iteration. The customer didn’t get value from that deployment. You need to make sure that the iteration is fast and it’s successful. So what are the metrics to track these? I would Put this into five different metrics.&nbsp; I’ll take one step back. I’ll represent this into two different categories.</p>



<p>One product engineering, second DevOps team. I will focus on product engineering and they have four different metrics. It divides into speed and quality. Just like I said, number of successful iterations. The speed part is deployment frequency and cycle time. <strong>Deployment frequency</strong> is how often do you deploy? That’s quite obvious by itself. </p>



<p>Then we go to <strong>cycle time</strong>. Cycle time can be tracked into different ways. Some people track it from JIRA, a single task. How long did it take for a single JIRA task to complete? The second way to track it is how long did a single pull request take to complete by complete I mean start to deployment.</p>



<p>In pull request, you can do this by first commits to production. In JIRA, it can start from triaged to production as well one nuance there is the JIRA. One might not be accurate because engineers it’s like an extra process.&nbsp; It’s not in their habits to track.</p>



<p>Make sure that the JIRA task is correctly tagged, but Github one pull requests. It’s in their habit, it’s in their workflow. They make sure that pull request is tagged correctly because they don’t actually control the tag. They just behave normally and you can get that data from it. So I would recommend specifically focusing on pull requests, but JIRA is also a way to track cycle time.</p>



<p>So what I have talked about was speed, deployment frequency, and cycle time. Now we can go to <strong>quality metrics</strong>, which also divides into two different categories. The pair of deployment frequency is hotfixes. It is called <strong>change failure rates</strong>…</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Why learning to code has been one of the best choices I’ve ever made.</p><p>At a macro level, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">software is eating the world</a>. The top 5 most valuable companies in the world (AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, FB, GOOGL) are all squarely situated in software. Antithetically (at a micro level), addictive software is eating lives with bottomless time vacuums of content that has little to no substance.</p><p>I think <a href="https://kylegill.com/blog/2020-11-13-in-defense-of-digital-minimalism/">technology is a two edged sword</a>, and like most things, software is neither entirely good nor entirely bad.</p><p>If software and its near infinite scale is taking over, it feels like a unique sort of superpower to be able to harness it. <strong>The easiest route to making software work for you, and not against you, is learning how to code</strong>. I want to give some examples of how learning to write software on my own has helped me craft improvements into my own life. Finding out I enjoyed writing code—and that companies will pay me for it—were delightful side effects to what was a really a new found freedom to build whatever I wanted.</p><h2 id="software-as-a-craft"><a href="#software-as-a-craft" aria-label="software as a craft permalink"></a>Software as a Craft</h2><p>When I get asked what I do when I’m off work, the answer is usually <em>the same thing I do at work</em>, <del>play minesweeper</del> write code. Something interesting to me is that that answer is <em>not particularly unique among software engineers</em>. It’s a craft that many engineers seem to hone outside of work because they actually enjoy it. Like a chef going home from work and cooking for their family, I tend to go home and write code that’s just for me. This surfaces itself in all sorts of projects and tools that I’ll go into in more depth later.</p><p>In all my attempts to convince my friends why I love programming—and why they should learn to program—I can’t seem to articulate this message well enough (which is part of the purpose of this essay). Software is a craft that is rewarding to improve.</p><h2 id="controlling-a-superpower"><a href="#controlling-a-superpower" aria-label="controlling a superpower permalink"></a>Controlling a Superpower</h2><p>As much as software is a craft, I also mentioned learning to code is like a superpower. Interestingly, I ran into a piece from Nil Eyal who <a href="https://genius.com/Nir-eyal-hooked-how-to-build-habit-forming-products-annotated">quoted a reader of his blog</a> who stated:</p><blockquote><p>If it can’t be used for evil, it’s not a superpower.</p></blockquote><p>I find this defintion fascinating because it squarely fits the bill for programming. The same network protocols, databases, and open source code that deliver petabytes of addictive media for the profit of developers, set up mechanisms for positive endeavors like disaster relief. Just as there <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.11?lang=eng">is an opposition in all things</a>, a developer has the liberty to build a platform for vitriol and sludge or one that magnifies the best parts of technology.</p><p>Just like a chef has to be aware of different ingredients to cook, software engineers need to be aware of tools to code with. Learning to code has a stigma for being hard to pick up because it’s not easy to understand what’s possible. There was one line of code in particular that helped me understand what was possible, and it came to me as a conniving high schooler with free time in my computer drafting class. My friend and I stumbled across 2 very interesting discoveries one day:</p><ol><li>there’s a command to open a computer’s CD drive</li><li>all the computers in the school were connected through the network</li></ol><p>On their own neither of those is that ground-breaking, but when you combine them… well 😎. We were popping CD trays of our classmates left and right with reckless abandon. Finding the shutdown command was when we began to feel the responsibility inherent in our new power.</p><p>Code is all about synthesizing the existing tools in the software tool belt into new and interesting uses. That application of tools in the right steps allows software companies to do things like <a href="https://stripe.com/">process financial transactions</a>, <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">generate entire websites</a>, or <a href="https://numpy.org/">run complex equations</a> automatically. Unfortunately, some choose to use their skill for less worthy causes, but being able to build <em>good</em> things can meaningfully improve lives (including your own).</p><p>For the software engineer, knowing how to use those tools (and what tools there are) opens up the door to <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">home automation</a>, <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">blocking all ads from their home internet</a>, or in my case a suite of personal apps for the things I do from day to day.</p><h2 id="building-my-own-solutions"><a href="#building-my-own-solutions" aria-label="building my own solutions permalink"></a>Building my own Solutions</h2><p>At work I build tools for the aforementioned macro level, where my code is used for a whole bunch of random denizens of the internet. At the end of the day the real magic happens, I get to dive into the micro world and build tools <em>for me</em>.</p><p>The following are some things I’ve made outside of work that make software more than just a job for me:</p><h3 id="a-personal-journal"><a href="#a-personal-journal" aria-label="a personal journal permalink"></a>A Personal Journal</h3><p>Because <a href="https://notes.kylegill.com/journals">I really value journaling</a> and <a href="https://notes.kylegill.com/writing">writing things down</a>, I made myself a journal that had all the features I wanted but couldn’t find anywhere else. It works without internet, it supports dark/light mode depending on the time of day, it’s search-able, and best of all makes it easy for me to write in my journal from anywhere because it’s easily accessible from my phone or laptop (unlike my written journals). Then because software is great like that, I put it online so anyone can install their own version of it for free: <a href="https://github.com/gillkyle/sol-journal">https://github.com/gillkyle/sol-journal</a></p><p><span>

Finding a better way to store a lot of the ideas I was thinking about made sense in a home grown wiki where I could move all my content wherever I wanted, and build little features I wanted on top of it. Everything I record is automatically grouped by topic, making it easier to find what I want and add more to ideas I’ve been thinking about in the past.

<p>Not just <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/">Clubhouse</a> itself, but the specific social audio network format and ease of use that it pioneered.</p>



<p>As more traditional forms of media continue to see declines, people are increasingly looking to newer, more digital native forms of media like social networks, online streaming services, and podcasts, which have seen <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/10713/podcast-listeners-in-the-united-states/">steady growth over time</a>.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="569" src="https://vancelucas.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-11-at-12.18.44-PM-700x569.png" alt="" srcset="https://vancelucas.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-11-at-12.18.44-PM-700x569.png 700w, https://vancelucas.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-11-at-12.18.44-PM-250x203.png 250w, https://vancelucas.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-11-at-12.18.44-PM-768x624.png 768w, https://vancelucas.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-11-at-12.18.44-PM-120x98.png 120w, https://vancelucas.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-11-at-12.18.44-PM.png 1444w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></figure></div>



<h2>Clubhouse vs. Podcasts</h2>



<p>A lot of traditional talk-radio style shows have migrated to podcasts, but they are a decidedly different format. The are generally planned, formatted, edited, polished, and then released at a later date. They don’t generally have the same feel as live talk shows, with the exception of a handful of podcasts which are just recordings of live conversations.</p>



<p>But even if the podcast is a full live conversation that is simply recorded, since they are not also <em>broadcast</em> live (and can thus be edited before release), the same level of listener trust isn’t there for podcasts.</p>



<h2>Lower Barrier for Creators</h2>



<p>Another thing that Clubhouse does brilliantly is significantly lower the barrier for participation and creation of audio content, especially when compared to podcasting. Anyone can create a room, invite others, and just start talking. If it’s interesting and attracts more listeners, it rises to the top. You are free to do this whenever you want, and many of the top channels occur on a regular basis at the same times every day – just like talk radio. All for free.</p>



<p>Now compare what it takes to publish a podcast. You have recording, equipment costs, editing, hosting (which is not free), transcription (optional), and distribution through iTunes, Spotify, Soundcloud, etc. among others. And even after you have done all that, building the audience for it is much more difficult, and discovery or new content is not as built-in as it is on Clubhouse.</p>



<p>The limitations of Clubhouse being a mobile app also effectively level the playing field. Podcasting setups can get pretty intense. No <a href="https://amzn.to/3d243Jp">expensive Yeti mic</a> or fancy studio setup is required to use Clubhouse. Everyone just has to use their phone. There is no significant differentiation in audio quality other than a quiet background.</p>



<h2>Instant Global Access to Live Talk Shows</h2>



<p>Clubhouse offers instant access to live conversations from friends, peers, experts, and thought leaders all around the world. It’s the new talk radio, only better since you’re not limited to the five AM radio frequencies you get in your own geography. And even better still, because you can also participate and ask questions too – also live and broadcast for all to hear. No radio station phone numbers to remember or menus to navigate. Just raise your hand and wait if you want to ask a question.</p>



<p>The social network audio model that Clubhouse has built feels like the future of talk radio. And I’m here for it. The market potential here is <em>huge</em>.</p>

At first, he says he wasn't sure what to do with them. Then, inspired by his guitar maker friend,&nbsp;the idea struck.</p>  <p>"It just popped into my head. I'm going to turn Uncle Fil into a guitar. And I was like, that is the best way to honour him. He would love that idea," he said.</p>  <p>Midnight says he has fond memories of listening to metal with his uncle, and seeing him perform at shows.</p>  <p>"Uncle Filip was a super metal head," he said. "He got me totally into metal when I was a little kid because he was my mother's younger brother, so he was closer to my age, and took me under his wing."</p>    <p>The idea didn't go over well with his mother at first, he said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"When this first started happening, she was really upset. She said, 'It's sacrilegious. He needs to lie, you know, and rest,'" he said.</p>  <p>"And as she was walking away, I was like, 'You think Uncle Fil would rather be a guitar, or a box of bones?' She threw her arms up. She goes, 'Probably the guitar.'"</p>  <h2>'It's got some quirks'</h2>  <p>Making the guitar was no easy feat, either.</p>  <p>"No one's ever made a guitar out of a skeleton, to my surprise. So there is a little bit of a learning curve," he said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"Originally, I was drilling into the vertebrae, the bones, and one cracked and broke. And so I was like, well, I've&nbsp;got to re-assess how I'm going to do this."</p>  <p>He ended up welding a metal bar onto the spine and attaching it to the bridge and neck of an old Fender Telecaster guitar. He also attached red and blue wires, reminiscent of veins and arteries depicted in medical books.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5909350.1612992577!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/skeleton-guitar.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5909350.1612992577!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/skeleton-guitar.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5909350.1612992577!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/skeleton-guitar.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5909350.1612992577!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/skeleton-guitar.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5909350.1612992577!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/skeleton-guitar.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5909350.1612992577!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/skeleton-guitar.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Turning a human skeleton into a guitar was no easy feat, says Midnight.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Submitted by Prince Midnight)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>"It is not a typical guitar, so it's got some quirks, to say the least. But sometimes the limitations we have with our tools are what make&nbsp;the products great," he said.</p>  <p>"When you are trying to strum inside a rib cage, it limits how long your strokes with a pick could be, right? So that tends to make a heavier kind of tone when you're strumming. So, yeah, it has a certain sound to it, and I think it sounds great."</p>  <p>But most of all, he says it makes him feel close to his uncle again.</p>  <p>"I feel like Uncle Fil is not just here now figuratively; he's here literally too," he said. "I'm literally giving my Uncle Fil hugs while he's figuratively with me, creating, you know, heavy metal riffs."</p>  <hr>  <p><em>Written by Sheena Goodyear.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="8a920a5" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"><div><h2 id="h-kubernetes-is-deprecating-docker">Kubernetes is Deprecating Docker?!</h2><p>For some time now, it seems that when people think of containers, they think of <a href="https://acloudguru.com/course/introduction-to-containers-and-docker">Docker</a> and <a href="https://acloudguru.com/course/kubernetes-deep-dive">Kubernetes</a>. Docker has been the big name when it comes to building and running containers, and Kubernetes has been the big name when it comes to managing and orchestrating them. It might seem a bit shocking to hear that Kubernetes is deprecating support for Docker as a container runtime starting with Kubernetes version 1.20.</p><p>So, I want to take this opportunity to talk about what this change really means, and what Kubernetes users will need to do about it.</p><figure><p> <iframe title="Kubernetes This Month: Container usage in production goes through the roof!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KzCaCBIgGvI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure><h2 id="h-what-s-changing">What’s Changing?</h2><p>Kubernetes deprecating Docker is actually not as big of a deal as it sounds, so let’s talk about what is really going on here.</p><p>Kubernetes is removing support for Docker as a <strong>container runtime</strong>. Kubernetes does not actually handle the process of running containers on a machine. Instead, it relies on another piece of software called a <strong>container runtime</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZdkIrgRa5Kx9RkYvsf_MitDSotGYiXP1dwpSE03SitQcSuHrk8VHKjGr5Mkdo8OXtoFsQpYv4UNaLw7xXLlbcYvvUDNyFM_Tcx2ussVCo7E9Z_aNj_NeN2AXJmLESV60PSp7hfVf" alt=""></figure><p>The container runtime runs containers on a host, and Kubernetes tells the container runtime on each host what to do. You can actually choose from a variety of options when it comes to what software you want to use as your container runtime when running Kubernetes. Up to now, a fairly popular option was to use Docker as the container runtime.</p><p>However, this will no longer be an option in the future. You will still be able to use Docker in other ways that are relevant to Kubernetes (more on that in a moment), but you will not be able to use Docker as the container runtime underneath Kubernetes.</p><h2 id="h-why-is-kubernetes-deprecating-docker">Why is Kubernetes Deprecating Docker?</h2><p>Kubernetes has supported using Docker a container runtime up to this point, so why are they choosing to stop supporting it?</p><p>Kubernetes works with all container runtimes that implement a standard known as the <strong>Container Runtime Interface (CRI)</strong>. This is essentially a standard way of communicating between Kubernetes and the container runtime, and any runtime that supports this standard automatically works with Kubernetes.</p><p>Docker does not implement the Container Runtime Interface (CRI). In the past, there weren’t as many good options for container runtimes, and Kubernetes implemented the Docker shim, an additional layer to serve as an interface between Kubernetes and Docker. Now, however, there are plenty of runtimes available that implement the CRI, and it no longer makes sense for Kubernetes to maintain special support for Docker.</p><h2 id="h-what-s-really-going-on">What’s Really Going On?</h2><p>To really understand why it makes sense for Kubernetes to deprecate Docker, we need to go a little deeper.</p><p>I’ll let you in on a secret: <strong>Docker is not actually a container runtime</strong>! It’s actually a collection of tools that sits on top of a container runtime called <strong>containerd</strong>.</p><p>That’s right! Docker does not run containers directly. It simply creates a more human-accessible and feature-rich interface on top of a separate, underlying container runtime. When it is used as a container runtime for Kubernetes, Docker is just a middle-man between Kubernetes and containerd.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qAs7sRi19J_vdE9NYNyZ5MZp8rFoV4aNUmn4aGtrc4zJXsgA_Not2cG68ut6XAXxVFAiBDyK-zp7FO6-sdcFv2obvfIxBrkcsawBisG7IKirWP4ODOlwP0kz1V9vNn_TbXAhaGKz" alt=""></figure><p>However, Kubernetes can use containerd directly as a container runtime, meaning Docker is no longer needed in this middle-man role. Docker still has a lot to offer, even in a Kubernetes ecosystem. It’s just not needed specifically as a container runtime.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/cNGPBxKBF4_Vm_WvKM4QWqXGrX4LqgaJfUUxVycD3d5XPuyXS8aWH8zeEooL--2MSDUhKzOmwCdYPGo6Zpga0xIk3EzyNq2fyDbHc0akoGLbBfnymOODbDPHh2zAhHzvdvsFxUxS" alt=""></figure><h2 id="h-what-s-the-role-of-docker-going-forward">What’s the Role of Docker Going Forward?</h2><p>Although Docker is not needed as a container runtime in Kubernetes, it still has a role to play in the Kubernetes ecosystem, and in your workflow.</p><p>Docker is still going strong as a tool for developing and building container images, as well as running them locally. Kubernetes can still run containers built using Docker’s <strong>Open Container Initiative (OCI) </strong>image format, meaning you can still use Dockerfiles and build your container images using Docker.</p><p>Kubernetes will also continue to be able to pull from Docker registries (such as Docker hub). This means that Docker will remain a powerful contender when it comes to managing the images once they are built.</p><p>All in all, Docker will continue to be a useful tool on your development workflows and continuous integration (CI) systems, even if you don’t need it to run your containers underneath Kubernetes in production.</p><hr><p><em>Looking to get certified on K8s? Read our <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/which-kubernetes-certification-path-should-i-take">blueprint for the Kubernetes certification journey</a>. </em></p><hr><h2 id="h-what-should-i-do">What Should I Do?</h2><p>&nbsp;If you are currently using Docker as a container runtime in your Kubernetes environment, you will need to make some changes. Moving forward, you can simply eliminate Docker as a middle-man in your Kubernetes environment. Instead, use another container runtime, such as <a href="https://containerd.io/">containerd</a> or <a href="https://cri-o.io/">CRI-O</a>.</p><p>Before upgrading to a Kubernetes version removes support for Docker (which is currently estimated to release in late 2021), you will need to modify (or replace) existing Kubernetes nodes so that they use a supported container runtime other than Docker. Starting now, you may want to start building any new nodes so that they use a non-Docker container runtime as well.</p><p>Other than that, nothing is really changing. You can continue to use Docker to build your images, as well as to run containers locally for development purposes, or in your continuous integration (CI) stack. You can also continue to use Docker registries to store and manage your images.</p><p>If you are interested in learning how to use containerd alongside Kubernetes, check out my new course, <a href="https://acloud.guru/overview/introduction-to-kubernetes">Introduction to Kubernetes</a>. It includes lessons that will walk you through the process of installing containerd and using it in your Kubernetes cluster.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p><b>Researchers at the RIKEN Center for Biosystems Dynamics Research in Japan have discovered a recipe for continuous cyclical regeneration of cultured hair follicles from hair follicle stem cells.</b></p>
<p>Scientists have been making waves in recent years by developing ways to grow a variety of useful items in laboratories, from meat and diamonds to retinas and other organoids. At the RIKEN Center for Biosystems Dynamics Research in Japan, a team led by Takashi Tsuji has been working on ways to regenerate lost hair from stem cells. In an important step, a new study identifies a critical population of hair follicle stem cells in the skin and a recipe for normal cyclical hair regeneration in the lab.</p>
<p>The researchers took fur and whisker cells from mice and cultured them in the laboratory with other biological “ingredients”. They used 220 combinations of ingredients, and found that combining a type of collagen with five factors — the NFFSE medium — led to the highest rate of stem cell amplification in the shortest period of time.</p>
<p>Hair growth in mammals is a continuous cyclical process in which hair grows, falls out, and is grown again. Growth occurs in the anagen phase and hair falls out in the telogen phase. Thus, a successful hair-regeneration treatment must produce hair that recycles. To test whether stem cells cultured in the NFFSE medium produce hair that cycles, the researchers placed bioengineered hair follicle stem cells in NFFSE medium or in medium missing one of the ingredients and observed the regenerated hair for several weeks. They found 81% of hair follicles generated in NFFSE medium went through at least three hair cycles and produced normal hair. In contrast, 79% of follicles grown in the other medium produced only one hair cycle.</p>
<p>Knowing that stem-cell renewal can depend on what is attached to the outside of the cells, the researchers next looked for markers on the surface of cells cultured in the NFFSE medium. In addition to the expected CD34 and CD49f markers, they found the best hair cycling was related to the addition of Itgβ5. “We found almost 80% of follicles reached three hair cycles when Itgβ5 was also bioengineered into the hair follicle germ,” explains first author Makoto Takeo. “In contrast, only 13% reached three cycles when it was not present.” Analysis showed that these important cells are naturally located in the upper part of the hair follicle’s bulge region.</p>
<p>“Our culture system establishes a method for cyclical regeneration of hair follicles from hair follicle stem cells,” says Tsuji, “and will help make hair follicle regeneration therapy a reality in the near future.” As preclinical animal-safety tests using these cultured cells were completed in 2019, the next step in the process is clinical trials.</p>
<p>“RIKEN is primarily an institute that does basic research,” explains Tsuji. “And clinical trials usually require outside collaborators. We are therefore looking for a partner company to help develop the clinical applications and welcome donations to promote the R&amp;D.”</p>

While technically correct, I believe these attributes tend to overlook other surprising properties.</p><p>In this article, I invite readers to learn more about its internal features, many of which became predominant in the market only after the Virtual Boy’s discontinuation.</p><hr><h2 id="display">Display</h2><p>The whole system is a curious piece of engineering. Externally, it resembles a bulky VR headset on a bipod. The player must place their head close to the eyepiece to see the game in action.</p><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/virtualboy/case/front.f5ed2bf56afcaf7238bb81e26e42ea66a11e68a40b14581affc282e9ee25c268.png"><picture>

In reality, games look very crisp and in full size!</figcaption></div><p>Internally, it’s a whole different story (and a very complicated one too). For this reason, I thought it would be better to start by explaining how this console displays images and then go through the internal hardware.</p><h4 id="projecting-an-image">Projecting an image</h4><p>Once you switch the Virtual Boy on, you will start seeing two <strong>monochromatic red</strong> pictures (one for each eye) through the eyepiece. So far so good? Well, here is the interesting part: <strong>This console doesn’t have a screen</strong>, so what you see is more of an ‘illusion’ - Let’s dive deeper to know what’s going on.</p><p>The topics involved in explaining this (optics, visual phenomenons, etc) may feel difficult at first, but I constructed some interactive animations to make this section little more immersive.</p><div><ul><li id="tab-2-1-scanner-link"><a href="#tab-2-1-scanner">Scanner</a></li><li id="tab-2-2-mechanics-link"><a href="#tab-2-2-mechanics">Mechanics</a></li><li id="tab-2-3-display-link"><a href="#tab-2-3-display">Display</a></li><li id="tab-2-4-active-periods-link"><a href="#tab-2-4-active-periods">Active periods</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-2-1-scanner"><h4>Scanner</h4><p>The large volume of this console can be attributed to the <strong>Scanner</strong>, which fills up a big part of it. The Scanner is the area of the Virtual Boy that displays images. It’s composed of two <strong>Display units</strong>, each one independently projects a frame (giving a total of two frames, one per eye).</p><p>A Display unit is where all the ‘magic’ happens, it’s made of the following components:</p><ul><li>An <strong>LED Unit</strong>: Contains 224 red LEDs stacked vertically and the necessary circuitry to control each one of them.</li><li>A <strong>Lens</strong>: Refracts the light coming from the LEDs.<ul><li>At the top of the Virtual Boy’s case, there is a <strong>Focus slider</strong> used to shift the lenses closer or further away from the LEDs. This allows the user to adapt the console to their focal length (preventing blurry images).</li></ul></li><li>A <strong>Mirror</strong>: Reflects the light coming from the lens and directs them to the user’s eyes. Furthermore, this component will be constantly oscillating thanks to a <strong>Voice coil motor</strong> connected to it. The motor is managed by the <strong>Servo control</strong>, a separate board which sends electrical pulses at 50 Hz.<ul><li>All in all, this is a very complex and fragile area of the console, so there’s a photo interrupter (a type of photosensor) installed. This reports the oscillation observed from the mirror to the Servo control, which in turns monitors the oscillations and applies the necessary corrections.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Next to the focus slider there is a <strong>IPD dial</strong> (knob-shaped switch), which adjust the distance between the two Display units. This is done to adapt the displays to the user’s inter-pupil distance.</p></div><div id="tab-2-2-mechanics"><h4>Mechanics</h4><div><figcaption>Basic representation of the angle of the oscillating mirror over time (at a very slow motion)<br>The left and right LEDs are operating (active) during the red and blue period, respectively<br>During the grey period, no LED is operating (idle)<br>For sake of simplicity, the angular velocity represented here is constant (but not in the real world)</figcaption></div><p>Now that we have each component identified, let’s take a look how the Virtual Boy manages to show images to our eyes.</p><p>If you haven’t noticed before, there <strong>isn’t any dot-matrix display to be found</strong>, so why are we seeing two-dimensional images from the eyepiece? Similarly to the functioning of a CRT monitor, Display units play with the way we perceive images:</p><ul><li>The fact the mirrors oscillate enables a single column of LEDs to displace horizontally between our field of view. The angle of the mirror is strategically directed to place the LEDs on 384 different ‘column positions’ distributed across our field of view.</li><li>Human vision is logarithmic and the mirror oscillates at <strong>50 Hz</strong> (each period takes 20 ms). This is so fast we end up perceiving 384 columns of LEDs illuminating at the same time (afterimage effect) until the mirror stops oscillating.</li><li>All of this is perfectly synchronised with the LED controller, which updates each LED bulb every time the mirror is slightly moved. Thus, we end up seeing a full picture coming from the eyepiece.</li></ul><p>In practice, there are some conditions for all these principles to work:</p><ul><li>The LEDs must only operate when the angular velocity of the mirror is stable (in other words, not when the mirror is changing direction). This can be thought of as the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/master-system/#tab-2-4-result"><strong>Active State</strong></a> of a CRT monitor.</li><li>In relation to the previous point, the angular velocity of the mirror can’t stay constant (since the mirror can’t change direction instantly, the periods considered ‘stable’ will be subject to forces that will disrupt its velocity). To remedy this, the Virtual Boy stores a list of values in memory called <strong>Column Table</strong> which instructs how much time to dedicate for each column interval, in an effort to balance out excessive &amp; insufficient periods of ‘LED column’ exposure.</li><li>Let’s not forget that this whole process has to be done twice since we got two display units (one per eye). Unfortunately, both units can’t pull energy and data at the same time, so each one operates at different display periods (out-of-phase, 10ms apart). We don’t notice this (another illusion!).</li></ul></div><div id="tab-2-3-display"><h4>Display</h4><div><figcaption>Simplified representation of how the first LED unit operates during specific periods of time. Notice how the LEDs will start displaying each column of the frame-buffer during active periods.</figcaption></div><p>Contrary to previous video chips modelled after CRT displays (i.e. <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nes/#graphics">PPU</a> and <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/master-system/#graphics">VGP</a>), graphics on the Virtual Boy are <strong>not rendered on-the-fly</strong>. The graphics chip on this console sends the processed frame to a frame-buffer in memory, each column of the frame is then sent to the LED array for display.</p><p>Once the Servo board detects it’s time for display, the graphics chip will start sending columns of pixels from the frame-buffer to those 224 vertically-stacked LEDs, one-by-one in a strategically synchronised matter so the LEDs will have shown 384 columns during the display period. Hence, the ‘screen resolution’ of this console is 384x224 pixels.</p><p>Moreover, we need to store two frame-buffers since each one will go to a different display unit. The graphics subsystem also employs double-buffering and other quirks (mentioned later in the ‘Graphics’ section). So, for now, just remember how a digital frame is sent to the LEDs.</p></div><div id="tab-2-4-active-periods"><h4>Active periods</h4><div><figcaption>Another simplified animation, this time showing how the oscillation of the mirror deviates the LEDs light in a way the user will end up seeing a proper frame</figcaption></div><p>Consequently of this design, there are going to be periods of:</p><ul><li><strong>Active Display</strong> during which the LEDs are pulling an image from the frame-buffer and nothing can disrupt it.</li><li><strong>Active Display 2</strong>: Same as before but now the other Display unit is operating.</li><li><strong>Drawing idle</strong>: A period where none of the LEDs are operating and the angular velocity of the mirror is unstable.</li></ul><p>This cycle is repeated 50 times per second (hence the 50 Hz refresh rate). That means that for every frame, the CPU and GPU would have around 10ms worth of time to update the picture that the user will see. In reality, Nintendo’s engineers implemented something more sophisticated. Again, I’ll try to explain this with more depth in the ‘Graphics’ section. But for now I hoped you got a good understanding of how the Virtual Boy cleverly managed to produce a picture with inexpensive hardware.</p></div></div></div><p>This has been a quick explanation of how optics can turn a single vertical line into a picture. If you own or have read about the Virtual Boy before, you may be wondering when the three-dimensional imagery takes place. I just want to make it clear that none of the previous explanation have a connection with that effect. I’m mentioning this because in the past I’ve seen many places arguing that the oscillating mirrors are the cause of the ‘depth perception’, however, with all the information I’ve gathered in this study, I don’t think that claim is accurate.</p><p>That being said, I think it’s time we discuss the 3D phenomenon…</p><h4 id="creating-a-third-dimensional-vision">Creating a third-dimensional vision</h4><p>During the marketing of the Virtual Boy, there was a lot of fanfare regarding the fact this console could project a ‘3D world’. I’m not referring to images with 3D polygons stamped (like the other 5th gen. consoles), but the actual perception of depth.</p><p>In a nutshell, the Virtual Boy relies on <strong>Stereoscopic images</strong> to carry out that illusion. So this system wasn’t only capable of toying with our vision to project a full image, but it also did it in a way we would think certain drawings are closer/far away from others!</p><div><div><figcaption>Snapshot of the game seen from the different display units<br>Mario's Tennis (1995)</figcaption></div><p>The technique is very simple: Each of the two frames displayed (one on each eye) will have some elements slightly shifted horizontally, so when we try to see them with our two eyes, our brain will think they are nearer than others. This depends on the direction the elements are shifted.</p><p>Objects shifted towards the centre of your eyes (moved right on the left frame and moved left on the right frame) will appear closer, objects shifted away from the center of your eyes will appear further away. Finally, objects with no shifting will appear between the two other. This approach is called <strong>Stereoscopic parallax</strong>.</p></div><p>One of the drawbacks of stereoscopy is <strong>eyestrain</strong>. This was alleviated by the fact games provided an ‘automatic pause’ system which reminded the user to take breaks every 30 min. Nintendo also wrote down various warning messages in their packaging and …</p></div></div></div>

	<p>
Being a practicing programmer, you are very unlikely to implement yet another linear system solving algorithm all by yourself. This guide doesn't cover the implementation details of such, therefore. Although, you will probably face the problems that may be solved in a form of linear systems, and often more elegantly than by any other means. This tutorial is all about the concepts that should help you recognize these problems and find the best solution for them.
	</p>
	<p>
But even if you are not interested in linear algebra at all, you might still find this tutorial interesting. Things as convergence, computational error, algorithmic complexity, — are all easy to show on a task as intuitive and graphic as solving a simple linear system.
	</p>
	<p>
A <span id="index_linear_system">linear system</span> is a system of linear equations. A linear equation is a sum of weighted variables that equals a constant. In two-dimensional space, it is also an equation for an actual line. In 3 dimensions it's a plane, in 4 — a hyperplane, and so on.
	</p>
	<p>
The system may be represented as an array of equations.
	</p>
	<table>
	<tbody><tr>
	<td rowspan="2">{</td>
	<td id="system_1_system_row1">
	a11x1 + a12x2 = b1
	</td>
	</tr><tr>
	<td id="system_1_system_row2">
	a21x1 + a22x2 = b2
	</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
	<p>
The very same array of equations constitutes a <span id="index_matrix_equation">matrix equation</span>.
	</p>

	<table>
	<tbody><tr>
	<td>[</td>
	<td id="system_1_matrix_col1">
1<br>0
	</td>
	<td id="system_1_matrix_col2">
0<br>1
	</td>
	<td>]</td>
	<td>[</td>
	<td>
x<sub>1</sub> <br> x<sub>2</sub>
	</td>
	<td>]</td>
	<td> = </td>
	<td>[</td>
	<td id="system_1_matrix_col3">
0<br>1
	</td>
	<td>]</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>

	<p>
And in the simplest case, it may also have a <span id="index_graphic_form">graphic form</span>.
	</p>
	<canvas id="system_1" width="640" height="512"></canvas>
	
	

	<p>
The graphic form is a useful mental model because it makes the system visual. Its solution is merely an intersection of lines.
	</p>

	<form>
		<b>Quest 1.</b> Using the plot above, please make a system that has a solution <nobr>in <i>x<sub>1</sub> = 0, x<sub>2</sub> = 0</i>.</nobr> It doesn't have to be exact, it would be cumbersome to achieve that on a small plot. Just make it somewhere near <i>(0, 0)</i>. Then press the “Check!” button.
		
		
	</form>

	<p>
But even a well-specified system may lack a solution (an intersection).
	</p>

	<form>
		<b>Quest 2.</b> Using the same plot above, please make a system with no solution.
		
		
	</form>

	<p>
And sometimes it may have not a single, but an infinite number of solutions.
	</p>

	<form>
		<b>Quest 3.</b> Using the same plot above, please make a system with infinite solutions.
		
		
	</form>

	<p>
This may be a problem for numeric methods aimed to find a single solution. They may report an error or, even worse, supply you with the first-best solution they find. In this case, you should check your equations for <span id="index_linear_dependency">linear dependency</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
You see when you multiply every coefficient of an equation, and the constant, to the same number, all the facts about the points it describes remain intact. It's still the same equation; it's still the same line.
	</p>
	<table>
	<tbody><tr>
	<td id="linear_row1">
	x<sub>1</sub> + 2x<sub>2</sub> = 3
	</td>
	</tr><tr>
	<td>
	
	</td>
	</tr><tr>
	<td id="linear_row2">
	2x<sub>1</sub> + 4x<sub>2</sub> = 6
	</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>

	<p>
Sometimes, systems have more equations than variables. These systems are called <b><span id="index_overspecified">overspecified</span></b>.
	</p>
	<canvas id="system_2" width="640" height="512"></canvas>
	
	<p>
In the general case, these systems don't have a solution, but in some rare cases, they do.
	</p>

	<form>
		<b>Quest 4.</b> Using the 3-lines plot, please make a system with a single solution.
		
		
	</form>

	<p>
Sometimes, systems have more variables than equations. These systems are called <b><span id="index_underspecified">underspecified</span></b>.
	</p>
	<p>
Of course, in a 2-dimensional case, they only have one equation, and an infinite number of solutions. Every point that lies on the equation's line is a solution. But in more-dimensional cases, underspecified systems might not have any solutions at all.
	</p>

	 

	<p>
There are two major classes of linear system solvers: iterative and direct.
	</p>
	<p>
Iterative algorithms are very simple conceptually. They all can be boiled down to these three steps
	</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Start somewhere.</li>
	<li>See if you got what you were looking for. <br>If so — great, you are done!</li>
	<li>If not, do something that brings you closer to the goal. <br>Go to step 2.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
Let's make a linear solver out of that. The part of the algorithm that will bring us closer to the solution will be a simple projection. If you project an arbitrary point on a line, the projection will be closer to ane point of that line, including of course the desired solution. Therefore, by projecting a point from one line to another we will get closer and closer to the solution.
	</p>
	<p>
If, of course, there is one.
	</p>
	<p>
As for exit criteria, we can simply measure how far we have to travel to make an iteration — a projective “leap” from one line to another. Presumably, as we're getting closer, the leap distance should shorten, so at some point, we might consider it small enough to stop the operation.
	</p>
	<p>
And we can leave the question “where to start” unanswered. Of course, it would be fantastic to start right at the solution point, but generally, our algorithm should work for any starting point we choose.
	</p>
	<p>
Here is the interactive illustration of it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Change: &nbsp;
		<label for="button_1">lines</label> &nbsp;
		<label for="button_2">start point</label> &nbsp;
		<label for="button_3">stop distance</label>
	</p>
	<canvas id="solver_1" width="640" height="512"></canvas>
	

	

	<p>
When an algorithm just like this gets closer to the solution with every iteration, it is said it converges. When it gets further from the point, it diverges. <b>Convergence</b> is the second most important property of the iterative algorithm. It is basically its speed.
	</p>
	<p>
And the first most important property of an algorithm is its <b><span id="index_stability">stability</span></b>. Usually, the more mathematical operations you do, the more error you gather. But stable algorithms have the property of reducing the error automatically. It gathers some error on every iteration, sure, but it doesn't accumulate it into anything ugly.
	</p>
	<p>
This particular algorithm is stable and geometrically incapable of divergence. Moreover, its convergence is directly linked to the angle between the lines.
	</p>
	<form>
		<b>Quest 6.</b> Using the plot from above, please make a system and set up the conditions to solve it in exactly 58 iterations.
		
		
	</form>
	<p>
Unfortunately, stability and convergence alone don't make it any good in practice. It is vulnerable to the near-parallel corner case and the choice of the exit condition.
	</p>
	<form>
		<b>Quest 7.</b> Using the plot from above, please make a system and set up the conditions so the solution will have an error of over 6.0.
		
		
	</form>
	<p>
Unlike iterative, <span id="index_direct_algorithm">direct algorithm</span>s don't have convergence. They always get the job done in some determined number of operations. In some conditions, however, iterative algorithms may behave just like direct.
	</p>
	<form>
		<b>Quest 8.</b> Using the plot from above, please make a system that is always solvable in no more than 3 iterations.
		
		
	</form>
	<p>
Being able to always solve a system in just a few leaps is neat. It's like the ultimate convergence — a metaphorical speed of light in computations. Fortunately, we can turn our iterative solver into direct by adding one small detail.
	</p>
	<p>
Previously we did every leap by doing an orthogonal projection to a respective line. But what if we do the projection parallel to the respective line?
	</p>
	<canvas id="solver_2" width="640" height="512"></canvas>
	
	<p>
Since the algorithm is now direct, it doesn't need exit criteria. Also, since it has “an ultimate convergence” starting point selection doesn't matter. That's brilliant! Why do we need iterative algorithms at all?
	</p>
	<p>
There is, of course, a catch. When the iterative algorithm's speed depends on convergence, the direct algorithm's speed depends on its complexity. This particular algorithm is rather complex.
	</p>
	<p>
<b><span id="index_algorithm_complexity">Algorithm complexity</span></b> itself is not a quantity. It's not just a constant number of operations to get things done. Just like with convergence, this number depends on things. In our case, it depends on the number of equations. This makes it a function, and we usually use big-O notation to characterize it. Big-O sets the form of a limiting function — a function our complexity has no right to overtake for any number of equations.
	</p>
	<p>
If you have something simple, like a single for loop, its complexity is linear: <i>O(n)</i>. If you have a loop inside a loop, then it's <i>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</i>. This kind of complexity is called <b>polynomial</b>, and it's quite common in the wild. For instance, our projective solver has <span id="index_polynomial_complexity">polynomial complexity</span>.
	</p>
	<div>
	<pre>def cross_of(A):
  ''' n-dimensional cross product on (n-1) vectors in list A '''
  D = len(A[0])
  N = len(A)

  v_res = [0.] * D
  <b>for</b> i in xrange(0, D):
    <b>for</b> jk in xrange(0, D ** N):
      v_ijk = [i] + [(jk/(D ** (N-j-1))) % D <b>for</b> j in xrange(0, N)]
      t_res = v__E(v_ijk)
      if t_res != 0:
        <b>for</b> k in xrange(0, N):
          t_res *= A[k][v_ijk[k + 1]]
        v_res[i] += t_res
  return v_res


def solution_for(A, B):
  p = [0. for each in B]
  <b>for</b> i in xrange(len(A)):
    plane_n = A[i]
    plane_d = -B[i]
    other_planes_ns = A[:i] + A[i+1:]
    projection_vector = cross_of(other_planes_ns)
    p = project_by_vector(p, projection_vector, plane_n, plane_d)
  return p
	</pre>
	</div>

	
	<p>
You might imagine that with polynomial complexity using a direct algorithm on massive systems is not really plausible. Solving a 1000 equation system with our algorithm requires a trillion operations. In this regard, iterative algorithms are the worthy alternative. Not that they are generally faster, but it's all about balancing between convergence and complexity.
	</p>
	<p>
Our algorithm may be graphic, but it is too heavy to be considered practically useful. There are better options out there. For instance, <span id="index_gaussian_elimination">Gaussian elimination</span> has a complexity of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination#Computational_efficiency"><i>O(n<sup>3</sup>)</i></a>, and the theoretical best for <span id="index_lu_decomposition">LU decomposition</span> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LU_decomposition#Theoretical_complexity"><i>O(n<sup>2.376</sup>)</i></a>.
	</p>
	<p>
They both share the same idea: we can change the system however we want until it holds true. We already saw that we can equally multiply both ends of an equation and still retain the same line in the graphic form. We can also add pick any equation and sum it with any other equation from the same system. This will change the line but retain the solution.
	</p>
	<p>
By doing these operations alone we can turn almost any system into the trivial one.

P. S.

	<p>
That's all fine, but how do you choose a method to solve your particular case? Here are a few hints.
	</p>
	<ol>
	<li>
If your system is sparse, meaning most of the coefficients are zeroes, you can exploit this with any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LU_decomposition">decomposition</a> (factorization) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_linear_equations#Elimination_of_variables">elimination</a> based method that works on sparse structures.
	</li>
	<li>
If your matrix is diagonally dominant, meaning that the largest elements in every equation tend to land on the diagonal, then iterative methods such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_method">Jacobi</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Seidel_method">Gauss-Seidel</a> should work best for you.

And if your system is very small, like 2 …</li></ol></div></div>

<p>This is the continuation of the second part of a three part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/01/29/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-i-soldiers-warriors-and/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/02/05/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-iia-the-many-faces-of-battle/">IIa</a>, III) discussion of the notion that there is a ‘universal warrior’ – a transcendent sameness about either the experience of war or ‘warrior values’ which might provide some sort of useful blueprint for life generally or some sort of fundamental truth about the experience of war.</p>



<p><a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/02/05/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-iia-the-many-faces-of-battle/">We started this section last week </a>by looking at the forms of war along with the direct emotional experience of combat.  What we found is that, quite to the contrary of there being just one sort of war that ‘never changes,’ there are in fact multiple <em>systems</em> of war that function quite differently (with considerable variation both within and between those systems) to the point that armies often find opponents working from within a different system of war almost utterly alien to them.</p>



<p>Moreover, as we discussed, the experience of battle, not merely the technology, tactics and circumstances, but the <em>raw emotional experience</em> (taken in terms of courage and fear) wasn’t constant either.  Different cultures understood ‘courage’ differently (and we must remember that translation here can be deceiving – most of them didn’t understand ‘courage’ at all, they understood <em>andreia</em> or <em>fortis </em>or <em>corage</em> or <em>der Mut</em> or <em>woohitike</em> which are, in the end, subtly different things and so not quite ever exactly courage at all) and different battles imposed different sorts of fear which strained those combatants in different ways.</p>



<p>Now we’re going to keep soldiering on and look at some of the other factors of the war experience: the importance of comrades, the drudgery and toil of war, and of course wounds (both physical and mental) and their healing.  Once again, to abuse the opening lines of the <em>Fallout</em> series, we going to ask if it is really true that “War, war never changes.”</p>

<h2>The Ties that Bind</h2>



<p>What about the personal relationships that are formed in the context of conflict?  Surely, the ‘band of brothers’ is a truly universal experience, right (<a href="https://youtu.be/76_Q9ruJfrE">but note on the complexities of Shakespeare’s <em>Henry V</em></a>)?  Surely the social bonds that held<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_of_Brothers_(miniseries)"> Easy-Company</a> together in 1944 and 1945 are the same as those from 1415?  Or 415?</p>



<p>Well, no.  Not quite.</p>



<p>We can approach this question through the idea of cohesion – the moral force that holds a group of combatants together on the battlefield under the intense emotional stresses of combat.  The intense bonds that soldiers form in modern armies (particularly those in the European pattern) are not an accident, but a core part of how those armies, institutionally, seek to build cohesion.  Going back to last week, we discussed briefly the emergence of the extensively drilled and disciplined ‘mechanical’ soldier of Early Modern Europe, noting that this approach wasn’t necessary for the effective use of firearms (the Ottoman Janissaries, for instance, were quite good with firearms, but were not trained and organized in this way), but rather was a product of elite aristocratic (read: officer) disdain for their up-jumped peasant soldiers and thus the assumption by those aristocrats that the only way to get such men to fight effectively was to relentlessly drill them.</p>

<p>Now the funny thing about this system is that it clearly <em>worked</em>, but not for the reasons its aristocratic pioneers believed.  It was only really after the Second World War that systematic study began to be made of unit cohesion (e.g. S.L.A. Marshall, <em>Men Against Fire</em> (1947), though subsequent literature on the topic is voluminous and Marshal’s work has its problems, but its conclusions are broadly accepted having been confirmed in subsequent studies).  What emerged quite clearly was that it wasn’t ‘the cause’ or patriotism that held troops together under fire, but group cohesion born out of an intense need not to let fellow soldiers in the unit down.  In short, what held units together and made them fight more effectively was (in part, there are many conclusions in <em>Men Against Fire</em>) the strong social bonds between comrades.</p>



<p>And, in fact, the drill and discipline of early modern European armies unintentionally did quite a lot of cohesion building things.  Soldiers were removed from civilian society (isolation from larger groups builds unit cohesion), split into very small groups (keeping the core group that coheres below <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar’s number</a> aids in group cohesion; thus <a href="https://youtu.be/a15gihWu1SM">why the platoon is a natural unit size</a>) and then pushed through difficult and unpleasant training (that drill and discipline) creating a sense of unique shared experience and sacrifice.  All of which doesn’t render men <em>machines</em>, but it does create strong social bonds within the units that will keep the men fighting even when they care little for their cause (which they generally did in this period; one does not find a super-abundance of patriotism among, say, the Army of Flanders).</p>



<p>And there is a tendency to point to this cohesion, its modern source in ‘toughening’ boot camp and to say, ‘aha!  That is the true universal about effective soldier-warriors!’  Except – and you knew there was going to be an except – except it isn’t.  Systems built on the use of drill and discipline for the development of unit cohesion through social bonds are actually, historically speaking, quite rare.  We see systems like that in use by the Romans from the Middle Republic forward (but significantly faded by the end of late antiquity; the Byzantine army doesn’t seem to function this way), in China from the Han Dynasty onward, in Japan for the <em>ashigaru</em> infantry from the Sengoku period, and in Europe from the Early Modern period.  That <em>sounds</em> like a lot, but that is relatively small minority of the historical period and even then in a relatively small minority of places.  It is, for instance, a period that only covers about half of the historical period in Western Europe, the place most often associated with this very system of organization (though that association is perhaps unfair to East Asia).</p>



<p>Instead, most societies relied on existing social bonds formed <em>outside</em> of the experience of war for cohesion.  Greek hoplite armies, for instance, generally formed up by <em>polis</em> (read: city) and then within those blocks by still smaller and smaller social divisions, so that family and neighbors would be standing shoulder to shoulder in the battle line (Sparta does this through the system of communal messes, the <em>syssitia</em>, but the idea that you fought alongside the men you dined with socially – your neighbors, generally – was perfectly normal in most Greek cities).  That was intentional – it allowed the phalanx to cohere through the social pressure not to be seen as a coward before the men who meant the most to you, whose shaming gaze you would have to endure in civilian life.  The same pressures, by the well, held together the (mostly volunteer) armies of the American Civil War (on this, see, McPherson, <em>For Cause and Comrades</em> (1997)).</p>



<p>By contrast, ‘warrior’ classes often rely on a sort of class solidarity along with the demand of an individual military aristocrat to be <em>individually</em> militarily excellent.  Richard Kaeuper quips of the literature of the medieval knightly class that it was filled with “utterly tireless, almost obsessional emphasis placed on personal prowess” (R.W. Kaeuper, <em>Chivalry and Violence in Medieval Europe</em> (1999)).  We’ve talked a fair bit about the values of mounted aristocrats, both in <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/04/16/collections-a-trip-through-bertran-de-born-martial-values-in-the-12th-century-occitan-nobility/">their </a><a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/04/10/collections-antarah-ibn-shaddad-victory-songs/">role </a>as combatants and <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/06/12/collections-the-battle-of-helms-deep-part-vii-hanging-by-a-thread/">in their roles as generals </a>and those values are relatively disconnected from discipline-induced forms of buddy-cohesion.  Of course exactly what ‘good generalship’ or ‘good officership’ looks like varies wildly from place to place – Alexander was expected to command his cavalry from the front; Roman emperors rarely took the battlefield and when they did they commanded from the rear since it would be foolish to risk the ‘brain’ of the army in personal combat and in any event someone at the front of a cavalry charge can hardly direct the rest of the army.</p>



<p>One of the things I find most striking about the ‘warrior ethos’ advanced by writers like Pressfield is that it accepts as normal the unique nature of the bonds that hold soldiers together in battle, assuming this bond and its shared sacrifice to be at once unique to combat and also transcendent to all combatants.  But one of the key points made very well in Sebastian Junger’s <em>War </em>(2010) and later <em>Tribe</em> (2016) is just how <em><strong>strange</strong></em> that experience is, historically.  <strong>Junger notes that in earlier societies, soldiers would have returned from war into communities </strong>(often small, agricultural communities or tribal communities) <strong>every bit as close-knit as the infantry platoon – and indeed, often involving <em>literally the same people</em> as the infantry platoon</strong>.  Instead, the intense feeling of uniqueness that modern soldiers feel about the bonds of combat is because of the historically unusual deracination produced by modern societies by the industrial revolution and the post-industrial period.</p>



<p>And Junger’s point is born out quite clearly when looking at the myriad of historical societies where those non-combat social bonds were the basis of the principles of military cohesion, be it the small-town cohesion of the hoplite phalanx or the class-based-expectation cohesion of a group of knights, or (for that matter) later modern …</p></div></div>

		<p><img src="https://20stech.com/files/arm-pr-image-210211b-thm.jpg">During its third fiscal quarter of 2020, Arm and its silicon partners shipped a record 6.7 billion Arm-based chips, resulting in a total of more than 180 billion Arm chips having now shipped.<br>
<span id="more-671"></span><br>
Arm claims to be the leading processor architecture for IoT and embedded devices, having shipped a record 4.4 billion Arm Cortex-M based chips in the quarter, and the company also said the Arm Mali graphics processors remain the number one shipping GPU. Rene Haas, President, Arm IP Products Group, said the company’s ecosystem continues to grow, with Arm partners signing a record 175 new licenses during CY2020, bringing the total to 1,910 licenses and 530 licensees.<br>

Arm plans to move most of its design work to Arm-based cloud services over the next several years, according to a <a href="https://www.arm.com/company/news/2020/12/arm-moves-production-level-electronic-design-automation-to-the-cloud-with-the-help-of-aws">mid-December news release</a>. The company intends to share its experiences, in an effort to encourage partners to design their Arm-based silicon on Arm-based cloud services. </p>
<p>For Arm, the advantage of the cloud is the ability to scale its computing power and storage faster and less expensively than by deploying servers and software for internal use by projects. Additionally, migrating services to the cloud gives its engineers more flexibility and freedom to sort out problems with its chips, and determine chip fit for an application or use care prior to a costly production run. </p>
<p>Since beginning its AWS cloud migration, the company has realized a six-fold improvement in performance time for EDA workflows on AWS, <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/aws-and-arm-demonstrate-production-scale-electronic-design">according to an Amazon news release</a>. Also, by running telemetry (the collection and integration of data from remote sources) and analysis on AWS, Arm is able to generate more powerful engineering, business, and operational insights that help increase workflow efficiency and optimize costs and resources across the company. On top of these benefits, Arm expects to reduce its global datacenter footprint by at least 45% and its on-premises compute by 80% as it completes its migration to AWS.</p>

February 12, 2021 | https://ignacy.co/the-case-of-the-red-bug | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ignacy.co/the-case-of-the-red-bug">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It was yet another gloomy evening in the Beamopolis. Boxes hiding artifacts of solved and unsolved cases cluttered my room. Dim light passing through my small window covers everything. I was sitting in front of my desk and was oscillating between the dream world and reality. A brutal phone call woke me up, and my intuition kicked in, telling me this will not be another typical case of a messy exception that went wrong.</p>

<p>I was right; this time, my caller was asking impossible. She wanted me to find a way to trace a suspect. Still, not only that, but the requirement was also to see all the breadcrumbs left by a suspect. She also demanded to gather all information about suspect inputs and outputs – all that with a possibility to have insights on-demand, remotely without even meeting me in person. My initial gut feeling told me to hang up the phone right away, but as always, with those cases, there is an urge to stand up to the challenge and try to accomplish the impossible.</p>

<p>For better or worse, I've agreed. Now I was standing next to my window, looking at all those actors passing by, not aware of each other minds but beautifully arranged in asynchronous dance on message lanes. I had to find a way to trace my suspect in the worst part of Beamopolis – Complexity District 9. The story tells that no one knows what happens behind the defmodule lines separating the district from the rest of the city – yet everyone communicates with them daily. I was skimming through my options.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/tracer/readme.html" rel="nofollow">Tracer</a> Trevor owns me a favor from our last case, but he was not ideal for the task at hand. It was hard to make him not put all his information to standard output but rather send it to me via a message. I also thought about the famous hacker going with the nickname <a href="https://github.com/fishcakez/dbg" rel="nofollow">dbg</a>, but she was quite rusty and might not have been able to address all my requirements. Then I've had an a-ha moment; there is already an excellent tracer in the city – <a href="https://github.com/massemanet/redbug" rel="nofollow">redbug</a>. He does not speak elixirish; instead, he is fluent in erlangish – if there only be a way to find a decent translator. After a few phone calls, I was lucky enough to find a fine young lady – <a href="https://github.com/nietaki/rexbug" rel="nofollow">rexbug</a>, who agreed to help me out and translate what redbug was saying to the language I speak.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for me, redbug had a similar limitation (at first glance only as I was going to find out) that it was outputting his findings to the standard output of his. The approach would not work for me as my mysterious caller demanded to have a possibility to query traces 24/7. That meant I have to build a specific endpoint for her, and tracing my suspect should be automated.</p>

<p>After going back and forth with rexbug, we've found a way. She told me that I could use a custom function to print whatever redbug found to wherever I want to. I knew that was it. At this stage, I knew I would be able to finish what I've started. I've come up with the following invocation.</p>

<pre><code>TraceClient.start(
  [
    "Main.Suspect :: return"
  ],
  time: @timeout,
  msgs: @max_number_of_messages,
  print_fun: fn entry -&gt; GenServer.call(Tracer, {:trace_entry, entry}) end
)
</code></pre>

<p>Both <code>@timeout</code> and <code>@max_number_of_messages</code> were set up in agreement with rexbug that we won't try to trace my suspect for too long (or too short), and if he becomes too noisy, we would also cease the operation. After all, we do not want to go too deep inside the Complexity District 9.</p>

<p>With my invocation ready, I could do my tedious but so needed work to handle all the pieces of evidence and present them to my employer. I came up with the following.</p>

<pre><code>defmodule Tracer do
  use GenServer

  alias Rexbug, as: TraceClient

  @timeout 2_000
  @max_number_of_messages 100_000

  # Client
  def start_link(opts) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, :ok, opts)
  end

  def trace do
    GenServer.call(Tracer, {:trace})
  end

  def get_results do
    GenServer.call(Tracer, :get_results)
  end

  # Server (callbacks)
  @impl true
  def init(:ok) do
    {:ok, []}
  end

  @impl true
  def handle_call({:trace}, _from, state) do
    TraceClient.start(
      [
        "Main.Suspect :: return"
      ],
      time: @timeout,
      msgs: @max_number_of_messages,
      print_fun: fn entry -&gt; GenServer.call(Tracer, {:trace_entry, entry}) end
    )

    try do
      Main.Suspect.call()
    rescue
      _ -&gt; nil
    end

    TraceClient.stop()

    {:reply, :ok, state}
  end

  @impl true
  def handle_call({:trace_entry, trace_entry}, _from, state) do
    {:reply, trace_entry, state ++ [trace_entry]}
  end

  @impl true
  def handle_call(:get_results, _from, state) do
    result =
      Enum.map(state, fn entry -&gt;
        {action, {{module, function, args}, retn}, {_, _}, {_, _, _, _}} = entry

        %{
          type: action,
          module: module,
          function: function,
          arguments: inspect(args),
          return_value: inspect(retn)
        }
      end)

    {:reply, {:ok, result}, []}
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>With that good old GenServer approach, I can now trace my suspect whenever I want, and all traces gathered with my friends – redbug and rexbug are passed to my GenServer state, waiting there until I fetch them.</p>

<p>It is easy to use my work simply as</p>

<pre><code>Tracer.trace()
</code></pre>

<p>and after traces are gathered fetch them as</p>

<pre><code>case Tracer.get_results() do
  {:ok, results} -&gt; results
  {:error, error} -&gt; error
end
</code></pre>

<p>With all that, I get results in a nice form where I can see all suspect's interactions – what they received, and what they gave in return</p>

<pre><code>{:ok,
 [
  %{
	 arguments: "we have to stash that gold somewhere",
	 function: :heist,
	 module: Main.Suspect,
	 return_value: "\"\"",
	 type: :call
  },

  ...

  %{
	 arguments: "1",
	 function: :heist,
	 module: Main.Suspect,
	 return_value: "{:error, \"uh! oh! they\'ve got me\"}",
	 type: :retn
  }
]}
</code></pre>

<p>Everything was there, right in front of me, now I could trace all naughty functions visited by my suspect, I knew what he passed to them and what they gave in return. That knowledge was exciting and scary at the same time. There was nothing he can do to hide anymore; even if he hides in the most complex part of the city, I will be there, always watching, always knowing.</p>

<p>I'm closing this case. The lady who started it decided to use this knowledge for good and created an excellent document where everyone could check what our suspect does in the city. It was a game-changer as no villain could hide anymore from good citizens of Beamopolis. Everyone was cheerful – until one day – I've picked up another phone call …</p>

<![CDATA[(Very) Basic Intro to Elliptic Curve Cryptography]]>

February 12, 2021 | https://qvault.io/2020/09/17/very-basic-intro-to-elliptic-curve-cryptography/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://qvault.io/2020/09/17/very-basic-intro-to-elliptic-curve-cryptography/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<hr>
<p>Elliptic curve cryptography is a modern <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/public-key" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">public-key&nbsp;encryption&nbsp;</a>technique based on mathematical elliptic curves and is well-known for creating smaller, faster, and more efficient cryptographic keys. For example, <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://bitcoin.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bitcoin</a> uses ECC as its asymmetric cryptosystem because of its lightweight nature.</p>
<p>In this introduction to ECC, I want to focus on the high-level ideas that make <a aria-label="ECC (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography" target="_blank">ECC</a> work. For the purposes of keeping this article easier to digest, I’ll omit implementation details and mathematical proofs, we can save those for another time.</p>
<h2>What is elliptic curve cryptography used&nbsp;for?</h2>
<p>A common use of ECC is to encrypt data so that only authorized parties can decrypt it. This has several obvious use cases but is most often used to encrypt internet traffic. For example, on the <a href="https://qvault.io/">Qvault web app</a> I could used ECC to encrypt a verification email so that no one but the recipient can read the message.</p>
<h2>ECC is public-key cryptography</h2>
<p>There are many types of public-key cryptography, and Elliptic Curve Cryptography is just one flavor. Other algorithms include <a aria-label="RSA (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)" target="_blank">RSA</a>, <a aria-label="Diffie-Helman (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange" target="_blank">Diffie-Helman</a>, etc. Let’s go over a quick background of public-key cryptography as a jumping-off point, so that I can discuss ECC and build on top of these ideas. By all means, study more in-depth on public-key cryptography when you have the time.</p>
<p>Public-key cryptography allows the following to happen:</p>

<p>We create two keys, a public key, and a private key. The public key is given freely, and any party can encrypt data by using it. However, the private key is kept secret and only those who hold it will have the ability to decrypt data.</p>
<h2>An example of public-key cryptography</h2>
<p>Let’s pretend that Facebook is going to receive a private post from Donald Trump. Facebook needs to be able to ensure that when the ex-president sends his post over the internet, no one in the middle (Like the NSA, or an internet service provider) can read the message. The entire exchange using public-key cryptography would go like this:</p>
<ul><li>Donald Trump Notifies Facebook that he wants to send them a private post</li><li>Facebook sends Donald Trump their public key</li><li>Donald Trump uses the public key to encrypt his post:</li></ul>
<p><em>“I love Fox and Friends” + Public Key = “s80s1s9sadjds9s”</em></p>
<ul><li>Donald Trump sends only the encrypted message to Facebook</li><li>Facebook uses its private key to decrypt the message:</li></ul>
<p><em>“s80s1s9sadjds9s” + Private Key = “I love Fox and Friends”</em></p>
<p>As you can see, this form of encryption can be quite useful. Here are some key points:</p>
<ul><li>The public key can safely be sent to anyone. It’s public.</li><li>The private key must be kept safe because if someone in the middle were to get the private key, they could decrypt messages.</li><li>Computers can quickly use the public key to encrypt a message, and quickly use the private key to decrypt a message.</li><li>Computers require a <em>very</em> long time (millions of years) to derive the original data from the encrypted message if they don’t have the private key.</li></ul>
<h2>How it Works: The Trapdoor&nbsp;Function</h2>
<p>The crux of all public-key cryptographic algorithms is that they each have their own unique trapdoor function<strong>. </strong>A trapdoor function is a function that can only be computed one way, or at least can only be computed one way <em>easily</em> (in less than millions of years using modern computers).</p>
<h3>Not a trapdoor function:</h3>
<p><code>A + B = C</code></p>
<p>If I’m given A and B I can compute C. However, if I’m given B and C I can also compute A. This is not a trapdoor function.</p>
<h3>Trapdoor function:</h3>
<p><code>"I love Fox and Friends” + Public Key --&gt; s80s1s9sadjds9s</code></p>
<p>If given <em>“I love Fox and Friends”</em> and the public key, I can produce <code>s80s1s9sadjds9s</code>, but if given <code>s80s1s9sadjds9s</code> and the Public Key I can’t produce <em>“I love Fox and Friends”</em></p>
<p>In RSA, which is arguably the most widely used public-key cryptosystem, the trapdoor function relies on how hard it is to factor large numbers into their prime factors.</p>
<p><strong>Public Key:</strong> <code>944,871,836,856,449,473</code></p>
<p><strong>Private Key:</strong> <code>961,748,941</code> and <code>982,451,653</code></p>
<p>In the example above the public key is a very large number, and the private key is the two prime factors of the public key. This is a good example of a Trapdoor Function because it is very easy to multiply the numbers in the private key together to get the public key, but if all you have is the public key it will take a very long time using a computer to re-create the private key.</p>
<p><em>Note: In real cryptography, the private key would need to be 200+ digits long to be considered secure.</em></p>
<h2>What Makes Elliptic Curve Cryptography Different?</h2>
<p>You would use ECC for the same reasons as RSA. ECC and RSA both generate a public and private key and allow two parties to communicate securely. One advantage to ECC however, is that a 256-bit key in ECC offers about the same security as a 3072-bit key using RSA. ECC allows resource-constrained systems like smartphones, embedded computers, and cryptocurrency networks to use ~10% of the storage space and bandwidth required by RSA.</p>
<h2>ECC’s Trapdoor&nbsp;Function</h2>
<p>This is probably why most of you are here. The trapdoor function is what makes ECC special and different than RSA. The trapdoor function is similar to a mathematical game of pool.</p>
<p>First, we start with an arbitrary point on the curve. Next, we use the dot function to find a new point. Finally, we keep repeating the dot function to hop around the curve until we finally end up at our last point. Let’s walk through the algorithm.</p>

<ul><li>Starting at <code>A</code>:</li><li><code>A dot B = -C</code> (Draw a line from A to B and it intersects at -C)</li><li>Reflect across the X-axis from -C to C</li><li><code>A dot C = -D</code> (Draw a line from A to C and it intersects -D)</li><li>Reflect across the X-axis from -D to D</li><li><code>A dot D = -E</code> (Draw a line from A to D and it intersects -E)</li><li>Reflect across the X-axis from -E to E</li></ul>
<p>This is a great trapdoor function because if you know where the starting point (A) is and how many hops are required to get to the ending point (E), it’s very easy to find the ending point. On the other hand, if all you know is where the starting point and ending point are, it is nearly impossible to find how many hops it took to get there.</p>
<p>Public Key: Starting Point A, Ending Point E</p>
<p>Private Key: Number of hops from A to E</p>
<h2>Questions?</h2>
<p>Here are just a couple of questions I had when I first learned about ECC. Hopefully, I can address them properly.</p>
<h3>How is the second point found? If the dot function is basically drawing a line between two points, don’t you need a second point to start&nbsp;with?</h3>
<p>No. The second point (we will call it -R below) is actually the result of P dot P (let’s assume the first point is called P)</p>
<p><code>P dot P= -R</code></p>
<p>So what is <code>P dot P</code>? It is actually just the tangent line of P. See the graphic below:</p>

<h3>What happens if the dot function produces a line that will go way off out to some&nbsp;extreme?</h3>
<p>If the line doesn’t hit the curve close to the origin, we can actually define a maximum X value where the line will wrap back around and start from the beginning again. See the graphic below for an example.</p>

<h2>Who Cares?</h2>
<p>ECC is used as the cryptographic key algorithm in Bitcoin because it potentially can save ~90% of the resources used by a similar RSA system. It seems that each year we see more systems moving from RSA to a more modern elliptic curve approach.</p>

						<p>When the US joined World War Two, it set back a number of peacetime R&amp;D projects. A team at Bell Labs had been studying some interesting properties of semiconducting substances, with the hope that they might find a way to replace the then-ubiquitous vacuum tube. But the exigencies of wartime complicated their plans—for one thing, the only supplier of sufficiently pure silicon was a German company—so they took a break to focus on wartime applications like radar. By the time they returned to regular work, the war was won, the US industrial base had dramatically ramped up (now DuPont, not German suppliers, made the world’s purest silicon), and the team had acquired an encyclopedic knowledge of how substances like silicon and germanium behave.</p>
<p>Two years later, the transistor was born.</p>
<p>Crises radically reshape priorities; they cancel some projects, and accelerate others. But another effect they have is to make people more conscious of the future. To struggle through a crisis is, implicitly, to view the future as a point very much worth getting to. The Bell Labs team certainly helped build a better postwar future, and arguably Covid-19 has pushed people in the same direction.</p>
<p>We shouldn’t expect the results of this to be visible just yet. Scientific progress is visible on a lag: while the <i>New York Times</i> did mention the invention of transistors, it was midway through a column called “news of the radio,” hardly an accurate assessment of the impact of one of the twentieth century’s great inventions. Fortunately, there are more real-time ways to approximate people’s attitudes towards the future—the stock market is a real-time dollar-weighted poll about what kinds of companies will matter, and how that’s changing.</p>
<p>One of the surprising consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic was that, after a brief and fearsome decline, overall asset prices rose. That’s partly an artifact of how policymakers responded to the pandemic; pumping liquidity into the market does help offset supply shocks, and some of that money finds its way into speculative vehicles. But even <i>within</i> the market, there’s been a striking rise in investor interest in electric vehicles, autonomous cars, AI, and software companies ranging from consumer-facing companies like Facebook and Google to complex enterprise products like Snowflake.</p>
<p>The market’s judgments always have to be taken judiciously. Humans are imperfect judges of the present, not to mention the future. And as the recent GameStop fireworks demonstrate, sometimes prices can be driven more by technical aspects of market structure than by a cold and calculating assessment of the net present value of future cash flows. Even GameStop’s run-up, though, was born out of forward-looking analysis of a business, not gambling. The original thesis behind buying GameStop, before it turned into a social movement devoted to punishing hedge funds, <i>was</i> an argument that the company was fundamentally underpriced—because the market had missed its opportunity to transcend brick-and-mortar retailing and digitize its business!</p>
<p>There are definite precedents for extrapolating about new concerns from stock prices. Defense stocks rise when war is rumored to be imminent, for example, and cyclical stocks’ performance tends to change ahead of macro data on the economic cycle. More narrowly, the economist Armen Alchian <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0929119914000546">deduced that hydrogen bombs use lithium by tracking the stock prices of mining companies</a>.</p>
<p>Today, the world’s most valuable automaker is Tesla, with a market capitalization of $827bn, compared to $232bn for runner-up Toyota. Tesla isn’t valued based on its current production (just under 500,000 vehicles annually, compared to Toyota’s 9.2 million) or high margins (it eked out a net profit margin of just under 2%, less than half of Toyota’s results). Instead, Tesla is valued based on three forward-looking intangibles: it’s a pure-play electric vehicle company, its brand name is synonymous with clean energy rather than the more mixed reaction General Motors or Hyundai might engender, and its charismatic CEO has been able to recruit cult-like adherents to his vision of sustainable transportation and a multiplanetary species.</p>
<p>Calling Tesla is a cult isn’t pejorative, just descriptive: any organization that successfully accomplishes something that is widely believed to be impossible has to have distinctive beliefs, and any group of people who behave in unusual ways because of shared beliefs can be reasonably described as a cult. Some companies use their cultish aspects in harmful ways, but cults are a social design pattern that shows up over and over again, in successful companies and political movements. Cult-like traits are more common with companies that are growing fast—it would be hard for a steel mill or a local bank to engender this kind of behavior in its employees. It’s a way to focus everyone’s energy on the future, and avoid distracting questions about whether or not that future is viable—a way to raise the variance of outcomes, which makes extreme upside scenarios possible while increasing the odds of failure.</p>
<p>Tesla is not the only futuristic vehicle stock to be accorded a high value by the stock market. In fact, it’s arguably among the more mature. There are at least earnings to put a price/earnings multiple on, whereas many of the more recent EV companies are at an earlier stage than that. Luminar Technologies, for example, went public through a reverse merger late last year, and currently has a market value of almost $11bn. The company has minimal sales ($11m over the last nine months) and is still pouring money into R&amp;D. But LiDAR appears to be the most promising way to get cars to full autonomy, so investors are willing to value it based on the chance that a) autonomous vehicles will happen, b) they’ll use LiDAR, c) they’ll use Luminar’s systems to do it, and d) Luminar will be able to earn acceptable margins selling it.</p>
<p>The joint probability of all of those possibilities is low if they’re independent: if there’s a 10% chance of autonomous vehicles, a 10% chance they’ll use LiDAR, a 10% chance that LiDAR-using AVs will use Luminar’s technology, and a 10% chance that Luminar will get good margins, then the odds of Luminar being a good investment work out to 0.01%. But the more ambitious a company is, the more its job is to make those variables <i>conditional</i> instead: the closer a company gets to being the <i>only</i> way a given technology can happen, the more technology risk becomes synonymous with business risk, which compresses the overall range of outcomes. It also solves for the viable-business condition: if there’s just one company that can make AVs possible, then that company will have the pricing power necessary to make them profitable, too.</p>
<p>This dynamic actually works in two directions: first, it means that the odds of Luminar selling LiDAR conditional on LiDAR becoming ubiquitous are higher, because the latter is most probably going to happen if the former is true. And second, it’s a recruiting tool: if there’s one company that has a reasonable shot at accomplishing something, and it’s a desirable goal, then the company has a monopoly on the kinds of employees who can achieve that goal. This is a point Peter Thiel articulates in <i>Zero to One</i>, and it’s one of the reasons technology companies have such a skewed distribution of outcomes. They articulate a variant view, which means they attract people who share that variant view—and since the argument is settled by technology and economics, they don’t have to persuade the rest of the world, just to offer a better product.</p>
<p>The rise of special purpose acquisition vehicles, or SPACs, is a general testament to a more forward-looking market. In a conventional IPO, an operating company sells shares to the public; with a SPAC, an empty shell company goes public, and then identifies a private company to merge with. Due to a quirk in securities laws, a traditional IPO prospectus only shows a company’s backwards-looking estimates, and makes heavily-qualified statements about the future. A company that goes public through a SPAC is technically engaging in a merger, rather than an IPO, and the rules are different. When a public company buys another company, securities laws allow it to talk about that company’s anticipated growth, or the likely cost savings of the merger. Similarly, SPAC offerings can talk up a company’s long-term prospects, and even make exact estimates of future revenue.</p>
<p>SPACs have existed for years, but they exploded in popularity in 2020. Of the 466 SPAC companies that went public from 2011 through 2020, 248 of them went public in 2020 alone. A number of technical forces drove this—a large number of private companies looking for acquisitions, investors eager to get into <i>any</i> growth company early, some technicalities around SPAC issuance that make them attractive to specialist hedge funds. But the key driver of excitement about SPACs is that they can take companies public based on a future-focused outlook.</p>
<p>When Virgin Galactic went public by merging with Chamath Palihapitiya’s Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings, the company, which has taken deposits but generated minimal revenue, was able to project $590 million in annual revenue in the year 2023, and over a quarter of a billion dollars in pretax, pre-depreciation earnings. While this was optimistic, it’s also demonstrative: a company like Virgin Galactic would have been almost impossible to take public in a conventional way, because backwards-looking financial statements showed only losses. it may not work out as a business, or live up to its projections, but those projections got more plausible once it had access to public markets for funding.</p>
<p>High valuations for money-losing, often pre-revenue companies remind people of the dot-com bubble, and it’s worth putting that bubble in perspective. Someone who bought the market at its peak in March 2000 has earned a 6% compounded return since then. …</p></div></div></div>

      <div><p><i>I sent this email to the whole team at YC yesterday:</i></p><p>When I joined&nbsp;YC&nbsp;7.5 years ago, there weren’t many people around. PG and Jessica were still running things. We had offices in Mountain View, Palo Alto, and on Kearny street, but they were nearly always empty. The only meeting on any calendar was the lunch on Thursdays where we’d talk about companies over takeout or at a table in a crowded restaurant.</p><p>The ways in which we’ve changed since then have been amazing to see.&nbsp;YC&nbsp;has grown in every way imaginable. The scope of what&nbsp;YC&nbsp;funds is larger. The team is bigger and more capable. The number of companies is pushing towards some ever receding upper bound. There’s more software, a larger community, and more programming designed to help&nbsp;YC&nbsp;founders build better futures.</p><p>I feel a deep sense of pride and honor at the part that I’ve played in that change and growth. I recall the first conversation I had with Aaron King about the Series A for Snapdocs. The questions he and I worked through were the kernel of the Series A program. I am amazed to see the directions in which Janelle is now building YCA. I’m grateful for the part I played in our conversations about growing beyond seed investing - conversations which eventually took shape as YCC. And, of course, there are fifteen batches worth of applications, interviews, dinners, office hours, and demo days rattling around in my head.<br></p><p>I’ve been thinking, recently, about the founders with whom I’ve had a chance to work. I’ve lost count of the number of incredible people I’ve gotten to know over these last years. Thinking back, it’s easy to see how the sheer weight of numbers can drive a person to be jaded about the problems that founders face. But the other night, as I spoke with a founder about a tough situation, I was reminded about how important it is to that individual that she gets the best possible advice. This is a lesson I learned time and again, and is something I hope I’ll never forget.</p><p>And then there’s the funny stuff. There were stolen air conditioners, barefoot pitches, robots that did not make sandwiches, update emails pulled from the I Ching, bandages, inhaled jet fuel, and literal blood on the interview floors. These are the things that I’ll remember long after everything else.</p><p>The truth is, I only meant to stick around&nbsp;YC&nbsp;for two years. Somehow, that two became two more, and then some more. As meaningfully as I’ve enjoyed my work here, it’s time for me to move onto something different and new and outside the bounds of what&nbsp;YC&nbsp;does. That’s a strange, exhilarating moment, and an important one for me and for my family. The pandemic provided the practical and existential nudge I needed to see the depth of this need.</p><p>To my fellow partners - thank you for your tireless work for our founders and for&nbsp;YC. Thank you for everything you’ve taught me, for all the strange conversations we’ve had, and for all the demo day presentations we’ve crafted.</p><p>To PG and Jessica and Trevor and RTM - thank you for giving me this opportunity and for making&nbsp;YC&nbsp;the kind of place I could love enough to stay long after I meant to leave.</p><p>To Janelle - thank you for building YCA with me and for being the best person I could imagine to take it into the future.</p><p>To everyone else -&nbsp;YC’s mission in the world is abstract. It could mean so many things, but it wouldn’t be anything without your work. Whether you are managing founder expectations about housing in the Bay Area, helping someone understand the mysteries of cap tables, talking someone down off the ledge of yelling at a reporter, or making sure that there will one day be an office to come back to, you are what makes&nbsp;YC&nbsp;a viable, vital force in the world.</p><p>I’ve never liked&nbsp;goodbye.</p><p>aaron</p></div>

  <p><strong>TLDR:</strong> The most common implementations of the factorial function in C do not handle
errors correctly and have typical code vulnerabilities. The factorial function should
include error handling even when only for the goal of teaching recursion, so that
beginners get used to writing robust code.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you need a real factorial function, or its logarithm to do number theoretical
calculations, it’s available in the C standard library as <code>tgammal()</code> and <code>lgammal()</code>
functions <a href="#ref-glibc-math">[1]</a><a href="#ref-posix-tgammal">[2]</a><a href="#ref-posix-lgammal">[3]</a>.</p>

<p><span>!☕</span> The C language was created shortly after the Unix
operating system in the 1970’s, so that the new operating system could be written in a
simple and efficient programming language, instead of
assembly <a href="#ref-chistory">[4]</a>. Portability soon became a motivation too: to be able
to run Unix and applications in heterogeneous systems caused the operating system and the
C programming language to have a profound and long lasting impact on computer
systems <a href="#ref-tiobe-index">[5]</a><a href="#ref-stackoverflow">[6]</a><a href="#ref-ctoday">[7]</a><a href="#ref-unixhistory">[8]</a><a href="#ref-unixtoday">[9]</a>.
Simplicity, efficiency and portability, built into the language and transformed into
programming philosophy, came with a price. When programming in C, if you want it, you’ll
have it. That includes writing broken code, invoking behavior not defined by the language
and, in general, allowing you, without questioning, to “shoot your own foot”. Those who do
not program in C might believe this wouldn’t affect them. Remember, though, that many
modern languages were influenced and even replicated C syntax and
behavior <a href="#ref-cfamily">[10]</a>. Even for languages that were not directly influenced
by C, simplicity and efficiency requirements may still cause a lot of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment" target="_blank">astonishment</a>.</p>

<p>In this post, we’ll begin by writing a couple of factorial function implementations in C
that 9 out of the first 10 Google Search results implement. Then, we’ll discuss the
problems, present a minimal robust implementation and finally discuss about different ways
of doing error handling in C, so that, in the end you feel motivated to always write
robust code.</p>

<h3 id="recursive-factorial">Recursive factorial</h3>

<p>So here we go, this is the “Google version” of the recursive factorial function written in
C:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</span>
<span>int</span> <span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
	<span>/* This basic recursive factorial function is widespread
	 * on the Internet, but results in incorrect results most
	 * of the time, contains a stack overflow and integer
	 * underflow. */</span>
	<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>

	<span>return</span> <span>n</span><span>*</span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
	<span>int</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span>

	<span>/* Missing error checking on standard I/O. */</span>
	<span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Input a number: "</span><span>);</span>
	<span>scanf</span><span>(</span><span>"%d"</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>x</span><span>);</span>
	<span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"The factorial of %d is: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>));</span>

	<span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s compile and run this program:</p>

<pre><code>$ cc -o fact0 fact0.c
$ ./fact0
Input a number: 100
The factorial of 100 is: 0
$
</code></pre>

<p>So the factorial of 100 is 0. Or is it ? Factorials are positive integers. Have we
written anything wrong ? A quick search online shows that there are indeed
implementations exactly like this and that the mathematical recursive formula for the
factorial is correct. Also, for some numbers the program correctly calculates the result:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./fact0
Input a number: 5
The factorial of 5 is: 120
$ ./fact0
Input a number: 12
The factorial of 12 is: 479001600
$
</code></pre>

<h3 id="interlude-factorial-in-python">Interlude: factorial in Python</h3>

<p>Let’s put this code on hold for a moment and implement exactly the same algorithm in
Python:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env python3
</span><span>def</span> <span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>):</span>
    <span># Incomplete factorial implementation, but better than C
</span>    <span># (all behavior is defined by the language).
</span>    <span>if</span> <span>n</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>:</span> <span>return</span> <span>1</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>n</span><span>*</span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>main</span><span>():</span>
    <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>int</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>(</span><span>'Input a number: '</span><span>))</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'The factorial of %d is: %d'</span> <span>%</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)))</span>

<span>if</span> <span>__name__</span> <span>==</span> <span>'__main__'</span><span>:</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running this program outputs:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./fact.py
Input a number: 100
The factorial of 100 is: 93326215443944152681699238856266700490715968264381621468592963895217599993229915608941463976156518286253697920827223758251185210916864000000000000000000000000
$ ./fact.py
Input a number: 5
The factorial of 5 is: 120
$ ./fact.py
Input a number: 12
The factorial of 12 is: 479001600
$
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, now it makes sense. The Python programming language, using arbitrary precision integer
numbers is able to correctly calculate the factorial using the recursive formula. In the
case of C, the integer data type (<code>int</code>) is a fixed width binary integer number (on my
computer, a 32-bit integer), without a defined overflow behavior. I can confirm this is
causing problems by using the undefined behavior detector library from my C compiler:</p>

<pre><code>$ cc -o fact0 fact0.c -fsanitize=undefined
$ ./fact0
Input a number: 100
fact0.c:10:10: runtime error: signed integer overflow: 13 * 479001600 cannot be represented in type 'int'
The factorial of 100 is: 0
$
</code></pre>

<p>So, that’s it, we’ve found it. Not only integer overflow is happening, we’ve confirmed by
using the undefined behavior detector that signed integer overflow in C is undefined
behavior. Due to the motivation of being small, efficient and portable to write an
operating system 50 years ago, the language rules won’t bother considering this case: what
happens when an integer operation overflows ? The language states that it’s
undefined. Anything is allowed to happen (like crashing the program or exploding a
spaceship). The reason for this is that this might be used for some kind of benefit,
typically related to performance and compiler simplicity, for a certain type of computer.
For example, for my compiler with default flags, integer overflows simply wrap around to
the minimum possible value because, when compiled, it results in the fastest possible
integer arithmetic code for my machine, and could be used for modular value calculations,
if desired. Other computers are free to implement a different behavior, also striving for
the fastest performance, if desired. This means that undefined behavior in C is part of
the language specification that helps guaranteeing that the language will be both portable
and performant in heterogeneous systems. Undefined behavior is arguably one of the reasons
C is so widespread for writing high performance system software. Consider, for example,
the modern high performance language <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank">Rust</a>,
praised for its modern safety features <a href="#ref-rustsafety">[11]</a>, and, in my opinion,
one of the best contenders for replacing C++ in the near future, also
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html?highlight=overflow#integer-overflow" target="_blank">opting to allow silent integer overflows, yet stating that relying on it is considered an error</a>.
More commonly nowadays, however, since computers are becoming more homogeneous, the
unexpected result will simply cause a bug, without offering any other portability benefit.
Worse yet, in our specific case, compiling with default flags mentioned nothing. The
programmer was allowed to do that and the C compiler was silent about that.</p>

<h3 id="as-buggy-as-possible">As buggy as possible</h3>

<p>In the latest international C draft standard (ISO C 2017/2018 <a href="#ref-isoc17">[12]</a>),
undefined behavior is defined as the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3.4.3 undefined behavior</p>

  <p>behavior, upon use of a nonportable or erroneous program construct or of erroneous data,
for which this International Standard imposes no requirements</p>

  <p>(…)</p>

  <p>EXAMPLE An example of undefined behavior is the behavior on integer overflow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the C programming language “imposes no requirements” on the behavior of integer
overflow, someone must. That someone is you, the programmer. You are allowed to shoot
your own foot, but if you’re smart you won’t.</p>

<p>Now any pragmatic programmer would think that this discussion doesn’t really make sense,
since the only goal of the recursive factorial function is to teach recursion and only
scratch the surface of C programming, so this discussion is meaningless. If that were the
whole story I would agree with that too and never waste my time writing this, but the
truth is that even though we must keep it simple, we have gone too far:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/05/13/einstein-simple/" target="_blank"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Albert_Einstein_-_pixabay.svg" alt="Einstein">“Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler” – Some really smart guy</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the C factorial example we have gone beyond as simple as possible and the code has
become oversimplified and thus incorrect. What I’m talking about is the amount of program
failures caused by buffer overflows, rounding errors, uninitialized memory access,
insufficient input validations and others that are main causes of electronic device
misbehaviors and exploitations in modern information technology. Famous bugs include the
$370 million Ariane 5 rocket explosion <a href="#ref-ariane5">[13]</a> and the Year 2000
bug <a href="#ref-y2k">[14]</a>, both caused by numeric overflows. Less impactful were the
integer overflows caused by the addictive Gangnam Style music video being viewed more than
2^31 times on YouTube <a href="#ref-gangnam">[15]</a> and Paypal depositing $92 quadrillion
(2^63 dollars) into the account of a user <a href="#ref-quadrillion">[16]</a>. On the other
hand, the cyberwarfare Stuxnet virus, believed to have been created by the Israeli and
American governments to damage Iranian uranium enrichment
centrifuges <a href="#ref-stuxnet">[17]</a>, was able to successfully spread by using a kind
of improper input validation when displaying Windows shortcut files and receiving Windows
Print Spooler commands, that allowed executing code where there should be only
non-verified data (thus, the vulnerability is called remote code execution).</p>

<p>Yearly lists of most dangerous software errors, besides misconfiguration and weak security
practices, always include out-of-bounds accesses, NULL pointer dereference, improper input
validation and use after freeing dynamic
memory <a href="#ref-vuln1">[18]</a><a href="#ref-vuln2">[19]</a><a href="#ref-vuln3">[20]</a>. These errors are
allowed by the C language, so it’s the programmer’s task to avoid them. If these fall in
the top list of most dangerous software errors, first of all it means they are difficult
to avoid even for skilled programmers and second, programmers are not trained well enough
to avoid them. So, every …</p></article></div></div></div>

        <h4>February 12th, 2021 · 5 minute read</h4>

        <p>
          I've seen quite a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21990566">few</a> <a href="https://blog.pushbullet.com/2020/05/13/lets-guess-what-google-requires-in-14-days-or-they-kill-our-extension/">people</a> <a href="https://blog.lipsurf.com/part-ii-after-3-years-of-work-chrome-killed-my-extension-and-wont-tell-me-why/">complaining</a> lately about the Kafkaesque Chrome extension review process, so when I started running into my own problems with the Chrome Web Store I wasn't exactly surprised.
        </p>

        <p>
          It wasn’t until I submitted the same extension to the Firefox Add-Ons Store that I saw just how good things could be. In a world of walled gardens watched over by heavy handed reviewers, Firefox's review process was laughably good.
        </p>

        <section>
          

          <p>
            In January 2020 my buddy and I started working on an idea we had for an automation app. We called it Otto.
          </p>

          <p>
            Otto consisted of two parts: a Mac app and a browser extension. After a few months worth of nights and weekends we had an alpha version we were ready to share with friends. I submitted the browser extension to Chrome under my own personal account, and after a review process of a couple days it was accepted. So far so good.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          

          <p>
            The trouble started a few months later. After some more development and discussion, we re-framed our idea as an app to make custom keyboard shortcuts and we decided to rename Otto to <a href="https://keysmith.app/">Keysmith</a>. We also took the time at this point to create a company Google account. We renamed the extension and submitted it from our new company account.
          </p>

          <p>
            To be clear: changing the name was the <i>only</i> change we made.
          </p>

          <p>
            A few days later we received a rejection email. Here's a timeline of our interaction:
          </p>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                We submit Keysmith to the Chrome Web Store.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <div>
              <p>
                First rejection email.

                Quick summary:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Keysmith "violates the 'Use of Permissions' section"</li>
                <li>We should "Request access to the narrowest permissions necessary"</li>
                <li>"If more than one permission could be used to implement a feature, you must request those with the least access to data or functionality."</li>
                <li>We shouldn't attempt to "future proof"</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <div>
              <div><p>
                We double check the permissions we've requested and can't find any problems. We respond asking for more detail.
                </p><p>
                We also mention that we had previously submitted the <i>same</i> extension with the <i>same</i> requested permissions, just under a different name (Otto). We hoped they'd say "oh, in that case we'll approve this right away!". But instead:
              </p></div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                Otto, our <i>existing extension</i>, is removed from the store and no additional detail on the rejection is provided. In fact, this email contains the <i>same exact</i> text as the previous one.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                We respond, again asking for more detail. We ask if it would help if we expanded on how we're using each permission in the permissions justification section.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                They respond with the <i>exact same text again</i>. No further detail. No help at all.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                We suspect these reviews are entirely automated, so we ask if we can speak to a "human reviewer", hoping this will trigger a manual review (we also consider dropping an f-bomb for the same reason, but decide to remain decent for now).
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                They respond with some <i>slightly</i> different text, but still nothing useful.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                We try adding a lot more detail to the "justification" section for each of the permissions we use and we resubmit.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                They respond with the exact same text as the first rejection.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                We respond with one more plea for more more information.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                They respond with the same text again.
              </p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section>
          

          <p>
            At this point I dig into Chrome's documentation once again with a fine-tooth comb and I make a discovery: we had been requesting both the <span>tabs</span> and <span>activeTab</span> permissions, but since we also requested permission to run on <span>&lt;all_urls&gt;</span> it turns out that the features made available by <span>activeTab</span> were a strict subset of the features made available by <span>tabs</span>. So the <span>activeTab</span> permission was redundant. We weren't opening up any new functionality, we were just asking for a <i>redundant</i> permission.
          </p>

          <p>
            This discovery made the Chrome review team's communications far more frustrating in retrospect. The line that all of their emails repeated was "Request access to the narrowest permissions necessary". And, sure, we had asked for <span>activeTab</span> when we didn't need it, but that permission <i>didn't grant us any more functionality</i>. They had rejected our extension 6 times with no detail <i>because of a technicality</i>.
          </p>

          <p>
            We committed the 1 line diff removing the <span>activeTab</span> permission and resubmitted. A day later it was accepted.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          

          <p>
            A Firefox version of our browser extension had long been on our list, but for the first little while it didn't feel worth the additional support cost. We didn't know exactly how large that cost would be, but we suspected that there would be enough differences between the two browsers that it'd be a bit of a hassle to maintain them both.
          </p>

          <p>
            Boy were we wrong. When we finally started looking into porting our extension to Firefox we found that we had to make <i>zero</i> changes to the code. None whatsoever. Firefox even supported the use of the global <span>chrome</span> object for accessing extension APIs (if you're curious, Chrome is not kind enough to return the favor).
          </p>

          <p>
            So we created a Firefox developer account, submitted our extension, and girded ourselves for another rough ride.
          </p>

          <p>
            <i>Boy were we wrong.</i>
          </p>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                We submit the first version of our extension to Firefox.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <div>
              <div><p>
                Less than 3 hours later we receive an email from Firefox that says, in effect, "Sorry this is taking so long, but we'll get to it soon!"
                </p><p>
                Responses from the Chrome team usually came in the wee hours of the morning, making the effective turnaround about 24 hours. Firefox apologizing after fewer than 3 hours was <i>hilarious</i> to us.
              </p></div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                We get an email saying the extension was accepted exactly 24 hours after submission.
              </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            Further updates have been even speedier, usually only taking 2 or 3 minutes to be scanned and accepted. One of our updates even got accepted before I finished uploading the unminified source archive (which they require if you minify in production). And the dashboard shows your position in the review queue to give you some idea of when it'll complete.
          </p>

          <p>
            Needless to say, this was a breath of fresh air, and we won't be neglecting support for Firefox ever again in the future.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          

          <p>
            I realize that in some ways this is an unfair comparison. Chrome's market share is much larger than Firefox's these days, so surely they also have to deal with far more extension submissions.
          </p>

          <p>
            But the lack of transparency in their process was infuriating and counter-productive. Had someone taken the time to manually review our case, or at least <i>read any of the emails</i> we sent, we could've resolved this issue with one response. Instead it took 6 responses and a week of wondering if this review process would kill our product before it even launched.
          </p>

          <p>
            I really hope things improve, but I'm not counting on it.
          </p>

</span></b><span face="Arial" size="2">
<p>Alan G. Carter</p>
<i><p>alan@melloworld.com</p>
</i>
<p>9th May 1999</p>

</span><b><i><span face="Arial"><p>Introduction</p>
</span></i></b><span face="Arial" size="2">
<p>This paper presents a deep logical error in most people's thinking, that is introduced right at the beginning of thought, and then stays in the thinking until the conclusions are reached. The conclusions are then wrong, but when they are examined there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with them. Nor does there seem to be anything wrong with the reasoning - as people check back, each step seems to be correct. This is because the error was already in place before reasoning began. Even worse, the conclusions people reach in one area seem to match the conclusions they reach in other areas. This is because the error has a particular character wherever it appears, so one conclusion that contains the error has a relationship with another that also contains the error, which makes them match up.</p>

<p>The problem distorts deductive reasoning. It does not distort inductive reasoning, but it makes inductive reasoning appear inadmissible to many people who have done some deductive reasoning with the Ghost Not and turned their minds effectively inside out.</p>

<p>The effect of this has been to create the "Two Half Cultures"  (not "Two Cultures" as C. P. Snow claimed - he was seeing double), as well as the single Culture we should have. The three groups are usually called:</p>

<b></b><p><b>Artists.</b> They use intense inductive reasoning (intuition) to spot implicit patterns and express them. They shun deductive reasoning and claim that it is in itself flawed. For some this leads to a paradox of trying to achieve clarity without being clear, which the best avoid by achieving expressions that are deeper than words. Since their social interactions are Ghost Not polluted, they learn to maintain a buffer zone around their art, which they simply refuse to allow any deductive discussion of. This impoverishes society, since there are a great many truths that can be <i>understood</i> deductively but cannot be <i>reached</i> deductively, as Kurt Godel proved in mathematics. </p>

<b></b><p><b>Scientists. </b>They use deductive reasoning to analyse explicit patterns and express them. They shun inductive reasoning because they have the Ghost Not inspired delusion that phenomena do not exist unless they themselves know of a viable causal mechanism at that moment. The best of them avoid this problem by achieving paradigm shifts - recastings of the perceived universe that are deeper than words. Since most scientists believe that is it their primary duty to enforce the orthodox paradigm rather than discover the truth, achieving a paradigm shift usually involves waiting for a generation of scientists to die, as Thomas Kuhn explained.</p>

<b></b><p><b>Alchemists.</b> They use deductive reasoning to illuminate the harmonies they perceive inductively. They use their logic to track what is there rather than what they have admitted to their inner simulations. By seeing what is there they have no conflict between deductive and inductive perceptions, and the correct single mode of perception emerges. The results of their contemplations are immediately encoded as modifications to their own perceptions, in a way that is deeper than words. They come to see on all the levels and into all the worlds. They never forget. They freely mix the tools and language of artists and scientists in a way that the half cultures insist is impossible. As they do so, they realise that the single way of seeing is a reality that "art" and "science" (as these words are usually understood) are mere shadows of. Isaac Newton was an alchemist in the true meaning of the word, and all the great mystical teachers prize rational thinking.</p>

<p>This is an alchemical paper. It starts by borrowing from van Gogh to describe the core idea of seeing like an artist that it is going to explore. Scientists should not be worried about this - where do axioms come from? Then van Gogh, Magritte and Freud help to compare seeing like an artist to the way most people currently do seeing. Then it makes an important philosophical point about the property of symmetry that is found in our universe, and just where we can and cannot reasonably expect to find it, with a little help from Allen Ginsberg. All of these ingredients are then put into a single context, using the Primary Algebra of George Spencer-Brown.</p>

<p>As ideas from art criticism and mathematics are introduced, they are explained. It is very important that both artists and scientists reading this paper realise this, since it is only by using both aspects of the One Culture together that what this paper discusses can be fully understood. It is not the case that those parts that use mathematics are inherently beyond the comprehension of artists, or the other way around. Both are nothing without the other.</p>

<p>At this point the Ghost Not is wholly exposed. The paper then builds up a series of examples, from the simplest logical OR operation through a few levels of mathematical examples to complex human emotional, social, philosophical and scientific contexts. At each level it shows how the Ghost Not appears to distort conclusions in its characteristic way. In the final sections, it makes some comments on a culture that has evolved with all of its thinking distorted by the Ghost Not. These are the areas where understanding the problem will allow us to make improvements.</p>
</span><b><i><span face="Arial"><p>Seeing Like An Artist</p>
</span></i></b><span face="Arial" size="2">
<p>We shall begin by asking what art is for. What does art do? One answer to this question is to say that it is <i>pretty</i> - decorous. This though, is a very shallow answer. Great art does more than cause nice feelings for us by being pretty. Great art captures in one (convenient) form, some deep and powerful thing usually found in another form. A few dyes daubed on canvas or a piece of hewn stone can capture something of a natural movement or a human emotion that excites, or challenges, or puzzles us. What art does is to <i>convey impressions</i>. Here are the awe inspiring forces of a storm, captured in daubings by Vincent van Gogh:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.datapacrat.com/Opinion/Reciprocality/r2/image3.jpg" width="324" height="155"></p>

<p>When he pulls the trick off, van Gogh has to do two quite distinct things. Firstly, he has to spot something worth conveying. This might just be something direct, such a particularly spectacular view. More usually, an artist will try to convey deeper impressions than this though. Here, what van Gogh has done is notice that the wheat in the field has been scraped into the same texture as the stormclouds. Although invisible, the same force (the wind) is behind both patterns. His painting thus celebrates the power of the wind, which cannot itself be painted because it is invisible. He then goes beyond this though, and shows that the track itself seems to have been pulled in the same way the wheat and the clouds have been. Can it be that there is a deeper principle behind both the wind and the historic forces that define the path of a track? Perhaps a modern physicist might think about fluid dynamics here - certainly the philosopher Plato would be sympathetic to the idea that the equations of fluid dynamics are "deeper" than their resultants - wind and track paths. Then look at the crows in the sky. They alone are not distorted by the action of this principle - the wind and perhaps what lies behind it. Perhaps the crows both individually and in their flock, are in some way creatures of - their behaviour is governed by - the same deep principle. Then look once again at the wheat. The raw energy that has scraped it is not the only thing that causes it to resemble the clouds, which have been shaped solely by the wind. It is quite clear that the scraped appearance of the wheat ears derives in part from the regular planting pattern that we see at the front of the picture. Is there another creature about whose nature derives from the deep principle behind wind and crows, that has done this?</p>

<p>Quite a lot of ideas for one eyeful. The sensibilities and editorial skills of van Gogh spotted an impression worth conveying, that caused him to experience a great deal of the world, in its own context, in one go. To do the job, van Gogh must allow sensory data to enter his eyes uncritically, and wait for the relationships that are implicit in the data to emerge as he rolls the raw data around in his head. When he had completed this task, the job of finding something to paint, his second task began. The second task was now to un-notice what he had noticed. Rather than paint a cloud that looked like a field, he must use his technical skill with his materials and a kind of <i>honesty</i> to simply record the visual image that had brought the impressions to his mind. He must leave it to the viewer of the painting to either agree with him or not, that the <i>data</i> he has recorded suggest a relationship between say, planted fields of wheat, windtorn clouds, and farm tracks. </p>

<p>In both of these tasks, van Gogh must perceive uncritically. He must allow sensory data to enter his awareness <i>without</i> asking what it "is", and only later in either his mind, or the mind of the viewer, should the pattern he will (or has) becomes aware of, take form. This is seeing like an artist. It is exactly the same as the <i>honesty</i> that the physicist Richard Feynman insisted is necessary to make any progress in understanding nature. See what is <i>there</i>, not what you <i>expect</i>.</p>
</span><b><i><span face="Arial"><p>Conventional Perception</p>
</span></i></b><span face="Arial" size="2">
<p>Most people do not usually see like artists. Instead they do something more complicated that they have subconsciously learned to do. First, the sensory data enter their heads. That bit is unavoidable. At that point they categorise what they have seen. If it is a field of wheat before them, they categorise what they have seen as a general issue field of wheat. They then put a general issue field of wheat on a kind of internal whiteboard that they keep in their minds for this very purpose. Then they make with the exaggerated Marcel Marceau impersonation, step back from their whiteboard in amazement and cry, "Gosh! A field of wheat!" as if it were the first time they have seen it.</p>

<p>Why would anyone do such a thing? …</p></span></basefont></div>

		<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Dependencies makes it easy for developers to understand the architecture of their app. We also wanted to provide a simple solution to objectively measure the quality and the complexity of the architecture. That's the reason why we developed a new mathematical formula in the graph theory that we called <strong>Software Entropy</strong>.</p>

<p>Dependencies calculates and displays the Software Entropy of your app. In the following screenshot, the analyzed iOS framework has a Software Entropy with a value of 25. This low value clearly indicates a well structured code:</p>
<p><img src="https://dependencies.app/entropy/screenshot.png" alt="Entropy"></p><p>This paper describes the mathematical concept behind the <strong>Software Entropy</strong> and how to calculate it.</p>
<h3 id="why-the-need-for-a-new-mathematical-formula">Why the need for a new mathematical formula?</h3>

<p>Dependencies is able to extract the architecture of your app and create an interactive graph. From this graph, we want to calculate an objective score indicating the complexity of the architecture. This score needs to be agnostic to the programming language, i.e. you should be able to compare the score of an app written in Swift with the score of an app written in C++ or Objective-C.</p>

<p>There is a fairly well-known technique to measure the complexity of a program: in a paper titled “A Complexity Measure”, Thomas McCabe introduced the <strong>Cyclomatic Complexity</strong>, a mathematical formula to calculate the complexity of a program control flow. This was in… 1976! You can read the original publication <a href="http://www.literateprogramming.com/mccabe.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>However the Cyclomatic Complexity has various limitations which makes it unsuitable for our use case. It was defined with Fortran in mind at a time where Object-Oriented Programming was not widely popular: Objective-C and C++ were both developed around 1985…</p>

<p>Therefore the Cyclomatic Complexity is really limited to calculate the complexity of control flow graph, i.e. if-else statements. This technique is still useful for example to measure the complexity of a single function. This is relevant for unit testing and code coverage because it provides a good indicator on the number of test cases required to cover all branches.</p>

<p>Since we could not find a mathematical concept in the graph theory to give a meaningful complexity score for the architecture of an object-oriented software, we decided to define our own mathematical concept to fill this gap.</p>
<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<br>
<h6 id="nodes-and-links">Nodes and links</h6>

<p>In the graph theory, a graph is a structure containing nodes linked together by links:</p>
<ul>
<li>the nodes are sometimes called vertices or points.</li>
<li>the links are sometimes called edges or lines. They join 2 nodes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a graph with 5 nodes and 5 links:</p>

<br>
<h6 id="directed-graphs">Directed graphs</h6>

<p>For the Software Entropy, we will only deal with directed graphs: a link between the node 1 and the node 2 means that the node 1 depends on node 2 but node 2 doesn't depend on node 1:</p>


<p>A graph with 2 nodes (1 and 2) and 2 links (1→2, 2→1) is possible but loops are not allowed (a node can't link to itself):</p>
<br>

<br>
<h6 id="components">Components</h6>

<p>An important concept is the concept of components in a graph. To calculate the Software Entropy, we are only interested by weakly connected components, i.e. we ignore the direction of the links.</p>
<p>
This graph with 7 nodes and 7 links is composed of 2 components:
</p>
<h3 id="software-entropy-formula">Software Entropy formula</h3>

<p>The Software Entropy for a graph with one single component is calculated by the formula:</p>

<p>
	Software Entropy = L - N + 1
</p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>N is the number of nodes</li>
<li>L is the number of links between nodes</li>
</ul>

<p>We can generalize this formula for a graph with C independent components as being the sum of the Software Entropy of each component:</p>

<p>
	Software Entropy = ∑(L<sub>C</sub> - N<sub>C</sub> + 1)
</p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>N<sub>C</sub> is the number of nodes in the component C</li>
<li>L<sub>C</sub> is the number of links between nodes in the component C</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="property-the-software-entropy-is-a-positive-value">Property: the Software Entropy is a positive value</h3>

<p>One interesting property of the Software Entropy is that its value is always positive:</p>

<p>
	Software Entropy &gt;= 0
</p>
<ul>
<li>An empty graph (no component, no link, no node) has a Software Entropy of 0.</li>
<li>A graph containing a single node and no link has a Software Entropy of 0 - 1 + 1 = 0.</li>
<li>A component of N nodes contains at least (N - 1) links. As a consequence the Software Entropy for a component is positive.</li>
<li>The Software Entropy for a graph with multiple components is the sum of the Software Entropy of each component. As a consequence the Software Entropy for any graph is positive.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="meaning-of-the-software-entropy-for-the-app-architecture">Meaning of the Software Entropy for the app architecture</h3>

<p>In a well-structured app, you want to have separate components. You absolutely want to avoid that each class knows about all the other classes in your app.</p>

<p>If you represent the architecture of your app with a graph, each node representing a class or structure and each link representing a dependency between 2 classes, you want to minimize the number of links in the graph. The more dependencies you have between classes, the more chaotic your architecture is.</p>

<p>As a result, a well-structured architecture will tend to have a smaller Software Entropy than a poorly designed application.</p>

<p>A Software Entropy with the value 0 means that the architecture is ideal and only the minimum amount of links between classes are used. The greater the entropy, the more chaotic the architecture is. The Software Entropy can be use as an objective metric to ensure that your app is:</p>
<ul>
<li>well structured</li>
<li>highly testable</li>
<li>easy to maintain</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

<p>A graph with a single node has a Software Entropy of <strong>0</strong> (0 link - 1 node + 1 = 0):</p>

<p>A graph with 2 nodes linked with 1 link has a Software Entropy of <strong>0</strong> (1 link - 2 nodes + 1 = 0):</p>

<p>A graph with 2 nodes linked with 2 links has a Software Entropy of <strong>1</strong> (2 links - 2 nodes + 1 = 1):</p>

<p>The following graph containing 4 nodes has a Software Entropy of <strong>0</strong> (3 links - 4 nodes + 1 = 0). It could correspond to the composition pattern in the Object Oriented concept:</p>

<p>The following graph containing 4 nodes has a Software Entropy of <strong>0</strong> (3 links - 4 nodes + 1 = 0). It could correspond to the inheritance pattern in the Object Oriented concept:</p>

<p>The following graph containing 4 nodes has a Software Entropy of <strong>1</strong> (4 links - 4 nodes + 1 = 1). It could correspond to the concept of Retain Cycle:</p>

<p>The following graph contains 2 components and has a Software Entropy of <strong>0</strong> (3 links - 4 nodes + 1) + (3 links - 4 nodes + 1) = 0:</p>

<p>The following graph contains 2 components and has a Software Entropy of <strong>3</strong> (5 links - 4 nodes + 1) + (4 links - 4 nodes + 1) = 3:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Commercial open source software has always been a head scratcher for many: how exactly can you publish your entire code base online, make it free for people to download, but also create a viable business around it? Red Hat's IPO in '99 was a great result, but it was more of a one-of success than a playbook that other makers could follow. In the past decade open source has boomed in popularity, but the path to commercialization has gotten even more complicated, as the shift to the cloud put AWS and other providers in a position to easily host and redistribute open source project without rewarding the original creators. In this post we will dive into the history of open source software licensing, its evolution over the last 40 years, and what the future holds.</p><h2>"Open Letter to Hobbyists"</h2><p>Before the 70s, software was not considered copyrightable, and therefore had no licenses attached to it; early commercial products like IBM's mainframe software were distributed with source code included. The landscape started changing with the <em>"US Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works (CONTU)"</em> of 1974, which stated that "computer programs, to the extent that they embody an author's original creation, are proper subject matter of copyright". In 1976, a young Bill Gates authored <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/surf/072397mind-letter.html">"Open Letter to Hobbyists"</a> and published it on the New York Times; in the essay, Gates denounced people who obtained copies of BASIC without paying the license fee: "Who can afford to do professional work for nothing?". These copies were bootleg versions of the BASIC paper tape. One of the original tapes was stolen at a Homebrew Computer Club meetup in June 1975, and copies of it were redistributed at the following meeting.</p><p>The final nail in the coffin of public-domain software came with the verdict of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Computer,_Inc._v._Franklin_Computer_Corp.">Apple vs Franklin</a></em> in 1983, which clarified that both the source code (the human-readable code) and the binary code (the machine readable code) of a program are covered by copyright. After Apple vs Franklin, the software landscape quickly started moving towards widespread licensing and binary-only distribution of software. IBM reverted its original policy and announced it'd be no longer distributing the source code along with software purchases. </p><p>"Free software" was now vulnerable to larger companies leveraging their source code and redistributing it as a commercial product. Apple itself was a clear representation of the divide between hobbyists, like Steve Wozniak and the Homebrew Computer Club, and more commercially-focused minds, like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates.</p><h2>The GNU Project and the birth of "Open Source"</h2><p>In the 1970s Richard Stallman, a Harvard graduate, spent time at MIT's AI laboratory where he built a reputation as a strong proponent of "free software". Disturbed by the development in the software licensing world, he founded <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.en.html">the GNU Project</a> in 1983, with the aim of representing and supporting the free software movement. The organization is responsible for the creation of the GNU General Public License (GPL) in 1989, which would then be adopted by leading projects of the time like Linux and MySQL.</p><p>The GPL leveraged a new concept called "copyleft". "Copyleft" allows software creators to grant users access to the source code of their applications and lets them create derivative work on top of it, but it requires that work to also adopt the same license. This makes it impossible for companies to take projects under "copyleft", package them and redistribute them as closed-source commercial products. The GPL was a pivotal moment in the history of open source software; to this day, the license is still leveraged by some of the most popular open source projects like Red Hat, MySQL, Git, and Ubuntu. </p><p>In 1997 Eric Raymond, a long-time Linux contributor, published <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/">"The Cathedral and the Bazaar"</a>, in which he talked about his experience in free software (the "Bazaar" model), and what his advantages are over the status quo of packaged software the industry offered (the "Cathedral" model). In summary, Raymond argues that the wisdom of the crowd offered by the Bazaar model generates better results than a small group of developers could. <em>"Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."</em> Netscape's CEO would mention Raymond's work as one of his inspirations when deciding to open source the browser (more on that later).</p><p>In that same year Christine Peterson, a fellow MIT alum, coined the term "open source" during a group meeting with Raymond and other "free software" leaders at the Foresight Institute. We should all consider ourselves lucky that "cooperatively developed" didn't win that fight! Raymond updated his essay accordingly on February 9th 1998 (<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/">"Changed free software to open source''</a>) and at the "Freeware Summit" of 1998, a vote was taken to adopt "Open source" as the standard term. The event was then renamed to "Open Source Summit", which still runs to the this day, supported by the Linux Foundation. </p><h2>Open Source goes commercial</h2><p>In March 1998, Netscape open sourced their Communicator 5.0 source code on their newly registered <a href="http://mozilla.org/">Mozilla.org</a> domain. This quote from Bob Lisbonne, SVP of client products at Netscape at the time, touches on one of the most important aspects of open source: the possibility of tapping into an unlimited pool of talent.</p><p>"It's no longer Netscape alone, pushing the client software forward, but now it's really the whole Net. For Netscape, this gives us a way to engage the creative, innovative abilities of literally orders of magnitude more people than we could ever--really any commercial software company could ever--afford to just put on their payroll." </p><p>The software was released under the <strong>Netscape Public License,</strong> which wasn't recognized as a true open source one, and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/netscape-npl.html">received criticism by Richard Stallman</a>. Mozilla eventually spun out of Netscape, and launched the Firefox browser in 2002 under the <strong>Mozilla Public License.</strong> In that same time period, other open source projects were being launched both in enterprise contexts, like Sun Microsystems's <a href="http://openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org</a> and Rapid7's Metasploit, but also in the gaming space, like Linden Lab's Second Life. In other cases, the open source project was preceding the company: Matt Mullenweg created WordPress in 2003, but only left CNET to start Automattic in 2006, and raised $1.1M in 2007. </p><p>In the early 2000s, licensing was still pretty straight forward, with most projects living under GPL or BSD licenses. The latter (not to be confused with Linux's BSD distribution) is one of the most permissive licenses, and doesn't require the disclosure of source code of derivative works. For example, I could take an open source BSD-licensed project, modify it, and redistribute it as commercial closed source product without issues. </p><p>GPL licenses on the other hand require you to disclose your source code if it leverages other GPL-licensed pieces of code. While great in theory, this is hard to enforce; if a closed source application uses GPL source code but I have no visibility into the code itself, how can I confirm it's in violation? <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2008/dec/12/cisco-fsf-opensource">Free Software Foundation (FSF) vs Cisco</a></em> in 2008's was one of the first GPL lawsuits that were against a large enterprise.  In 2016 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/11/wordpress-and-wix-trade-shots-over-alleged-theft-of-open-source-code/">Automattic accused Wix of using GPL-licensed code</a> in one of their projects, but quickly resolved the issue out of court. </p><p>As cloud computing became more popular in the 2000s, there was a major shift in the open source world. In the early days, a big part of the OSS community was individual developers participating in the development of these projects as a hobby; as time went on, open source became a larger focus for enterprises. This usually happens in two ways: </p><ul><li>The company uses an open sources project for marketing the company as a thought leader, as well as a recruiting tool to attract top talent to work on it (a good example of this is Google with TensorFlow in machine learning, but you also see it with React at Facebook)</li><li>An open source project is monetized through an open core or commercial open source strategy. This is the case for companies like MongoDB, Elastic, DataBricks, etc.</li></ul><p>This shift caused GPL to lose in popularity, as it'd require companies to open source their core products if they were to use their own open source work. Companies started moving to an Apache or MIT license. Nowadays, those two licenses account for more than 50% of all licenses. This also allowed the rise of startups that can help companies manage open source compliance, such as <a href="http://fossa.com/">FOSSA</a> and <a href="http://snyk.io/">Snyk</a>. </p><p><img src="https://alessiofanelli.com/images/screen-shot-2021-02-05-at-5.52.24-pm.png" alt="WhiteSource breakdown of licenses"></p><p><em>Credit to WhiteSource for the visualization</em></p><h2>Staying open source in a cloud-first world</h2><p>Open source software and cloud computing have been a big net positive for engineering teams around the world, drastically lowering the upfront cost and time to develop software. On the other hand, there's been a lot of discussion around whether or not cloud providers are taking advantage of open source projects, by leveraging their distribution channels to monetize open source work without giving anything back to the creators.</p><p>The community is somewhat split on this, with one side arguing that cloud providers don't owe anything to the creators, while the other side sees this as an ethical breach of the open source sentiment, even though it's technically legal. The next few years will be pivotal in deciding what the future of commercial open source looks like, especially from a licensing perspective. </p><p><strong>MongoDB</strong> was a pioneer of the first generation of large commercial open source companies. The first release of MongoDB came out in 2009; for the first few years the company behind it, at the time still named 10gen, didn't have a commercial product other than professional services and training. In 2013 they were named DB system of the year by DB-Engines, officially rebranded to MongoDB, and launched their first Enterprise version. The product was licensed under AGPLv3. The company grew very quickly and eventually went public in 2017. In 2018, MongoDB announced a license change, moving from AGPLv3 to a …</p></div></div>

          <h4><span>All orders are preorders! Please check <a href="https://thinkmodsstore.myshopify.com/blogs/news" title="ThinkMods Blog">here</a> for updates regarding development and shipping.</span></h4>
<p>The ExpressCard to NVMe adapter allows you to install any PCI-E based M.2 2242 SSD in your EC-equipped ThinkPad. It supports plug and play, hotswap, and is even bootable.</p>
<p><em>SSD is not included.</em></p>
<h4>FAQ</h4>
<p><strong>What&nbsp;laptop models&nbsp;are compatible?</strong></p>
<p>Any laptop with an ExpressCard slot is compatible. When it comes to ThinkPads, that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<u>ExpressCard 34</u><strong>:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>T400s, T410/s, T420/s, T430/s, T510, T520, T530, T540p, W510, W520, W530, W540, W541, W700/ds, W701/ds, P50, P51, P70, P71</li>
<li>
<u>ExpressCard 54:</u><span>&nbsp;</span>R51e, R52, R60, R61, R400, R500, T43/p, T60/p, T61/p, T400, T500, Z60m, Z61m, W500, X200/s/t, X201/s/t, X220/t, X230/t&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>EC54 devices can use the EC34 variant, leaving only a small cosmetic gap to one side. EC34 devices cannot use the EC54 variant.</p>
<p><strong>What SSDs are compatible?</strong></p>
<p>Any M.2 2242 PCI-E based SSD. SATA drives are not supported. The current compatible list is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Toshiba RC100 (up to 480GB)</li>
<li>Lexar NM520 (up to 512GB)</li>
<li>Sabrent Rocket 2242 (up to 2TB)</li>
<li>WD SN520 (up to 512GB)</li>
</ul>
<p>I recommend the Sabrent Rocket 2242, since it's incredibly fast, widely available, and goes up to 2TB. The WD SN520 is more widely available in Europe, though.</p>
<p><strong>What's the speed limit?</strong></p>
<p>The ExpressCard slot is limited to a single PCI-E 2.0 lane. This means the theoretical speed bottleneck is 425MB/s real-world, which is roughly the speed of SATA 6Gb/s (SATA 3).</p>
<p>Pre-Sandy Bridge models (T410/X201 and older) are limited to PCI-E 1.1, which is roughly 220MB/s. The P50/51/70/71 are capable of PCI-E 3.0, and can go up to ~900MB/s.</p>
<p><strong>Is it bootable?</strong></p>
<p>The adapter comes with a USB flash chip embedded inside, which can be booted from any stock BIOS. It contains the Clover bootloader, which has special NVMe drivers that can then boot your SSD. If you use Coreboot, you can boot directly to the SSD without touching Clover.</p>

They may think that teaching the team how to do their tasks is all that's left to do.</p><p>Well, that might be good enough when dealing with workers doing repetitive, pre-defined chores. However, it is certainly not the best way to manage a high-performing team when problem-solving and creativity are ingredients of their daily tasks.</p><p>Starting with WHY, and reminding it constantly, keeps everyone aligned on the purpose of the team. That will energize and empower each individual to be pro-active, make the right decisions, surpass roadblocks, and the team will move faster as a consequence.</p><p>Teams that start with WHY are also more likely to have a strong sense of purpose and experience less churn.</p><p>People who make a habit of applying this framework can inspire others and be inspired themselves. It applies in both directions. When in doubt, don't be afraid to ask WHY.</p><h3 id="start-with-why-in-marketing">Start with WHY in Marketing</h3><p><em>"People don't buy what you do. They buy why you do it."</em> - Simon repeats this so many times, it can get on your nerves.</p><p>He also claims that <em>"the goal is not to do business with people who need what you have, the goal is to do business with people who believe in what you believe."</em></p><p>Many authors reference Apple again and again to illustrate this point. Let's allow it one more time.</p><figure><img src="https://www.fernandoamaral.org/content/images/2021/01/thinkdifferent.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.fernandoamaral.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/thinkdifferent.jpg 600w, https://www.fernandoamaral.org/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/thinkdifferent.jpg 1000w, https://www.fernandoamaral.org/content/images/2021/01/thinkdifferent.jpg 1100w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Focusing on the WHAT and the HOW, Apple would sell computers like this:</p><blockquote><em>"We make great computers. They're user friendly, beautifully designed, and easy to use. Want to buy one?"</em></blockquote><p>Starting with WHY and then moving to HOW and WHAT, they would end up with something more along these lines:</p><blockquote><em>"With everything we do, we aim to challenge the status quo. We aim to think differently. Our products are user-friendly, beautifully designed, and easy to use. We just happen to make great computers. Want to buy one?"</em></blockquote><p>In this case, a decision is made emotionally first and then justified rationally. That's why Apple <em>fanboys</em> are often accused of buying inferior products at inflated prices, as long as they come from Cupertino. Whether that is true or an exaggeration, any brand would love to have such a dedicated following.</p><p>Simon states that this behavior is grounded in biology and the way our brain makes decisions. The outer circle (WHAT) corresponds to the neocortex, where rational thoughts and language are processed. The inner circles (HOW and WHY) relate to the limbic system, where our emotions take control.</p><p>A gut feeling, that kind of decision that we need to follow but have trouble explaining rationally, comes straight from the inner circles. If your marketing can tap into the emotions of your audience, amazing things can happen.</p><p>Remember: People don't buy what you do. They buy why you do it.</p><h3 id="start-with-the-ted-talk">Start with the TED Talk</h3><p>If you've made it this far, I recommend watching Simon himself presenting his ideas. The TED Talk amassed more than 50 million views and is well worth 18 minutes of your time.</p><figure><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action"><div><p>How great leaders inspire action</p><p>Simon Sinek has a simple but powerful model for inspirational leadership -- starting with a golden circle and the question: “Why?” His examples include Apple, Martin Luther King Jr. and the Wright brothers ...</p><p><img src="https://pa.tedcdn.com/apple-touch-icon.png"><span>TED Talks</span></p></div><p><img src="https://pi.tedcdn.com/r/pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/04916ee6e81065c8333e6546184af512eee37bbe_2880x1620.jpg?c=1050%2C550&amp;w=1050"></p></a></figure><p>At this point, you'll probably be considering whether to read the book or not.</p><p>Although I strongly identify with the notion of starting with WHY and I've applied it many times in my life since I've discovered it, I have to say that 256 pages around this simple concept are a stretch.</p><p>The book reiterates the same message ad nauseam, and I found myself repeating <em>"Ok...

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I recently came across <a href="https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity">SerenityOS</a> when it was featured in hxp CTF and then on <a href="https://twitter.com/liveoverflow">LiveOverflow’s</a> YouTube channel. SerenityOS is an open source operating system written from scratch by <a href="https://twitter.com/awesomekling">Andreas Kling</a> and now has a strong and active community behind it. If you’d like to learn a bit more about it then the recent <a href="https://cppcast.com/serenity-os/">CppCast episode</a> is a good place to start, as well as all of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/andreaskling">fantastic videos by Andreas Kling</a>.</p>

<p>Two of the recent videos were about writing exploits for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMvjaoBLPxA">typed array bug in javascript</a>, and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gt6-TC6FtMs">kernel bug in munmap</a>. The videos were great to watch and got me thinking that it would be fun to try and find a couple of bugs that could be chained together to create a full chain exploit such as exploiting a browser bug to exploit a kernel bug to get root access.</p>

<h3 id="entrypoint">Entrypoint</h3>

<p>I started looking around and discovered an integer overflow when creating a typed array from an array buffer, the length was multiplied by the element size which could overflow.

<p>This could be used to create two powerful primitives, one that could read an arbitrary address and the other that could read an arbitrary amount from some allocated memory. These were the same primitives that Kling created in his video which meant that the issue could be exploited in exactly the same way:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Finding a vtable pointer with the offset primitive by spraying lots of Numbers</li>
  <li>Use the deterministic memory layout to calculating the stack location</li>
  <li>Find the saved return address on the stack</li>
  <li>Overwriting it with a rop chain.</li>
</ul>

<p>While I was looking into exploiting this, someone else spotted the same issue and it was quickly patched.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/commit/f6c6047e49f1517778f5565681fb64750b14bf60"><img src="https://devcraft.io/assets/serenity/slack.jpg" alt="slack"></a></p>

<p>As I had already started and wanted to keep using the same issue, I kept working from <a href="https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/commit/c899ace3ad1efbf1bc8f8ee2ebb1e35903d7224b">this commit</a> which still had the bug :)</p>

<p>Exploiting the issue is pretty much identical to the video above and it does a great job explaining what is going on, so I wont go into too much detail. Here Is what I ended up with:</p>

<p>After loading this up and setting a breakpoint with gdb at <code>0x9d000000</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://devcraft.io/assets/serenity/gef.jpg" alt="gef"></p>

<p>Success! Arbitrary code in the browser.</p>

<h3 id="kernel-bug-hunting">Kernel Bug Hunting</h3>

<p>Next it was time to try and find a kernel bug that could be reached from the browser process. There had been a few issues with integer overflows, so I started looking for places that this might happen. After some searching I saw the following in <a href="https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/blob/22b0ff05d4a5b087d805d8147ca12efe410cb18f/Kernel/VM/RangeAllocator.cpp#L139">RangeAllocator::allocate_anywhere</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>m_available_ranges</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>();</span> <span>++</span><span>i</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>auto</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>available_range</span> <span>=</span> <span>m_available_ranges</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>];</span>

    <span>// FIXME: This check is probably excluding some valid candidates when using a large alignment.</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>available_range</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>()</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>(</span><span>effective_size</span> <span>+</span> <span>alignment</span><span>))</span>
        <span>continue</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each process has a list of available ranges that are used when allocating memory regions. This code is looping through all the ranges and seeing if there is one large enough to hold the requested size, taking into account the alignment (both <code>effective_size</code> and <code>alignment</code> are controlled by the user). The issue is that <code>effective_size + alignment</code> can overflow, resulting in a range being chosen that is too small to hold the requested size.</p>

<p>The <code>available_range</code> is then used to create a new allocated range:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>FlatPtr</span> <span>initial_base</span> <span>=</span> <span>available_range</span><span>.</span><span>base</span><span>().</span><span>offset</span><span>(</span><span>offset_from_effective_base</span><span>).</span><span>get</span><span>();</span>

                        SVG, short for <em>“scalable vector graphics”</em> is a format for, well, scalable vector graphics. In this article I summarize my opinion of the format, what its problems are and suggest what could be done to improve things.

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">SVG</a>, short for <em>“scalable vector graphics”</em> is a format for, well, scalable vector graphics. In this article I summarize my opinion of the format, what its problems are and suggest what could be done to improve things.</p>
<p>I’ve been using SVG together with Inkscape regularly for a few years for sketches and graphics, and like to write it by hand to satisfy my love for precision and art through code. SVG and I have a kind of love-hate relationship. It’s powerful and has some nice free and open-source tooling, but the format itself is pretty ugly.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>It’s <em>the</em> format for vector graphics. It is well supported by a range of programs from Adobe Illustrator to Inkscape for editing and in various browsers.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s a web standard so you can use it directly in websites. You can also use CSS with it.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s XML-based, so the syntax is familiar, it’s extensible and can benefit from the vast XML ecosystem. For example, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLink">XLink</a> you can reference other elements and definitions in an SVG file. Or <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> uses custom XML tags to extend SVG into their editor exchange format.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s powerful. You can do <em>a lot</em> with it. It obviously supports various path types and shapes, supports text and more, but also animations, gradients, effects and more.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>
<p>It’s a web standard. And as is customary for a web standard, SVG is magnificiently bloated. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/REC-SVG11-20110816.pdf">SVG specification</a> brings a whopping 826 (<em>eight-hundred twenty-six</em>) pages to the table. And as if that’s not enough, it’s also XML-based and cross-linked with other web standards, driving the scope of any implementation to dizzying heights.</p>
<p>If you want to be sure to correctly render all SVG files, not only do you have to consider 800 pages of SVG spec, but e.g.&nbsp;another 20 pages of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xlink11/">XLink spec</a>. Oh, and CSS as well, by the way. And, I shit you not, <em>JAVASCRIPT</em>. Yes. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/script">SVG files can include <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags.</a></p>
<p>SVG fits right in with web browsers. They’re hilariously bloated already, they already implement stuff like CSS and JavaScript that a complete SVG implementation requires. This problem of SVG is actually just the <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2020/03/18/Reckless-limitless-scope.html">problem of the web in general</a>. It’s scope is huge, it’s bloated and hard to work with.</p>
<p>SVG is nothing you could implement in a day. Or a week. Or a month. The huge amount of specifications, that are most often only partly implemented, makes it very hard to overview what supports what, confusing the user as to what features they can actually use if they want their SVG file to be universally supported.</p>
<p>Furthermore the XML-based syntax is pretty ugly and needlessly verbose. It’s tiring to write by hand and just as tiring to parse or generate automatically.</p>
<h2 id="the-ugly">The Ugly</h2>
<p>A central problem that can be extracted from the points listed above is the one I detailed in my article about <a href="https://www.eisfunke.com/article/language-design-machine-or-human.html">language design for machines vs.&nbsp;humans</a>: SVG doesn’t know what it wants to be, a machine-focused language or a human-focused language and ends up doing badly in both aspects.</p>
<p>Is it a machine-processible language? It’s far too bloated for that. Writing parsers, renderers and generators for SVGs is a huge task. The syntax is repetitive and complex. It has a lot of features that could be represented by more basic features.</p>
<p>But is it a format well-suited for direct usage by humans? Well, no. Firstly, the exhausting syntax and complexity is also bad for human users. Secondly, it misses a lot of features that would make it suitable for direct use. A graphics language that is meant for direct human use would be <a href="http://texdoc.net/pkg/tikz">Ti<em>k</em>Z</a> for LaTeX. While it’s not a great language regarding user experience in my opinion, it is definitely meant for humans and has the necessary features to help making creating complex graphics easy. But nobody would have the idea to use Ti<em>k</em>Z code as an interchange format for the finished graphic. Nobody would want to implement 1300 pages of Ti<em>k</em>Z manual just to view some graphic. Instead you compile it into an PDF (which is also a horrible format and badly bloated, but well). If SVG was a language meant for human use, compiling it into a machine-focused format would be the way to go as well, but as I said – it isn’t. It’s neither.</p>
<h2 id="what-now">What now?</h2>
<p>A good idea would be to develop a simple vector graphics exchange format that is desigend to be easily processed by machines. As minimal in features as possible. Maybe JSON-based, definitely not XML-based. You should be able to implement a basic renderer in a few days, or even better, hours, without depending on two metric tons of XML ecosystem libraries. Bezier curves, elliptic curves, fills, outlines and gradients should mostly suffice to represent every unanimated SVG. An extension could allow animations in a separate file extension.</p>
<p>This minimal and well-delimited format could then have a strict test suite and be implemented in browsers and image viewers with relative ease. Users could rely on their graphic working everywhere and implementers wouldn’t have to worry about implementing XLink, CSS and JavaScript as well. It could save bandwidth and computation power. Compilers from and to SVG could be written for compatibility.</p>
<p>It could be used as export format of user-facing programs like Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator. For people wanting to markup graphics through code there’s already stuff like Ti<em>k</em>Z, <a href="https://diagrams.github.io/">Haskell diagrams</a> or <a href="https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html">Python matplotlib</a> that could also export to the new minimal interchange format.</p>
<p>I’m actually thinking about making a slim machine-focused vector graphics format (the name <em>“SlimSVG”</em> has been suggested :D) and writing my own human-focused Haskell graphics creation library with similar goals for my own purposes in the future, maybe as a student research project for the university.</p>
<p>In summary: Decide whether a language is for humans or for machines and do one of those things. And do the one thing well instead of both, but badly.</p>

<p><strong>Update 1:</strong> This article was posted on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26114863">Hacker News</a> and landed on the front page, currently it’s on rank 3. I’m honored! <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=26115086&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D26114863%2326115086">In the comments there</a> somebody mentioned an <a href="https://www.xul.fr/svgtetris.svg">interesting use of the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag in SVG</a>. I’m unsure though whether I should be impressed or horrified :D</p>
<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> Somebody posted this on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/livw57/svg_the_good_the_bad_and_the_ugly">Reddit</a> as well. Currently, there are over 150 comments, wow.</p>
<p><strong>Update 3:</strong> PEOPLE, PLEASE. This is absolutely not about “XML is bad, let’s do JSON instead”. I actually like XML more than JSON in total, I’m a fan of XML schema and nice strong schemas. And while I still don’t like the syntax, XML generally is a good fit for a document markup language like HTML. I mostly wouldn’t care whether a good format with a good data model was encoded in JSON, XML, YAML, binary, Brainfuck or monkey feces. The encoding really is the least important part. I just think that for a strictly machine-focused format for data JSON would be a better choice.</p>
<p>I guess though I should have anticipated that saying that I don’t like XML and then mentioning the word “JSON” would start a religious war.</p>

                    <p>Wouldn’t it be amazing if you could sign up with a website with face recognition on your mobile phone and the next day on your MacBook you could just use your fingerprint scanner to sign in? What if we told you that this is possible today? </p><p>Currently you manage your accounts using passwords that you have to remember. For most users this is done by either remembering various different passwords, or worse; using the same one for every website. While social login has brought us a convenient way to sign in to websites using a single account, it still requires an account with a password. On top of that, there are security and privacy risks when using a single account for each service. Extra layers of security, like two factor authentication, can be added. But those come at the cost of complexity for the end user. The problem lies in passwords themselves. To solve it we should, and finally can, get rid of them all together to provide a user-friendly and secure authentication flow. </p><p>Even though it is still early and it has not landed in all browsers, we feel this is the future. We have already looked into what it takes to implement. As with any form of authentication, it is definitely not a trivial subject and it requires effort to implement. But please bear with us though, as we talk you through the steps. The result for the end user is definitely worth it.</p><p>Passwordless authentication on the web is made possible by the new Web Authentication (WebAuthn) API. If you’re not familiar with this API, you can check out <a href="https://webauthn.guide/#about-webauthn">this guide</a> or the video below to make it all a bit more tangible.</p><figure><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hk7kDRx3MuQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>The simplicity of using WebAuthn</figcaption></figure><h3 id="connecting-devices">Connecting devices</h3><p>The WebAuthn API supports replacing passwords with biometric data through device specific authenticators. These authenticators are, for example, the facial recognition &amp; fingerprint scanners built into (mobile) devices.</p><p>Creating accounts and logging in with a device-specific authenticator has one problem. The fingerprint scanner on a mobile phone isn’t connected to the one on a laptop. So, how does a user access their account on a laptop if they created the account on a mobile phone? </p><p>For multi-device passwordless authentication we created a proof-of-concept flow. Our solution uses a secure environment already shared on all devices: email. A secure link sent through email connects the laptop &amp; mobile phone. No typing required at all. Let’s explore this flow together.</p><h3 id="under-the-hood">Under the hood</h3><p>For most server side languages, there’s a library available that does the heavy lifting around WebAuthn by implementing FIDO2. We went with <a href="https://github.com/abergs/fido2-net-lib">abergs/fido2-net-lib</a> on .NET core. The juicy part is in expanding the user interaction flow. Let’s start with registration. </p><p>A user enters a desired username (a valid email in our case), presses the register button and is presented with a biometric confirmation modal to resolve a generated challenge that is sent by the server. When the user successfully authenticates with their biometric info, an account is created for that user.</p><p>During account creation, these steps are executed:</p><ol><li>Server sends challenge</li><li>Device requests biometric confirmation</li><li>User scans finger</li><li>Device creates public + private key</li><li>Device sends public key as response</li><li>Server creates user account associated to that public key</li></ol><p>When a user later wants to login to the website, they enter their username (email) again and then are presented with a biometric confirmation modal to resolve a generated challenge. This time the server checks if the response (that the browser generates based on the given challenge and private key) matches the user with the given email address. If that’s the case, the user is logged in.</p><p>During user login, these steps are executed:</p><ol><li>Server sends challenge</li><li>Device requests biometric confirmation</li><li>User scans finger</li><li>Device signs challenge with private key</li><li>Device sends response to server</li><li>Server verifies response with public key</li></ol><p>On a technical level this is not too different compared to a regular password login, if you would hash and salt the password before sending it over. The biggest difference is we’re not asking the user to authenticate with something that needs to be remembered.</p><h3 id="implementing-multi-device-sign-in">Implementing multi-device sign-in</h3><p>Logging in with a platform authenticator only works if the local device has credentials stored for this website. The first step in making multi-device possible is by detecting if the device has credentials for the current website user account or not. If it doesn’t, the Web Authentication API will throw an error. This allows us to ask the user if they want to add this device to their account.</p><figure><pre><code>let credentials;
try {
  credentials = await navigator.credentials.get(optionsObject);
} catch (err) {
  // Show modal to ask if the user wants to add this device to their account
  confirmAddDevice();
}</code></pre><figcaption>Detect if the device platform authenticator has known credentials</figcaption></figure><p>This is the hook that allows us to extend the user experience. For our take on a possible UX flow for passwordless multi-device authentication we came up with the diagram below. Highlighted in blue is the email confirmation flow that we found missing in existing implementations of logging in without a password. Remember that, while this diagram may seem daunting at first, all the parts in black are taken care of by WebAuthn and the FIDO2 library. Luckily that also is the hardest and most boring part.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vwtyGrDkcChPhUrxucOV-6IbyzezykWKK-NI_KEF4px3Ke-uGunrfKZXd34gd0z5R0tfd1-xEiidbgTCVbKK09qdhKiW6ezDYaUg_keR61DoGJmJR1Xs4vXokVCnSzWAD2fSwFFG"><figcaption>Expand the platform authenticator flow to support multiple devices</figcaption></figure><p>Our flow starts when the user wants to sign in to their existing account from an unknown device. The flow starts similar to the regular login flow. However, we can now detect when the device has no credentials stored for this website.</p><p>Interaction wise this is where things get interesting. We can let the user know that this is an unknown account that is being attempted to sign in to. But just showing an error is a dead path. A user expects an immediate follow-up action to add this device to the account.</p><p>In our case we show a modal to ask the user if they want to add the new device:</p><figure><pre><code>async function confirmAddDevice() {
  const confirm = confirm('Do you want to add this device to your account?');
  if (!confirm) {
    // User denied the confirm modal, do nothing
    return;
  }

  try {
    await fetch('/api/add-device', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: {
        email: this.email
      }
    });

    alert('Email sent, click the link in the mail to continue the process.')
  } catch {
    alert('Could not send an email, please try again later.')
  }
}</code></pre><figcaption>Ask the user if they want to add the device to their account</figcaption></figure><p>When the user confirms the action, the client sends a request to the server. Luckily we know how to securely contact the user because they registered with their email as username. The server then sends an email that allows the user to register their device.</p><figure><pre><code>[HttpPost]
[Route("/add-device")]
public async Task&lt;JsonResult&gt; AddDevice([FromBody] string email)
{
  var user = Storage.GetUser(email);
  if(user == null) {
    return NotFound();
  }

  var otp = Storage.GenerateAndStoreOneTimePasswordForUser(user);

  var response = await SendAddDeviceEmail(user, otp);
  return Json(response);
}</code></pre><figcaption>Send an email to the user</figcaption></figure><p>By clicking the link in the email, the user confirms this device may be added to their account. The flow is just like with the first device, only adding a one time password (OTP) in the form of a link in an email. The OTP allows the new device to be securely linked to the existing account. This is done by the server, which checks if the OTP matches the one generated for the user, and stores the challenge response as an additional device linked to the account.</p><p>This way, minimal user input is required to allow multi-device passwordless authentication on the web. On top of that, we leverage existing patterns for account validation (through email) that users are already used to on the web.</p><h3 id="outro">Outro</h3><p>We are very excited to work towards a more secure and effortless web, and can’t wait to use this in production. What’s your opinion on passwordless authentication, and how should multi-device usage be addressed? We would love to hear your ideas and get to know your implementations.</p><hr><p><em>Do you love figuring out new features like multi-device passwordless authentication?

    <div id="post-body">
        <p>&lt;rant&gt;Two years ago I sat in on a security meeting. The subject was protecting the code and associated websites from attack.</p><p>"I'd just attack the npm packaging system, introducing subtle changes in several that would work together to do whatever I wanted."</p><p>All I got was blank stares, and this was from professionals. From <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/researcher-hacks-over-35-tech-firms-in-novel-supply-chain-attack">this week's reading</a>:</p><blockquote>Unlike <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malicious-npm-project-steals-discord-accounts-browser-info/">traditional typosquatting attacks</a> that rely on social engineering tactics or the victim misspelling a package name, this particular supply chain attack is more sophisticated as it needed no action by the victim, who automatically received the malicious packages.<p>This is because the attack leveraged a unique design flaw of the open-source ecosystems called <strong>dependency confusion.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Even using things like Test-Driven Development, programmers can only reason about a small part of the code in front of him in the IDE. (In fact, one of the reasons TDD is so successful is because programmers have no idea at how much they suck at actually understanding what they're doing).</p><p>From a recent study:</p><figure><img src="https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/2021/02/EsXlJyCXYAAD9x7.png" alt="" srcset="https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/EsXlJyCXYAAD9x7.png 600w, https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/EsXlJyCXYAAD9x7.png 1000w, https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/EsXlJyCXYAAD9x7.png 1600w, https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/2021/02/EsXlJyCXYAAD9x7.png 1890w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Here's the takeaway graphic:</p><figure><img src="https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/2021/02/2021-02-11_9-41-46.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/2021-02-11_9-41-46.jpg 600w, https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/2021/02/2021-02-11_9-41-46.jpg 678w"></figure><p>Note: this result is seeking out a mean, regular coders writing regular code. Your mileage may vary.</p><p>Why is this? Let's take two code samples:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>echo Hello World
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>#include &lt;cstdio&gt;

int main()
{
    printf("hello from %s!\n", "HelloWorld");
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>In the first example, how many symbols is the programmer manipulating to reach their goal? Only one, "echo" In the second example, how many symbols are being manipulated?</p><p>I counted seven, but I wasn't trying to be strict.</p><p>What do these seven involve? There's namespaces, libraries, standard function signatures, string substitution, OS return values, and so on.</p><p>Do any of these matter to the new C# programmer? Of course not! That's why it's called "Hello World". You're supposed to be able to type in a few symbols and start doing something useful right away.</p><p>The waters get murky very quickly after that. Let's say your boss sends you an email:</p><p>"Jenkins, add the cover sheet to all of those TPS reports"</p><p>Something goes wrong. The boss is unhappy. You two have a conversation about what you did that was mistaken.</p><p>Suppose instead you're looking at the following code:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>WorkingStack.Reports.AddSheet(cover);
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The boss is mad because it's not working right.</p><p>You can certainly go into the boss's office and have that same conversation, just this time over code instead of an email. <em>In fact, that's what you have to do</em>. Without a bunch more source code, what the hell does that C# code do, anyway? You don't know. It says it does the same thing as the boss wanted, but for all you know it's mailing off your tax returns to Russian hackers.</p><p>Most of modern programming is spent creating and consuming fake abstractions that are much more leaky and buggy than we'd like admit. In fact, it's grown far, far beyond our ability to reason about. It's magic. We spend a lot of time pretending that this isn't the case, then cursing when reality rears its ugly head again.</p><p>When I was writing <a href="https://leanpub.com/info-ops2">my second book</a>, I had to address this problem because reasoning about code and controlling complexity is the number one problem in software development today. It's the reason we have buildings full of hundreds of developers wasting a lot of time and money. Our incentives are wrong.</p><p>The best thing to look for in any professional, doctor, lawyer, coder, etc is their ability to not engage with a problem, instead solving it in a simple and non-intrusive way. The worst behavior from professionals are the folks who are going to do a lot of work no matter what. These guys look busy, and they’re deep in a bunch of technically wonky stuff that nobody understands, so naturally they look like they know what they’re doing and are doing a good job. The guy who shows up in flip-flops and after a five-minute conversation solves your problem? He’s just some smart eleck showman, probably a con man.</p><p>We don’t teach coders the one skill they need most of all: adding incremental complexity as-needed. Nobody talks about choosing what to add and why. Nobody talks about ways to understand you’ve gone too far (except for a few folks like me. Apologies for the shameless plug.)</p><p>For some odd reason, discussions on frameworks and complexity always devolve into some version of “Dang kids!” vs. “Talentless luddite!” As many people have pointed out, not only do we not teach or talk about incremental complexity, if you don’t have the appropriate buzzwords in your CV, you don’t get hired. So BigCorps naturally end up with scads of people who did well on scads of tech that somebody decide they had to use/learn but nobody very good at actually making things happen.</p><p>This can't continue, and I want to do my part in making it end. The answer I came up is something I call it <strong>Code Cognitive Load (CCL)</strong>. It's the amount of risk you take on as a programmer looking at any piece of code to manipulate it, whether coding fresh or doing maintenance on existing code.</p><ol><li>It's scoped first by method/function and then by compilation unit. There's no other scoping (namespace, class, module, etc.)</li><li>To compute, you add up four things: symbols you are required to look at to do your work, exceptions that using those symbols may throw, &nbsp;any editable code underneath that you may have to read or write for those symbols to work, and exceptions that code may throw</li></ol><p>You can see for the first Hello World example, there's only one symbol, echo, and there's only one general type of exception, and that's related to system resources. For the second example, the count easily goes into the dozens.</p><p>Why is this related to the security problem I led off with? Because if you have code you can't reason about, you don't just have a risk for bugs, it's a security risk too. The code doesn't care whether it's busy screwing up your beautiful solution or hacking your local network. You can't reason about it. Period. That's the problem. It's doing whatever it's coded to do.</p><p>Do npm packages count as "editable code underneath that I have to read or write for these symbols to work"? Sure, if you're downloading code and compiling it, you may have to edit it. It's a risk. If you're just hotlinking to a dll or something, that's different. If you're using precompiled code, whatever you've got, you've got. It may be buggy as hell and it may do nasty things that make you sad and drink by yourself late at night, but it's not a complexity issue, it's some other kind of issue, security, performance, and so on. Don't confuse them. You address and work with the problems of that precompiled library in a totally different way than you would with code you may one day have to plow through.</p><p>Code Cogntivie Load (CCL) is not a good/bad metric. It's a measure of the risk in complexity you're assuming to do whatever work you have to do. Some problems may naturally require a great deal of complexity risk. Others not so much. That's your call, not mine.</p><p>The point is that you're measuring it, instead of just ignoring it until something goes wrong. Is your solution doing mostly the same thing but your CCL is going through the roof? You're most likely doing something wrong, since your code's value is staying the same while your coding risk is dramatically increasing. </p><p>There's no way of knowing whether code is appropriately complex or not, but we can (and should) measure how much <em>complexity risk</em> we're taking on ourselves and our downstream maintenance workers.</p><p>This will change the way you code and the way you think about coding. Good. Looking at the software landscape today, things need changing.</p><p>&lt;/rant&gt;</p>    </div>

                    <p>On December 1st, 2020, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/want-more-postgresql-you-just-might-like-babelfish/">Amazon AWS announced Babelfish</a>. Babelfish “<em>adds an endpoint to PostgreSQL that understands the SQL Server wire protocol Tabular Data Stream (TDS), as well as commonly used T-SQL commands used by SQL Server. Support for T-SQL includes elements such as the SQL dialect, cursors, catalog views, data types, triggers, stored procedures, and functions</em>”. Wow. <strong>SQL Server wire and application compatibility for PostgreSQL!</strong></p>
<p>What this means is that Babelfish will be able to “impersonate” a SQL Server database. Applications may be able to run unchanged, believing that they are connecting to SQL Server, when they will actually be connecting to PostgreSQL-Babelfish.</p>
<p>Surely, compatibility will not be 100% at the beginning. But it will keep improving, and <strong>as long as it provides enough compatibility for a nice set of applications to run unchanged on Babelfish, it will open the door to migrations and replacing SQL Servers with Babelfish</strong>. This is very good news for the PostgreSQL Community!</p>
<h2 id="brief-analysis-on-postgresql-popularity">Brief analysis on PostgreSQL popularity</h2>
<p><a href="https://db-engines.com/en/blog_post/85">PostgreSQL has been named (again) database of the year 2020</a>. This award is given based on “<em>DBMSs sorted by how much they managed to increase their popularity in 2020</em>”, which means that <strong>PostgreSQL was the database that grew the most in popularity in 2020</strong>. <strong>But in absolute terms, PostgreSQL’s popularity is still way behind that of Oracle, MySQL and SQL Server</strong>. Let’s analyze <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/ranking_trend">db-engines popularity trend chart</a> for the Top4 DBMS, on a linear scale (db-engines presents results on a logarithmic scale):</p>
<p><img src="https://postgresql.fund/img/dbengines_popularity_ranking-linear-900.png" alt="DB-engines popularity ranking - linear scale"></p>
<p>The trends for the last 8 years are clear: Oracle and SQL Server are constantly declining in popularity; MySQL is slightly declining; and PostgreSQL is clearly growing in popularity. But while PostgreSQL almost tripled in popularity in these eight years, it is still far behind the other three.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL became the database of 2020 because its popularity grew the most in the last year. The other three mentioned databases declined in popularity during 2020. If we assume the same rate of change in popularity will continue for the upcoming years, by 2025 PostgreSQL would still remain in the 4th place, albeit close to SQL Server. It won’t overtake SQL Server until 2026, and by 2030 PostgreSQL would still lag behind Oracle and MySQL.</p>

<p>How is this analysis related to Babelfish? <strong>Babelfish opens the door to new users, new markets, new opportunities. <strong>Babelfish may bump PostgreSQL’s popularity further, targeting use cases that either PostgreSQL is not able to reach today; or can only reach via complex technology migrations.</strong> Babelfish could be one of the many potential boosts that PostgreSQL needs in order to become a more universally used database</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="to-fork-or-not-to-fork-thats-the-question">To fork, or not to fork, that’s the question</h2>
<p>In their announcement, AWS said that “<em>We are open sourcing Babelfish in 2021. […] We are releasing Babelfish under the Apache 2.0 license. We invite others to become active in the project, and we will see it as a sign of success when developers outside of AWS become committers or maintainers. You can help by adding or extending Babelfish functionality, submitting feature requests, working on documentation, and contributing test cases</em>”. They also mentioned the code will be published on GitHub.</p>
<p><strong>At the time Babelfish will be published, it will likely require changes to PostgreSQL to enable Babelfish to be an extension</strong>. Some people may call that a “fork” of PostgreSQL, and others may call it a “development branch”. The difference between the two will only be clear over time. Note that PostgreSQL development model doesn’t use feature branches, and in my opinion it’s a great model –but this is an entirely different topic. It is really appreciated that AWS is releasing the code as open source, and under a permissive license (that should be compatible with PostgreSQL’s). <strong>If AWS developers work with the PostgreSQL Community to get the necessary changes merged into PostgreSQL core, then it would have been a development branch, and not a fork. This is something that the PostgreSQL Community and all parties involved need to figure out</strong>.</p>
<p>On January 25th, Amazon AWS made a first move. In an <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/CAGBW59d5SjLyJLt-jwNv%2BoP6esbD8SCB%3D%3D%3D11WVe5%3DdOHLQ5wQ%40mail.gmail.com">email to PostgreSQL’s hackers mailing list</a>, Jan Wieck, a well-known Postgres-er, proposed to start discussing the implementation of protocol hooks. These hooks would enable to implement SQL Server’s protocol as an extension, rather than a fork.</p>
<p>Protocol hooks are, possibly, not the only hooks or modifications to PostgreSQL core that would be required to integrate the whole Babelfish project. With those changes to the core most of the Babelfish code could possibly be integrated in core as an extension(s). I cannot estimate the complexity of these core changes. But I believe that it would be a worthwhile effort, an effort that may further increase PostgreSQL outreach.</p>
<p>Only very recently (Feb 10th, 11th) some initial, very interesting, discussion around this proposal has started (including a very interesting offer to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/CADUqk8UndFi7WHVNZscs4ZCk37_2aBUw-K32QA7sQd_3cJ%2Bqng%40mail.gmail.com">open source MySQL protocol compatibility for Postgres!</a>). It’s understandable, it’s a very busy time for PostgreSQL hackers (the last Commitfest for feature inclusion into PostgreSQL 14 is ongoing). But Babelfish was already announced more than two months ago; and it could be published anytime. I believe we need to start a deeper conversation about Postgres-Babelfish integration sooner than later. And what is being discussed so far are mainly technical considerations around the integration of one of the possibly several integration points that may be required. <strong>I’d love to also have a strategic discussion, where the Community would address, from a leadership perspective, what would be the plans for integrating, or not, Babelfish</strong>. <strong>Is Babelfish the Elephant in the Room?</strong> Probably not anymore, but I anyway hope this post will help, at the very least, to spark the strategic discussion.</p>
<p>What is the alternative? What will happen if PostgreSQL would not implement such hooks or will not pursue understanding with AWS, for the common benefit, and help Babelfish and PostgreSQL cooperate and allow for code bases integration?</p>
<p><strong>Under this scenario, AWS will probably have to keep Babelfish as a fork</strong>. For one, AWS already keeps Aurora as a fork, even though it’s an internal one. Given AWS’ well-known customer obsession and that AWS doesn’t kill services that they started offering, I think that if given no other chance they will keep Babelfish as a separate fork, getting its own share of features and contributors. Surely AWS knows that maintaining a fork is expensive. And I believe they have no intention to have it as a fork (otherwise, they won’t be publishing it as open source). So there will be serious intentions and efforts to merge it into PostgreSQL, for the benefit of all. But the recent Elastic case has demonstrated that AWS is committed to the open source software that is part of their managed services, and are willing to step up with a lot of resources when they are required to continue serving their customers. Apparently AWS has around 200 open job positions (!!) for developers working on Elasticsearch. Surely they can do the same for Babelfish, especially given that RDS Postgres/Aurora/Babelfish is probably a much larger business for them than Elastic.</p>
<h2 id="on-protocol-hooks">On protocol hooks</h2>
<p>Jan also argued that “<em>Creating the necessary infrastructure in the postmaster and backend will open up more possibilities, that are not tied to our compatibility efforts. Possible use cases for wire protocol extensibility include the development of a completely new, not backwards compatible PostgreSQL protocol or extending the existing wire protocol</em>”. I cannot agree more. This effort not only benefits the Babelfish integration; but also opens the door for new PostgreSQL protocols.</p>
<p>The current PostgreSQL protocol (v3) <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/7.4/release-7-4.html">has been in use since PostgreSQL 7.4</a>, released in 2003. It works well, and has spun the broadest possible set of drivers, tools and even compatible databases that use it (like CockroachDB, Crate.io or NoisePage, for example). But it also has some limitations and well-known problems. There is an entry in PostgreSQL “TODO” about <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Todo#Wire_Protocol_Changes_.2F_v4_Protocol">proposed changes for an eventual v4 version of the protocol</a>. I also participated in another <a href="https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/blob/95ba7b261e39754674c5817695ae5ebf9a341fae/backend_protocol_v4_wanted_features.md">“brain dump” on v4 proposed features</a>. But despite much talk, v4 has not happened and there’s no ongoing effort to make it happen. v3 is to stay for long.</p>
<p>Why is that, why can’t the protocol evolve? Have a look at <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/CD5C1525-8B2C-4986-87F0-B1CB3B52ACA7%40wa-research.ch">this thread</a>, where a proposal to implement an HTTP protocol for PostgreSQL was made. Other than the proposal about HTTP itself –which has its own merits, and is a topic that I believe should definitely be discussed again–, the general sentiment was that <strong>any new protocol would have to provide all the features that the current protocol has, work for every use case, do not disrupt existing drivers or provide good means for driver rewrites; and do it significantly better than the current one</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="the-innovators-dilemma">The Innovator’s Dilemma</h2>
<p>I don’t have an MBA, but this to me is a clear case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma">The Innovator’s Dilemma</a>. PostgreSQL protocol v3 is the incumbent, and protocol v4 and/or other protocols like HTTP are the potential disruptive innovators. In what looks like a perfect match for Christensen’s book, a disruptive protocol innovation “<em>would not initially satisfy the demands of even the high end of the market</em>”. In other words, initial versions of these protocols should not target feature parity with the incumbent. They should rather focus on doing the basics, but much better, with a compelling higher value proposition.</p>
<p>Eventually, these protocols “<em>will surpass sustaining technologies</em>” and may end up replacing the current v3 protocol. This was very well explained by Prof. Clayton and is represented on his famous graph comparing the product …</p></div></div></div></div></section></div>

<p>This article is my attempt to summarise common technical interview process steps and to collect in one place some useful insights from recruiters that they normally send to applicants before the interviews. This is not a comprehensive guide of the interview process and the actual interview steps may vary from company to company.</p>

<p>The common technical interview process consists of three main steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Phone interview with recruiter</strong> when you’ll be ask to tell about your experience and explain your motivation.</li>
<li><strong>Technical phone interview</strong> where you’ll be asked to solve some tech problems in real time.</li>
<li><strong>On-site (in-person) interview</strong> in company’s office when you’ll be asked to solve technical and system design problems as well as to answer some behavioural questions.</li>

<p>All interview steps are mainly consists of three following building blocks:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Problem solving.</strong> The main focus here is your ability to solve technical problems by applying different algorithmic approaches and data structures.</li>
<li><strong>System design.</strong> This one is about your ability to combine many pieces (frameworks, approaches, databases, micro-services) and design a system as a whole that will successfully solve certain tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Behavioural questions</strong> that are focused on your experience, motivations, leadership and soft skills.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s move on and touch every of these 6 aspects of the interview process.</p>

<p>Recruiter will introduce himself and give you more details about the company and projects you might be working on. You’ll be asked to introduce you and explain what was your responsibility on the previous projects.</p>
<p>Normally only things you did during the last 1–3 years matters. So focus on your latest achievements and responsibilities.</p>
<p>Introduce your side-projects, open-source projects and production projects from your latest workplace.</p>
<p>It will be done by means of telephone.</p>
<p>Things to remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get familiar with the job description and prepare your questions regarding the job.</li>
<li>Prepare a short introduction of yourself in the context of your profile, professional past, qualifications and education.</li>
<li>Use specific examples. The strongest examples are work based examples, but you can also use study or personal examples.</li>
<li>If you haven’t understood the interviewer’s question, ask them to repeat it or explain it further.</li>
<li>Learn about the company, be passioned about the company’s product (about what company is doing).</li>
<li>Feel free to ask any questions you have about the role or company in general.</li>
</ul>
<p>Explain yours experience examples in a clear manner. Using the STAR technique will help you:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>SITUATION/TASK</em> — Describe the situation/task you faced and the context of the story.</li>
<li><em>ACTION</em> — What actions did you take?</li>
<li><em>RESULTS</em> — How did you measure success for this project? What results did you achieve?</li>

<p>During the phone interview you’ll have a coding exercise (or task to develop something online).</p>
<p>The call will be 45–60 minutes long.</p>
<p>Some interviews will include 2 people. Don’t worry — one will be there purely for training purposes.</p>
<p>You will need access to a webcam. Wired internet and headphones are recommended but not essential. Your computer may require a plug-in install, so make sure you test the link that will be provided to you by recruiter with enough time before your call. Make sure to take the call in a calm environment.</p>
<p>You might be asked to install and/or use special programs and service like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/chime/">Amazon Chime</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bluejeans.com/">BlueJeans</a></li>
<li><a href="https://hangouts.google.com/">Hangouts</a></li>
<li><a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom.us</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.skype.com/en/">Skype</a></li>
<li><a href="https://coderpad.io/">CoderPad</a> or others</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What to expect during the interview:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>45 mins initial interview with 1–2 coding questions using a whiteboard (if on site) or laptop and a service similar to CoderPad (if remote).</li>
<li>You will be tested on your problem solving and core CS fundamental skills (theory, algorithms, data structures, design patterns, recursions, binary tree questions, Fibonacci series etc.)</li>
<li>You will need to think of an efficient, optimised and bug-free solution to code up quickly and concisely in whatever language you code best in.</li>
<li>Keep it simple! If you think it’s obvious, it probably is. Start with a simple solution, and think about making it more efficient afterwards.</li>

<p>For the on-site, you generally have 4 to 5 interviews — at least 2 strictly focused on coding, 1 on design, and 1 on conversation/coding. So basically all three building blocks described at the beginning of the chapter will be included.</p>
<p>There will be a 45-minute lunch to break up your day — the lunch will most likely be with one of the engineers. Feel free to be very candid with the engineer — they will not be providing feedback, but are there to answer any questions/concerns you may not have asked during your interview.</p>

<p><strong>General tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explain</strong> — Interviewers want to understand how you think, so explain your thought process and decision making throughout the interview. Remember they are not only evaluating your technical ability, but also how you solve problems. Explicitly state and check assumptions with your interviewer to ensure they are reasonable.</li>
<li><strong>​Clarify</strong> — Many questions will be deliberately open-ended to provide insight into what categories and information you value within the technological puzzle. Interviewers are looking to see how you engage with the problem and your primary method for solving it. Be sure to talk
through your thought process and feel free to ask specific questions if you need clarification.</li>
<li><strong>Improve</strong> — Think about ways to improve the solution you present. It’s worthwhile to think out loud about your initial thoughts to a question. In many cases, your first answer may need some refining and further explanation. If necessary, start with the brute force solution and improve
on it — just let the interviewer know that’s what you’re doing and why.</li>
<li><strong>Practice</strong> — You won’t have access to an IDE or compiler during the interview so practice writing code on paper or a whiteboard. Be sure to test your code and ensure it’s easily readable without bugs. Don’t stress about small syntactical errors like which substring to use for a given method (e.g. start, end or start, length) — just pick one and let your interviewer know.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="before-the-interview">Before the interview<a href="#before-the-interview" aria-label="before the interview permalink"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Practice! Practice! Practice!</strong></p>
<p>Put yourself under time constraints as speed is important in the interview.</p>
<p><strong>Problems examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Write the code to print the first element of each “row” of a binary tree.</li>
<li>Implement tic-tac-toe.</li>
<li>Write the code to show the number and type of permutations of a given string.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may use the following services to get more problems examples and possible solutions:</p>

</ul>
<p>You might also want to read <a href="http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/">Cracking the coding interview book</a> that will help you to prepare for coding interviews similar to what you will be solving throughout the interview process.</p>
<p><strong>Topics to cover:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coding</strong> — You should know at least one programming language really well, preferably C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, Go, or C. You will be expected to know APIs, Object Oriented Design and Programming, how to test your code, as well as come up with corner cases and edge cases for code. Note that interviewers will focus on conceptual understanding rather than memorisation.</li>
<li><strong>Algorithms</strong> — Approach the problem with both bottom-up and top-down algorithms. You will be expected to know the complexity of an algorithm and how you can improve/change it. Algorithms that are used to solve problems include sorting (plus searching and binary search), divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming/memoization, greediness, recursion or algorithms linked to a specific data structure. Know Big-O notations (e.g. run time) and be ready to discuss complex algorithms like Dijkstra and A*. Knowing the runtimes, theoretical limitations, and basic implementation strategies of different classes of algorithms is more important than memorising the specific details of any given algorithm.</li>
<li><strong>Sorting</strong> — Be familiar with common sorting functions and on what kind of input data they’re efficient on or not. Think about efficiency means in terms of runtime and space used. For example, in exceptional cases insertion-sort or radix-sort are much better than the generic QuickSort/MergeSort/HeapSort answers.</li>
<li><strong>Data structures</strong> — You should study up on as many data structures as possible. Data structures most frequently used are arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash-sets, hash-maps, hash-tables, dictionary, trees and binary trees, heaps and graphs. You should know the data structure inside out, and what algorithms tend to go along with each data structure.</li>
<li><strong>Mathematics</strong> — Some interviewers ask basic discrete math questions. Spend some time before the interview refreshing your memory on (or teaching yourself) the essentials of elementary probability theory and combinatorics. You should be familiar with n-choose-k problems and their ilk.</li>
<li><strong>Graphs</strong> — Consider if a problem can be applied with graph algorithms like distance, search, connectivity, cycle-detection, etc. There are three basic ways to represent a graph in memory (objects and pointers, matrix, and adjacency list) — familiarize yourself with each representation and its pros and cons. You should know the basic graph traversal algorithms, breadth-first search and depth-first search. Know their computational complexity, their tradeoffs …</li></ul></div></div>

<p>
Much has been written about what makes for good design. All of it is fiercely debated by designers, who would rather find ways to exclude one another than celebrate commonality.
</p>
<p>
Rather than write yet another forgettable entry into the insufferable oeuvre of <i>This-Not-That</i>, I thought I’d just cut to the chase and focus on the <i>Not-That</i>.
</p>
<p>
Here are seven kinds of bad design. There are certainly more.
</p>
<h2>
Design made in ignorance of the damage it does is not good design.
</h2>
<p>
In 2021 we have enough information readily available to exhaustively vet ideas, measure costs, run scenarios, and project outcomes. We frequently choose to skip over most of these activities because they take time and cost money. But I suspect that the more salient reason we skip them is because testing an <i>idea</i> is too risky to the <i>ideologue</i>.
</p>
<p>
Entire systems of business are constructed to protect the idea-havers from the idea-deliverers — to insulate them from the questions and concerns that those most acquainted with how things work and how people use them have as soon as they receive their orders.
</p>
<p>
Insulation is the enemy of empathy. If you can’t access the impact of your ideas, then you will never understand the damage they can do. But that makes you no less responsible. There is no plausible deniability in good design.
</p>
<h2>
Design that takes inequalities for granted is not good design.
</h2>
<p>
Many of the products being made now that are the most nutritious, least processed, least harmful to the environment, least reliant upon the exploitation of others, and offer the most self-sufficiency to consumers are also the most expensive. The wealthy can afford them, and they live healthier and more comfortable lives as a result. They stay wealthy.
</p>
<p>
The products that are the most mass-produceable, widely available, and least expensive are those that are made from materials of lower quality, by workers with fewer rights, under poorer conditions, and for less pay. The poor can afford them, but they pay the difference in infirmity. They stay poor.
</p>
<p>
In a capitalist system, leading-edge products always start out more expensive. As they become more accepted and integrated in society, they can be produced at a lower price and be made available to more people. We want to believe that through this system, a certain standard of living can eventually be reached by all. One must wonder why that hasn’t happened yet.
</p>
<p>
Also in a capitalist system, what first succeeds is what the wealthy want. And yet, one evergreen desire of the wealthy is to <i>remain</i> wealthy. Wealth itself is a slippery concept; it means abundance and prosperity. While that could be interpreted to mean having more than one needs, it’s often taken as a comparison — to have more than <i>someone else</i>.
</p>
<p>
If you make something that widens the gap between those who already have a lot and those that never had much, you have not done good design.
</p>
<h2>
Design with short-term goals that can only exist by ignoring long-term effects is not good design.
</h2>
<p>
Planned obsolescence robs from the future to pay for the present. Why do we accept that modern devices are made with such lopsided priorities — thinness over battery life, beauty over resilience — which ensure our experience of them is one of rapidly diminishing returns? Why do buy the next thing sooner than our current one was promised to last? How many times must we do that before we realize the con?
</p>
<p>
Our own use cases are both hardly the problem and also the cause of everything. We pay too much and too often for things that could last longer. It’s wasteful and yet very on-brand for America. But how long must the acres of e-waste in Africa burn before we insist that our technology last a just little longer? Not just for our sake, but for those who barely eke out a living scavenging the toxic ash for resealable scrap. With growing evidence of the catastrophic environmental and human costs of digital devices — more on ecology in a moment — making temporary objects for perpetual users is deeply cruel.
</p>
<p>
If you make something to last only as long as the development phase for the next thing, you have not done good design.
</p>
<h2>
Design that ignores available data is not good design.
</h2>
<p>
Data show that cigarettes are addictive and eventually kill. Cigarette makers knew this decades before most everyone else and hid the data so that it would remain easy for them to sell their poison. Thus, there is no such thing as good design of a cigarette, its packaging, or any other accoutrement of its brand. Anything that makes it easier or more likely that anyone purchase or smoke a cigarette is bad. It may be good that one is free to smoke, but that doesn’t make smoking good for anyone.
</p>
<p>
Cigarettes, of course, are too easy a target. Many other things with much more sterling reputations are presently harmful to people. The data are persuasive of that yet, somehow, not persuasive enough to stop people from making or using these things. Some of them aren’t <i>things</i> at all, nor are they as easily avoided as a cigarette. Some of them are services that are so enmeshed in our social fabric that to avoid them can cost a person valuable relationships and opportunities. But when it is shown that these things manipulate people, make them less happy, distort the truth, spread lies, disrupt democracy, increase hate speech and violence, and generally make people less safe — when data has been gathered and disseminated to clearly show each of these effects — there is no good design of such a thing.
</p>
<p>
And if you make something that worsens available data, you have not done good design. You’ve participated in destruction.
</p>
<h2>
Design that produces something easily thrown away but not easily salvaged is not good design.
</h2>
<p>
It may be cheaper to make things out of older, established materials using older, established production processes and facilities than it is to use something new. But if that old stuff and those old ways aren’t as good for the world, how much longer does that calculation favor anyone?
</p>
<p>
How many more years do we have to churn out styrofoam? How many more years do we have to pretend to recycle plastic? How many more one-time use containers will we make? How strange it is that we willingly make things to be used for mere moments and then to rot exponentially longer in the same soil from which we draw food. That plastic cup you drank from for 15 minutes will take 450 years to break down. And when it does, it’s actually still there. It just doesn’t look like a cup anymore. But every single chemical molecule remains, in the soil, in the water, in the plants, in the animals that ate them, in us.
</p>
<p>
There are better materials out there that are less harmful to produce and easier to re-use, but getting them to the same scale of production we’ve been used to will require investment and patience. A short-term cost of transitioning to better materials will lead to a long-term gain in a habitable world. And in working to make living here last longer, we might also train ourselves to expect things to last longer, too. Imagine that.
</p>
<h2>
Design that treats grifted information as proprietary material is not good design.
</h2>
<p>
It has often been said that if something is free, then you are the product. It turns out the situation is much more complicated because <i>you</i> are complicated.
</p>
<p>
“You,” to the data-grifter, are a multitude of facts. Some of them you willingly share. Some are gathered when you think no one is watching. And some are inferred by who you know and what the grifters know about them. Consent in this situation is cloudy. What, exactly, are you agreeing to share about yourself when you use a service? Few know.
</p>
<p>
Though the majority of Americans encounter privacy notices multiple times each week, only 22% say they read them all. Even fewer claim to understand what they’re reading. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-attitudes-and-experiences-with-privacy-policies-and-laws/" target="_blank">That’s a pretty bad state of affairs</a>. One would think that given such poor readership and comprehension of this incredibly important material, these friendly services would make a better effort to communicate it and gain true consent. But the companies that stand to gain the most by gathering information about you stand to lose the most if you actually know what the hell they’re up to. Why? Because whatever you get from them is just the worm they dangle into the pond. You’re the fish; their customers are the fish-eaters.
</p>
<p>
Beyond privacy, disclosure, and consent is ownership. Who owns your information? The question seems to provide the answer: you! It’s <i>your</i> information. But, virtually every service you use claims ownership over the information you provide. That, too, is buried within the virtually impenetrable wall of legal jargon that so many of us never read. That such agreements are written to repel exactly those for whom it is most consequential but designed to be so easily dismissible is what makes the grift a grift.
</p>
<p>
The value of just <i>my</i> name, age, height, weight, education, profession, ethnicity, affiliations, purchases, browsing history, sexual preferences, relationships, thoughts, feelings, and fears is hardly much. Few would buy such information; I would never even think to sell it. But the value of such a data profile for <i>millions</i> is astronomical. The power of being the one to sell it, even more staggering.
</p>
<p>
When you signed up for a place to post your thoughts and pictures, were you consenting to the consignment of your information and the creation of a Machiavellian, rat-king of an information machine against which almost no individual has leverage? When put that way, who on Earth would say “yes”?
</p>
<h2>
Design without philosophy and ethics is not good design.
</h2>
<p>
No idea exists alone. Every idea is the product of other, more foundational ideas. And those ideas, of course, were birthed by ideas that came before them. It’s ideas all the way down.
</p>
<p>
That, in a nutshell, is a theory of knowledge. Or, as the philosophers call it, epistemology. Everything we know is the result of beliefs about …</p></div></div>

<p><em>After I finished school in 2007 and later graduated from high school in 2012, I thought it was all over. I kind of swore that I’d never touch a textbook again. “Welcome world,” I said, “I’m ready and now I know everything!” Boy was I wrong. I learned the hard way that our complex and rapidly changing world increasingly demands adopting new skills. And what I’ve accumulated as knowledge during my time behind the desk was not even close to what was happening in the real world.</em> <em>Learning, not simply during the years associated with formal schooling, but across the lifespan seemed a must.</em></p>



<p>Mark Twain famously said, “I have never let my schooling interfere with my education.” More than 100 years later, that’s still the case – or at least it should be. We should not, let the material we study now, or years ago when we were in school, satisfy our appetite and our thirst for knowledge.</p>



<p>In our current setting, it’s extremely important to educate yourself and regularly expose yourself to various topics that are not covered by your school, and/or job, curricula. Simply digesting what your teacher shares or what your company is doing is not enough to stay afloat. You need a different point of view. Make unusual connections. Look for inspiration in topics that others might call crazy or insane.</p>



<p>If you’re a student reading this, you probably haven’t yet discovered that the information shared by your teacher is not enough to help you get a <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/bullshit-jobs/" target="_blank" aria-label="nice job (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">nice job</a> or <a href="https://durmonski.com/business/fewer-moving-parts/" target="_blank" aria-label="start a business (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">start a business</a>. If you have already dealt with the school bureaucracy, fought your way through countless exams and unusually not useful school practices, and you’re now a proud owner of a Job, congrats! You know how little our school system has given to us. You know, I hope, how little you know and how much is yet to be explored. Especially today, when things constantly change and where, as many modern authors state, “change is the only constant.”</p>



<p>Our complex and rapidly changing world creates a need, demands a need, for self-initiated and self-managed learning.</p>



<p>If you still don’t know how little you know, and how much you need to acquire to get a new job, keep your current one, or completely change directions, in this article, I’m going to share why it’s so damn important to become master of your own learning process. To become a sophisticated learner. To learn how to learn and to keep doing it till your very last day.</p>







<h2>What Does Self-Regulated Learning Mean?</h2>



<p>Self-regulation in the learning process is commonly related to formal education. We think that becoming better at learning is not for us if we’re not in school. “I graduated with honors. I don’t need to get better at learning,” you might think.</p>



<p>That may be true. I mean, yes, being your teacher’s favorite student is probably a thought that makes you feel all fuzzy and good. But the information you accumulated in school as I just elegantly pointed out, is not enough – it never was – to transform you into a blossoming individual.</p>



<p>A self-regulated learner is a person who is aware of what he’s consuming and actively working towards self-imposed goals to acquire more relevant information. In this case, relevant means things that are closely related to the interests and skills of that person. Or the interests and skills the person wants to acquire. In other words, self-improving, as banal it might sound.</p>



<p>To avoid interpreting what has just been mentioned as something dry and unimaginable, let us give an example:</p>



<p>So, for example, let’s say that you’re a professional photographer. You’re making a living taking pictures. You are good. You have regular clients. Your <a href="https://durmonski.com/private/using-social-media/" target="_blank" aria-label="Instagram (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> profile is widely known in your country. Yet, for how long you think this will last?</p>



<p>As stated, things are changing. And they are changing fast. Reportedly, video is becoming more and more popular. In this situation, if you want to get to the next level, you probably need to school yourself on shooting and later editing video. Then, probably, you need to figure out how to properly attune your clip to fit across the newly created social media channels. And then, you need to learn all the growth-hack techniques other online entrepreneurs so enthusiastically share on their profiles. </p>



<p>To put it differently, there is always something new to learn. But this is not always obvious. In most situations, we reach a certain level of expertise and we settle. We get comfortable. And the moment we get too cozy with what we know is the moment others get ahead.</p>



<p>Self-regulation means actively monitoring your learning process. Being mindful about how and from where to obtain, and master, new information. Settings goals and motivating yourself to expand your expertise.</p>



<p>Plainly, continuously asking yourself the following: “Is the thing I’m reading, watching right now, helping me get better at X?”</p>







<h2>Why is Self-Regulated Learning Important?</h2>



<p>To make things even more difficult, if we have to go back to the example of the photographer, the simple realization that one needs to learn new things is not enough to make him better. The person also needs to have a good learning process.</p>



<p>Something we’re not thought in school, sadly.</p>



<p>The school, the system that runs the school, doesn’t do much to teach us how to actually improve our learning skills. It’s presumed that we know how to learn and study. The material is handed to us and we are expected to know what to do with it.</p>



<p>Or as stated in a scientific paper about self-regulated learning, “There is an overwhelming assumption in our educational system that the most important thing to deliver to students is content.”<span id="easy-footnote-1-13224"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-13224" title="Self-Regulated Learning: Beliefs, Techniques, and Illusions &amp;#8211; <a href=&quot;https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-psych-113011-143823&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; aria-label=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot;>Annual Reviews</a>."><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>



<p>Besides sharing what is supposedly thought from teachers as great content, there is also a need to organize and remember that content. And today, in the 21st century, there is also the need to find great content. Since there is so much stuff out there, you need to know how to adequately sort the good from the clickbait-y.</p>



<p>Regrettably, schools are not actively teaching us about these things. We’re given a lecture. A paper with resources. Commonly also some sort of assignment. And that’s it. We need to figure how to best connect the pieces. But that’s not the worst of it. We’re also not though that these things also need to happen outside school premises – when we now have jobs and families. That after there is no longer a teacher who is monitoring your assignments and actually imposing them on you, that you should take his role and set assignments for yourself.</p>



<p>When we don’t know any of these things, they end in the graph unknown unknowns.<span id="easy-footnote-2-13224"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-13224" title="There are known knowns &amp;#8211; <a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; aria-label=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot;>WIKI</a>."><sup>2</sup></a></span> Or in other words, things we don’t know exist. Hence, we don’t do them. And since we don’t do them, we never get better at what we do.</p>



<p>Self-regulating your learning process involves creating your own curriculum – being both the teacher and the student. This involves seriously considering what you want to learn and how you need to approach this subject.</p>







<h2>What Are The Self-Regulated Learning Fundamentals?</h2>



<p>Intuitively, high-achievers know how to approach learning. Or they simply found the best way for them after years of trial and error. Others, in contrast, simply go with the flow and do the most obvious exercise when trying to learn something new: they consume the information in front of them, never actually looking for resources on their own, and hope that some of the facts will stick.</p>



<p>These are not the best strategies, though.</p>



<p>The point of becoming sophisticated as a learner requires knowing how to manage your own learning activities.</p>



<p>It requires planning and the process is guided by metacognition (thinking about thinking). Or in our case, thinking about how to learn better.</p>

<p>This is a deliberate thought process that one must consider before actually approaching anything new. In simple words, this means that you don’t just open Google and start endlessly browsing articles. You first ask yourself: “What do I want to learn?; Why do I want to learn this?” You set expectations and goals. You consider your weaknesses in the learning process and find resources that are most likely to appeal to your persona.</p>



<p>Instead of relying on the algorithms to show you great content, you approach things strategically – you search for great content based on your goal.</p>



<p>Here are the fundamentals to create your own learning process:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Establish a plan and find resources</strong>: The first requirement, sort to say, is asking yourself what do you want to learn and why. Then, figure out what sources you’ll use, and how you’ll find them, to learn the desired thing. And finally, set a learning schedule and form a plan that will help you along the way.</li><li><strong>Monitoring and maintenance of knowledge</strong>: This is often overlooked. You can’t expect to remember everything from your first attempt. You should monitor yourself and find gaps in your skills – your processes. Then, find new ways to approach things that are hard for you to understand. Additionally, since often learning something new requires retention of certain facts, writing down the most important things is also a must.</li><li><strong>Self-reflection and adapting</strong>: Getting a good grade in school feels awesome. Launching a product and making sales is amazing. But these things are just outcomes. Often, the results we get are a lot of times based on luck, not always dependent on what we did. That’s why it’s far more important to reflect on what you think you did that get you these results and why.</li></ul>



<p>Now, once we have the fundamentals, let’s expand this further…</p>







<h2>How to Best Approach Something New?</h2>



<p>To put all of the above into practice, let’s consider another following example:</p>



<p>You just graduated from school. And while you are relieved, you just realized that …</p></div></div></div>

<li>
<p>user, cpu, sys time</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><code>report.html</code> which contains a basic interactive UI.</p>

<p>To tweak settings, the following API is available:</p>

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>I don’t know how this should work.
I think I would be happy with a perf-based Linux-only implementation.
The <a href="https://github.com/jimblandy/perf-event">perf-event</a> crate by Jim Blandy (co-author of “Programming Rust”) is good.</p>
<p>Have I missed something?
Does this tool already exist?
Or is it impossible for some reason?</p>

<h2 id="0-what-is-active-listening-" data-kb-block="kb-adv-heading_2b06d7-a8"><strong>What is active listening?</strong></h2>
<p>Active listening is the ability to focus completely on a speaker, understand their message, comprehend the information and respond thoughtfully, in a relevant way. Compared to passive listening, this highly valued interpersonal communication skill ensures you’re able to engage with your peer and later recall specific details without needing information repeated. Your partner will feel cared for and listened to, which results in building genuine and honest relationships.</p>
<p>To practice active listening, you make a conscious effort to hear not only the words that another person is saying but, more importantly, the&nbsp;complete message&nbsp;being communicated, subtle hints and non-verbal messages included, such as tone, emphasis, facial expressions and body language.</p>
<p>Active listening is always neutral and nonjudgmental from the listener’s side.</p>
<p>Finally, to practice active listening, you turn an otherwise passive process into an interactive flow by techniques such as eye contact, asking follow-up questions and reflecting back what was said.<br></p>
<h2 id="1-why-is-active-listening-essential-in-a-work-environment-" data-kb-block="kb-adv-heading_14e87a-de"><strong>Why is active listening essential in a work environment?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>First and foremost, <strong>it helps you build trust</strong>. When people know they can speak freely to you without interruptions and judgment, they’ll be more likely to confide in you. This is especially helpful when meeting a new customer or business contact with whom you want to develop a long-term working relationship.</p>
<p><strong>It helps you build genuine and honest connections. </strong>Active listening helps others feel comfortable sharing information with you. When you demonstrate your willingness and ability to listen to what others have to say truly, people will be motivated to communicate with you on a regular basis. This can open up opportunities to collaborate with others, get work done quickly or start new projects. All of these things can help lead you to success in your career. As a manager, this skill is also essential to your success – in fact, the lack of it is <a href="https://ochronus.online/engineering-manager-4-ways-of-failure/#3-4-too-much-solving-not-enough-listening">one of the key ways to fail</a>.</p>
<p><strong>It helps you increase your knowledge and understanding of various topics. </strong>The best employees are always striving to learn something new and grow their knowledge base. Because active listening helps you retain information, it will also help you better understand new topics and remember what you’ve learned so you can apply it in the future.</p>
<p><strong>It helps you identify and solve problems. </strong>Actively listening to others will help you detect challenges and difficulties others face or problems within projects. The more quickly you’re able to spot these issues, you sooner you can find a solution or create a plan to address it.</p>
<h2 id="2-how-can-active-listening-be-beneficial-while-searching-for-a-job-" data-kb-block="kb-adv-heading_6339e7-8f"><p><strong>How can active listening be beneficial while searching for a job?</strong></p></h2>
<p>Active listening is beneficial throughout the whole process of searching for a job.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you look at job advertisements and research companies, you can look for clues that might help you learn more about the company before you apply. Don’t just look at the words, though. Try to identify the tone of the post. Does the job posting use formal language? Casual? Conversational? Does it use a lot of technical jargon or industry language? Does it seem frantic? All of these can help determine what the job and company are like and help you decide if you want to apply. Actively listen to the company website’s tone to learn more about the company culture. What images do they use? Are they stock photos, formal portraits, or candid images? Are there videos you can watch (and listen to!)? How formal or informal is the narrator? What do you find on social media? All of these clues can help you figure out if the company is the right fit for you.</p>

<p>Naturally, the best place to utilize your active listening skills is the interview. You gather much more information this way, both because of encouraging your interviewer to be more honest with you and asking clarifying and follow-up questions. Active listening can also boost your evaluation during and after an interview. More and more companies recognize that good communication skills are essential for job success and even company culture and are actively looking for it during interviews. Even if you interview at a company which does not focus on this, you will leave a good impression by being an active listener – you’ll seem more interested in the job than other candidates. It will be in general much more enjoyable for the interviewer to talk to you. Last but not least, actively listening to your interviewer, you’ll get a glimpse of what kind of communication standards are present in your target company and whether you’d enjoy working there.</p>

<h2 id="3-how-can-you-best-practice-active-listening-" data-kb-block="kb-adv-heading_3396a3-a4"><p><strong>How can you best practice active listening?</strong></p></h2>
<p>Active listening starts with the <strong>right intent</strong>. If you don’t actually care about what the other person wants to say it will be tough to listen genuinely. We are frequently rushing from meeting to meeting, and our minds are already on the next thing we need to do when talking to someone. Slowing down and taking some time (even a minute can help!) to refocus our attention and prepare right before the discussion starts is essential. If you know the topic in advance, think a bit about it while considering your peer’s context with regards to it. What is their potential goal with the conversation, what do they hope to get out of it? What mindset would that result in, and how could that influence the discussion? How can you best support them?</p>
<p><strong>Be curious</strong> about what the other person has to say. Actively work on putting your judgment aside and be neutral, even when what they say strikes a nerve. Giving feedback is generally not a part of active listening, it comes after that and only if the other person asked for it.</p>
<p>Giving <strong>verbal and non-verbal affirmations and cues</strong> is key so that your peer actually feels that you are listening to them.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t interrupt</strong> your partner while they are speaking. Use non-verbal cues to demonstrate that you’re following along.</p>
<p><strong>Shut down your internal dialogue</strong> – this both helps you focus and keeps you judgment-free.</p>
<p><strong>Be patien</strong>t with the other person – you might feel the discussion is dragging on but remember your role is to listen, not to enforce your agenda! On a related note, don’t abruptly change the subject until you’ve made sure your peer said what they wanted to about the topic at hand.</p>
<h3 id="4-what-are-some-verbal-ways-to-demonstrate-active-listening-" data-kb-block="kb-adv-heading_b430a5-b3">&nbsp;<p><strong>What are some verbal ways to demonstrate active listening?</strong></p></h3>
<p>A <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08934215.2011.610731" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2011 study</a> concluded that active listening was primarily associated with verbal social skills.</p>
<p>One of the most important techniques to verbally demonstrating active listening is paraphrasing. This is a form of reflecting on what you’ve heard by summarizing the message’s main points in your own words. When you do this, you show that you understand the message and you’re also giving a chance to your peer to clarify or expand it further. An example: “So you’re basically saying that our training process works in general, but could use some improvement, right?</p>
<p>Asking <strong>open-ended follow-up questions</strong> is equally important. Ask these questions in a way that demonstrates that you’ve gathered the essence of what your partner was saying and also guide them to share more or more in-depth information. This technique can be used together with paraphrasing. Open-ended questions are ones that cannot be answered with a simple “yes” or “no” but instead require your peer to elaborate. An example, building on the previous paragraph: “I understand you feel our training process could be improved – what changes would you like to see?”</p>
<p>Besides open-ended questions, you can ask more specific probing questions too. These questions drill deeper into topics or can be used to narrow down the scope of a subject that might be too broad to discuss in one setting. Example: “Could you elaborate a bit on how the sequencing of training sessions was unhelpful?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learn more about questions as a coaching technique here: <a href="https://ochronus.online/questions-vs-directions/">Coaching Questions vs. Giving Directions – Ochronus online</a></p>
<p><strong>Displaying empathy</strong> goes a long way in conversations and is key in active listening. Ensure your peer understands that you recognize their emotions and maybe even share their feelings. Go a step further with showing compassion which will help you connect with your partner and establish mutual trust. Example: “Going through that kind of an experience must have been hard for you; I’m really sorry!”</p>
<p>You can <strong>share similar experiences</strong> to show you deeply understand what your peer is talking about. It will also help build the relationship and – depending on the goal of the situation – can turn into you giving valuable advice about how you’ve solved similar challenges in the past. Example: “I also had a tough time with the training process years ago. This is how I made it better: ….”</p>
<p><strong>Short verbal affirmations and cues</strong> are probably the easiest way to show that you’re following along and are still engaged. Some of these can even be used while the speaker is talking without interrupting them. Examples: “Mhm”, “I see”, “I agree”.</p>
<p>Nothing demonstrates that you care about your peer and the topic at hand than <strong>recalling relevant, previously shared information</strong>. Example: “Oh, true, and I remember you shared your ideas about improving our training process – let’s make sure we implement those ideas!”</p>
<h3 id="5-what-are-some-non-verbal-ways-to-demonstrate-active-listening-" data-kb-block="kb-adv-heading_343c56-85"><p><strong>What are some non-verbal ways to demonstrate active listening?&nbsp;</strong></p></h3>
<p>Non-verbal cues are just as important as verbal ones in active listening, and there is a set of simple things you can do here. Use a combination of the following techniques:</p>
<p>Maintaining <strong>eye contact</strong> is a sure way to make the speaker feel you’re focused on them. Make sure your gaze is natural and conveys a feeling of interest and care.</p>

February 12, 2021 | http://www.rzepa.net/blog/?p=14437 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.rzepa.net/blog/?p=14437">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<div kcite-section-id="14437">
<p>I recently received two emails each with a subject line&nbsp;<i>new approaches to research reporting</i>. The traditional 350 year-old model of the (scientific) journal is undergoing upheavals at the moment with the introduction of APCs (article processing charges), a refereeing crisis and much more. Some argue that brand new thinking is now required. Here are two such innovations (and I leave you to judge whether that last word should have an appended ?).</p>

<p>To set the scene for the first, I will quote the abstract: “<em>The single figure publication is a novel, efficient format by which to communicate scholarly advances. It will serve as a forerunner of the nano-publication, a modular unit of information critical for machine-driven data aggregation and knowledge integration</em><span id="cite_ITEM-14437-0" name="citation"><a href="#ITEM-14437-0">[1]</a></span> The kernel of this suggestion is (again I quote) “<em>We offer the idea of the micro-publication unit, the single figure publication (SFP), to provide scholars with a real-world, manageable method to inform research</em>.” I was struck by the overlap between this suggestion and the one you may find on many of the posts on this blog, where what I refer to as <a href="http://www.ch.imperial.ac.uk/rzepa/blog/?p=13248" target="_blank">FAIR Data</a> is assigned a digital object identifier (DOI) and included in the citation lists at the end of the post. The key phrase in the above abstract is&nbsp;<em>machine-driven data aggregation and knowledge, </em>although the article does not really go into any&nbsp;mechanisms for easily achieving this. It is my argument that the act of assigning a DOI carries with it the association that there is machine searchable metadata which can be retrieved and used for the aggregation and knowledge mining. The authors of this article, Do and Mobley, advocate adoption of nanopublications defined by inclusion of just a single figure (notably, not a table of results!) and some accompanying context which they claim would reduce&nbsp;the unit of publication to a more tractable size. This does raise the question of whether science needs more publications (in chemistry alone there are said to be more than a million published each year) or whether we should instead be concentrating our efforts on improving the data side of things by increasing its semantic content and formalising its structures, its preservation and curation. I certainly argue that far too little effort has been poured into these latter activities. You only have to look at the typical SI (supporting information) associated with many chemistry articles to realise that in many cases they are still hardly fit for purpose.&nbsp;There is one concept introduced by&nbsp;Do and Mobley that also deserves mention. Their nanopublications&nbsp;are structured to be read by machines, not people. They will therefore <strong>not</strong> be refereed by people (my inference). They do not really discuss how else the quality will be assessed, but of course if you treat their nanopublication as essentially FAIR data, then it does become possible to develop methods of machine refereeing.</p>
<p>The second email alerted me to an article<span id="cite_ITEM-14437-1" name="citation"><a href="#ITEM-14437-1">[2]</a></span> in the Winnower, a forum that offers a bridge between “<em>traditional scholarly publishing tools to traditional&nbsp;and&nbsp;non-traditional scholarly outputs—because scholarly communication doesn’t just happen in scholarly journals</em>“. Here, the concept of scholarly communication is extended to the <em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/science/" target="_blank">New Reddit Journal of Science</a>&nbsp;</em>and introduces the concept pioneered by reddit of the AMA, or “ask me anything” environment. I occasionally publish some of the posts on this blog&nbsp;to the Winnower, receiving in return the increasingly ubiquitous DOI. I have also occasionally quoted these DOIs in articles submitted to conventional chemistry journals. What we see now is the propagation of a Winnower DOI on to e.g.&nbsp;https://www.reddit.com/r/science/ where anyone<sup>†</sup> can post a question related to the original research reporting. I must state that I do have some reservations about this. Whilst it is likely that the majority of traditional scholarly reporting is likely to receive no AMAs (just as a very high proportion of research articles attract few if any citations in other articles over a period of decades), it is also likely that the quality of posted AMAs may turn out to be very low. At which point the original researcher has to make a judgement as to whether to devote any of their increasingly precious and fragmented time to answering them. And if few if any answers are posted in response to an AMA, the system seems unlikely to flourish.</p>
<p>But what we see here are two serious attempts to develop new approaches to research reporting, and not doubt others will emerge. To quote Yogi Berra, the future is not what it used to be.</p>
<hr>
<p><sup>†</sup>Anyone can also post to this blog to ask similar questions. But note that associating an <a href="http://www.ch.imperial.ac.uk/rzepa/blog/?p=13974" target="_blank">ORCID</a> with such comments is highly recommended. I do not think that reddit currently supports ORCID, but &nbsp;I would argue if the intent is serious, it certainly should.</p>

    <p><strong>Today you are frustrated.</strong></p>

<p>This is so annoying. Youâ€™ve written a Rust crate and now that you want to test it for the very first time, <em>it doesnâ€™t work!</em></p>

<p>Come on, Rust! How dare you? You promised that once one gets past the compiler, it.<br>
<em>Just.<br>
<strong>Works!</strong></em><br>
And now this!</p>

<p>Ok, ok. You calm yourself down. Lets start from the beginning. You want to create so called <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/native/guides/minidumps/">minidumps</a>. This is a file that contains information about a crashed program (like stacks of all threads, CPU registers, system info, etc.).
The minidump consists of various sections, such as the minidump header (including time of day, versions and basically a table of contents), a thread section (including all threads of the process and their stacks), memory mappings and libraries, etc. [Just to give some context, as all of this is actually not really important.]</p>

<p>For this, you created a <a href="https://github.com/msirringhaus/minidump_writer_linux">crate</a>. One section gets written after the other, while information about the targeted process is retrieved from the system. You even created a nice, simple API. You hand in a process ID and an open file, where the minidump should be written to. like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>MinidumpWriter</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>pid</span><span>,</span> <span>blamed_thread</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.dump</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>dump_file</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.expect</span><span>(</span><span>"Dumping failed!"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can also hand in user specified memory regions that should be included in the dump, like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>let</span> <span>app_memory</span> <span>=</span> <span>AppMemory</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>ptr</span><span>:</span> <span>some_address</span><span>,</span>
        <span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>memory_size</span><span>,</span>
    <span>};</span>

    <span>MinidumpWriter</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>pid</span><span>,</span> <span>pid</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.set_app_memory</span><span>(</span><span>vec!</span><span>[</span><span>app_memory</span><span>])</span>
        <span>.dump</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>tmpfile</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.expect</span><span>(</span><span>"Dumping failed"</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>But when you run your nice library code in an application, you get <code>'Dumping failed: "Failed in ptrace::read: Sys(EIO)"'</code>.</p>

<p><em>How useless is that?!</em></p>

<p>Okay, maybe you could enhance your library error handling, a little. And by enhance, you mean â€œimplement one in the first placeâ€�.</p>

<h2 id="state-of-the-dart">State of the dart</h2>

<p>Your current approach is to define</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>Error</span> <span>=</span> <span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>dyn</span> <span>error</span><span>::</span><span>Error</span> <span>+</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>marker</span><span>::</span><span>Send</span> <span>+</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>marker</span><span>::</span><span>Sync</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>type</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>result</span><span>::</span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>Error</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and using <code>Result&lt;T&gt;</code> in all of your functions as the return value and handing all of them to the parent function using <code>?</code>. Thus the original error pierces through your callstack like a dart throughâ€¦.jelly (Yes, you are good with words and you know it.).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>init</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>()</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.read_auxv</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.enumerate_threads</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.enumerate_mappings</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
        <span>Ok</span><span>(())</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In Rust parlance, this is also called bubbling up errors.</p>

<p>Usually, you just bubble up errors from libraries you use, but for the rare errors you have to define yourself, you currently just do</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>"Found no auxv entry"</span><span>.into</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Well, now you know there is an error, at least. And that it has <em>something</em> to do with your usage of <code>ptrace</code>. But you have no idea where that happens. You use that functionality in various places. Is it during the init-phase? During one of the sections? And if so, which one? What are you trying to read? And from where? Or in short: <strong>What is going on?!</strong></p>

<h2 id="shoes-off-get-some-tea-research-time">Shoes off, get some tea: Research time!</h2>

<p>Well, Rust has been around for quite some time now and they always boast about how error handling is a first class citizen and all that. So error handling should be a done deal, right? With a canonical way of dealing with errors, officially documented and all that should be right there, correct?</p>

<p>Oh boy, were you wrong.</p>

<p>Turns out, this is a very active field ofâ€¦mhâ€¦experimentation, lets say. There has been <a href="https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/error-handling-survey/">a survey</a> recently, listing and quickly describing most the different libraries and ways for error handling that emerged, fallen out of favor, got forked, died anyways, got superseded, fallen out of favor again, etc.
And the opinions seem to change frequently, if you should use <code>error-chain</code> or <code>failure</code> or <code>fehler</code> or <code>snafu</code> or <code>thiserror</code> or <code>anyhow</code> or <code>eyre</code> orâ€¦</p>

<p>You opened a can of hornets there, or whatever that saying is.</p>

<p>Then you find <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2020/11/23/What-the-error-handling-project-group-is-working-on.html">this gem</a> and donâ€™t know if you should laugh or cry. Almost six years after Rust hit 1.0 an error handling project group is formed. Six. Years. <em>(heavy breathing)</em></p>

<p>Well, okay. At least they are sorting it out now. Problem is, you needâ€¦.<em>SIX YEARS? Are you serious?</em>â€¦ahem, sorryâ€¦Problem is, you need helpful error messages now.</p>

<p>After reading a few decent blogs on the topic (like <a href="http://www.sheshbabu.com/posts/rust-error-handling/">this</a> or <a href="https://nick.groenen.me/posts/rust-error-handling/">that</a>), there seems to emerge a consensus, at least for libraries: Return something that derives from <code>std::error::Error</code>. Either implement them by hand, or use a crate that does it for you, using macro magic. like <code>thiserror</code>. Which method you use depends on your level of laziness plus your patience regarding compile times.</p>

<h2 id="examples-vs-reality">Examples vs. Reality</h2>

<p>Another post highlighted <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/error/multiple_error_types/wrap_error.html">error wrapping</a>, a particularly intriguing idea to you.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, all the articles have the understandable, but rather annoying tendency to use very simple example code for illustration purposes. Unrealistically simple, you might even say. They have callstacks of depth 1, return only three kinds of error in total in their API, and their errors are obvious and easily describable (e.g. â€œInput file XY not found in your â€˜counting wordsâ€™ programâ€�).</p>

<p>You have a more complicated callstack, with tons of different errors and code reuse in different places. For example, the function you think is to blame for the above error is <code>copy_from_process()</code>, which calls <code>ptrace::read()</code>, which probably returns something like <code>Failed in ptrace::read: Sys(EIO)</code>.
This function is used in multiple places in your code, e.g.:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>â”œâ”€ init()
â”‚   â”œâ”€ read_auxv()
â”‚   â”‚  â”œâ”€ open(format!("/proc/{}/auxv", self.pid))
â”‚   â”‚  â””â”€ some_parsing()
â”‚   â”œâ”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€ enumerate_mappings()
â”‚   â”‚  â”œâ”€ open(format!("/proc/{}/maps", self.pid))
â”‚   â”‚  â””â”€ some_parsing()
â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â””â”€ some_more_checks()
â”‚      â””â”€ copy_from_process()
â”‚
â””â”€ dump()
   â”‚
   â”œâ”€ sections::header::write()
   â”‚
   â”œâ”€ sections::thread_list_stream::write()
   â”‚  â””â”€ copy_from_process()
   â”‚
   â”œâ”€ sections::mappings::write()
   â”‚  â””â”€ elf_identifier_for_mapping()
   â”‚     â””â”€ copy_from_process()
   â”‚
   â”œâ”€ sections::app_memory::write()
   â”‚  â””â”€ copy_from_process()
   â”‚
   â””â”€ ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Same goes for opening files, which happens in multiple places (two examples of which are shown in <code>init()</code>), so getting <code>FileNotFound</code> without context is going to be equally fun, and so on.</p>



<p>Wrapping errors still sounds like a nice idea, but one layer alone is not going to <del>wrap it</del> cut it.
Going with <code>copy_from_process()</code> as an example, you see a few possibilities:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Wrapping the <code>ptrace</code> error into an <code>CopyFromProcessError</code>, but that gives you nothing (except maybe some context, if you add some)</li>
  <li>With <code>InitError</code>s and <code>DumpingError</code>s that wrap the <code>ptrace</code> errors, you will still not know which section failed and why, but know if it was during <code>init()</code> or not.</li>
</ol>

<p>You might add context to option 2 as well (see below on how), but each section has a variety of reasons why it could fail. Some unique to the section, some shared among a few, some among all of them.</p>

<p>Complex problems sometimes require complex solutions, maybe?</p>

<h2 id="inc-err-ption">Inc <em>Err()</em> ption</h2>

<p>Using <code>thiserror</code> and the fabulous <code>#[from]</code> macro, you quickly define a plethora of errors and wrappers, starting from the deepest, darkest places in your callstack, wrapping your way up:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#[derive(Debug,</span> <span>Error)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>enum</span> <span>PtraceDumperError</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>#[error(</span><span>"nix::ptrace() error"</span><span>)]</span>
    <span>PtraceError</span><span>(</span><span>#[from]</span> <span>nix</span><span>::</span><span>Error</span><span>),</span>
    <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>#[derive(Debug,</span> <span>Error)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>enum</span> <span>SectionAppMemoryError</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>#[error(</span><span>"Failed to copy memory from process"</span><span>)]</span>
    <span>CopyFromProcessError</span><span>(</span><span>#[from]</span> <span>PtraceDumperError</span><span>),</span>
    <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>#[derive(Debug,</span> <span>Error)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>enum</span> <span>DumpError</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>#[error(</span><span>"Error during init phase"</span><span>)]</span>
    <span>InitError</span><span>(</span><span>#[from]</span> <span>InitError</span><span>),</span>
    <span>#[error(transparent)]</span>
    <span>PtraceDumperError</span><span>(</span><span>#[from]</span> <span>PtraceDumperError</span><span>),</span>
    <span>#[error(</span><span>"Failed when writing section AppMemory"</span><span>)]</span>
    <span>SectionAppMemoryError</span><span>(</span><span>#[from]</span> <span>SectionAppMemoryError</span><span>),</span>
    <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The fun part is: You have to touch very little of your existing code, thanks to the automatic conversion from one error to the other, conveniently provided by <code>#[from]</code>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>- pub fn init(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
</span><span>+ pub fn init(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;(), InitError&gt; {
</span>     self.read_auxv()?;
     self.enumerate_threads()?;
     self.enumerate_mappings()?;
     Ok(())
 }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>- pub fn get_stack_info(&amp;self, int_stack_pointer: usize) -&gt; Result&lt;(usize, usize)&gt; {
</span><span>+ pub fn get_stack_info(&amp;self, int_stack_pointer: usize) -&gt; Result&lt;(usize, usize), DumperError&gt; {
</span> // snip

    let mapping = self
        .find_mapping(stack_pointer)
<span>-        .ok_or("No mapping for stack pointer found")?;
</span><span>+        .ok_or(DumperError::NoStackPointerMapping)?;
</span>    let offset = stack_pointer - mapping.start_address;
    let distance_to_end = mapping.size - offset;
  // snip
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you run your test binary again, you now get</p>
<div><div><pre><code>Failed when writing section AppMemory
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>which isâ€¦.<em>(Throws a stack of papers from the desk)</em>â€¦short. Too short, and not that much more helpful, actually. Well, you know which section is failing. Thats good. But where are all the nice error messages you specified in your errors?</p>

<p>Hm, you do only use <code>println!("{}", error);</code>. Maybe <code>{:?}</code> is better?</p>
<div><div><pre><code>SectionAppMemoryError(CopyFromProcessError(PtraceError(Sys(EIO))))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Aha! Now you are getting somewhere! Tiny, tiny, painfully <strong>tiny</strong> steps, but you are getting somewhere! No error texts, but at least a chain!</p>

<p>Normal printing doesnâ€™t seem to recursively go through all the wrapped errors, but stop at the top most. For this, you need to either go through all the errors yourself by hand, or use a crate that does this for you. There are a number of them that provide this, but <code>anyhow</code> will do (its by the same author as <code>thiserror</code>, so interoperability shouldnâ€™t be an issue).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{:#}"</span><span>,</span> <span>anyhow</span><span>::</span><span>Error</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>aaaaand:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Failed when writing section AppMemory: Failed to copy memory from process: nix::ptrace() error: EIO: I/O error
</code></pre></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Whether it was our first call or our hundredth, founders inevitably asked me whether they should market and sell their enterprise software to buyers/executives (top-down) or to users (bottom-up). My view, which only strengthened every time I uttered it, was this:</p>

<p>Marketing and selling to users is just another, roundabout way of getting to the buyer. Compared with the top-down approach — think whitepapers and meetings with the CIO — it takes more effort and time to see a payoff. More effort because users want a smooth self-serve experience, which means more product work. More time because big budget decisions are made at the executive level, which means you are just adding more hoops to hop through before meeting the CIO.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e1d7c01d1b02afb36c6da331334936f4823d9ce9/0dfc5/images/uploads/343.jpg" alt="Cartoon about dogs in the board room."></p>

<p>More recently this inevitable question evolved from “top-down or bottom-up?” to “what do you think of product-led growth?”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gkogan.co/product-led-growth/">Product-led growth</a> is the strategy of getting to the users first. It emphasizes letting users see, test, and get value from the product quickly and on their own. Since it’s an evolution of “bottom-up,” my answer was more or less the same.</p>

<p>Sure, there were success stories like Atlassian and GitLab, but those were exceptions to the rule, especially for enterprise software.</p>

<p><strong>I was wrong.</strong></p>

<p>Although the clues had been all around me for months, I paid them no mind until they hit me in the face in quick succession:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Late in November I had an intro call with yet another founder interested in product-led growth.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A week later, another founder brought up product-led growth. Not as a question but as a decision they’ve made. (I now <a href="https://www.gkogan.co/blog/pinecone/">work</a> for this <a href="https://www.pinecone.io/">company</a> in part because of that decision.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next day, I attended several sessions at FC Build, where CEOs of unicorn and public companies mentioned product-led growth either as a major contributor to their growth or a major area of focus in the future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The day after, I spoke on a panel about developer marketing, with other panelists from Twilio, Google Cloud, and Sequoia. In this discussion I heard “developer marketing” used interchangeably with “product-led growth.” (Much of my work involves marketing to developers, yet I never thought of it as product-led growth.) The event organizer holds a panel like this every month, and this one had the most attendants of all.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A week later, Tomasz Tunguz of Redpoint Ventures made a <a href="https://tomtunguz.com/2021-predictions/">prediction</a> that “Product-led growth [will become] the standard GTM for software and infrastructure companies” in 2021.</p>

<p>Over a few reflective days in December, other clues from the past year started coming into focus:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>My three biggest opportunities of the year — two unicorns and one Fortune-50 company — revolved around product-led growth. (Having failed to recognize it at the time, I lost those opportunities.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the projects I enjoyed most were really about product-led growth: Launching a trial and growing data scientist users for <a href="https://www.dominodatalab.com/">Domino Data Lab</a>, increasing self-serve revenue from developers for <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, and commercializing open-source software for <a href="https://www.goteleport.com/">Teleport</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seemingly every one of my startup clients and every other prospective client had asked me about product-led growth at some point, indicating widespread interest among founders and their investors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I researched enterprise software companies that recently went public for my <a href="https://www.gkogan.co/blog/category-creation/">category creation</a> post, I noticed more than half of them offer free trials.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To ensure I wasn’t just seeing what I wanted to see, I emailed five investors with a question: “How much (or little) demand are you seeing for product-led growth compared to enterprise demand-gen?” Four out of five confirmed seeing strong demand and opportunity for product-led growth among startups; one remained neutral.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/399f678b2d026ec46d1dbd67095ad42bd7552e52/80e97/images/uploads/370.jpg" alt="Cartoon about getting a second opinion."></p>

<p>The trend was clear: Software purchasing decisions are increasingly starting with the users. “What tools do my engineers need,” “what do they already use,” “can they try this,” “what do they think of this?” Ironically, calling the CIO is now a roundabout way of getting to the users.</p>

<p>I changed my mind about product-led growth. Software companies not already targeting users (over buyers) should consider changing theirs.</p>

Although <code>mmap</code> is a really neat solution, it has some troubles.

Because of that most databases avoid using <code>mmap</code>. However, they still need to read and write data from disk in an efficient manner. And the answer to that is: <strong>buffer pool</strong>.</p>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure><img src="https://brunocalza.me/content/images/2021/02/image.png" alt=""><figcaption>A database file is organized into fixed-length blocks called <strong>pages</strong></figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The page length is usually a multiple of the filesystem block length ranging from <strong>512 bytes</strong> to <strong>16KB</strong>. <em>PostgreSQL</em>, for example, uses <strong>8KB</strong>,  although a different page size can be selected when compiling the server<sup>[1]</sup>. <em>InnoDB</em>, a storage engine used in MySQL, uses <strong>16KB</strong> for page size<sup>[2]</sup>.</p>
<p>The layout of these pages is not the scope of this post. However, just to give a glimpse of what happens when writes are executed, think that, for row-oriented databases, tuples are appended inside the page until it is filled up. When the page is filled up, another page needs to be allocated to support incoming writes.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="the-buffer-pool-manager">The buffer pool manager</h2><p>So we have our data in disk and the database wants to access it, let's say, through a <strong>SELECT</strong> command. Or we have new incoming data, that we want to store. In order to manage reads and writes efficiently, the common practice is to avoid touching the disk directly. The <strong>execution engine</strong> that is processing the commands has no access to disk. It has access to an <strong>in-memory intermediate layer abstraction</strong> called <strong>buffer pool</strong>. </p><figure><img src="https://brunocalza.me/content/images/2021/02/image-8.png" alt=""><figcaption>High level architecture of how data is accessed by the execution engine</figcaption></figure><p>The <strong>execution engine</strong> requests pages from the <strong>buffer pool</strong> by providing a <strong>page identifier</strong>. It can read the content of the page and send the data to the client. Or it can modify the content of the page and send it back to the <strong>buffer pool</strong> so that the change can be persisted. The execution engine<strong> </strong>access the buffer pool thinking that it is accessing the disk. </p><p>I really think the term buffer pool is kind of misleading here, and it confused me a lot. And that's because the purpose of this structure is not only to manage a pool of empty buffers and its reuse but also it is responsible for <strong>caching the disk pages into memory for future reuse</strong> (not only by the requesting thread but also for concurrent threads). And as with any cache, also responsible for <strong>caching replacement policy</strong>. For this reason, a more appropriate name for the buffer pool is <strong>page cache</strong>. With this in mind, you can imagine the importance of the buffer pool for speeding up the database access to disk.</p><p>The buffer pool can be implemented with a statically allocated array of <strong>frames</strong>. Frames start empty and fill up as pages are being requested. There is an associative structure called <strong>page table</strong><em>, </em>that indicates which page is being held by each frame. </p><figure><img src="https://brunocalza.me/content/images/2021/02/image-2.png" alt=""><figcaption>A representation of a full buffer pool</figcaption></figure><p>The above image indicates the two data structures used for implementing a buffer pool: a <strong>frame array </strong>and a <strong>page table</strong>. The image represents a buffer pool that can cache a maximum of 4 pages. The pages being cached are 4, 5, 6, and 7. The arrows indicate where the page can be found in memory (in the array of frames). Let's look into another buffer pool:</p><figure><img src="https://brunocalza.me/content/images/2021/02/image-3.png" alt=""><figcaption>A representation of a buffer pool with one empty frame</figcaption></figure><p>At this, we can see that there are 3 pages in cache, and one space left. The frames that are free and are ready for receiving a new page are tracked in an additional structure called <strong>free list</strong>. </p><p>The <strong>pages in red</strong> indicate the pages that are being accessed by some thread. That indication is very important because it means that the page cannot leave the buffer pool until all accesses are finished. We will be back to this. </p><p>Another important concept is <strong>page replacement</strong>. <strong>What happens when the cache is full, and a page that is not in the cache is requested?</strong> We need to evict a page that is not being accessed and give its frame to the requested page. There are many algorithms (or policies) to decide which page to evict. We'll talk about this later.</p><p>With these concepts in mind, here is how we can represent our buffer pool in <strong>Go</strong> code</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>//BufferPoolManager represents the buffer pool manager
type BufferPoolManager struct {
	diskManager DiskManager
	pages       [MaxPoolSize]*Page
	replacer    *ClockReplacer
	freeList    []FrameID
	pageTable   map[PageID]FrameID
}

//NewBufferPoolManager returns a empty buffer pool manager
func NewBufferPoolManager(DiskManager DiskManager, clockReplacer *ClockReplacer) *BufferPoolManager {
	freeList := make([]FrameID, 0)
	pages := [MaxPoolSize]*Page{}
	for i := 0; i &lt; MaxPoolSize; i++ {
		freeList = append(freeList, FrameID(i))
		pages[FrameID(i)] = nil
	}
	return &amp;BufferPoolManager{DiskManager, pages, clockReplacer, freeList, make(map[PageID]FrameID)}
}
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The buffer pool receives a <code>DiskManager</code> implementation and a <code>replacer</code>. In our case, we are going to implement the <strong>clock replacement policy</strong>, implemented by <code>ClockReplacer</code>, for page eviction. Internally, <code>pages</code> represents the frame array of fixed size (<code>MaxPoolSize</code>); <code>pageTable</code> is a <code>map</code> the indicates which frame holds which page; and <code>freeList</code> tracks the array of <code>free</code> frames. Initially, we have all frames ids inside the <code>freeList</code>, because all frames are free. That also means all frames pointing to <code>nil</code>.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>And here is the <strong>API</strong> provided by our buffer pool implementation:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>NewPage() *Page
FetchPage(pageID PageID) *Page
FlushPage(pageID PageID) bool
FlushAllPages()
DeletePage(pageID PageID) error
UnpinPage(pageID PageID, isDirty bool) error
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li><strong><code>NewPage() *Page</code></strong>: a clean new page can be requested. The buffer pool will ask the disk manager for a new page id;</li>
<li><strong><code>FetchPage(pageID PageID) *Page</code></strong>: fetches a known page. If the page is in cache, it is immidiatatly returned. If not, the buffer pool will find it on disk and cache it;</li>
<li><strong><code>FlushPage(pageID PageID) bool</code></strong>: writes the page that is in cache to disk;</li>
<li><strong><code>FlushAllPages()</code></strong> writes all pages in cache to disk;</li>
<li><strong><code>DeletePage(pageID PageID) error</code></strong>: deletes page from cache and disk;</li>
<li><strong><code>UnpinPage(pageID PageID, isDirty bool) error</code></strong>: indicates that the page is not used any more for the current requesting thread. If no more threads are using this page, the page is considered for eviction.</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="how-to-represent-a-page">How to represent a page</h2><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>We are going to represent our page in a very simple manner. Our focus here is to learn how the buffer pool works.  Our page is just a <code>[]byte</code> followed by an <code>id</code>. There is some metadata that needs to be tracked. One is the <code>pinCount</code> that tracks the number of concurrent accesses. Each time the page is accessed the <code>pinCount</code> is increased. When it is no more in use, the <code>pinCount</code> is decreased. So, if the <code>pinCount</code> is greater than 0, we say the page is <em>pinned</em> and it is indicated in our figures by the red mark. The other metadata variable is <code>isDirty</code>, which indicates that the page has been modified after it was read from disk.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>// PageID is the type of the page identifier
type PageID int

const pageSize = 5

// Page represents a page on disk
type Page struct {
	id       PageID
	pinCount int
	isDirty  bool
	data     [pageSize]byte
}
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="the-clock-replacement-algorithm">The Clock Replacement algorithm </h2><p>When the buffer pool is full, and a new page needs to enter the cache, some page needs to be chosen to leave the cache. &nbsp;This is a classic <strong>cache eviction</strong> problem and there is no perfect solution because predicting which pages are going to be requested is a complicated problem. If you can't predict which pages are going to be requested, you don't know which pages must remain in cache and which pages must be evicted. The best you can do is to reduce the number of wrong page evictions. There are many strategies like <strong>FIFO</strong> (f<em>irst-in first-out</em>), <strong>LRU</strong> (<em>least recently used</em>), and <strong>LFU</strong> (<em>least frequently used</em>). We are not going to explore all of them and their trade-offs. For our buffer pool manager implementation, we have chosen one policy called <strong>CLOCK</strong>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>When a thread from the execution engine no longer needs a page, it calls the <code>UnpinPage</code> method from the buffer pool. This method reduces the <code>pinCount</code> of the page, and if the pin count reaches zero, the <code>frame id</code> of where that page allocated is stored in the <strong>Clock Replacer</strong> for future analysis. If, anytime, the same page is accessed again (its pin count increases), and it needs to be removed from the <strong>Clock Replacer</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Clock Replacer</strong> keeps tracks of all pages that are not being accessed in a <strong>circular buffer</strong>. For each page, it also keeps a <strong>reference bit</strong> to indicate if the page was recently accessed. There is a <strong>Clock Hand</strong> or <strong>Clock Pointer</strong> (CP) that iterates through the circular buffer looking for a <em>victim</em>.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure><img src="https://brunocalza.me/content/images/2021/02/image-4.png" alt=""><figcaption>Clock Replacer representation&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The <strong>Clock Replacer </strong>provides the following <strong>API</strong>:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>func Victim() *FrameID
func Unpin(id FrameID)
func Pin(id FrameID) 
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li><strong><code>Unpin</code></strong> is called when the buffer pool wants to make a page eligible for eviction because it is no longer accessed;</li>
<li><strong><code>Pin</code></strong> is called when the buffer pool wants to remove a page from cache eviction election because it was accessed and it cannot be evicted;</li>
<li><strong><code>Victim</code></strong> elects a victim through the clock replacement policy.</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Let's see how the clock replacement policy works using an example.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <div> <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div id="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <p>You know how it happens.</p> <p>You see someone from the Product team coming to your desk and your heart starts to sink. Then the inevitable question comes:</p> <blockquote> <p>hey, how did the sale go? How many items did we sell compared to last year’s? Is there a chance we could compare on an hourly basis how much we sold compared to any given Friday?</p> </blockquote> <p>You don’t have a straight answer and you don’t have a quick way to tell them; your transactions table in postgres has grown way too big to handle analytical queries. It could take minutes to even get a <code>SELECT count(*) FROM transactions</code> going.</p> <p>We at Tinybird love PostgreSQL. We have been working with it for longer than we can remember and we know its insides and outs better than most; it is our go to RDBMS system for building data intensive applications and the one we recommend to pretty much anyone who asks.</p> <p>But when your tables start hitting the tens of millions of rows, the hundreds of millions… Yes, you can create or fine tune indices to keep serving your application requests; yes, you can set replication up so that you can at least run the analytical queries against the replicas instead of against the main database; yes, you can resort to running recurring pre-aggregation queries that then dump a reduced (and poorer) set of data somewhere else so that you can exploit it through whatever BI your Product team chose.</p> <p>But all of that is costly and none of it is ideal. We can offer a way to cut through all that stuff.</p> <blockquote> <p>Because none of that gives you the ability to use the full power of SQL to run instant queries against all of your data; none of that enables you to retain the flexibility of cutting and slicing ALL of your data any which way you want and to make the most of it.</p> </blockquote> <p>What if we told you that, with a single cron job, you can be running analytical queries of your large postgres tables in less than it takes you to run a <code>SELECT count(*)</code> against any of them?</p> <p>Yep, it is possible; only it wouldn’t use Postgres to actually run the analytical queries but Tinybird. This is what the command would look like:</p> <div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre>psql -U {USER} -c \
"COPY (select * from transactions where insertion_date = CURRENT_DATE - 1) to STDOUT WITH CSV HEADER" | \
curl -F csv=@- "https://api.tinybird.co/v0/datasources?name=transactions&amp;mode=append&amp;token={TOKEN}"
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div> <p>And here is how to setup your crontab to run the job at midnight every night:</p> <div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>0 0 * * * [user] psql -U {USER} -c "COPY (select * from transactions where insertion_date = CURRENT_DATE - 1) to STDOUT WITH CSV HEADER" | curl -F csv=@- "https://api.tinybird.co/v0/datasources?name=transactions&amp;mode=append&amp;token={TOKEN}"
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div> <p>You might want to do this every 5 minutes, a little bit more complex but still a piece of cake, you just need to query for the insertion time.</p> <div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>0/5 * * * * [user] psql -U {USER} -c "COPY (select * from transactions where created_at &gt; '`curl -s "https://api.tinybird.co/v0/sql?q=select+max(created_at)+from+transactions&amp;token={TOKEN}"`') to STDOUT WITH CSV HEADER" | curl -F csv=@- "https://api.tinybird.co/v0/datasources?name=transactions&amp;mode=append&amp;token={TOKEN}"
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div> <p>And that’s that… You now have an always-up-to-date replica of your transactions table and can start querying it with sub-second times.</p> <p>To make this painless, it’d be good to have an index on insertion_date on your Postgres table; in this case we recommend BRIN index which is compact, suited for append-only tables and pretty fast for these use cases. You could use the following command (bear in mind BRIN index only works when data in disk correlates with the order of the data)</p> <div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>create index created_at_idx on orders using brin (created_at);
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div> <p>Tinybird can ingest records as fast as you can feed them through your network (all the way up to 4Gb/per minute depending on the network speed), so as long as your Postgres db can spit it out, we can take it.</p> <p>You can then login to Tinybird’s UI and start issuing queries in seconds. Or setup a KPIs dashboard using our APIs.</p> <p>Oh! And those queries your Product team was asking about? Here’s how fast they run against a 100M rows table.</p> <p>The upload takes about 5 minutes for these 100M rows (2Gb compressed). Basically is limited by the network and postgres export speed, so it might vary depending on your machine and how close your datacenter is to ours (Google in different regions in our case)</p> <p>Let’s see some simple examples to see the point where it pays off waiting 5 minutes to upload the whole dataset. All the queries are running PostgreSQL 11.5 with 6 cores per query on a 32Gb machine (16gb shared buffers). The times reported here are the best of many executions.</p> <h2 id="count-per-shipping-method">Count per shipping method</h2> <div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

<p>To start drawing, I created a rectangular area that will represent the boundary of my image. The code:</p>
<pre>image.NewRGBA(image.Rect(0, 0, 1200, 630))</pre>
<p>does that. This statement creates a rectangle from point(0,0) to point(1200, 630).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><section><div id="content">

<p>
I'm planning on pivoting away from pure software, and this post is meant as
a sort of explanation and rationale for the choices I'm about to make.
</p>

<p>
Over the last few years working in the software industry, I realized that pure software
work is just boring. What's worse, much of the work in this industry seems to be pretty useless,
if not even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising">detrimental to society</a>. Code is a powerful tool for making this world
better, and yet I'm having a hard time seeing it used that way.
</p>

<p>
If code is a tool, then it's a means to an end. A carpenter is not an expert in using a hammer - they're
an expert in using a hammer <i>to build something useful</i>. I'm increasingly feeling more
like a hammer expert in an industry of selling modern nail art, and so I think it's time to focus on developing
expertise in some other fields, where I could use computing to create things I believe in.
</p>

<p>
There are two areas of human endeavor that I've been dreaming about for a long time now,
and I want to make a serious effort to contribute to them. I'm thinking
of switching over my career to one (or both) of them over the coming few years.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org7712ef1">
<h2 id="org7712ef1">Space</h2>
<div id="text-org7712ef1">
<p>
I find space intrinsically interesting. I've dreamed of humans exploring the universe
since I was a kid.
</p>

<p>
I believe that expanding outwards, and moving various industries from the surface
to Earth orbit and further out, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_mH8R0KTM">could usher a new era of prosperity for humans</a>.
It could also play a vital part in restoring the damage we've been doing to our home
for the past three centuries.
</p>

<p>
Space programs worldwide have become quite neglected since the end of the Apollo era,
but in the last decade - in big part thanks to the private sector, now dubbed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NewSpace">NewSpace</a> - 
things have been picking up pace. Still, development happens too slow for my taste,
and I would love to give my best to push it forward ever so slightly, so that maybe
humanity will become a real spacefaring species within my lifetime.
</p>

<p>
Ultimately, my dream is to directly contribute towards bootstrapping
an industry in space - that is, to work on things related to asteroid mining, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ_resource_utilization">ISRU</a>, zero-G manufacturing,
or many of other supporting areas.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgcae13bd">
<h2 id="orgcae13bd">Biotech</h2>
<div id="text-orgcae13bd">
<p>
I believe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engines_of_Creation">Eric Drexler when he writes that</a> molecular nanotechnology pretty much the key to the future.
Mastery of nano-scale processes could literally solve half of the problems humanity faces (i.e. the
half we don't inflict on ourselves). And as I'm fond of saying:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Life <i>is technology</i>. It is very advanced nanotech that we didn't design, and we can't control… <i>yet</i>. 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Biotech of today is finally letting us tinker with existing machines that work on molecular scale, and
gain necessary experience to design our own nanosystems. I think that modifying and ultimately reverse-engineering
an existing, working technology is much simpler than developing our own - but even if not, it's currently
our only example of working nanomachinery to study.
</p>

<p>
To be clear - I was never particularly interested in living things by themselves. I have no passion
for flowers and animals, and I prefer concrete jungle to a raw forest. But I love engineering of all
kinds, and it is with this view that I feel drawn towards biology. My dream is to work on things
that help us design our own nanomachines for use in making lives of everyone better.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3c570b8">
<h2 id="org3c570b8">Doing it</h2>
<div id="text-org3c570b8">
<p>
While I've been paying attention to both spacetech and biotech for a long time,
it's only in the past year or two that I really started considering a serious career switch. I could just
resign from my current software job and try to get hired by anyone in my industries of choice, but that
feels both irresponsible and like a waste of time.
</p>

<p>
Instead, I want to spend the year 2018 on getting the "lay of the land" of both spacetech and biotech
industries - to figure out who is working on what areas, what work is impactful, and what kind of skills
are needed to contribute something meaningful. And while I hate this word, I know I need to spend
some effort on networking.
</p>

<p>
If you, dear reader, have any experience in either of those industries or maybe tips to share,
I would <a href="http://jacek.zlydach.pl/contact.html">very much appreciate some help</a> in getting my bearings.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org489f69c">
<h2 id="org489f69c">But what about…?</h2>

<div id="outline-container-org26e7938">
<h3 id="org26e7938">Lisp</h3>
<p>
It's still my personal tool of choice, and I plan to remain active in Common Lisp community.
I will keep using it wherever I can, but I'm more practical about it than I used
to be a few years ago.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4d6b72f">
<h3 id="org4d6b72f">Game development</h3>
<p>
It's fun as a pastime, but I don't feel like I want to make a career in it anymore.
I'll probably keep writing small games as a pure hobby.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7179f89">
<h3 id="org7179f89">AI</h3>
<p>
I pay attention to both the more hype-driven areas like deep learning, and those more dream-driven,
like the work of <a href="https://intelligence.org/">MIRI</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a>. However, I don't feel like focusing on those particular areas right now,
beyond picking up basic skills in machine learning. If an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">AGI</a> takes off and renders all our endeavors obsolete,
only better for us. If it decides to kill us all, it at least won't be because of a software bug I made.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc684c0f">
<h3 id="orgc684c0f">Cleantech, energy</h3>
<p>
Energy problems are constantly on my mind, and I have some interest in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_technology">cleantech</a>. A possible future pivot
into that industry isn't beyond my imagination, but as it is, I feel that both spacetech and biotech
can offer a lot in terms of solutions for energy and climate problems, so my current choice is tangentially
related.

<p>Many claim: "Reliable video conferencing? Only big companies in Silicon Valley can do that". But these companies are repeatedly criticised for endangering our privacy and the security of our computers.</p>
<p>As students in Darmstadt and Karlsruhe, we were forced by our universities to use the applications of such companies. That's why we want to show that video communication for digital family visits, web seminars, teaching and conferences also works with data protection. With Senfcall we offer videoconferencing via the open source software <a href="https://bigbluebutton.org/">BigBlueButton™</a>. The advantage: to use Senfcall you only need your web browser - no additional software that creates new security holes.</p>
<p>So that you can also use privacy protecting video conferences.</p>
<p>Senfcall uses BigBlueButton and is not endorsed or certified by BigBlueButton Inc. BigBlueButton and the BigBlueButton Logo are trademarks of BigBlueButton Inc..</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Quite a while back I wrote a larger article on the algebraic foundation of software patterns which also covered the <a href="https://thma.github.io/posts/2018-11-24-lambda-the-ultimate-pattern-factory.html#map-reduce">MapReduce algorithm</a>.</p>
<p>During the research digged out a paper on <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0498/3a1c0d6343e21129aaffca2a1b3eec419523.pdf">algebraic properties of distributed big data analytics</a>, which explained that a MapReduce will always work correctly when the intermediate data structure resulting from the <code>map</code>-phase is a Monoid under the <code>reduce</code>-operation.</p>
<p>For some reason, I was not convinced that this Monoid-condition was enough, because all the typical examples like word-frequency maps are even <strong>commutative</strong> Monoids under the respective reduce operation.</p>
<p>So I came up with the following personal theory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only if the intermediate data structure resulting from the <code>map</code>-phase is a <strong>commutative Monoid</strong> under the <code>reduce</code>-operation, then a parallel MapReduce will produce correct results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I tried to validate this property using the <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Introduction_to_QuickCheck2">QuickCheck test framework</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly the QuickCheck tests failed! This finally convinced me that my theory was wrong, and after a little deeper thought, I could understand why.</p>
<p>I was impressed with the power of QuickCheck, so I thought it would be a good idea to share this lesson in falsification.</p>
<p>The code shown in this blog <a href="https://github.com/thma/CommutativeMonoid">is also available on GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="commutative-monoids">Commutative Monoids</h2>
<p>In abstract algebra, a monoid is a <em>set</em> equipped with an <em>associative binary operation</em> and an <em>identity element</em>.</p>
<p>The simplest example for a <em>commutative Monoid</em> is <span>\((\mathbb{N}_0, +, 0)\)</span>: the natural numbers under addition with <span>\(0\)</span> as the identity (or neutral) element. We can use QuickCheck to verify that indeed the Monoid laws plus commutativity are maintained.</p>
<p>If we want to use <code>GHC.Natural</code> type to represent natural numbers, we first have to make <code>Natural</code> instantiate the <code>Arbitrary</code> type class which is used by QuickCheck to automatically generate test data:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>import</span>           <span>Test.QuickCheck</span> (<span>Arbitrary</span>, arbitrary, <span>NonNegative</span> (..))</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span>import</span>           <span>GHC.Natural</span>     (<span>Natural</span>, naturalFromInteger)</span>
<span id="cb1-3"></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><span>instance</span> <span>Arbitrary</span> <span>Natural</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5">  arbitrary <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6">    <span>NonNegative</span> nonNegative <span>&lt;-</span> arbitrary</span>
<span id="cb1-7">    <span>return</span> <span>$</span> naturalFromInteger nonNegative</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we can start to write our property based tests. For algebraic structures it is straightforward to come up with properties: we just write the required laws (associativity, 0 is identity element and commutativity) as properties.</p>
<p>I am using Hspec as a wrapper around QuickCheck as it provides a very nice testing DSL which makes it easy to read the code and the output of the test suite:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>import</span>           <span>Test.Hspec</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><span>spec ::</span> <span>Spec</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4">spec <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb2-5">  describe <span>"The Monoid 'Natural Numbers under Addition'"</span> <span>$</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb2-6">    it <span>"is associative"</span> <span>$</span></span>
<span id="cb2-7">      property <span>$</span> \x y z <span>-&gt;</span> ((x <span>+</span> y) <span>+</span> z) <span>`shouldBe`</span> ((x <span>+</span> (y <span>+</span> z))<span> ::</span> <span>Natural</span>)</span>
<span id="cb2-8">      </span>
<span id="cb2-9">    it <span>"has 0 as left and right identity element"</span> <span>$</span></span>
<span id="cb2-10">      property <span>$</span> \x <span>-&gt;</span> (x <span>+</span> <span>0</span> <span>`shouldBe`</span> (<span>x ::</span> <span>Natural</span>)) <span>.&amp;&amp;.</span> (<span>0</span> <span>+</span> x <span>`shouldBe`</span> x)</span>
<span id="cb2-11">      </span>
<span id="cb2-12">    it <span>"is commutative"</span> <span>$</span></span>
<span id="cb2-13">      property <span>$</span> \x y <span>-&gt;</span> x <span>+</span> y <span>`shouldBe`</span> (y <span>+</span><span> x ::</span> <span>Natural</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The output of these tests will be as follows:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>Monoid</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2">  <span>The</span> Monoid <span>'Natural Numbers under Addition'</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3">    <span>is</span> associative</span>
<span id="cb3-4">      <span>+++</span> OK, passed 100 tests.</span>
<span id="cb3-5">    <span>has</span> 0 as identity (or neutral) <span>element</span></span>
<span id="cb3-6">      <span>+++</span> OK, passed 100 tests.</span>
<span id="cb3-7">    <span>is</span> commutative</span>
<span id="cb3-8">      <span>+++</span> OK, passed 100 tests.</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So behind the scenes, QuickCheck has generated test data for 100 tests for each property under test. For all these data the test cases passed.</p>
<p>This is definitely not a proof. But it gives us some confidence that our math text-books are correct when giving Natural Numbers under addition as an example for a commutative Monoid.</p>
<p>OK, that was easy! Now let’s move to non-commutative Monoids.</p>
<h2 id="non-commutative-monoids">Non-commutative Monoids</h2>
<p>Strings (or any other Lists) under concatenation are a typical example. It’s easy to see that <code>"hello" ++ ("dear" ++ "people")</code> equals <code>"(hello" ++ "dear") ++ "people"</code>, but that <code>"hello" ++ "world"</code> differs from <code>"world" ++ "hello"</code>.</p>
<p>Now let’s try to formalize these intuitions as QuickCheck property based tests again.</p>
<p>First I’m introducing an alias for <code>(++)</code>, as it is defined on any list type, it would be required to have type signatures in all properties (as we had all those <code>:: Natural</code> signatures in the examples above). So I define an operation <code>(⊕)</code> which is only defined on <code>String</code> instances:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1">(⊕)<span> ::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2">(⊕) a b <span>=</span> a <span>++</span> b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we can extend our test suite with the following test cases:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1">  describe <span>"The Monoid 'Strings under concatenation'"</span> <span>$</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2">    </span>
<span id="cb5-3">    it <span>"is associative"</span> <span>$</span> </span>
<span id="cb5-4">      property <span>$</span> \x y z <span>-&gt;</span> ((x ⊕ y) ⊕ z) <span>`shouldBe`</span> (x ⊕ (y ⊕ z))</span>
<span id="cb5-5">      </span>
<span id="cb5-6">    it <span>"has \"\" as left and right identity element"</span> <span>$</span></span>
<span id="cb5-7">      property <span>$</span> \x <span>-&gt;</span> (x ⊕ <span>""</span> <span>`shouldBe`</span> x) <span>.&amp;&amp;.</span> (<span>""</span> ⊕ x <span>`shouldBe`</span> x)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The output looks promising:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1">  <span>The</span> Monoid <span>'Strings under concatenation'</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2">    <span>is</span> associative</span>
<span id="cb6-3">      <span>+++</span> OK, passed 100 tests.</span>
<span id="cb6-4">    <span>has</span> <span>""</span> as left and right identity element</span>
<span id="cb6-5">      <span>+++</span> OK, passed 100 tests.</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now let’s try to test the non-commutativity:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1">    it <span>"is NOT commutative"</span> <span>$</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2">      property <span>$</span> \x y <span>-&gt;</span> x ⊕ y <span>`shouldNotBe`</span> y ⊕ x</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But unfortunately the output tells us that this is not true:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1">    <span>is</span> NOT commutative FAILED [1]</span>
<span id="cb8-2"></span>
<span id="cb8-3">  <span>1</span>) <span>Monoid</span>, The Monoid <span>'Strings under concatenation'</span>, is NOT commutative</span>
<span id="cb8-4">       <span>Falsifiable</span> (after 1 test)<span>:</span></span>
<span id="cb8-5">         <span>""</span></span>
<span id="cb8-6">         <span>""</span></span>
<span id="cb8-7">       <span>not</span> expected: <span>""</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>We formulated the property in the wrong way. The <code>(⊕)</code> <em>may be commutative for some</em> edge cases, e.g.&nbsp;when one or both of the arguments are <code>""</code>. But it is not commutative <em>in general</em> – that is for all possible arguments.</p>
<p>We could rephrase this property as <em>“There exists at least one pair of arguments <span>\((x, y)\)</span> for which <span>\(\oplus\)</span> is not commutative”</em>:</p>
<p><span>\[\exists (x,y) \left [  x \oplus y \neq y \oplus x \right ]\]</span></p>
<p>QuickCheck does not come with a mechanism for <em>existential quantification</em>. But as is has <code>forAll</code>, that is <em>universal quantification</em>. So we can try to make use of the following equivalence:</p>
<p><span>\[\exists (x,y) \left [  x \oplus y \neq y \oplus x \right ] 
  \equiv 
  \neg \forall (x,y) \left [ x \oplus y = y \oplus x \right ]\]</span></p>
<p>Unfortunately we can not write this simply as <code>not forAll</code>, as <code>forAll</code> returns a <code>Property</code> but <code>not</code> expects a <code>Bool</code>. But as explained in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42764847/is-there-a-there-exists-quantifier-in-quickcheck">this discussion on Stackoverflow</a> it is still posible to implement our own <code>exists</code>:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>exists ::</span> (<span>Show</span> a, <span>Arbitrary</span> a) <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Property</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2">exists <span>=</span> forSome <span>$</span> resize <span>1000</span> arbitrary</span>
<span id="cb9-3"></span>
<span id="cb9-4"><span>forSome ::</span> (<span>Show</span> a, <span>Testable</span> prop) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Gen</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> prop) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Property</span></span>
<span id="cb9-5">forSome gen prop <span>=</span></span>
<span id="cb9-6">  mapResult (\r <span>-&gt;</span> r {P.reason <span>=</span> <span>"No witness found."</span>, P.callbacks <span>=</span> []}) <span>$</span></span>
<span id="cb9-7">    once <span>$</span> disjoin <span>$</span> <span>replicate</span> <span>1000</span> <span>$</span> forAll gen prop</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we can rewrite the property <span>\(\exists (x,y) \left [ x \oplus y \neq y \oplus x \right ]\)</span> as follows:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1">    it <span>"is not commutative (via exists)"</span> <span>$</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2">      exists <span>$</span> \(x,y) <span>-&gt;</span> x ⊕ y <span>/=</span> y ⊕ x</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I like how close the Haskell code stays to the concise mathematical formulation! The output of this test fits much better into our intuitive understanding:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1">    <span>is</span> not commutative (via exists)</span>
<span id="cb11-2">      <span>+++</span> OK, passed 1 test.</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="sequential-mapreduce">Sequential MapReduce</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets. Users specify <strong>a map function</strong> that processes a key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/value pairs, <strong>and a reduce function</strong> that merges all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key.</p>
<p>[This] abstraction is inspired by the map and reduce primitives present in Lisp and many other functional languages. <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/16cb30b4b92fd4989b8619a61752a2387c6dd474.pdf">Quoted from Google Research</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m not going into more details here, as You’ll find detailed information on this approach and a working example <a href="https://thma.github.io/posts/2018-11-24-lambda-the-ultimate-pattern-factory.html#map-reduce">in my original article</a>.</p>
<p>Here is the definition of a sequential MapReduce:</p>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1">simpleMapReduce </span>
<span id="cb12-2"><span>  ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b)   <span>-- map function</span></span>
<span id="cb12-3">  <span>-&gt;</span> ([b] <span>-&gt;</span> c) <span>-- reduce function</span></span>
<span id="cb12-4">  <span>-&gt;</span> [a]        <span>-- list to map over</span></span>
<span id="cb12-5">  <span>-&gt;</span> c          <span>-- result</span></span>
<span id="cb12-6">simpleMapReduce mapFunc reduceFunc <span>=</span> reduceFunc <span>.</span> <span>map</span> mapFunc</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can test the sequential MapReduce algorithm with the following property based test:</p>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1">    it <span>"works correctly with a sequential map-reduce"</span> <span>$</span></span>
<span id="cb13-2">      property <span>$</span> \a b c d <span>-&gt;</span> (simpleMapReduce <span>reverse</span> (<span>foldr</span> (⊕) <span>""</span>) [a,b,c,d]) </span>
<span id="cb13-3">                     <span>`shouldBe`</span> (<span>reverse</span> a) ⊕ (<span>reverse</span> b) ⊕ (<span>reverse</span> c) ⊕ (<span>reverse</span> d)</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="excurs-foldmap">Excurs: foldMap</h3>
<p>What I have shown so far just demonstrates the general mechanism of chaining <code>map</code> and <code>reduce</code> functions without implying any parallel execution. Essentially we are chaining a <code>map</code> with a <code>fold</code> (i.e.&nbsp;reduction) function. In the Haskell base library there is a higher order function <code>foldMap</code> that covers exactly this pattern of chaining. Please note that <code>foldMap</code>does only a single traversal of the foldable data structure. It fuses the <code>map</code> and <code>reduce</code> phase into a single one by function composition of <code>mappend</code> and the mapping function <code>f</code>:</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1"><span>-- | Map each element of the structure to a monoid,</span></span>
<span id="cb14-2"><span>-- and combine the results.</span></span>
<span id="cb14-3"><span>foldMap</span><span> ::</span> (<span>Foldable</span> t, <span>Monoid</span> m) <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> m) <span>-&gt;</span> t a <span>-&gt;</span> m</span>
<span id="cb14-4"><span>foldMap</span> f <span>=</span> <span>foldr</span> (<span>mappend</span> <span>.</span> f) <span>mempty</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="parallel-mapreduce">Parallel MapReduce</h2>
<p>Now we come to the tricky part that kicked off this whole discussion: parallelism.</p>
<p>As an example we consider a simple sequential MapReduce, taking an input list of <code>Int</code>s, computing their squares and computing the sum of these squares:</p>
<div id="cb15"><pre><code><span id="cb15-1">λ<span>&gt;</span> simpleMapReduce (<span>^</span><span>2</span>) (<span>foldr</span> (<span>+</span>) <span>0</span>) [<span>1</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>3</span>,<span>4</span>]</span>
<span id="cb15-2"><span>30</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s try to design this as a massively parallelized algorithm:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Mapping of <code>(^2)</code> over the input-list <code>[1,2,3,4]</code> would be started in parallel to the reduction of the intermediary list of squares by <code>(foldr (+) 0)</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The mapping phase will be executed as a set of parallel computations (one for each element of the input list).</p></li>
<li><p>The reduction phase will also be executed as a set of parallel computations (one for each addition).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Of course the reduction phase can begin only when at least one list element is squared. So in effect the mapping process would have to start first. The parallel computation of squares will result in a non-deterministic sequence of computations. In particular it is not guaranteed that all elements of the input list are processed in the original list order. So it might for example …</p></div></div>

<p>Hey readers!</p>
<p>I've open-sourced new <a href="https://github.com/trekhleb/machine-learning-experiments">🤖 Interactive Machine Learning Experiments</a> project on GitHub. Each experiment consists of 🏋️ <em>Jupyter/Colab notebook</em> (to see how a model was trained) and 🎨 <em>demo page</em> (to see a model in action right in your browser).</p>
<p>Although the models may be a little dumb (remember, these are just experiments, not a production ready code), they will try to do their best to:</p>
<ul>
<li>🖌 Recognize digits or sketches you draw in your browser</li>
<li>📸 Detect and recognize the objects you'll show to your camera</li>
<li>🌅 Classify your uploaded image</li>
<li>📝 Write a Shakespeare poem with you</li>
<li>✊🖐✌️ Play with you in Rock-Paper-Scissors game</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've trained the models on <em>Python</em> using <em>TensorFlow 2</em> with <em>Keras</em> support  and then consumed them for a demo in a browser using <em>React</em> and <em>JavaScript</em> version of <em>Tensorflow</em>.</p>

<p>⚠️ First, let's set our expectations.️ The repository contains machine learning <strong>experiments</strong> and <strong>not</strong> a production ready, reusable, optimised and fine-tuned code and models. This is rather a sandbox or a playground for learning and trying different machine learning approaches, algorithms and data-sets. Models might not perform well and there is a place for overfitting/underfitting.</p>
<p>Therefore, sometimes you might see things like this:</p>

<p>I'm a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/trekhleb/">software engineer</a> and for the last several years now I've been doing mostly frontend and backend programming. In my spare time, as a hobby, I decided to dig into machine learning topics to make it less <em>like magic</em> and <em>more like math</em> to myself.</p>
<ol>
<li>🗓 Since <strong>Python</strong> might be a good choice to start experimenting with Machine Learning I decided to learn its basic syntax first. As a result a <a href="https://github.com/trekhleb/learn-python">🐍 Playground and Cheatsheet for Learning Python</a> project came out. This was just to practice Python and at the same time to have a cheatsheet of basic syntax once I need it (for things like <code>dict_via_comprehension = {x: x**2 for x in (2, 4, 6)}</code> etc.).</li>
<li>🗓 After learning a bit of Python I wanted to dig into the basic <strong>math</strong> behind Machine Learning. So after passing an awesome <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng</a> on Coursera the <a href="https://github.com/trekhleb/homemade-machine-learning">🤖 Homemade Machine Learning</a> project came out. This time it was about creating a cheatsheet for basic machine learning math algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, k-means, multilayer perceptron etc.</li>
<li>🗓 The next attempt to play around with basic Machine Learning math was <a href="https://github.com/trekhleb/nano-neuron">🤖 NanoNeuron</a>. It was about 7 simple JavaScript functions that supposed to give you a feeling of how machines can actually "learn".</li>
<li>🗓 After finishing yet another awesome <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning">Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng</a> on Coursera I decided to practice a bit more with <strong>multilayer perceptrons</strong>, <strong>convolutional</strong> and <strong>recurrent neural networks</strong> (CNNs and RNNs). This time instead of implementing everything from scratch I decided to start using some machine learning framework. I ended up using <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow 2</a> with <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/overview">Keras</a>. I also didn't want to focus too much on math (letting the framework do it for me) and instead I wanted to come up with something more practical, applicable and something I could try to play with right in my browser. As a result new <a href="https://github.com/trekhleb/machine-learning-experiments">🤖 Interactive Machine Learning Experiments</a> came out that I want to describe a bit more here.</li>

<ul>
<li>🏋🏻‍ I used <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/overview">Keras</a> inside <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow 2</a> for modelling and training. Since I had zero experience with machine learning frameworks, I needed to start with something. One of the selling points in favor of TensorFlow was that it has both Python and <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/js">JavaScript flavor</a> of the library with similar API. So eventually I used Python version for training and JavaScript version for demos.</li>
<li>🏋🏻‍ I trained TensorFlow models on Python inside <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> notebooks locally and sometimes used <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/">Colab</a> to make the training faster on GPU.</li>
<li>💻 Most of the models were trained on good old MacBook's Pro CPU (2,9 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5).</li>
<li>🔢 Of course there is no way you could run away from <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a> for matrix/tensors operations.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="models-demo">Models demo<a href="#models-demo" aria-label="models demo permalink"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>🏋🏻‍ I used <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/js">TensorFlow.js</a> to do predictions with previously trained models.</li>
<li>♻️ To convert <em>Keras HDF5</em> models to <em>TensorFlow.js Layers</em> format I used <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/tree/master/tfjs-converter">TensorFlow.js converter</a>. This might be inefficient to transfer the whole model (megabytes of data) to the browser instead of making predictions through HTTP requests, but again, remember that these are just experiments and not production-ready code and architecture. I wanted to avoid having a dedicated back-end service to make architecture simpler.</li>
<li>👨🏻‍🎨 The <a href="http://trekhleb.github.io/machine-learning-experiments">Demo application</a> was created on <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> using <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">create-react-app</a> starter with a default <a href="https://flow.org/en/">Flow</a> flavour for type checking.</li>
<li>💅🏻 For styling, I used <a href="https://material-ui.com/">Material UI</a>. It was, as they say, "to kill two birds" at once and try out a new styling framework (sorry, <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> 🤷🏻‍).</li>

<p>As I've mentioned above the main purpose of <a href="https://github.com/trekhleb/machine-learning-experiments">the repository</a> is to be more like a playground for learning rather than for production-ready models. Therefore, the main plan is to <strong>continue learning and experimenting</strong> with deep-learning challenges and approaches. The next interesting challenges to play with might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emotions detection</li>
<li>Style transfer</li>
<li>Language translation</li>
<li>Generating images (i.e. handwritten numbers)</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another interesting opportunity would be to <strong>tune existing models to make them more performant</strong>. I believe it might give a better understanding of how to overcome overfitting and underfitting and what to do with the model if it just stuck on <code>60%</code> accuracy level for both training and validation sets and doesn't want to improve anymore 🤔.</p>
<p>Anyways, I hope you might find some useful insights for models training from <a href="https://github.com/trekhleb/machine-learning-experiments">the repository</a> or at least to have some fun playing around with the demos!</p>
<p>Happy learning! 🤖</p></div></div>]]>

  <em>a 21 minute read (and <a href="https://github.com/bogo/arm64-to-sim">sources</a>) by <a href="https://twitter.com/giertler">Bogo Giertler</a></em>

  <p><img src="https://bogo.wtf/assets/images//Full%20Screenshot.png" alt="M1 Simulator + ARM64"></p>

<p>The screenshot above looks perfectly normal - until you realize that the sample app running on this M1 MacBook is actually a legacy Spotify SDK demo from 2017. Its proprietary binary framework has never been rebuilt to support M1 Macs and cannot run on Apple’s newest computers, unless Xcode is launched through <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_silicon/about_the_rosetta_translation_environment">Rosetta 2</a>.</p>

<p>If you have an M1 Mac, you probably already encountered this issue. A couple of seconds after hitting Run on your favorite project (and going <em>wow, those M1 Macs sure are fast!</em>), you were likely greeted with this:</p>

<p><img src="https://bogo.wtf/assets/images//Xcode%20Linker%20Error.png" alt="Xcode Linker Error"></p>

<div><div><pre><code>ld: in ../../SpotifyiOS.framework/SpotifyiOS(MPMessagePackReader.o), building for iOS Simulator, but linking in object file built for iOS, file '../../SpotifyiOS.framework/SpotifyiOS' for architecture arm64
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In plain English, the proprietary binary framework you’ve been using in your project has not been updated to support iOS Simulator running on M1 Macs. Apple’s advice in this situation is to reach out to the vendor and ask them to release an updated version of the framework - both by migrating it to an XCFramework format, and by rebuilding it to support M1 simulators.</p>

<p>There is a lot of reasons why you might not get your hands on that updated framework anytime soon - or even at all. Commonly, the third-party vendor is slow to react, or you are pinning to a previous major version of the framework for compatibility reasons. Since you likely do not have sources for the original library, you cannot rebuild it yourself either. This means no Simulator builds and no local unit and UI tests. You seemingly hit a dead end and development on an M1 Mac will be very difficult for time being. Or did you?</p>

<p>Last week, I ran into this issue with <a href="https://github.com/spotify/ios-sdk">Spotify’s iOS SDK</a>. With the binary release not updated for over a year, I had to find a way to hack the native ARM64 binary to run in the Simulator. On the way, I learnt a lot about frameworks, binaries, and loaders.  You can find the complete sources for <a href="https://github.com/bogo/arm64-to-sim">arm64-to-sim</a> on GitHub. What follows is a detailed explanation of the ARM64 transmogrification.</p>

<h2 id="-an-idea-takes-root">💡 An Idea Takes Root</h2>
<p>Let’s take a look at the error message again. The error we receive isn’t actually a compiler error - it’s a linker error. <code>ld</code> complains that we are attempting to link in a binary that was compiled for <em>native</em> ARM64 to a binary that is being built for <em>iOS Simulator</em> ARM64.</p>

<p>Historically, the ARM/x86 bifurcation in the Apple product line meant that one could safely assume that code built for <code>i386</code> and <code>x86_64</code> was meant for the Simulator, and code built for <code>armv7</code> and <code>arm64</code> was meant for native devices. This found reflection in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_binary">fat (universal) binaries</a> being a widely used hack for distributing frameworks for Apple platforms that could be used both for devices and simulators.</p>

<p>With the release of M1 Macs, this assumption no longer holds true - an ARM64 slice can now be meant for either. Under the guise of supporting macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS in a single framework, in 2019 Apple released a new bundle framework format, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/416/">XCFramework</a>.</p>

<p>This should give us an idea: since, as indicated by the <code>ld</code> error, we already have a native ARM64 slice in our library, maybe we can repackage it as an iOS Simulator-supporting XCFramework. There is no technical reason why it <em>shouldn’t</em> work - a compiled binary links against symbols of other frameworks and binaries. Since iOS devices and M1 Macs use the same ARM64 instruction set, if the symbols of native and Simulator libraries are sufficiently similar, the library should simply work. We will just need to apply a lot of elbow grease.</p>

<h2 id="-the-anatomy-of-a-xcframework">🫀 The Anatomy of a (XC)Framework</h2>
<p>XCFramework is a pretty straightforward format that is meant to be a drop-in replacement for the original Cocoa Frameworks. Essentially, each XCFramework is a directory containing a property list telling the linker where to find architecture- and plaform-specific copies of each framework.</p>

<p>An example XCFramework looks as follows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Example.xcframework/
|-- Info.plist
|-- ios-arm64/
|   +-- Example.framework/
+-- ios-arm64_x86_64-simulator/
    +-- Example.framework/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The actual mapping of individual frameworks to platforms is done in the <code>Info.plist</code> file. Notice the <code>SupportedArchitectures</code>, <code>SupportedPlatform</code>, and <code>SupportedPlatformVariant</code> properties.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After creating a relevant folder structure and dropping in an <code>Info.plist</code> alongside our legacy <code>.framework</code>, we should now have a real <code>.xcframework</code> on our hands. Let’s emplace the original <code>.framework</code> in Xcode with it and try to build. Of course, it would be too easy if it worked - instead, we get the following:</p>

<p><img src="https://bogo.wtf/assets/images//Xcode%20Linker%20Error%20with%20XCFramework.png" alt="Xcode Linker Error - with XCFramework"></p>

<div><div><pre><code>ld: in /Users/bogo/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/NowPlayingView-aeukgqexpeqlsrdzslkpeehveixs/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/SpotifyiOS.framework/SpotifyiOS(MPMessagePackReader.o), building for iOS Simulator, but linking in object file built for iOS, file '/Users/bogo/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/NowPlayingView-aeukgqexpeqlsrdzslkpeehveixs/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/SpotifyiOS.framework/SpotifyiOS' for architecture arm64
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since the Cocoa Framework is coming from <code>DerivedData</code>, we can be sure we assembled our XCFramework correctly. Still, we are back to square one - despite our naïve wrapping, the linker can still tell that we are bringing in a native library. Here’s our new objective: to find a way to convince <code>ld</code> that the library is actually a Simulator library.</p>

<h2 id="️-into-the-binary">🕵️ Into the Binary</h2>

<p>Let’s take a look inside our framework and see what files could be informing it about the platform.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Example.framework/
|-- Info.plist
|-- Example
|-- Headers/
|   |-- A.h
|   |-- B.h
|   +-- C.h
+-- Modules/
    +-- module.modulemap
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Cursory browsing of the human-readable contents of the framework does not yield any hints, so the linker must be using the contents of the binary file itself to infer the Simulator information. Since, we don’t really know what to look for, let’s dig into the binaries of other XCFrameworks out there first.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk/blob/master/Package.swift#L244">FirebaseAnalytics.xcframework</a> is a particularly good XCFramework to investigate - it contains both native and Simulator binaries. The obvious first idea is to search for Simulator references in the human-readable strings of the binary:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># in the FirebaseAnalytics.xcframework directory</span>
<span>$ </span>strings ios-arm64_i386_x86_64-simulator/FirebaseAnalytics.framework/FirebaseAnalytics | <span>grep</span> <span>-i</span> sim
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The result is a bunch of rather uninteresting strings, none of them mentioning the Simulator. We can make an educated guess that the Simulator information is thus encoded in the machine-readable segment of the binary. To extract it, we can use <code>otool</code> - a tool meant to explore the executable files produced by LLVM. The <code>-fahl</code> parameter prints the relevant  fat, archive, and Mach-O headers, as well as the load commands.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># in the FirebaseAnalytics.xcframework directory</span>
<span>$ </span>otool <span>-fahl</span> ios-arm64_i386_x86_64-simulator/FirebaseAnalytics.framework/FirebaseAnalytics
<span>(</span>...<span>)</span>
Load <span>command </span>2
      cmd LC_LINKER_OPTIMIZATION_HINT
  cmdsize 16
  dataoff 12464
 datasize 760
Load <span>command </span>3
     cmd LC_SYMTAB
 cmdsize 24
  symoff 13224
   nsyms 201
  stroff 16440
 strsize 5064
<span>(</span>...<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Whoops, that’s a lot of data! The offsets and addresses and sizes are doing us no good and are likely to be different between platforms. Let’s constrain our search to load commands, save the results, and compare them:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># in the FirebaseAnalytics.xcframework directory</span>
<span>$ </span>otool <span>-fahl</span> ios-arm64_i386_x86_64-simulator/FirebaseAnalytics.framework/FirebaseAnalytics | <span>grep</span> <span>-E</span> <span>'cmd |\.o'</span> <span>&gt;</span> simulator_cmds

<span>$ </span>otool <span>-fahl</span> ios-arm64_armv7/FirebaseAnalytics.framework/FirebaseAnalytics | <span>grep</span> <span>-E</span> <span>'cmd |\.o'</span> <span>&gt;</span> native_cmds

<span>$ </span>diff <span>-u</span> native_cmds simulator_cmds
<span>-ios-arm64_armv7</span>/FirebaseAnalytics.framework/FirebaseAnalytics<span>(</span>FirebaseAnalytics_vers.o<span>)</span>:
+ios-arm64_i386_x86_64-simulator/FirebaseAnalytics.framework/FirebaseAnalytics<span>(</span>FirebaseAnalytics_vers.o<span>)</span>:
       cmd LC_SEGMENT_64
-      cmd LC_VERSION_MIN_IPHONEOS
+      cmd LC_BUILD_VERSION
      cmd LC_SYMTAB
<span>(</span>...<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Alright, we got a match! Seems that the Simulator binary contains  an <code>LC_BUILD_VERSION</code> load command, while the native binary contains an <code>LC_VERSION_MIN_IPHONEOS</code> load command in the same place. A pass with <code>otool</code> on our unsupported, native-only <code>.framework</code> confirms this theory. A bit of Googling reveals that <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D85358">this specific difference</a> is used by LLDB to distinguish Simulator and native binaries. We are on the right track then - looks like substituting <code>LC_VERSION_MIN_IPHONEOS</code> with <code>LC_BUILD_VERSION</code> might be just enough to fool <code>ld</code>.</p>

<h2 id="-meet-the-librarian">📚 Meet the Librarian</h2>
<p>So far, we’ve been playing with a fat binary, containing multiple platform-specific slices. We can see architectures available in a binary using the <code>file</code> command:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>For the last few days, I’ve been scouring the web for “no-code” founder interviews. The goal was to find insights on which acquisition channels worked for them on getting new users. Here are the top 9 acquisition channels I’ve found to be working for no-code SaaS companies:&nbsp;</span></p><h2><strong>1. Product Hunt</strong></h2><p><span><strong><a href="https://producthunt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ProductHunt.com</a></strong> is the biggest website in the world for launching your product. NoCode is a directory of no-code tools and they’ve used ProductHunt to <strong><a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/building-a-directory-of-tools-and-resources-for-non-technical-makers-0db30533a5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">launch successfully</a></strong>.</span></p><blockquote><p><span>A few weeks after publicly launching the site, I was fortunate enough to get featured on Product Hunt. This provided a huge boost of traffic to the site, providing me with a couple of hundred email subscribers and loads of constructive feedback to consider.</span></p></blockquote><h2><strong>2. Integration marketing</strong></h2><p><span>Is there an event/website/class you can integrate with? Bubble (making $100k+/month) (the biggest no-code tool online) did just that in order to get new users:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>The following year (2013) we did a pilot at Harvard Business School, which I had just graduated from”. Their first-year entrepreneurship class required students to build something under a very tight budget, and Bubble was a good solution for this. It got us a few more users, some of whom now use Bubble to professionally build apps for corporations!</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Source: <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/creating-a-100-000-mo-business-that-helps-people-learn-to-code-c5e87bdbf9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interview</a> – <a id="ember58" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/estraschnov?id=wo2QqEVUM9c2p0eB81oZSPQb9R13"><span>Emmanuel Straschnov</span></a>&nbsp;</span></p><h2><strong>&nbsp;3. LinkedIn Outreach</strong></h2><p><span>You can use LinkedIn to reach people in a certain position within a company. This is what MySocialApp ($8K/month) did to get new users. They’re a tool to help companies build social apps without code:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>How did we find prospects? Our premium LinkedIn account was the most effective. LinkedIn’s filters allow you to search for people of any position, so it’s a really good tool for finding and involving the right contacts. Marketing automation is our new main focus, and we invest in it to maximize sales conversions.</span></p></blockquote><p>Source: <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/social-media-platform-as-a-service-growing-to-8k-mo-2e608c3258" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interview</a> – <a id="ember58" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/ev0xmusic?id=tA7oV5tgGrdxcKRFt3sUVCfw1uD3"><span>Romaric Philogène</span></a></p><h2><strong>&nbsp;4. “Powered by” marketing&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><span>MySocialApp ($8K/mo) is a no-code tool to create a social media app. Before creating it, the founder worked on Nousmotards, which was a social media app for motorcyclists.</span></p><blockquote><p><span>Over the three years we spent working on Nousmotards, many people contacted us to find out if we were using a pre-made solution for its technical infrastructure, which got us thinking about MySocialApp.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Source: <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/social-media-platform-as-a-service-growing-to-8k-mo-2e608c3258" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interview</a> – <a id="ember58" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/ev0xmusic?id=tA7oV5tgGrdxcKRFt3sUVCfw1uD3"><span>Romaric Philogène</span></a></span></p><p><span>This got them the initial idea about MySocialApp; users asking them what Nousmotards is “powered by”. This also happened with many other no-code startups we analyzed. Someone will see your no-code widget on their website, see a “powered by X” link and sign up. Live chat companies are the most famous example.</span></p><h2><strong>&nbsp;5. Meetups as acquisition channels</strong></h2><p><span>Online/offline <strong><a href="https://www.solveo.co/work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hackathons</a></strong>, meetups, local conferences. There are plenty of happening each and every day and participating/sponsoring them can be a great way to get new users. This is what Bubble did:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><blockquote><p><span>We started “recruiting” users at tech meetups in New York. With the startup wave, everybody was looking for a tech co-founder, and there were plenty of co-founder-dating meetups. We went there and told people that while we couldn’t be their tech co-founders, they could use Bubble, as it would allow them to build the whole thing themselves. We had a few skeptical responses, but a few teams decided to try it, and they stuck with us for more than a year! </span></p></blockquote><p><span>Source: <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/creating-a-100-000-mo-business-that-helps-people-learn-to-code-c5e87bdbf9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interview</a> – <a id="ember58" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/estraschnov?id=wo2QqEVUM9c2p0eB81oZSPQb9R13"><span>Emmanuel Straschnov</span></a></span></p><h2><strong>6. Guest posting&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><span>Guest posting worked for NoCode ($400/mo) – a directory of no-code tools (so non-technical founders can create what only technical founders could in the past):</span></p><blockquote><p><span>I have also done some guest blogging on other prominent sites that work really well, increasing the number of high-quality backlinks to the site and in turn slowly improving my SEO ranking. It’s not something you see instant results with. However, it’s certainly worth the effort. </span></p></blockquote><p><span>Source: <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/building-a-directory-of-tools-and-resources-for-non-technical-makers-0db30533a5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interview</a> – <a id="ember58" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/thisdickie?id=q4tUifsiQNZWCoNqGb1kVg3BYvj2"><span>Sam Dickie</span></a></span></p><h2><strong>7. Your own marketplace</strong></h2><p><span>If you get big enough, you’ll want to make use out of the users you have. Creating a marketplace is one way to do it. This is what Bubble ($100k/month) did:</span></p><p><em><span>What’s your business model, and how have you grown your revenue?</span></em></p><blockquote><p><span>We also have a marketplace where users can build templates or plugins and get compensated for them. There were a few different models before the current one, but they weren’t as clear to our users. We started charging by user visits and then by workflow runs, but we’ve learned from users that server capacity is the best resource to sell. </span></p></blockquote><p><span>Source: <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/creating-a-100-000-mo-business-that-helps-people-learn-to-code-c5e87bdbf9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interview</a> – <a id="ember58" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/estraschnov?id=wo2QqEVUM9c2p0eB81oZSPQb9R13"><span>Emmanuel Straschnov</span></a></span></p><h2><strong>&nbsp;8. BetaList</strong></h2><p><span><a href="https://betalist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BetaList.com</a> is a popular website where people can get early, beta access (thus the name “Beta”) to various (mostly digital) products.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;NoCode ($400/mo), a directory of no-code tools, used BetaList successfully:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>Initially, as I was creating NoCode I built a quick landing page with an email capture form and a mocked-up screenshot of the homepage using Canva.</span></p><p><span>I then managed to get featured on BetaList where I got about 35 signups. I later used those interested early adopters to test my initial prototypes of the site and get feedback on some of my ideas. This approach proved incredibly valuable information and helped validate some of my early assumptions.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>This was my butt ugly landing page in 2016: <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/indie-hackers.appspot.com/content/nocode__original.png" rel="magnific" target="_blank">Landing Page Lander</a></span></p><p><span>Source: <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/building-a-directory-of-tools-and-resources-for-non-technical-makers-0db30533a5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interview</a> – <a id="ember58" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/thisdickie?id=q4tUifsiQNZWCoNqGb1kVg3BYvj2"><span>Sam Dickie</span></a></span></p><h2><strong>&nbsp;9. SEO (after being successful with other acquisition channels)</strong></h2><p><span>SEO often reveals itself as an acquisition strategy as you focus on other acquisition channels. You notice a certain % of people come from Google / convert as paying customers, you see what keywords they come from and then start to proactively focus on <a href="https://jelvix.com/blog/saas-business-metrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ranking higher</a> for those &amp; related terms. This is what happened to NoCode:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>To improve my SEO I hired a freelance SEO expert via Fiverr to optimize the site as I didn’t have a clue how to structure my site map or meta tags. After a few months, I noticed a substantial improvement in traffic coming via Google.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>A lot of my traffic now comes from my mockup generator directory which ranks number 2 on Google when you search for the term ‘online mockup generator’.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Source: <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/building-a-directory-of-tools-and-resources-for-non-technical-makers-0db30533a5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interview</a> – <a id="ember58" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/thisdickie?id=q4tUifsiQNZWCoNqGb1kVg3BYvj2"><span>Sam Dickie</span></a></span></p><h2><strong>Want more acquisition channels?</strong></h2><p><span>I’ve spent 2 years researching acquisition channels that work consistently/repeatedly for founders. Go to <a href="https://zerotousers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ZeroToUsers.com</a> to see my preliminary findings.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><img src="https://serhack.me/images/bitcoin-getting-started/social_oasis.jpg"><figcaption><h4>A man looks for Bitcoin Oasis</h4></figcaption></figure><p>If you have heard about blockchain or cryptocurrency, then the term that initially comes to mind is <a href="https://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a>. Launched 12 years ago, it was the late 2017 bull run that created a media frenzy that propelled Bitcoin into the mainstream and our modern day lexicon.</p><p>Often labeled as the “original” cryptocurrency, <a href="https://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a> has been the catalyst (directly and/or indirectly) behind many new innovations in the blockchain and digital asset space, most notably <a href="https://ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a> and <a href="https://getmonero.org/">Monero</a>. Shortly after the late 2017 bull run lost its steam, interest in these new technologies started to fade ― but here we are in 2021 with Bitcoin having risen like a phoenix from the ashes. As you would assume, an appetite for the blockchain and digital asset space has returned and now it is more important than ever that we understand what exactly is behind this unique asset, Bitcoin.</p><p>This article is meant to be a guide for individuals who are new to cryptocurrency and want to learn about <a href="https://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a>, specifically its use case and the different ways to become involved in the broader blockchain and digital asset space. My goal is to educate you on the basics and make sure that you walk away with a newfound perspective and understanding of <a href="https://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a>.</p><h2 id="what-is-bitcoin">What is Bitcoin?</h2><p>Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash whose transactions are recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. In late October 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto (whose identity is still unknown) published a white paper titled <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"><em>Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System</em></a> on bitcoin.org (registered in August 2008) and subsequently posted it to <a href="https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-October/014810.html">a cryptography mailing list</a>. On January 3, 2009, the Bitcoin network was created when Satoshi Nakamoto mined the initial block of the chain, which is called the genesis block.</p><p>In essence, Bitcoin is a decentralized type of “digital money” that can be used by anyone around the world, at any time, and without restrictions or a central authority. Bitcoin is not backed by any bank or government and originally allowed users to freely send and/or spend it anywhere without trusting third parties.</p><p>At inception, the price of Bitcoin was approximately $0.01 and, as of today, the price has surpassed $40,000 per coin ― with many believing that it can grow exponentially higher to levels between $100,000 and $250,000 in the next year or so.</p><figure><img src="https://serhack.me/images/bitcoin-getting-started/extras_1_blockchain-80.jpg"><figcaption><h4>The transactions data are memorized through a chain-of-blocks</h4></figcaption></figure><p>Given that Bitcoin exists and operates within the confounds of the Internet, all user balances are kept on an immutable and fully transparent blockchain. Put simply, each Bitcoin transaction is broadcasted to the Bitcoin network and grouped with several other transactions in the form of a block, which the network’s miners validate. Once the block is accepted, the transactions get recorded on the blockchain (which, as you may recall, is a public ledger). Whenever this process is successfully completed, the network distributes new Bitcoin to miners for each block that has been validated ― this is referred to as a block reward.</p><p>The peculiarity of the blockchain is its distribution and decentralized properties, as all the nodes share a valid copy of the public ledger. In the Bitcoin network, nodes play a very important role ― think of them as “protectors” who are constantly monitoring Bitcoin’s blockchain to distinguish legitimate Bitcoin transactions from illegitimate ones. The basic job of a node is to prevent attempts to double-spend Bitcoins that have already been spent elsewhere. In addition, the process of mining is essential to validating transactions, as it ensures the overall trustworthiness and security of the payment network.</p><h2 id="advantages-and-limitations">Advantages and Limitations</h2><p>Members of the cryptocurrency community, who range from the tech savvy to your average retail investor, have adopted various perspectives regarding the fundamental driver of Bitcoin’s value (both in financial and non-financial terms).</p><p>On one side, there are the Bitcoin Maximalists who believe that Bitcoin is the ultimate financial innovation and will assume a mainstream role in global society ― to maximalists, other cryptocurrencies and traditional financial instruments are inferior. On the other side, you have cryptocurrency enthusiasts who believe Bitcoin’s technology is outdated and that other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, have more expansive utility.</p><p>These arguments and differences of opinion (as it relates to Bitcoin) can often become confusing, so let’s dig deeper into some of the most common discussion points with hopes that you can decipher for yourself.</p><h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3><ul><li>A blockchain is managed autonomously using <strong>a peer-to-peer network</strong> and cannot be shut down ― the only way to stop it is through shutting down or banning Internet access. (Note: Even though a blockchain or Bitcoin cannot be shut down, some jurisdictions have imposed restrictions on citizens that limit or ban the holding or trading of Bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrencies.)</li><li>There is no need to trust a third party. <strong>You are your own bank!</strong></li><li>Relatively quick and cheap transactions without intermediary fees (around 10 minutes on average per transaction), when compared to most leading cryptocurrencies.</li><li>Increasing adoption by merchants and individuals across the globe.</li><li>Largest market capitalization and name recognition, which will continue to promote its growth and (hopefully) price stability.</li></ul><h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3><ul><li><strong>Lack of anonymity</strong> as transactions that take place in the Bitcoin network, along with many other leading cryptocurrencies, are fully transparent and can potentially be linked via chain analysis. In addition, strict AML/KYC regulations require many of the leading cryptocurrency trading exchanges to verify your most sensitive personal information.</li><li>Slow and expensive transactions, when compared to lesser known cryptocurrencies that can be sent within seconds and at a fraction of the cost.</li><li>Irreversible transactions. Once a transaction is sent, you cannot undo or cancel the transaction.</li><li>Achievement of its status as a currency will be challenging due to its volatile nature (i.e. swings in price) and regulations.</li><li>The core technology has some subtle limits that make Bitcoin outdated in comparison with other cryptocurrencies.</li></ul><p>Along with Bitcoin Maximalists and cryptocurrency enthusiasts, you have many individuals who simply like to be long-term holders of Bitcoin (because they believe in the fundamentals and value proposition) and others who speculate on the short-term price (e.g. day traders).</p><p>Whatever side you are on, there is no question that Bitcoin has established itself as a serious contender in the financial world and is here to stay for the time being. There may be other alternatives, but the granddaddy of cryptocurrencies still has the spotlight!</p><h2 id="how-to-obtain-bitcoin-from-an-exchange">How to Obtain Bitcoin from an Exchange</h2><p>Now that you have an understanding of Bitcoin and its utility, you may be interested in purchasing some. If that is the case, you have come to the right place as buying it is now easier than ever due to the growing number of exchanges and companies making Bitcoin accessible to the masses.</p><p>Some of the most well-known exchanges that allow you to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are <a href="https://coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a>, <a href="https://www.gemini.com/">Gemini</a>, <a href="https://www.kraken.com/">Kraken</a>, <a href="https://binance.com/">Binance</a>, and <a href="https://www.huobi.com/en-us/">Huobi</a>. While all of these exchanges list Bitcoin, not all of them offer the same cryptocurrencies ― so, it is recommended to open accounts across a few exchanges to ensure that you are provided adequate exposure.</p><p>Once you have created an account on an exchange, you can transfer your local fiat money via ACH or bank wire to the exchange. From there, you can purchase Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency in exchange for your local fiat money. In addition, after purchasing Bitcoin, you can exchange it for another cryptocurrency that you might not be able to purchase with your local fiat money. While some exchanges offer credit card purchases of Bitcoin, please keep in mind that the fees associated with this transaction are typically very high.</p><figure><img src="https://serhack.me/images/bitcoin-getting-started/extras_2_exchange-80.jpg"><figcaption><h4>You can exchange central currencies (EUR, USD) to BTC, but sacrificing privacy.</h4></figcaption></figure><p>Using any of the exchanges listed above is the easiest and most convenient way to purchase Bitcoin, as the majority of the other cryptocurrency exchanges do not support fiat currencies. This being the case, you can only exchange other cryptocurrencies (like Ethereum or Monero) for Bitcoin. <a href="https://cash.app/">Cash App</a> and <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/crypto">PayPal</a>, some of the largest financial technology companies, offer its users the ability to purchase Bitcoin. While this is extremely convenient for users of these platforms, the downside for PayPal (not Cash App) is that your Bitcoin must remain on its platform, so you cannot transfer or send it. Remember: Not your keys, not your coins.</p><p>If you are not keen on using any of the methods described above, Bitcoin ATMs are a great alternative. There are over 14,000 physical ATMs worldwide, most of which can be found in major cities at peculiar locations such as a shopping mall, burger restaurant, or a bar. All you need to do is deposit cash and enter your Bitcoin address. Once you have completed the transaction, the funds will be sent to you. This is a very simple process and typically does not require any identity verification, but beware of high fees!</p><h2 id="who-accepts-bitcoin">Who Accepts Bitcoin?</h2><p>Over the years, many individuals and businesses have begun accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment. From time to time, you might have noticed stickers on a shop’s window that says “Bitcoin accepted here.” As mentioned above, after the bull run of late 2017 died down, overall interest in cryptocurrencies (especially Bitcoin) amongst merchants began to wane. Today, Bitcoin and the broader digital asset space has bounced back from a pricing perspective and, with this, so has the interest amongst merchants who have triggered another wave of increased acceptance, most notably <a href="https://apnews.com/article/financial-markets-elon-musk-bitcoin-061817c6795e75d1c3c9e9d6cfc4a911">Tesla</a> disclosing that it has invested approximately $1.5 billion into Bitcoin and that the company plans to accept Bitcoin as payment for its electric vehicles.</p><p>There have been a few prominent …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="h.l7qn47u1544x"><span>Building web apps without a SPA - A case study</span></p><p><span>We all know that feeling. You’re scrolling through a page that’s full of mostly static content - constantly being interrupted by spinners - and the thought hits you, “Why did they use Javascript for this?”</span></p><p><span>Now this might not always be fair. I’ve done a fair amount of web development and there is definitely a time and a place for a SPA. And rendering libraries like React make client side work an absolute pleasure. But that’s not what I’m going to write about today. I’m going to write about all the </span><span>other</span><span>&nbsp;cases. Or as I like to call it, 73.6% of the internet.</span></p><p><span>My fiance is studying to become a veterinary physiotherapist. She has to learn </span><span>a lot</span><span>&nbsp;of animal body parts. She’s picked up a few books along the way to help her memorise various animal parts that normally look something like this:</span></p><p><span><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/kALs0Nu-AjBdB7ujRxyewUokHCMcT-idZaQ0aqQrhVJUP8x3c1g4Hf3E_3A_DZWW-TOdcig3Y_gl3Z8zzE0uqPyEh0I2fI6Gw1nX_VGNnOMX1ekeUI8nrdKaxeet8SYKkLqsLbeg" title=""></span></p><p><span>Ladies and Gentlemen, the canine</span></p><p><span>I took a look at the content she was studying and thought it would probably be handy if we could put all those pictures into a little quiz app so that she could test herself. After a bit of requirements gathering, it was decided it needed to support:</span></p><ul><li><span>Profiles</span></li><li><span>A group management system to share profiles with others</span></li><li><span>Referencing and tags</span></li><li><span>Some way for her to upload pictures and map body parts</span></li><li><span>Quizzes (of course!)</span></li></ul><p><span>To keep it simple, we added two types of quizzes. The first kind points to a body part and asks you to choose what limb it is. The second kind of quiz names a part and asks you to select it on the picture. All you need to do is first prepare quizzes by uploading images and selecting the limbs.</span></p><p><span>This is what is ends up looking like:</span></p><p><span><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lLiY8kQz2JfDyeySZgzE6cC24HcQ_0MAw5a8ePJA1y94d5j-gDvv2e5aKOuYW7g0sKqW2qTfxKydlL1n_qCydremS_9GUpD-B9ymUfsXhwqxnjCbDkJD1TOiof5vU2vnxiZuKC_d" title=""></span></p><p><span>And here is what a quiz looks like:</span></p><p><span><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/nlY63N83LNXIJmA9fp530SXydjZIO16NLY1HUP9MVw-nQHQIYbU0RoglAf-QOSYgd3Yzwxz1WjnTCuFNxeAaFbgJxHFafhFQYQwB029O_ht-BbyN8kFKyEn-aYPOlIglV4lTKroJ" title=""></span></p><p><span>Nothing about this is particularly complex. I probably took around a day or so in total to add everything we wanted. I worked fast and loose and skipped automated tests because I don’t plan to work on it further (and most of it is CRUD operations).</span></p><p><span>What I would like to emphasize at this point is that I’ve seen many projects with a similar scope become a React/Angular/Bitcoin app. There are a few reasons I can think of (off the top of my head) for this:</span></p><ol start="1"><li><span>The developer would like to learn a new stack (nothing wrong with this!)</span></li><li><span>The developer uses it out of muscle memory</span></li><li><span>The developer wants to create an app like experience and things this will result in faster performance</span></li></ol><p><span>I have no issue with the first reason. I also don’t have an issue with the second reason when you just want to get something done fast and you’re comfortable with a way of working. What I would like to question however is the third reason.</span></p><p><span>When working on a smaller project, I often find that it is both simpler to reason with, and faster to write everything in the backend. And I don’t just mean faster in terms of development. I think you can make a much faster system overall when you’re not sending a bulky javascript bundle that needs to perform client side rendering.</span></p><p><span>As it turns out, a lot of people think server side rendering is slow simply because of the downloading and parsing browsers need to do with javascript. But there’s a handy little library I absolutely love that alleviates this problem entirely. </span><span><a href="https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks">Turbolinks</a></span><span>&nbsp;(made by the good folks at </span><span><a href="https://basecamp.com/">basecamp</a></span><span>) intercepts the links on your page and replaces them with ajax requests. It then takes care of placing the content back in your page. What this means is that you can entirely work </span><span>as if</span><span>&nbsp;your app is entirely server side, while still leaving it feeling very much like a web app. And the best part is we get to leave the browser to do the rendering work instead of a javascript engine! Browsers are actually pretty good at doing that.</span></p><p><span>Here’s what it ends up looking like in action:</span></p><p><span><img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-blx8YYUJdB1_aOeLIz7VAlPxsVolWFfNOA9uMvo1r41gUFUG-lv-u3wrqx6tRq5BOCRy5oJF4kDsNBh5UjH8hCsC6Bowlcl3umzLrAWlJHJUTyPQRB16VA-EdLMp0Xao_vAVFa4" title=""></span></p><p><span>Disclaimer:</span><span>&nbsp;I haven’t given it a go yet because it’s still in beta but the basecamp team has moved onto </span><span><a href="https://github.com/hotwired/turbo">Turbo</a></span><span>&nbsp;which is supposed to replace Turbolinks.</span></p><p><span>Then just to be extra safe, for the small parts of javascript I do use (for the quiz questions) I use </span><span><a href="https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/">rollup</a></span><span>&nbsp;to bundle it together. This ends up producing a very nice and small javascript bundle because I refused to use any javascript dependencies for the client side code. The bundle clocks in around 3.9kB.</span></p><p><span>What this results in is a very light weight, and easy to develop web app. Obviously there’s not a silver bullet that solves all problems but the next time you’re building a web app, it might be worth taking a step back and asking the question, “Do I really need a javascript frontend framework for this?”</span></p><p><span>As always you can find the code here if you want to take a deeper look:</span></p><p><span><a href="https://gitlab.com/BenWiser/physio-quiz">https://gitlab.com/BenWiser/physio-quiz</a></span></p></div></div>]]>

<p>In this post we’ll discuss how Spotify optimized and sped up elements from our largest Dataflow job, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/02/18/spotify-unwrapped-how-we-brought-you-a-decade-of-data/" target="_blank">Wrapped 2019</a>, for <a href="https://open.spotify.com/genre/2020-page">Wrapped 2020</a> using a technique called Sort Merge Bucket (SMB) join. We’ll present the design and implementation of SMB and how we incorporated it into our data pipelines.</p>



<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>Shuffle is the core building block for many big data transforms, such as a join, GroupByKey, or other reduce operations. Unfortunately, it’s also one of the most expensive steps in many pipelines. Sort Merge Bucket is an optimization that reduces shuffle by doing work up front on the producer side. The intuition is that for datasets commonly and frequently joined on a known key, e.g., user events with user metadata on a user ID, we can write them in bucket files with records bucketed and sorted by that key. By knowing which files contain a subset of keys and in what order, shuffle becomes a matter of merge-sorting values from matching bucket files, completely eliminating costly disk and network I/O of moving key–value pairs around. Andrea Nardelli carried out the original investigation on Sort Merge Buckets for his <a href="http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1334587/FULLTEXT01.pdf">2018 master’s thesis</a>, and we started looking into generalizing the idea as a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://spotify.github.io/scio/extras/Sort-Merge-Bucket.html" target="_blank">Scio module</a> afterwards.</p>



<h2>Design and Implementation</h2>



<p>The majority of the data pipelines at Spotify are written in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/spotify/scio" target="_blank">Scio</a>, a Scala API for <a href="https://beam.apache.org/">Apache Beam</a>, and run on the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow">Google Cloud Dataflow</a> service. We implemented SMB in Java to be closer to the native Beam SDK (and even wrote and collaborated on a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AQlonN8t4YJrARcWzepyP7mWHTxHAd6WIECwk1s3LQQ/edit?usp=sharing">design document with the Beam community</a>), and provide Scala syntactic sugar in Scio like many other I/Os. The design is modularized into the main components listed below — we’ll start with the two top-level SMB <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#transforms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PTransforms</a> — the write and read operations SortedBucketSink and SortedBucketSource.</p>



<h3>SortedBucketSink</h3>



<p>This transform writes a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#pcollections" target="_blank">PCollection</a>&lt;T&gt; (where T has a corresponding <a href="https://github.com/spotify/scio/blob/master/scio-smb/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/extensions/smb/FileOperations.java" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FileOperations&lt;T&gt;</a> instance) in SMB format. It first extracts keys and assigns bucket IDs using logic provided by <a href="https://github.com/spotify/scio/blob/master/scio-smb/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/extensions/smb/BucketMetadata.java" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BucketMetadata</a>, groups key–values by the ID, sorts all values, and then writes them into files corresponding to bucket IDs using the FileOperations instance.</p>



<p>In addition to the bucket files, a JSON file is also written to the output directory representing the information from BucketMetadata that’s necessary to read the source: the number of buckets, the hashing scheme, and the instructions to extract the key from each record (for example, for Avro records we can encode this instruction with the name of the GenericRecord field containing the key).</p>

<h3>SortedBucketSource</h3>



<p>This transform reads from one or more sources written in SMB format with the same key and hashing scheme. It opens file handles for corresponding buckets from each source (using FileOperations&lt;T&gt; for that input type) and merges them while maintaining sorted order. Results are emitted as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/transforms/join/CoGbkResult.java" target="_blank">CoGbkResult</a> objects per key group, the same class Beam uses for regular Cogroup operations, so the user can extract the results per source with the correct parameterized type.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="365" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image7-700x365.png" alt="" srcset="https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image7-700x365.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image7-250x130.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image7-768x400.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image7-120x63.png 120w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image7.png 1067w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></figure>



<h3>FileOperations</h3>



<p>FileOperations abstracts away the reading and writing of individual bucket files. Since we need fine-grained control over the exact elements and their order in every file, we cannot leverage the existing Beam file I/Os, which operate on a PCollection level and abstract away the locality and order of elements. Instead, SMB file operations happen at a lower level of BoundedSource for input and ParDo for output. Currently Avro, BigQuery TableRow JSON, and TensorFlow TFRecord/Example records are supported. We plan to add other formats like Parquet as well.</p>



<h3>BucketMetadata</h3>



<p>This class abstracts the keying and bucketing of elements, and includes information such as key field, class, number of buckets, shards, and hash function. The metadata is serialized as a JSON file alongside data files when writing, and used to check compatibility when reading SMB sources.</p>



<h3>Optimizations and Variants</h3>



<p>Over the last year and a half we’ve been adopting SMB at Spotify for various use cases, and accumulated many improvements to handle the scale and complexity of our data pipelines.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Date partitioning:</strong> At Spotify, event data is written to Google Cloud Services (GCS) in hourly or daily partitions. A common data engineering use case is to read many partitions in a single pipeline — for example, to compute stream count over the last seven days. For a non-SMB read, this can be easily done in a single PTransform using wildcard file patterns to match files across multiple directories. However, unlike most File I/Os in Beam, the SMB Read API requires the input to be specified as a directory, rather than a file pattern (this is because we need to check the directory’s metadata.json file as well as the actual record files). Additionally, it must match up bucket files across partitions as well as across different sources, while ensuring that the CoGbkResult output correctly groups data from all partitions of a source into the same TupleTag key. We evolved the SMB Read API to accept one or more directories <em>per source</em>.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Sharding:</strong> Although the Murmur class of hash functions we use during bucket assignment usually ensures an even distribution of records across buckets, in some instances one or more buckets may be disproportionately large if the key space is skewed, creating possible OOM errors when grouping and sorting records. In this case, we allow users to specify a number of <em>shards</em> to further split each bucket file. During the bucket assignment step, a value between [0, numShards) is generated randomly <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runtime/model/#bundling-and-persistence"><em>per bundle</em></a>. Since this value is computed completely orthogonally to the bucket ID, it can break up large key groups across files. Since each shard is still written in sorted order, they can simply be merged together at read time.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Parallelism:</strong> Since the number of buckets in an SMB sink is always a power of 2, we can come up with a joining scheme across sources with different numbers of buckets based off of a desired level of parallelism specified by the user. For example, if the user wants to join Source 1 with 4 buckets and Source 2 with 2 buckets, they can specify either:<ul><li><strong>Minimum parallelism,</strong> or “Merge Greatest Buckets” strategy: 2 parallel readers will be created. Each reader will read 2 buckets from source A and 1 from source B, merging them together. Because bucket IDs are assigned by taking the integer hash value of the key modulo the desired number of buckets, mathematically we know that the key spaces of the merged buckets overlap.</li><li><strong>Maximum parallelism,</strong> or “Least Bucket Replication” strategy: 4 parallel readers will be created. Each reader will read 1 bucket from Source A and 1 from Source B. After merging each key group, the reader will have to rehash the key modulo the greatest number of buckets, to avoid emitting duplicate values. Therefore, even though this strategy achieves a higher level of parallelism, there is some overhead of computing duplicate values and rehashing to eliminate them.</li><li><strong>Auto parallelism:</strong> Creates a number of readers between minimal and maximal amounts, based on a desired split size value provided by the Runner at runtime.</li></ul></li></ul>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="459" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image3-700x459.png" alt="" srcset="https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image3-700x459.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image3-250x164.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image3-768x504.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image3-120x79.png 120w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image3.png 1115w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></figure>



<ul><li><strong>SortedBucketTransform:</strong> A common usage pattern is for pipelines to enrich an existing dataset by joining it with one or more other sources, then writing it to an output location. We decided to specifically support this in SMB with a unique PTransform that reads, transforms, and writes output using the same keying and bucketing scheme. By doing the read/transform/write logic per bucket on the same worker, we can avoid having to reshuffle the data and recompute buckets — since the key is the same, we know that the transformed elements from bucket M of the inputs also correspond to bucket M in the output, in the same sorted order as they were read from.</li></ul>

<ul><li><strong>External Sort:</strong> We made a number of improvements to Beam’s <a href="https://github.com/apache/beam/tree/master/sdks/java/extensions/sorter">external sorter extension</a>, including replacing the Hadoop sequence file with the native file I/O, removing the 2GB memory limit, and reducing disk usage and coder overhead.</li></ul>



<h2>Adoption — Core Data Producers</h2>



<p>Since SMB requires data to be bucketed and sorted in a specific fashion, the adoption naturally starts from the producer of that data. A majority of the Spotify data processing relies on a few core data sets that act as single sources of truth for various business domains like streaming activities, user metadata and streaming context. We worked with the maintainer of these data sets to convert a year’s worth of data to SMB format.</p>



<p>Implementation was straightforward since SortedBucketSink is mostly a drop-in replacement for the vanilla Avro sink with some extra settings. We were using Avro sink with the sharding option to control the number and size of output files. After migrating to SMB, we did not notice any major bump in terms of vCPU, vRAM, or wall time since sharding requires a full shuffle similar to the additional cost of SMB sinks. A few other settings we have since had to tweak:</p>



<ul><li>Agree on user_id as a hexadecimal string as bucket and sort key, since we need the same key type and semantic across all SMB datasets.</li><li>Set compression to DEFLATE with level 6 to be consistent with the default Avro sink in Scio. As a nice side effect of data being bucketed and sorted by key, we observed ~50% reduction in storage from better compression due to collocation of similar records.</li><li>Make sure output files are backwards compatible. SMB output files have “bucket-X-shard-Y” in their names but otherwise contain the same records with the same schema. So existing pipelines can consume them without any code change; they just do not leverage the speedup in certain join cases.</li></ul>

  <p><span>09 Feb 2021</span></p><p>Anyone who ever tried to cross-compile a C/C++ program knows how big a PITA the whole process could be. The main reasons for this sorry state of things are generally how byzantine build systems tend to be when configuring for cross-compilation, and how messy it is to set-up your cross toolchain in the first place.</p>

<p>One of the main culprits in my experience has been the GNU toolchain, the decades-old behemoth upon which the POSIXish world has been built for years.
Like many compilers of yore, GCC and its <code>binutils</code> brethren were never designed with the intent to support multiple targets within a single setup, with he only supported approach being installing a full cross build for each triple you wish to target on any given host.</p>

<p>For instance, assuming you wish to build something for FreeBSD on your Linux machine using GCC, you need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A GCC + binutils install for your host triplet (i.e., <code>x86_64-pc-linux-gnu</code> or similar);</li>
  <li>A GCC + binutils complete install for your target triplet (i.e. <code>x86_64-unknown-freebsd12.2-gcc</code>, <code>as</code>, <code>nm</code>, etc)</li>
  <li>A sysroot containing the necessary libraries and headers, which you can either build yourself or promptly steal from a running installation of FreeBSD.</li>
</ul>

<p>This process is sometimes made simpler by Linux distributions or hardware vendors offering a selection of prepackaged compilers, but this will never suffice due to the sheer amount of possible host-target combinations. This sometimes means you have to build the whole toolchain yourself, something that, unless you rock a quite beefy CPU, tends to be a massive waste of time and power.</p>

<h2 id="clang-as-a-cross-compiler">Clang as a cross compiler</h2>

<p>This annoying limitation is one of the reasons why I got interested in LLVM (and thus Clang), which is by-design a full-fledged cross compiler toolchain and is mostly compatible with GNU. A single install can output and compile code <em>for every supported target</em>, as long as a complete sysroot is available at build time.</p>

<p>I found this to be a game-changer, and, while it can’t still compete in convenience with modern language toolchains (such as Go’s gc and <code>GOARCH</code>/<code>GOOS</code>), it’s night and day better than the rigmarole of setting up GNU toolchains. You can now just fetch whatever your favorite package management system has available in its repositories (as long as it’s not extremely old), and avoid messing around with multiple installs of GCC.</p>

<p>Until a few years ago, the whole process wasn’t as smooth as it could be. Due to LLVM not having a full toolchain yet available, you were still supposed to provide a <code>binutils</code> build specific for your target. While this is generally much more tolerable than building the whole compiler (<code>binutils</code> is relatively fast to build), it was still somewhat of a nuisance, and I’m glad that <code>llvm-mc</code> (LLVM’s integrated assembler) and <code>lld</code> (universal linker) are finally stable and as flexible as the rest of LLVM.</p>

<p>With the toolchain now set, the next step becomes to obtain a sysroot in order to provide the needed headers and libraries to compile and link for your target.</p>

<h2 id="obtaining-a-sysroot">Obtaining a sysroot</h2>
<p>A super fast way to find a working system directory for a given OS is to rip it straight out of an existing system (a Docker container image will often also do).
For instance, this is how I used <code>tar</code> through <code>ssh</code> as a quick way to extract a working sysroot from a FreeBSD 13-CURRENT AArch64 VM <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ mkdir ~/farm_tree
$ ssh FARM64 'tar cf - /lib /usr/include /usr/lib /usr/local/lib /usr/local/include' | bsdtar xvf - -C $HOME/farm_tree/
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="invoking-the-cross-compiler">Invoking the cross compiler</h2>

<p>With everything set, it’s now only a matter of invoking Clang with the right arguments:</p>

<p>In the snipped above, I have managed to compile and link a C++ file into an executable for AArch64 FreeBSD, all while using just the <code>clang</code> and <code>lld</code> I had already installed on my GNU/Linux system.</p>

<p>More in detail:</p>
<ol>
  <li><code>--target</code> switches the LLVM default target (<code>x86_64-pc-linux-gnu</code>) to <code>aarch64-pc-freebsd</code>, thus enabling cross-compilation.</li>
  <li><code>--sysroot</code> forces Clang to assume the specified path as root when searching headers and libraries, instead of the usual paths. Note that sometimes this setting might not be enough, especially if the target uses GCC and Clang somehow fails to detect its install path. This can be easily fixed by specifying <code>--gcc-toolchain</code>, which clarifies where to search for GCC installations.</li>
  <li><code>-fuse-ld=lld</code> tells Clang to use <code>lld</code> instead whatever default the platform uses. As I will explain below, it’s highly unlikely that the system linker understands foreign targets, while LLD can natively support <em>almost</em> every binary format and OS <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</li>
  <li><code>-stdlib=libc++</code> is needed here due to Clang failing to detect that FreeBSD on AArch64 uses LLVM’s <code>libc++</code> instead of GCC’s <code>libstdc++</code>.</li>
  <li><code>-lz</code> is also specified to show how Clang can also resolve other libraries inside the sysroot without issues, in this case, <code>zlib</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The final test is now to copy the binary to our target system (i.e. the VM we ripped the sysroot from before) and check if it works as expected:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>rsync zpipe FARM64:<span>"~"</span>
<span>$ </span>ssh FARM64

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Success! It’s now possible to use this cross toolchain to build larger programs, and below I’ll give a quick example to how to use it to build real projects.</p>

<h3 id="optional-creating-an-llvm-toolchain-directory">Optional: creating an LLVM toolchain directory</h3>

<p>LLVM provides a mostly compatible counterpart for almost every tool shipped by <code>binutils</code> (with the notable exception of <code>as</code> <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>), prefixed with <code>llvm-</code>.</p>

<p>The most critical of these is LLD, which is a drop in replacement for a plaform’s system linker, capable to replace both GNU <code>ld.bfd</code> and <code>gold</code> on GNU/Linux or BSD, and Microsoft’s <code>LINK.EXE</code> when targeting MSVC. It supports linking on (almost) every platform supported by LLVM, thus removing the nuisance to have multiple specific linkers installed.</p>

<p>Both GCC and Clang support using <code>ld.lld</code> instead of the system linker (which may well be <code>lld</code>, like on FreeBSD) via the command line switch <code>-fuse-ld=lld</code>.</p>

<p>In my experience, I found that Clang’s driver might get confused when picking the right linker on some uncommon platforms, especially before version 11.0.
For some reason, <code>clang</code> sometimes decided to outright ignore the <code>-fuse-ld=lld</code> switch and picked the system linker (<code>ld.bfd</code> in my case), which does not support AArch64.</p>

<p>A fast solution to this is to create a toolchain directory containing symlinks that rename the LLVM utilities to the standard <code>binutils</code> programs:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span> <span>ls</span> <span>-la</span> ~/.llvm/bin/
Permissions Size User  Group Date Modified Name
lrwxrwxrwx    16 marco marco  3 Aug  2020  ar -&gt; /usr/bin/llvm-ar
lrwxrwxrwx    12 marco marco  6 Aug  2020  ld -&gt; /usr/bin/lld
lrwxrwxrwx    21 marco marco  3 Aug  2020  objcopy -&gt; /usr/bin/llvm-objcopy
lrwxrwxrwx    21 marco marco  3 Aug  2020  objdump -&gt; /usr/bin/llvm-objdump

lrwxrwxrwx    21 marco marco  3 Aug  2020  strings -&gt; /usr/bin/llvm-strings
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>-B</code> switch can then be used to force Clang (or GCC) to search the required tools in this directory, stopping the issue from ever occurring:</p>

<p>Before we get to my latest essay below—I’ve now opened enrollment for John David Ebert’s <a href="https://otherlife.co/jung">8-week masterclass</a> on the Swiss psychologist Carl Jung. The first live group discussion seminar will be Saturday, February 20th at 3pm Eastern. If you’re curious, <a href="https://gum.co/jung-guide">download the free study guide</a> and/or join us for <a href="https://lu.ma/jung-qa">a private Q&amp;A meeting</a> this Saturday, where you can sniff us out and get answers to any questions you might have. If you’re curious about John’s mastery of the material or his thinking style, I’d recommend his recent appearance on the Other Life podcast. OK—onto my post!</p>
<hr>
<p>I appreciate Michael Lind's <a href="https://www.thebellows.org/the-double-horseshoe-theory/">model</a> of the contemporary American class structure. He asks us to visualize two horseshoe structures:</p>
<blockquote><p>a lower horseshoe whose two prongs point up, and an upper horseshoe whose two prongs point down. The lower horseshoe has the underclass at the bottom/midpoint and the hub city working class and the heartland working class as the points of its two opposing prongs. The upper horseshoe has the managerial elite proper as its midpoint/apex and the professional bourgeoisie and the small business bourgeoisie as the points of its two opposing prongs.</p></blockquote>
<p>This model is pretty nifty, and it parsimoniously captures some ideological variation as well. Roughly, Lind suggests, the “center,” “left” and “right” map onto the managerial elite, the professional bourgeoisie, and the small business bourgeoisie. True elites just want stability, institutionalized bourgeois professionals want more government funding, and the self-employed want freedom from regulation and taxation. So far, so good.</p>
<p>But his sense of the near future is quite limited. It was only a parting remark, but</p>
<p>Lind suggests that any new cross-class alliance will have to create “powerful mass-membership, working-class organizations..."</p>
<p>I do not think this needs to happen, and I do not think it will happen. This is a powerful meme from pre-digital labor history, but I don’t think it bears much scrutiny. It’s the kind of thing Gen X socialists say when they don’t know what else to say.</p>
<p>I see a very different trajectory.</p>
<p>Consider Lind’s ”small business bourgeoisie,” which currently includes a lot of obsolete business models, like many local brick-and-mortar stores. There is a new player in this class, and it's the bootstrapped internet business—which doesn’t even require computer programming or much startup capital anymore. This includes a whole new breed of "DTC" or direct-to-consumer brands, but also the "creator economy" and even some of the crypto economy.</p>
<p>A non-trivial portion of Lind's "professional bourgeoisie" is defecting from legacy bureaucratic institutions (technologically indefensible prestige cartels), into this new tech-savvy faction of the small-business bourgeoisie. The clearest and most recent example is the massive wave of journalists quitting their jobs in favor of writing independently on Substack. But the 2 million people working full-time as internet “creators” already would have been enough to substantiate my claim.</p>
<p>Then within Lind's "managerial elite" (the major titans of industry and government), there is an increasingly salient cleavage between tech-centric libertarian types and paper-centric bureaucratic types. Think “west coast” figures like Marc Andreesen or Peter Thiel versus “east coast” figures like the Sulzbergers.</p>
<p>The "professional bourgeois" defecting from institutions into the small-business bourgeoisie are doing so because their institutional wage premia are being eroded by technology, so their shift is almost intrinsically tech-centric and libertarian.</p>
<p>We’re beginning to see an ideological realignment where the professional bourgeoisie increasingly defects from the old state-centric, pro-bureaucracy socialism into a new, more tech-centric communitarianism with socialistic longings but libertarian characteristics.</p>
<p>It’s not as contradictory as it sounds. For most left-wing intellectuals since Marx, their ideological alignment with state power was only ever a marriage of convenience. Their ultimate preference is always to abolish the state, but until that’s possible, they love the state as a necessary vehicle moving in the direction of liberation. In the digital age, left-leaning bourgeois intellectuals will retain their radical egalitarianism but their marriage of convenience will now be with technology and private wealth, which they will correctly see as the only viable bulwarks for egalitarian political structures moving forward.</p>
<p>If you doubt that ideologies and alliances can shift so quickly due to external changes in the economic landscape, read <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1962581?seq=1">this classic political science paper.</a> Is “free trade” a left-wing or right-wing position? There’s no clear answer to this questions, because the content of “left” and “right” party programs fluctuates depending on opportunistic factors. If you look at left-wing parties across time and space, their position on the Free Trade issue is a function of how much land, labor, and capital there is in the country under consideration. </p>
<p>The newfound allies of our defecting professionals will be the tech-libertarian elites and, most confusingly, the working-class heartland—the true believers in the American freedom ethos. This is the only way to understand the new cleavage that puts on one side right-leaning media figures like Tucker Carlson, with defected left-leaning professional-bourgeois figures like Angela Nagle and Ariel Pink, with right-leaning tech figures such as Curtis Yarvin and Peter Thiel, with an army of anti-institutional solo-business creators as big as Joe Rogan and as small as the Patreon podcaster who is barely scraping by but nonetheless paying all of their bills with complete intellectual freedom.</p>
<p>A major catalyst of this realignment will be crypto. Crypto is fundamentally a redistribution of wealth and power away from the managerial elite (whose income is based on legacy cartels and fiat currency) toward anti-institutional outsiders (whose income is based on being correct before being accepted). This is another independent vector of change, which is also intrinsically tech-centric libertarian.</p>
<p>The American class structure is approaching a great schism that might very well make the Civil War of 1861 seem like a sibling rivalry.</p>
<p>On the one side, we will have a tech-centric libertarian camp connecting all of the most forward-thinking and freedom-focused people up and down the class hierarchy, boasting a fundamentally new and censorship-proof monetary system and wealth base.</p>
<p>On the other side, we will have everyone whose income is based on having paid dues to a legacy institution, plus the black urban underclass that the institutional bourgeois is essentially holding hostage (exploiting this faction's historical investment in the Democratic party, leaving them nowhere else to go, like abusive husbands do to their battered wives).</p>
<p>The big question is whether the captains of the sinking ship accelerate their bellicosity or ask for a lifeboat. In many ways, crypto provides the best thermometer for this growing cleavage: If the institutions gradually buy into crypto, then I would expect the USA to gradually morph into a tech-libertarian patchwork where all national and state bureaucracies gradually recede into nothingness and all power passes through blockchains.</p>
<p>If the US government tries to institute an outright ban on crypto—like Nigeria is doing right now—then all the crypto millionaires, the small-business intellectuals, and the freedom-loving rednecks would galvanize into a proto-secessionary unit. They would have most of the guns in America, and most of America’s greatest minds.</p>
<p>In the face of serious aggression from US institutions, this camp could either double-down on one of the untraceable cryptocurrencies and alternative networking models like Urbit, to sustain the true American nation in the shadow of the usurper government, or it would simply purchase a small country somewhere else. </p>
<p>Either way, we win.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the past month, two things happened to me that made me realize how glad I'm for using a password manager, namely <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>.</p>
<p>First thing is about a login page. I was searching for a Github repo on DuckDuckGo, and I clicked on a link in the search results. As I was about to fill in the password with a 1Password shortcut, I noticed that 1Password wasn't filling in the login details. How strange, I thought. Puzzled, I looked at the url. And then I saw it—I almost fell for a phishing attack! The url was <a href="https://marcel.is/1password/github.com.cnpmjs.org">github.com.cnpmjs.org</a> instead of <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. I knew of phishing attacks, and thought I'd never fell for such a simple trick. Yet, I almost did.</p>
<p>Second thing is about email. As I'm migrating away from gmail, I thought I would check out the spam folder. I usually don't do that, but I thought I'd peek in. One email caught my eye: the email subject was my password. The site must have been compromised and the attacker got hold of my email and password. Fortunately, the damage radius was minimal, as I have generated unique passwords for each site.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After spending some weeks playing with Rust, I felt ready to test my skills and try some programming challenges in the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent Of Code</a>. My approach to tackle some of those challenges was to solve them using Javascript (I use it in my day to day) first and then port the code to Rust. While writing the port I just focus on getting the Rust code as elegant as possible to achieve that I research the Rust API's to get syntactically correct. It was after finishing porting this <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/5">puzzle</a> in particular and feeling a sense of accomplishment that I decided to test how the Rust compiled code will perform against Javascript interpreter.</p><h2 id="naive-algorithm">Naive Algorithm</h2><hr><p>Before jumping to the whom-was-slower-and-why, let’s take a quick look at <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/5">puzzle</a> (so you see there is no hidden agenda) which goes like this:</p><p>You are given an input string with <code>N</code> amount of characters and we should write an algorithm that find and remove any sequential pairs of characters that similar but have different capitalisation, examples of this are:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sh">bB <span># Remove</span>
bb <span># Do Nothing</span>
ab <span># Do Nothing</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The algorithm should re-evaluate the string recursively searching for new pairs created after the removal, something like tetris.</p><p>We have this input:</p><p>We should remove <code>bB</code> to get:</p><p>Then because <code>aA</code> has been formed we should eliminated this too:</p><p>Then we remove <code>dD</code> and the final string should be:</p><h3 id="my-solution">My Solution</h3><p>To solve this I wrote two functions, one that <code>process</code> takes array of characters, traverse the array a pair at a time and validate that they follow the rules mentioned above:</p><h4 id="rust">Rust</h4><hr><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>process</span>(tokens: <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> Vec<span>&lt;</span>String<span>&gt;</span>) -&gt; <span>i32</span> {

      }

      <span>let</span> candidate <span>=</span> polymer.pop().unwrap();

      <span>if</span> <span>!</span>react(<span>&amp;</span>candidate, <span>&amp;</span>token) {

</code></pre></div><p>This is a surprising turn of events, here we can see the Rust version is <code>2x</code> slower than Javascript, How? My first reaction (in an act of self denial) was to check the compiler flags <code>opt-level</code> and after checking that was fine, which to be honest won’t make a difference, I started to look for inefficiencies in the code, first using the ancient <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/methodology.html">Drunk man anti-method</a> technique and when that didn’t work, I end up settling for a more scientific method of profiling my code with <a href="https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page">perf</a>.</p><h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2><hr><p>Every time you are debugging a performance issues you might feel tempted to start adding your own function to calculate the duration of suspicious section of code (like I used to do, in the past). <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/perf.html">Perf</a> does this for you by taking various approaches such as listening to CPU/Kernel <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/developer_guide/perf">performance events</a> metrics emitted by the system in reaction of your process while running.

To enable this add <code>debug=true</code> to the <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="toml">[<span>profile</span>.<span>release</span>]

    <span>false</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>My first impression is that I made a mistake while running <code>perf</code> (never used it before with Rust), but everything started to make sense once I looked at the source code of the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html#method.to_lowercase">to_lowercase</a> function.</p><p>What happen is that Rust lowercase function try to be correct in any language, so it delegates this conversion to a function called <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.29.2/std_unicode/conversions/fn.to_lower.html">std_unicode::conversions</a> this function then does a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">binary search</a> of each character against a big array (≈1200) of unicode characters:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust">
<span>const</span> to_lowercase_table: <span>&amp;</span>[(char, [char; <span>3</span>])] <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span>[
        (<span>'\u{41}'</span>, [<span>'\u{61}'</span>, <span>'\0'</span>, <span>'\0'</span>]),

        (<span>'\u{43}'</span>,<span>//...≈1200 ]
</span><span></span>

 <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>to_lower</span>(c: <span>char</span>) -&gt; [char; <span>3</span>] {
        <span>match</span> bsearch_case_table(c, to_lowercase_table) {

            Some(index) <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> to_lowercase_table[index].<span>1</span>,
        }
    }

</code></pre></div><blockquote><p>Going back at the code, this binary search is done twice per iteration now multiply this by <code>50K</code> and we found the reason for the slow down.</p></blockquote><p>After some googling I found that I should use <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/core/str/mod.rs.html#4006">eq_ignore_ascii_case</a> instead, which basically makes this operation in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.37.0/src/core/slice/mod.rs.html#2487">linear time</a> and for one character is nearly the same as saying constant time. I recompiled the code and run the benchmarks:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="xml">Node.JS
real  0m0.374s
user  0m0.301s
sys   0m0.030s

user  0m0.248s
sys   0m0.005s
</code></pre></div><p>Now we are talking, profiling has pay its dividends and made the Rust program <code>2.5x</code> <em>faster</em> than the original and <code>91ms</code> faster than the Javascript version, I can start celebrating and telling my friends that I’m a Rust expert now. But this leaves me with some questions:</p><blockquote><p>The <code>91ms</code> is not bad, but I wonder how much effort it will take to optimize this code to make it <code>&gt;1.5x</code> faster than the Javascript counterpart?</p></blockquote><h2 id="performance-on-macos">Performance On MacOS</h2><p>While I was thinking of this and was in the middle of unpacking my Rust stickers and preparing my laptop for some re-branding, I decided to move the code (Javascript and Rust) from my Linux VM to my main OS (<strong>MacOS Catalina</strong>), once there I gave the benchmark another try because I <em>love</em> suffering:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sh">Node   0.17s user 0.03s system 101% cpu 0.209 total
Rust   0.23s user 0.01s system 98% cpu 0.238 total
</code></pre></div><p>After seeing this my confidence in my time measuring tool (<code>time</code>) started to fade a bit, but once I calm down and use the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AnalysisTools/Conceptual/instruments_help-collection/Chapter/Chapter.html">XCode Instrumentation</a> which point me in the right direction:</p><p><img src="https://github.com/cesarvr/hugo-blog/blob/master/static/rust/malloc-xcode-2.png?raw=true" alt=""></p><blockquote><p>The slowest part of the program (Rust version) is the part that does the allocation and deallocation of memory produced when calling MacOS <code>malloc</code>.</p></blockquote><p>To catch this one I'll need to dig more into Rust inner workings. Does this make it more expensive to get performance out of Rust? Did I choose the wrong abstractions? That's for another post.

February 11, 2021 | https://www.honeybadger.io/blog/subdomain-takeover/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.honeybadger.io/blog/subdomain-takeover/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <article>
            <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">Domain Name System (DNS)</a> is often described as
the address book of the Internet;
A and AAAA records map a human-friendly hostname (e.g., <code>honeybadger.io</code>)
to some machine-friendly IP address (<code>104.198.14.52</code>, in this case).
Other types of DNS records also exist; in particular,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNAME_record">CNAME records</a> are records that map a hostname to some other hostname,
thereby delegating IP resolution to the latter.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, DNS is not immune to misconfiguration,
and poor DNS hygiene opens the door to all kinds of abuse
that can wreak havoc on the security of your organization and its stakeholders.
Of course, if attackers gain access to your DNS configuration and
are able to create records or modify existing ones,</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdqyG3CcoLM">That's it, man! Game over, man! Game over!</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, attackers don't need such a strong foothold in your system
to cause harm.
In some cases, a dangling CNAME record on one of your subdomains is all they
need to take control of some (or all) of the content served
by the subdomain in question.
Such a security issue is known as a <em>subdomain takeover</em>.</p>

<p>In this post, I will do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>show you how subdomain takeovers typically arise,</li>
<li>explain why this type of security issue should be on your radar,</li>
<li>delve into how an attacker may use a subdomain takeover against you,</li>
<li>provide some guidance for protecting yourself
against vulnerabilities of this kind.</li>
</ul>

<h2>A Typical Scenario</h2>

<p>To fix ideas, let's go over a typical subdomain-takeover scenario.
Let's assume that your organization, ExampleDotOrg,
whose domain name is <code>example.org</code>,
wants to use some service from a vendor called TipTop.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.honeybadger.io/images/blog/posts/subdomain-takeover/scenario.svg?1613267319" alt="typical scenario">
<em>A typical subdomain-takeover scenario</em></p>

<ol>
<li>You register an account at TipTop and create an instance of their service,
which is accessible at <code>example-dot-org.tiptopapp.com</code>.</li>
<li>For brand-consistency reasons,
your organization would like to make your TipTop instance accessible
from one of its subdomains: <code>tiptop.example.org</code>.
No problem, as TipTop allows you to do that.
All you have to do is create a CNAME record that points <code>tiptop.example.org</code>
to <code>example-dot-org.tiptopapp.com</code>.</li>
<li>After a while, your organization decides to cancel its TipTop subscription.
Your TipTop instance is then deleted but, crucially, you forget to remove
the associated CNAME record!</li>
<li>An attacker later notices the dangling CNAME record.
Because TipTop doesn't prevent anyone from
reclaiming the <code>example-dot-org</code> instance name on their platform,
the attacker is able to create his or her own TipTop instance at
<code>example-dot-org.tiptopapp.com</code>,
which your subdomain <code>tiptop.example.org</code> now points to!
From then on, and for as long as the CNAME record remains,
the attacker has control over the content served by your subdomain.</li>
</ol>

<p>You've just fallen victim to a subdomain takeover!</p>

<h2>Why You Should Pay Attention</h2>

<p>Subdomain takeover was pioneered by ethical hacker <a href="https://twitter.com/fransrosen">Frans Rosén</a> and
popularized by <a href="https://detectify.com/">Detectify</a> in a <a href="https://labs.detectify.com/2014/10/21/hostile-subdomain-takeover-using-herokugithubdesk-more/">seminal blogpost</a>
as early as 2014.
However, it remains an underestimated (or outright overlooked)
and widespread vulnerability.
The rise of cloud solutions certainly hasn't helped curb the spread.</p>

<p>In many ways, subdomain takeover is an insidious security issue:</p>

<ul>
<li>Finding out whether a subdomain takeover is possible
and taking control of the subdomain
typically require remarkably few technical skills from the attacker.</li>
<li>Detecting that a subdomain takeover is being actively exploited
is difficult; you may realize it too late, when your users start complaining.</li>
<li>A subdomain takeover may pose a relatively minor threat in itself, but
when combined with other seemingly minor security misconfigurations,
it may allow an attacker to cause greater damage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Impact of a Subdomain Takeover</h2>

<p>What harm could a subdomain takeover bring to your organization? Well, the impact mainly depends on three factors:</p>

<p><strong>The nature of the third-party service (if any) that the vulnerable
  subdomain points to.</strong>
  Does the vendor offer little to no customization,
  or does it allow you to modify the style of the landing page via custom
  JavaScript or CSS code?
  Does it restrict you to serving static content,
  or is it a full-blown platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering
  on which you can deploy a Web server?</p>

<p><strong>The purpose and popularity of the vulnerable subdomain.</strong>
  What was the subdomain used for before becoming vulnerable?
  Was it used to simply host API documentation
  or was it instead used to authenticate users?
  Is the subdomain still receiving traffic?
  Is the subdomain name long and obscure (e.g., <code>exctxzzxxp09.test.example.org</code>)
  or short and simple and, thus, unlikely to raise suspicion
  (e.g., <code>auth.example.org</code>)?</p>

<p><strong>The trust relationship that the organization's other Web assets
  have with the vulnerable subdomain.</strong>
  Would <code>example.org</code> blindly trust requests originating
  from the vulnerable subdomain?
  Would it accept to share sensitive data with that subdomain?
  Would it accept to load and execute JavaScript code hosted on that subdomain?</p>

<p>Now that you have a better idea of what factors into the impact of a subdomain takeover, let's see how a malicious actor might exploit one.</p>

<h3>Defacement</h3>

<p>If possible, an attacker may decide to change the appearance of pages
served by the vulnerable <code>example.org</code> subdomain
to openly ridicule or embarrass your organization.
This is exactly <a href="https://grahamcluley.com/hacker-defaces-donald-trump-fundraising-site-via-subdomain-takeover-attack/">what happened in February 2017</a>,
when a hacker took control of <code>secure2.donaldjtrump.com</code>,
a subdomain of Donald Trump's campaign-fundraising website,
and left there a message that...
well... did not really fall in line with the Trump campaign's strategy.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.honeybadger.io/images/blog/posts/subdomain-takeover/trump_hacked.png?1613267319" alt="Trump gets pwned">
<em>Defacement of Trump's campaign fundraising site thanks to a subdomain takeover</em></p>

<p>Although the issue was quickly resolved,
the offending page was captured and
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170219165347/http://secure2.donaldjtrump.com/">persists in the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine</a> to this day.
This incident arguably was neither the first nor the last cause for
embarrassment for Trump,
and it certainly did not prevent him from winning the 2016 presidency—as
he was already in office at the time.
However, I'm sure you can imagine how a defacement,
possibly consisting of more offensive content than Trump's hacker used,
could harm your organization's reputation.</p>

<h3>Phishing</h3>

<p>Another obvious way to exploit a subdomain vulnerable to takeover is phishing.
Most phishing sites masquerading as a legitimate site (e.g., <code>payments.example.org</code>)
usually do not survive close scrutiny of the browser's address bar
because phishers typically have no other option than to host them
on a lookalike domain (e.g., <code>payments.exarnple.org</code>).
Not so with a subdomain takeover!
In fact, a subdomain takeover is the perfect spot for running a phishing campaign.
After all, if the domain name <code>example.org</code> is trustworthy,
then one would assume that any subdomain of <code>example.org</code> is also trustworthy, right?</p>

<p>Thanks to a subdomain takeover,
phishers can readily leverage the reputation of the legitimate domain name
to lure unsuspecting victims to it and elicit sensitive information
(e.g., account credentials, personally identifiable information, and payment details)
from them.
Even tech-savvy visitors are likely to fall for the subterfuge.</p>

<p>In some cases, attackers may even be able to obtain and install a valid TLS
certificate for the vulnerable subdomain
to serve their phishing site over HTTPS;
and, sad to say, many people
(including <a href="https://twitter.com/Europol/status/1214557374180020224">Europol representatives</a>, who should know better),
still view the use of HTTPS as a reliable indicator for trustworthiness
of the server on the other end of the connection.</p>

<h3>Stealing Broadly Scoped Cookies</h3>

<p>Run-of-the-mill phishing typically requires some gullibility and
user interaction (beyond navigating to the malicious site) from the victim.
A subdomain takeover is more powerful, though, as it may enable an attacker
to steal sensitive cookies simply by the victim visiting the attacker's site.</p>

<p>Cookies have a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie#Attributes"><code>Domain</code> attribute</a>,
which determines where browsers are allowed to send them in HTTP requests.
For instance, if a cookie is set from <code>example.org</code> with that hostname
as the value of its <code>Domain</code> attribute,
browsers will attach it to all HTTP requests sent to <code>example.org</code>
or any subdomain thereof.
Some sites, in a questionnable approach to implementing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">Single-Sign-On (SSO) authentication</a> across all of their subdomains,
set the <code>Domain</code> attribute of their session-identifying cookies to their root
domain (<code>example.org</code>).</p>

<p>Now picture a malicious actor who has taken control over a subdomain and
deploys their own malicious server there, which is set up to log all HTTP requests.
By luring authenticated users to the compromised subdomain,
the attacker will be able to harvest cookies scoped at the root domain
simply by inspecting the server logs!</p>

<p><img src="https://www.honeybadger.io/images/blog/posts/subdomain-takeover/cookies.svg?1613267319" alt="Cookie theft">
<em>Exploiting a subdomain takeover to steal sensitive cookies</em></p>

<p>If session-identifying cookies are scoped this way,
the attacker will be able to hijack user sessions and, perhaps, even take over
user accounts.</p>

<p>Note that security cookie attributes cannot protect users
who happen to visit the compromised subdomain. In particular,</p>

<ul>
<li>the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie#Attributes"><code>HttpOnly</code> cookie attribute</a> is irrelevant here
because the attack involves no client-side JavaScript;</li>
<li>under the assumption that the subdomain has a valid TLS certificate,
the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie#Attributes"><code>Secure</code> cookie attribute</a> cannot be of any help
because browsers will send cookies to the compromised subdomain,
even over HTTPS.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cross-Site Request Forgery</h3>

<p><a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf">OWASP defines cross-site request forgery</a> as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end
user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which [he
or she is] currently authenticated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let's take a social network as an example.
A CSRF attacker may perform sensitive actions, such as</p>

<ul>
<li>liking another user's post,</li>
<li>updating the victim's email address, or</li>
<li>changing the victim's profile picture,</li>
</ul>

<p>all on behalf of the victim but against his or her will.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite"><code>SameSite</code> cookie attribute</a> was introduced to protect users
against such cross-site attacks,
but few organizations are taking full advantage of it.
Thus, CSRF remains a risk wherever cookie-based …</p></article></div></div>

February 11, 2021 | https://altcampus.school/community/posts/how-to-get-first-job-as-a-software-developer-when-you-have-zero-experience | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://altcampus.school/community/posts/how-to-get-first-job-as-a-software-developer-when-you-have-zero-experience">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://altcampus.school/images/posts/how-to-get-first-job-as-a-developer-when-you-have-zero-experience.png" alt="How to get first job as a developer when you have zero experience - AltCampus"></p>
<p>Most companies want to hire experienced developers but how do you become experienced until you get the first job? This is the classic chicken and egg problem version of tech jobs. Everyone needs to start somewhere.</p>
<p>First, let's understand why most companies want to hire experienced developers. It's becuase with experienced developers companies don't need to invest much time or mentorship in order to get them to be productive. They get the work done. Whereas junior developers usually need lot of handholding, time, and upfront mentorship. It either slows the companies down or needs more investment from them.</p>
<p>That said, you can get the first job even as a junior developer by showing the proof that you know stuff, can build things and can learn quickly. It's all about signaling the right stuff.</p>
<p>Here's how -</p>
<h3>1. Build a portfolio</h3>
<p>Build good projects, ideally outside of a tutorial, that showcase what you are actually capable of building. Make sure it has a live URL that people can checkout. It proves that you can actually ship a project end-to-end.</p>
<p>Here are some detailed tips on <a href="https://altcampus.io/blog/how-to-build-a-great-portfolio-as-a-beginner-developer">how to build a great portfolio</a>.</p>
<h3>2. Become good at writing code and problem solving</h3>
<p>This is reflected in your Github repositories. Make sure that you refactor your code and follow good practices. Simple stuff like</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing good variable, function names</li>
<li>Breaking down big functions into smaller, reusable functions</li>
<li>Making sure that the code and modules are well structured and documented</li>
</ul>
<p>goes a long way.</p>
<h3>3. Pay attention to the details</h3>
<p>This is critical. A major difference between junior and experienced developers is that experienced developers are used to paying attention to the details like handling edge cases because they have burnt their fingers in the past. Similarly as a frontend developer, pay special attention to the details of the UI.</p>
<p>Paying attention to the details signals that you are the kind of person who cares about the quality of your work and are diligent. A quality that can make you stand out even as a junior developer.</p>
<h3>4. Learn and share stuff in public</h3>
<p>Tweet, write blog posts and share what you learnt. This is a very good way of showcasing your knowledge and passion for learning. It also builds a network where you can get referred or people might show interest in hiring you, without you even looking for it.</p>
<p>For example, pick up a new library/framework/tool in the relevant language. Read the official documentation and other articles and try to build a project around it and share your learnings online. This shows that you can learn new skills quickly and can also communicate about it.</p>
<h3>5. Apply. Apply. Apply.</h3>
<p>Once you have a deployed project that is complete either in frontend, backend or full-stack, you should start applying. Read up <a href="https://github.com/yangshun/tech-interview-handbook/">frequently asked questions in interviews</a>.</p>
<p>Apply to various companies. It's inevitable that you will get rejected at some places. Don't get disheartened, there are thousands of companies hiring. Learn from the mistakes in previous interviews and keep applying.</p>
<p>Good luck. 🙌</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>React revolutionized front end development as most people knew it when it was first released. This new approach to writing code triggered incredible innovation in how to handle state changes and UI updates.</p><p>This revolution had its downsides, too. One of them was a culture of over-engineering solutions to challenges that could be solved in simpler ways. A typical example of this is how state has been managed in React applications.</p><p>Redux has become a hallmark of many React applications created in the last couple of years. The allure of having a single state object, available everywhere in your application sure sounds nice. But has its time passed? Has React evolved to a point where these kinds of state management tools add more complexity than they solve?</p><p>This article aims to give you a deeper understanding of which situations warrants state management tools like Redux. We’ll discuss the reasons behind the rise of Redux, and what has changed in the last couple of years - both in React and in Redux. Finally, we’ll look into what might be coming in the future.</p><h2 id="redux---and-why-people-started-using-it">Redux - and why people started using it</h2><p>When it was first released , React didn’t have an officially supported way to pass data far down the component tree. If you had some kind of shared state, configuration or other information you would like to use anywhere in you application, you had to pass it down from parent to child to sibling to another child. There <em>was</em> a way to avoid it, but that way - the “legacy context API” was never officially supported, and was documented with a warning that it should not be used.</p><p>About the same time React was released to the public, some other Facebook engineers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLb0IAmt7-GS188xDYE-u1ShQmFFGbrk0v&amp;v=nYkdrAPrdcw&amp;feature=emb_title" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">introduced a blueprint</a> for how they created front end applications - the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/flux/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Flux architecture</a>. It complimented React’s component-centric design by having a unidirectional data flow, which made things both easy to follow and simple to understand.</p><p><img tabindex="0" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.asayer.io/static/176421ef1740882c46b0283385b27764/ff5cf/d97c68cc0c034806aa6ff882a5f51995.png" srcset="https://blog.asayer.io/static/176421ef1740882c46b0283385b27764/ff5cf/d97c68cc0c034806aa6ff882a5f51995.png 1300w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" alt="Flux Architecture">
<em>(photo borrowed from <a href="https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/in-depth-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/in-depth-overview</a>)</em></p><p>While many famous open sourcerers were busy fighting over which slightly different implementation of this was the best, a young Russian developer named Dan Abramov introduced an implementation based on the <a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Elm architecture</a>, called Redux.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/xsSnOQynTHs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://youtu.be/xsSnOQynTHs</a></p><p>Redux was a pretty simple system, with a single state object, encased in a “store”, which could be updated by dispatching actions on it. The actions were sent to a “reducer” function, which returned a brand new copy of the entire application state, which would then propagate across your application.</p><p>Another great feature of Redux was how easy it was to use with React. Not only was it a great match with the programming model of React, it also solved the prop drilling issue! Just “connect” whatever component you want to a store, and you had access to any part of the application state you wanted. It was like magic!</p><h2 id="context-hooks-and-why-it-solved-much-of-what-redux-did">Context, hooks, and why it solved much of what Redux did</h2><p>With all its elegance and popularity though, Redux did have a few major downsides. For each new way of changing the state, you had to add a new action type and action creator, probably a dispatcher and a selector, and then you’d have to handle that new state change in an existing reducer, or create a new one. In other words - lots and lots of boilerplate.</p><p>When the 16.3 version of React was released, it finally shipped with a fully redesigned context API. With this new feature, prop drilling was suddenly as easy as wrapping any subsection of your application in a context provider, and fetching it again with a context consumer component.

Hooks made using state and side effects much easier, and made away with the need for class components altogether. In addition, the context API was suddenly much easier to consume, which made it much more user friendly.

The elegance of reducers were suddenly built into React itself, and prop-drilling was a solved challenge. New projects were started without having Redux in the stack - a previous no-brainer - and more and more projects started to consider moving away from Redux altogether.</p><p>As a response, the team currently maintaining Redux (led by a gentleman named Mark Eriksson) started two different efforts. They introduced an opinionated toolkit named <a href="https://redux-toolkit.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Redux Toolkit</a> that did away with most boilerplate code through conventions, and they added a <a href="https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">hooks-based API</a> for reading state and dispatching actions.</p><p>Together these two new updates simplified Redux codebases substantially. But is it really enough to defend introducing the added complexity of the concepts in Redux to a new project? Is the value Redux adds more than the added cost of teaching new employees about Yet Another Tool?</p><p>Let’s look at where React does a great job by itself, and in what cases the tradeoff of complexity vs power is worth it.</p><h2 id="when-react-is-enough">When React is enough</h2><p>Most React applications I’ve worked with have been pretty small in scope. They’ve had a few global pieces of state that was used across the application, and some data that was shared across a few different views.</p><p>Besides from this though, many React applications don’t have a lot of shared state. Most state  like the content of input fields or whether a modal is open, is only interesting to the component that contains them! No need to make that state globally available. </p><p>Other pieces of state might be shared, but only by a part of the application. Perhaps a particular page requires a piece of state to be shared across several of its components, or a sidebar needs to expose some remote status to all of its children. Either way, that’s not global state - it’s state scoped to a part of the application.</p><p>By keeping state co-located, or as close to its dependents as possible, you ensure that it’s deleted whenever the feature requiring it is deleted, and that it’s discoverable without leafing through tens of different reducers.</p><p>If you need to share app-wide settings that rarely change, React’s context API is a great tool to reach for. One example of this is what locale is currently active:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>LocaleContext</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span>.</span><span>createContext</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  locale</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"en-US"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>  </span><span>setLocale</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>LocaleProvider</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>locale</span><span>,</span><span> setLocale</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span>.</span><span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>"en-US"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>LocaleContext</span><span>.</span><span>Provider</span><span> value</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>{</span><span> locale</span><span>,</span><span> setLocale </span><span>}</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>...</span><span>props</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>useLocale</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span>.</span><span>useContext</span><span>(</span><span>LocaleContext</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div><p>Other use cases can be what color theme is active, or even what experiments are active for a given user.</p><p>Another very useful approach is using a small data-fetching library like <a href="https://swr.vercel.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SWR</a> or <a href="https://react-query.tanstack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">React-Query</a> to handle fetching and caching your API responses for you. To me, cached data isn’t really global state - it’s just cached data. This is much simpler to handle with these small single-use libraries, than introducing async thunks or sagas to your Redux rig. Also, you don’t have to handle all the complex variations of isLoading, hasError and what not. With these libraries, it works out of the box.</p><p>A thing these context use cases have in common is the fact that they represent data that rarely updates. Rarely in the context of computer science is a bit vague, but in my mind, less than a couple of times every second is pretty rare. And as it turns out, that’s the way the React Context API works best!</p><p>The use cases summarized above covers most of the situations I’ve met in real world applications. Actual global state is rare and far between, and is often better off being co-located with the code that actually uses it, or provided through the context API.</p><h2 id="situations-where-redux-might-be-warranted">Situations where Redux might be warranted</h2><p>With all that said, Redux is still a great product. It’s well documented, adopted by many, and can be combined with the approaches posted above. But what use cases warrants the added complexity and learning curve of adding Redux to your stack in 2021?</p><p>One of the use cases I see most in the projects I’m involved with is when you have advanced data fetching scenarios that requires a lot of cascading network communication. One might argue that this is best done on the server side, but there are definitely use cases where handing this on the client is warranted. Redux, particularly in combination with so-called thunks, is extremely versatile and flexible when it comes to such orchestration.</p><p>Another use case is for very interdependent states, or states that are derived from several other states. This is possible to handle in React as well, but the end result is still much easier to both share, reuse and reason about in Redux.</p><p>A third use case is for those where the state of your application can change very rapidly.

<div>

<p><strong>Update 1:58 AM PT:</strong> <em>Updated the post to clear confusion about how Google’s Safe Browsing feature works.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Apple’s privacy push is much more widespread than it seems at the surface. A perfect example is the new privacy feature in <a href="https://the8-bit.com/ios-14-5-changes/">iOS 14.5 Beta 1 (V2)</a> which redirects Google Safe Browsing traffic through Apple’s own proxy servers to enhance users’ privacy and to not let Google see your IP address. </p>
<p>Google Safe Browsing is a security service created by Google that checks whether a website is malicious. When you access a website on the desktop version of Chrome on your Mac or PC, for instance, Google Safe Browsing checks if a website is safe to browse and displays a warning accordingly. The user ultimately has the choice, however.</p>
<p>As Reddit user u/jaydenkieran explains, Apple uses Google Safe Browsing when you enable “Fraudulent Website Warning” within the Safari settings in the Settings app on iPhone or iPad.</p>
<p><a aria-label="According to Google (opens in a new tab)" href="https://support.google.com/transparencyreport/answer/7380435?hl=en#zippy=%2Chow-do-you-determine-that-a-site-is-unsafe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Google</a>, its Safe Browsing system works by scanning sections of Google’s web index and “identifying potentially compromised websites.” Then, Google tests those websites by using a virtual machine to check if the website compromises the system. If it does, it’s added to Google’s online database. Google also identifies phishing websites by using statistical models. </p>
<p><a aria-label="According to Apple (opens in a new tab)" href="https://support.apple.com/en-ae/HT210675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Apple</a>, before visiting a website, Safari may send hashed prefixes of the URL (Apple terms it “information calculated from the website address”) to Google Safe Browsing to check if there’s a match. </p>
<p>Since Apple uses a hashed prefix, Google cannot learn which website the user is trying to visit. Up until iOS 14.5, Google could also see the IP address of where that request is coming from. However, since Apple now proxies Google Safe Browsing traffic, it further safeguards users’ privacy while browsing using Safari.</p>
<p>Apple has been intensifying its push for privacy with iOS 14 what with the <a href="https://the8-bit.com/app-tracking-transparency-guide/">App Tracking Transparency update and the inclusion of App Privacy Reports in the App Store</a>. </p><div><p>See also</p><div id="block-wrap-39225" data-id="39225" data-base="0"><div><div><div><article><div><p><a href="https://the8-bit.com/siri-now-allows-setting-a-default-music-streaming-service-on-ios-14-5/" title="Siri_Default_Music_App"><img width="100" height="100" src="https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Siri_Default_Music_App-100x100.jpg" alt="Siri Default Music App" srcset="https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Siri_Default_Music_App-100x100.jpg 100w, https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Siri_Default_Music_App-80x80.jpg 80w, https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Siri_Default_Music_App-293x293.jpg 293w" sizes="(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px"></a></p></div></article></div></div></div></div></div>
<p>At the same time, companies like Facebook are actively opposing the Cupertino giant, accusing it of negatively affecting the advertising industry. Apple’s response has been simple: </p>
<p>“We believe that this is a simple matter of standing up for our users. Users should know when their data is being collected and shared across other apps and websites — and they should have the choice to allow that or not. App Tracking Transparency in iOS 14 does not require Facebook to change its approach to tracking users and creating targeted advertising, it simply requires they give users a choice.” </p>
<p>Google itself <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/02/04/google-still-hasnt-updated-its-ios-apps-while-pondering-android-privacy-controls" target="_blank" aria-label="had been holding off (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">had been holding off</a> on updating its host of apps on the App Store due to the App Privacy Health Reports in the App Store that lets users view how an app tracks them. However, Google later disclosed that it will update its apps to include as little tracking as possible.</p>
<p>Having said that, it’s interesting to see Apple focus on enhancing user privacy as much as they can. And setting up a proxy server to filter Google Safe Browsing traffic just so Google cannot see users’ browsing activity will be a welcome move for a lot of users.</p>

    <p>An exploration of grid system design space, and an alternative to the typical options like H3 and S2.</p>



<p>A global grid system is a way of partitioning the Earth’s surface into smaller regions, often known as <em>cells</em>. Depending on your perspective and preferred nomenclature, global grids may be closely related to or the same as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_global_grid">discrete global grids</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_database#Spatial_index">[geo]spatial indices</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_geocoding">geocode systems</a>, etc. The most well known examples are probably <a href="https://eng.uber.com/h3/">Uber’s H3</a>, <a href="http://s2geometry.io/">Google’s S2</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash">Geohash</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Location_Code">Open Location Code</a>.</p>

<p>From my day job at <a href="https://evanfields.github.io/No-Perfect-Geo-Grid/www.zoba.com">Zoba</a>, I’m most familiar with grid systems as a convenient tool for splitting a city into cells of approximately uniform shape and size; these cells become a unit of analysis. For example, if you want to characterize the spatial distribution of shared bikes over a city, it’s natural to simply count how many bikes are in each grid cell. In fact, many of our analyses and optimizations are at the cell level: we count vehicles and rides by cell, estimate and forecast demand by cell, estimate the prevalence of mobility competition by cell, and so forth.</p>

<p>It’s against the law to write a blog post about maps without liberal use of visuals, so let’s get started.[<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>] I’ll use H3 as an example, both because it’s something of a de facto standard and because it’s easy to use. These are probably related. Here’s how H3 divides North America into very coarse cells:</p>

<p><img src="https://evanfields.github.io/images/geogrids/h3_north_america.png" alt="North America" title="North America covered by H3 resolution 2 cells"></p>

<p>(The majority of the apparent distortion in cell size and shape comes from the web Mercator projection used in Kepler and approximately everywhere else on the web.)</p>

<p>Pretty much every grid system offers multiple resolutions. High resolutions (or precision levels, or granularities) correspond to partitioning the Earth’s surface into many small cells; low resolutions correspond to a few big cells. For example, here’s Boston with two sizes of H3 cells. I’ve plotted a large cell by the public garden and seven smaller cells by MIT. Collectively, the seven small cells have the same area as the large cell.</p>

<p><img src="https://evanfields.github.io/images/geogrids/h3_boston.png" alt="Boston" title="Boston with H3 resolution 8 and 9 cells"></p>



<p>Creating a global grid system requires lots of design decisions: how is the Earth’s surface (not flat, despite my best efforts) projected to flat surfaces? What kind of planar grid overlays those flat surfaces? Or maybe a projection-free grid is possible? How are cells shaped and oriented? What resolutions are available, and how do they relate to each other?</p>

<p>The best design choices are surely context dependent, but we can list some reasonable desiderata for a general purpose global grid system:</p>
<ol>
  <li>All cells at a given resolution have equal size, or at least nearly equal.</li>
  <li>All cells have the same shape, and that shape is close to a convex regular polygon.</li>
  <li>All neighbors of a given cell are at the same distance from that cell.</li>
  <li>Multiple cell resolutions are available, and each cell is perfectly partitioned by cells of a finer resolution.</li>
  <li>The grid system covers the entire earth, and each point on the earth is in exactly one cell of a given granularity. In other words, the grid system is not made up of overlapping mutually-incompatible subgrids.</li>
</ol>

<p>Unfortunately, these design goals conflict with each other. Let’s try to design a grid system that satisfies them. Start with desideratum #2, that cells are regular polygons. The Earth is approximately spherical, and up close spheres look like planes. So our cells must tile the plane. If our cells are regular convex polygons, that means cells must be equilateral triangles, squares, or regular hexagons.</p>

<p>Triangles and squares violate goal #4 by having different flavors of neighbors. For example, a square cell (in green below) has both edge-neighbors (red) and corner-neighbors (blue); the corner neighbors are much farther away:</p>

<p><img src="https://evanfields.github.io/images/geogrids/square_neighbors.svg" alt="Square neighbors" title="Neighbors of a square cell"></p>

<p>Triangles are even worse, with three types of neighbors. Hexagons, on the other hand, have only one kind of neighbor. In a hexagonal tiling of the plane, each hexagon cell (green) has six neighbors (blue), which correspond to the cell’s six edges and are each at the same distance away:</p>

<p><img src="https://evanfields.github.io/images/geogrids/hex_neighbors.svg" alt="Hexagon neighbors" title="Neighbors of a hexagonal cell"></p>

<p>So maybe we should use hexagons? While I do believe hexagons are the best choice for general use, they’re not perfect either. In particular, they don’t subdivide perfectly. With square[-ish] cells, each cell can be perfectly subdivided into 4 similar sub-cells. But hexagons can’t be subdivided into similar smaller hexagons; the best strategy I know of comes from H3, which approximately divides each hexagon into 7 smaller rotated hexagons.</p>

<p><img src="https://evanfields.github.io/images/geogrids/subdiv.svg" alt="Cell subdivision" title="Cell subdivision"></p>

<p>So we’ve reached a contradiction. Regular polygon grid cells implies triangle, square, or hexagon cells. Each cell having just one kind of neighbor implies hexagonal cells, but each cell subdividing nicely implies not hexagonal cells. ⇒⇐</p>

<p>Maybe we shouldn’t have been using convex regular polygons? There are definitely exotic plane tiling schemes that don’t rely on regular polygons, but regular polygons are important because they minimize the perimeter to area ratio. One of many reasons this is important: location data is often imprecise. Let’s say you know locations only up to ± 10 meters, mabye due to GPS limitations. Then any time you think a point is less than 10 meters from a cell boundary, you should be worried that the point is actually in a neighboring cell. To minimize this situation, we’d want to minimize the perimeter to area ratio, which pushes us towards regular polygons. For example, consider a very spiky rhombus type shape: almost the whole area is near the boundary.</p>

<p><img src="https://evanfields.github.io/images/geogrids/inset.svg" alt="Rhombus" title="Most of the rhombus' area is near its boundary."></p>

<p>There are other subtle tensions between these five goals. Because the Earth is not flat, projecting the earth to a [collection of] flat spaces does involve some distortion, even for very clever projections such as those used by S2 and H3. These distortions will end up creating some variability between cells: not all cells will be the same size and shape. For example, even though H3 uses a very clever projection, at each resolution the largest cell in the world has area about twice that of the smallest cell. (Nearby cells have approximately the same area.) Check out some <a href="https://observablehq.com/@nrabinowitz/h3-area-stats">measurements</a> and a <a href="https://observablehq.com/@nrabinowitz/h3-area-variation">cool visualization which reveals the projection structure</a>.</p>

<h2 id="s2-and-h3">S2 and H3</h2>
<p>Google’s S2 and Uber’s H3 navigate the inevitable design tradeoffs slightly differently:</p>

<p><strong>S2</strong> projects the Earth’s surface to a cube, which corresponds to dividing the surface into six square-like shapes bounded by geodesics. Each square-like shape is then recursively divided into smaller squares. This strategy gives cells which are perfectly partitioned by cells at a higher resolution, but comes with the expected downsides of square-ish cells: different flavors of cell neighbors, higher perimeter/volume ratio than a hexagon would have, etc. In some parts of the world, the cells assume a more rhombus like shape, I think. I’m not sure how cell area varies over the world.</p>

<p><strong>H3</strong> projects the Earth’s surface to an icosahedron and then does a soccer-ball type pentagon and hexagon tessellation. At every resolution there are exactly 12 pentagons, and the icosahedron orientation is carefully chosen to put all 12 pentagons in the oceans. So unless you’re using very coarse cells or doing world-wide ocean mapping, in practice all cells you encounter will be hexagons. The carefully chosen projection orientation means that the orientation of individual hex cells is beyond the user’s control.</p>

<p>As we’ve seen, hexagons have nice neighbor properties but don’t subdivide cleanly. Also, each H3 resolution level changes hexagon area by a factor of 7 (i.e. a hexagon cell is approximately subdivided by 7 smaller cells at one resolution higher). This means the user has quite little control over cell size, especially because of the aforementioned variability in cell size at a given resolution.</p>



<p>Recall the 5th desideratum from above:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The grid system covers the entire earth, and each point on the earth is in exactly one cell of a given granularity. In other words, the grid system is not made up of overlapping mutually-incompatible subgrids.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This requirement is entirely reasonable; consider what happens if we relax this constraint and allow our grid system to be a collection of overlapping grids, each with sub-global coverage. Then a given point on the Earth’s surface may be in multiple cells belonging to multiple subgrids; subgrids have boundaries, meaning that a cell near the boundary may not have any neighbors; there may be discontinuities between grids, etc. Potentially nasty stuff!</p>

<p>On the other hand, many of the inevitable tradeoffs in global grid design arise exactly because of the single-global-grid criterion: the Earth’s surface is not flat → the surface must be projected to a flat space → distortion and irregularities occur.</p>

<p>Depending on your use case, it may be totally irrelevant to you whether your grid system is a single global grid. This is certainly the case for me at my day job. At Zoba we use grids to model mobility networks and dynamics in one city at a time. Even the spatially largest cities are quite small compared to the curvature of the Earth; at city scale, the Earth is approximately flat. So if I’m using a grid system to model, say, Boston (where I live), I don’t particularly care whether that grid system is built on a clever projection. If my grid system only extends as far as the Rocky Mountains or the middle of the Atlantic Ocean or has some noticeable distortion in northern Canada—totally fine.</p>



<p>I built a proof of concept geographic grid package to explore what’s possible when we ignore the global grid requirement. The world is big so I’m sure somebody has done this before, but I’m not aware of a widely used grid system which makes the same set of tradeoffs I have. I should also add a disclaimer that the code is solidly…fine…and while I’d be delighted for you to look at or copy it (MIT license), I strongly advise against using it as-is for any important work or production systems.</p>

<p><code>HexGeoGrids.jl</code> (<a href="https://github.com/evanfields/HexGeoGrids.jl">GitHub</a>) is a Julia package defining a large set of overlapping hexagonal grids, as well as some basic utilities for working with …</p></div></div>

The bug had been present in </span><span>sudo </span><span>for nearly 10 years. Their report, which can be found here </span><a href="https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-research/2021/01/26/cve-2021-3156-heap-based-buffer-overflow-in-sudo-baron-samedit"><span>CVE-2021-3156: Heap-Based Buffer Overflow in Sudo (Baron Samedit) | Qualys Security Blog</span></a><span>, outlines the root cause and three possible methods of exploitation.</span></p><p><span><br></span><span>Here, we give a brief overview of the relevant workings of sudo. Then we discuss the vulnerability as well as one possible exploitation method in depth. The details of exploitation will focus on our application of the technique known as “heap grooming” or “heap feng shui”. Lastly, we outline the fix.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span>Sudo (utility)

</span></h2><p><span>Sudo, or “superuser do”, is a widely used utility which assists people in administrating their Unix systems. Many Unix derived operating systems have sudo packaged by default.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>According to the </span><a href="https://www.sudo.ws/man/1.9.5/sudo.man.html"><span>sudo manual</span></a><span>, “sudo allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user, as specified by the security policy.” The main use for sudo is to have fine-grained control over which users are able to perform which tasks on a given set of hosts. For example, it allows a superuser to delegate responsibilities to other users without having to share the root password with them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>There are two main designs realised in sudo: a policy plugin and a timestamp ticket system. The policy system decides which users are permitted to elevate their privileges, for which host, and for which particular commands. These capabilities are outlined by default in the </span><a href="https://www.sudo.ws/man/1.9.5/sudoers.man.html"><span>sudoers file</span></a><span> and through consulting system databases. Additionally, the ticket system decides the duration for which these privileges are elevated before the next sudo password prompt.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Sudo achieves temporary elevation of privileges by utilising the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid"><span>Unix setuid permission bit</span></a><span>. This allows an executable to be run with the owner’s permissions. Where the owner may not be the same user who runs the executable. Because sudo is owned by root, it is run in the context of root.</span></p><p><span>When sudo is run, it parses the sudoers policy file to decide whether the current user’s requested command should be executed. It then prompts for the user’s password and forks into a child process whose effective user id allows it to perform the requested commands. </span><br></p><h2><span>The bug</span></h2><h3><span>What is the bug?

</span></h3><p><span id="docs-internal-guid-f5bbe507-7fff-11e2-d69d-e9a8f23e7b78"><span>The bug is a </span><a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html"><span>heap-based buffer overflow</span></a><span>. It is possible because of an inconsistency between the conditions which guard the initial </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacharacter#Escaping"><span>metacharacter escaping</span></a><span> and concatenation mechanism and the conditions which guard the subsequent unescaping and buffer write mechanism. At its core, the bug could be described as a </span><a href="https://siguza.github.io/psychicpaper/"><span>parser differential error</span></a><span> resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow. </span></span></p><h3><span>What is the input and what are the parsers?</span></h3><p><span>The input is the command line arguments supplied to sudo which need to be processed and potentially run in an elevated context.

            <!-- content --><p>Recently, we moved one of our Arista 32x 100GbE lab switches. Patrick, our Editor-in-Chief, pulled it out of the rack and wanted to do a little feature on it, so we put together a short “inside the switch” look of the Arista DCS-7060CX-32S 32x 100GbE switch. Unlike servers that we get to do weekly looks at hardware, switches are much harder to take a look at. As a result, Patrick did the video, and I am doing a web overview so our readers can see how these are made.<span id="more-50661"></span></p>
<h2>Inside the Arista DCS-7060CX-32S 32x 100GbE Switch</h2>
<p>If you want to see the video version, you can see it here.</p>
<p><iframe title="Inside an Arista 32x 100GbE switch that had a $30k List Price" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZPbxScPWOx4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As always, we suggest opening it in a YouTube tab. There are more angles there than we can show in pictures.</p>
<h2>Arista 7060CX-32S Hardware Overview</h2>
<p>The switch itself is a 1U form factor for standard 19″ racks. The front of the switch has 32x 100GbE ports. One will notice that there are also two SFP+ ports on the left side of the switch.</p>

<p>We also have a management, RJ45 COM port, and USB port on the side to manage the switch.</p>

<p>The rear of the switch has four hot-swappable fans and two power supplies. One can see these have red handles so we have a port to PSU airflow switch.</p>

<p>The switch cooling solution is interesting. There is a center section heatsink with a few fins. That center heatsink has heat pipes that dart to either side with much denser fin arrays. The total heatsink length is around 15″ including the tips of the heat pipes.</p>

<p>Many of the switches we see have power supplies that connect to the control PCB rather than the switch PCB. This Arista switch is designed to directly connect the power supplies to the higher-power switch PCB.</p>

<p>Powering the system we get an AMD embedded SoC. This is the AMD GX-424CC from what we can see in the switch. Arista has an x86 platform for managing the switch. A fun fact is that this chip technically has Radeon 5E graphics onboard. Although there are no display outputs, technically there is AMD GPU IP in this switch.</p>

<p>Something else that is very important here is that by using an AMD embedded CPU instead of the common Intel Atom C2000 series. As a result, we do not have to worry about the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/intel-atom-c2000-series-bug-quiet/">Intel Atom C2000 Series Bug (AVR54)</a>. We have had the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/intel-atom-c2000-avr54-bug-strikes-sth/">Intel Atom C2000 AVR54 Bug Strike STH</a>. Atom 2000 switches, without the fix or new chip stepping can suddenly fail to boot. Using the AMD embedded CPU, this particular bug is not a concern unlike many switches such as the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/inside-a-celestica-seastone-dx010-32x-100gbe-switch/">Celestica Seastone DX010 32x 100GbE Switch</a> we looked at a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>Memory is very interesting. There are two DDR3 slots and one is populated. Per the spec sheet, we were expecting to see a 4GB DIMM here. Instead, this is clearly an 8GB DIMM.</p>

<p>In the lab, this switch runs under 200W for us and the specs state a maximum power draw of 333W, so to us, the 5W difference is more of a curiosity rather than a cause for concern.</p>

<p>One other quick note that we wanted to mention about this switch. If you want to run EOS, then that is fairly straightforward on this platform. If you want to venture into the world of open networking, then this switch supports SONiC. You can check out Arista SONiC on <a href="https://github.com/aristanetworks/sonic">GitHub</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_50681" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50681"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/inside-the-arista-dcs-7060cx-32s-32x-100gbe-switch/arista-7060cx-32s-sonic-supported-devices-from-the-data-sheet/" rel="attachment wp-att-50681"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Arista-7060CX-32S-SONiC-Supported-Devices-from-the-Data-Sheet.jpg" alt="Arista 7060CX 32S SONiC Supported Devices From The Data Sheet" width="702" height="232" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Arista-7060CX-32S-SONiC-Supported-Devices-from-the-Data-Sheet.jpg 702w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Arista-7060CX-32S-SONiC-Supported-Devices-from-the-Data-Sheet-400x132.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Arista-7060CX-32S-SONiC-Supported-Devices-from-the-Data-Sheet-696x230.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-50681">Arista 7060CX 32S SONiC Supported Devices From The Data Sheet</figcaption></figure>
<p>We took a snapshot of the list above because at STH we had a guide years ago on getting <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/get-started-with-40gbe-sdn-with-microsoft-azure-sonic-for-under-1k/">started with 40GbE SDN with Microsoft Azure SONiC for under $1K</a> using the 7050QX 40GBE generation of this part.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>Overall, we wanted to show one of Arista’s 100GbE switches that you can use to get started with SONiC. If you either currently or hope to, work in the networking space, it is likely wise to learn about SONiC since that is a huge force in the industry. Also, 100GbE is a rapidly growing standard that will be bolstered by the transition to PCIe Gen4 this year and PCIe Gen5 in 2022 and 2023. In the last year or so, our test platforms at STH have been adopting 25GbE and we use 100GbE switches with breakout cables in our lab racks for testing. With PCIe Gen4 we can get dual 100GbE ports in a single PCIe Gen4 x16 slot, and there are new lower-cost 100GbE NICs such as the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/supermicro-aoc-s100gc-i2c-100gbe-intel-800-series-nic-review/">Supermicro AOC-S100GC-i2C 100GbE Intel 800 Series NIC</a> hitting the market.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-240">

	

	<div>
		<p>This blog used a&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/levlaz/blog">simple homegrown blogging engine</a>&nbsp;that I wrote backed by a SQLite database. I have a function in the flask app that performs database migrations. My current approach has been to keep a folder full of migrations and run them sequentially whenever the app starts.</p>
<p>This works well for the case of adding and removing tables since SQLite has the handy&nbsp;<code>IF NOT EXISTS</code>&nbsp;option. However, when you are altering an existing table, this entire model falls apart since&nbsp;<code>IF NOT EXISTS</code>&nbsp;no longer works.</p>
<p>Practically, this means that outside of a fresh install my database migrations are useless.</p>
<p>I am still being stubborn and not using a well written solution like&nbsp;<a href="http://alembic.zzzcomputing.com/en/latest/">Alembic</a>&nbsp;(which I would highly recommend for a “serious” project) for this blog. Instead, I discovered that SQLite comes with a built in mechanism to keep track of the user schema. This is the&nbsp;<a href="https://sqlite.org/pragma.html">pragma</a>statement, and specifically&nbsp;<a href="https://sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_user_version">user_version</a>.</p>
<h2>Using PRAGMA user_data for DB Migrations</h2>
<p>My migrations folder structure looks like this:</p>
<div>
<pre>.
├── blog.db
├── blog.py
├── __init__.py
├── migrations
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── 0001_initial_schema.sql
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── 0002_add_unique_index_to_posts_tags.sql
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── 0003_add_fts.sql
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── 0004_add_column_to_post.sql
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── 0005_add_comments_table.sql
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── 0006_add_admin_flag_to_comments.sql
</pre>
</div>
<p>As you can see the naming convention is&nbsp;<code>000N_migration_description.sql</code>. Each migration file has the following statement in it:</p>
<div>
<pre>PRAGMA user_version=N; (where N is the 000"N" part of the file name)
</pre>
</div>
<p>This steps the current&nbsp;<code>user_version</code>&nbsp;to be equal to the current version as defined by the file name.</p>
<p>The code to do stuff with the database is shown below:</p>
<div>
<pre><span>def</span> <span>connect_db</span><span>():</span>

</pre>
</div>
<p>The relevant part to this blog post is the&nbsp;<code>migrate_db()</code>&nbsp;function. Two things are happening.</p>
<ol>
<li>The&nbsp;<code>get_script_version()</code>&nbsp;helper function extracts the integer from the migration name.</li>
<li><code>current_version</code>&nbsp;gets the current value of&nbsp;<code>user_version</code>&nbsp;of your database.</li>
<li>We iterate over each migration file in the&nbsp;<code>migrations</code>&nbsp;folder and perform a simple check. If the migration version is larger than the current_version we run the migration, otherwise it gets skipped.</li>
</ol>
<p>This solves for most cases and allows for a smooth upgrade path if anyone ever decides to start using this blogging engine for themselves. I am still pretty happy with this approach because this is essentially a fully functional migration system in just a handful of lines of python.</p>

This blog post is a great example. It had been a draft for a long time, and I was hesitant to publish it. I waited and waited, just in case I could think of a few more tips. I mean, everyone would benefit from 15 tips rather than 10, right? Wrong. If I didn't publish, then nobody would benefit from even 1 tip. <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/1709">A draft post tends to remain a draft</a>. Get your posts published. I want to hear your ideas!</p></li><li><p>You don't always have to write about the next big thing, or what everyone is currently talking about. Countless millions of websites use web technologies that are many years old. Write about whatever interests you and you will find an audience, trust me.</p></li><li><p>Blog about things that scratch your own itch. For example, you may have had trouble setting up a server, or found it hard to understand a JavaScript library. It can be anything. Posts that explain and describe how you solved a problem you experienced are really helpful to other developers.</p></li><li><p>If you are planning a complex or technical blog post and it seems intimidating, try breaking your plan into smaller steps. Limit the time you spend on each step–30 minutes, for example. Completing each step will help give your motivation a boost, and help you stop feeling lost in one huge task. You can use these regular motivational mini-boosts to keep going and help you write your post!</p></li><li><p>You may think of something you would like to write about, but do not know where to start, or have little idea how to structure the information. A good way to overcome this is to create headings, and place information under these headings. This can influence how you write and section your work and can help you get your awesome post out to the world faster.</p></li><li><p>As Anne Lamott, who wrote a book on how to write, says—get all your thoughts down in a "shitty first draft". Don't focus on editing grammar or spelling right at the beginning. Your draft will most likely change a lot as you are writing.</p></li><li><p>I don't use grammar or spellcheckers much myself but there are definitely a number of tools that can help!</p></li><li><p>Don't blog for attention or money! This will most likely make your motivation for blogging hit a roadblock, and fast. Blog for fun, let your creativity flow, and connect with other people. That's all it should be about. Other rewards are just side effects.</p></li></ul></div></article><a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/ambrwlsn" aria-label="Buy Amber a coffee"><svg width="20.84" height="24.79" viewBox="0 0 884

<p>A Python library for unevenly-spaced time series analysis.</p>
<div id="why">
<h2>Why?<a href="#why" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Taking measurements at irregular intervals is common, but most tools
are primarily designed for evenly-spaced measurements. Also, in the
real world, time series have missing observations or you may have
multiple series with different frequencies: it’s can be useful to
model these as unevenly-spaced.</p>
<p>Traces aims to make it simple to write <em>readable code</em> to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wrangle</strong>. Read, write, and manipulate unevenly-spaced time series data</li>
<li><strong>Explore</strong>. Perform basic analyses of unevenly-spaced time series
data without making an awkward / lossy transformation to
evenly-spaced representations</li>
<li><strong>Convert</strong>. Gracefully transform unevenly-spaced times series data to
evenly-spaced representations</li>
</ul>
<p>Traces was designed by the team at <a href="https://datascopeanalytics.com/">Datascope</a> based on several practical
applications in different domains, because it turns out
<a href="https://datascopeanalytics.com/blog/unevenly-spaced-time-series/">unevenly-spaced data is actually pretty great, particularly for
sensor data analysis</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="installation">
<h2>Installation<a href="#installation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To install traces, run this command in your terminal:</p>

<div id="quickstart-using-traces">
<h2>Quickstart: using traces<a href="#quickstart-using-traces" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To see a basic use of traces, let’s look at these data from a light
switch, also known as <em>Big Data from the Internet of Things</em>.</p>
<p><img alt="light switch trace" src="https://traces.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/trace.svg"></p>
<p>The main object in traces is a <a href="https://traces.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference.html#timeseries"><span>TimeSeries</span></a>, which
you create just like a dictionary, adding the five measurements at
6:00am, 7:45:56am, etc.</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>What if you want to know if the light was on at 11am? Unlike a
python dictionary, you can look up the value at any time even if it’s
not one of the measurement times.</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>time_series</span><span>[</span><span>datetime</span><span>(</span><span>2042</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>11</span><span>,</span>  <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>)]</span> <span># 11:00am</span>

</div>
<p>The <code><span>distribution</span></code> function gives you the fraction of time that the
<code><span>TimeSeries</span></code> is in each state.</p>

<p>Nouriel Roubini, an economics professor at New York University, thinks Tether is issuing fake money. And that nothing short of an audit will prove the $30 billion in USDT the BVI-registered company has spewed out into the crypto markets thus far are even 74% backed. (Stuart Hoegner, the firm’s general counsel, claimed they were three-quarters backed in April 2019 court documents.)</p>



<p>Tether is a “criminal enterprise,” he bluntly told reporters on <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/video/nouriel-roubini-reacting-to-teslas-big-bitcoin-buy-sec-should-investigate-market-manipulation">Coindesk TV</a>. In a 10-minute interview, Roubini predicted Tether’s looming demise, called for the SEC to look into <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/on-twitter-elon-musk-has-mused-about-bitcoin-11612821103">Elon Musk’s bitcoin tweets,</a> and claimed that central bank digital currencies will spell the end for crypto. </p>



<figure><div>
<p><span><iframe width="1000" height="563" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fy2oEgWnCck?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></p>
</div></figure>



<p>Dr. Doom, as Roubini is called, talks quickly, doesn’t mince words, and his face barely changes expression. He has a reputation as a perpetual pessimist. Ask him a question, and he will give you a straightforward, often bleak, answer. Though he might argue, he is simply being a realist. </p>



<p>I am not sure why Coindesk had him on their program. Roubini hates bitcoin and his responses elicited laughter—though it wouldn’t be the first time. Roubini “sounded like a madman in 2006,” when he stood before economists at the International Monetary Fund and announced a crisis of solvency was brewing, IMF economist Prakash Loungani <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/17/magazine/17pessimist-t.html">told the NYT in August 2008.</a> “He was a prophet when he returned in 2007.”</p>



<p>Anyhow, I transcribed the talk only because I thought Roubini’s points made sense. He was interviewed by Coindesk’s Lawrence Lewitinn, Christine Lee, and Emily Parker.</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p><strong>Lee</strong>: The narrative on bitcoin has shifted from a means of payment to a store of value for some. It is not so much used as a currency as a digital gold. Institutions and public companies are buying this thesis and we are seeing bitcoin hit records as a result. What do you make of this institutional and corporate interest in bitcoin, underlined by <a href="https://amycastor.com/2021/02/08/tesla-spent-1-5b-in-clean-car-credits-on-bitcoin-the-filthiest-asset-imaginable/">Tesla’s $1.5 billion bitcoin investment</a> on Monday?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Roubini</strong>: As you suggested, bitcoin and crypto is not a means of payment. It is not a currency. It is not a unit of account. Is not a scalable means of payment. It is not a single <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/numeraire.asp">numeraire.</a> Now, people say it is an asset. But think of it. What are assets? Assets like stocks, bonds and real estate give you income or give you some use, like real estate. And, therefore, they give you capital gain. Gold does not give you income but it has other uses,—industrial activity and jewelry—and therefore, has some value. It used to be used as a means of payment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the case of bitcoin, it does not have any income. It doesn’t have any use. It doesn’t have any utility. So the value of it based on what? Based on no intrinsic value and purely a speculative bubble. That is why I argue that bitcoin, like all the other shitcoins, are worth zero. [Coindesk reporters giggle.]&nbsp;</p>



<p>Actually, negative given the hogging of energy and the environmental cost. If there was a carbon tax on crypto, the value of these assets would be negative.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So what is the fundamental value? What is the use? What is the utility that justifies the capital gain? None. It is a speculative bubble that is based on pump-and-dump, spoofing, wash trading and manipulation by Tether, which is a total scam.&nbsp;[More giggling from Coindesk crew.]</p>



<p>So, for institutional investors, saying we are going to invest in crypto doesn’t make any sense. You have a failing company that had a flat stock market like MicroStrategy for a decade, and its head was a coke addict who decided to bet the entire house on bitcoin. [CoinDesk crew really losing it.] That is irresponsible behavior. It is not gonna be any corporate head that is going to put his cash, as you point out, into something that is so volatile. You put your cash into something that is stable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And for someone like Elon Musk who knows he has a market impact to manipulate to first, take an individual position to bitcoin, pump the price up, and then say that Tesla is invested. And Tesla doesn’t make money yet. It is also irresponsible and it is market manipulation.&nbsp;[Note: <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/bitcoin-spikes-20percent-after-elon-musk-adds-bitcoin-to-his-twitter-bio.html">Musk was tweeting about BTC,</a> pushing up the price, before Telsa announced it had purchased $1.5 billion worth.]</p>



<p>The SEC should be looking at people that have a market impact that manipulate the price of assets. That is also criminal behavior. It is totally a criminal enterprise. Tether is a criminal enterprise, and a bunch of whales and insiders are manipulating the price of bitcoins and other shitcoins day in and day out. That is a fact.</p>



<p><strong>Lewitinn</strong>: Dr. Roubini, always a ray of sunshine, of course. The question about Tether is this: We have known for a while now that it has been backed entirely by dollars. It is something like 70-some-odd percent. That came out a while ago. There have been questions about its backing for some time, for several years. Yet it is still trading on par with the US dollar. Conceivably, they have enough assets at least for a while to keep the peg going with the dollar. How much of a real worry is it for crypto if there is even a small run on tether?</p>



<p><strong>Roubini</strong>: First of all, we don’t know if it is backed 70% or not. Their lawyer says 70% but we have no idea. It doesn’t mean any[thing] absolute independent audit of it. [A bit garbled here, but he is saying, outside of a third-party audit, which Tether has never had, there is no way of knowing what’s backing tethers.]</p>



<p>We also know they are really issuing, literally, at an exponential rate, new tethers. In the last year alone, something like 25 billion. And in the last few weeks, a billion per week. So it looks like they are getting desperate, and it is a typical Ponzi scheme, in which you maintain the value of something by issuing more of it and more of it and so on.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lewitinn</strong>: How different is that from what is going on right now from the money printing happening in Washington?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Roubini</strong>: The money printing in Washington is happening at a rate that is much less than the issuance of fiat by Tether and other shitcoins. If you look at the chart of it, literally, the case of Tether is exponential. Second, central banks, if you know, their assets are matching their liabilities. For every dollar of currency in excess of reserves that are in the central bank balance sheet there is an asset, foreign reserve, or gold or treasury assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So the idea that fiat currencies are not backed by anything is utterly false. If you look at the balance sheet of any central bank, there are assets and there are liabilities. And actually, there is a positive net worth most of the time. But in the case of Tether there is nothing backing it. Again, even 70% is not true. And we know that every fixed exchange rate that is based on not-full-backing and not fully collateralized eventually collapses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The entire monetary history, every fixed exchange that is not backed has collapsed. It is only a matter of time. And the trigger is gonna be when the indictments of Tether and Bitfinex are going to occur, and it is only a matter of time this year. Because we know that there are investigations occurring.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Parker</strong>: Let’s move to central bank digital currencies for a moment. We know that China is moving quite rapidly in this area. Do you think that the US dollar will remain the world reserve currency?</p>



<p><strong>Roubini</strong>: I think that the Chinese are going to go ahead. [Sweden’s] Riksbank bank is going to go ahead. The [European Central Bank] is going to go ahead. And until now the US was behind the curve, but they realize that the Chinese had a plan to dominate the global financial system. It’s their e-commerce. It is their own platform of private payment systems like AliPay and WeChat Pay and that is going to be the e-RNB. And it is only a matter of time before we are going to phase out cash all over the world. And if the US wants to maintain the role of the US dollar as a major global reserve currency, they will have to move to an e-dollar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The problem with that is that people get excited in the crypto world when central banks end up talking about a central bank digital currency. A CBDC, first of all, has nothing to do with blockchain. It is going to be private. It is going to be centralized. It is going to be permissioned. And it is going to be based on a bunch of trusted authority verifying transactions. </p>



<p>It has nothing to do with blockchain. It has nothing to do with crypto. And as a payment system, it is going to dominate, not only crypto, which has absolutely no payment services, but also any private form of payment system that is digital, from credit cards to bank deposits to AliPay to WeChat pay to Venmo to Square to PayPal, and so on. Because it is going to be cheap, it is going to be instantaneous clearing and settlement. It is going to be a system that is going to dominate any form of private money</p>



<p>If and when a central bank currency is going to be introduced, the problem is going to be that any form of private digital payment system is going to be crowded out, starting with crypto, which doesn’t have any payment service in the first place.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lee</strong>: Dr. Roubini, it sounds like you believe that the technology underlying bitcoin is at least sound and that governments and central banks around the world will adopt it, and if that is the case, what happens to privacy? And you also mentioned something about negative rates becoming the norm. Tell us about that?</p>



<p><strong>Roubini</strong>: First of all, I said the opposite of the technology. The central bank digital currencies will not be based on blockchain. They are going to be private, not public. They are going to be centralized, not decentralized. They are going to be permissioned, not permissionless. They are going to be a bunch of central banks and private banks that are trusted verifiers of the transaction, rather than being trustless. So the technology is not going to be blockchain. It is not going to be crypto. That is my point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Secondly, the advantage of having a central bank digital …</p></div></article></div>

This article is a collection of direct thoughts from many individuals in the space — my value-add was in the aggregation, distillation, and combination of narratives.</p><h3>Work is&nbsp;Energy</h3><p>The idea of “work” being energy started when the French Mathematician&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaspard-Gustave_de_Coriolis" target="_blank">Gaspard-Gustave de Coriolis</a>&nbsp;introduced the idea of energy being “work done.”&nbsp;A long time ago, the work done in the economy was entirely human. That work was powered by food.</p><p>About a million years ago, humans&nbsp;stumbled across fire. As a result,&nbsp;the energy available to us increased because now we could keep warm not just from what we ate but also from burning. So this added energy usage improved our standard of living.</p><p>Some thousands of years ago, our energy usage increased still further when we domesticated animals. Animals could labor in our place. Those new laborers also had to be fed. Large amounts of food were required to meet the energy demand, and our prosperity increased alongside.</p><p>In the last few hundred years, we built great machines. Those mechanized machines produced work, first from sources like water &amp; wind, and then the cheaper sources like coal and gas, and now from nuclear sources (fission/fusion).&nbsp;Both machines and nature produce work through the utilization of energy.&nbsp;We have an economy based not on money, but on work and energy.</p><p>All things in our lives are closely linked to the price of energy.&nbsp;Purifying water requires energy. Transporting products requires energy. Manufacturing products requires energy. Cooking requires energy. Refrigerators and freezers require energy.&nbsp;In a free market, the cost of any good largely reflects the energy used in producing that good.&nbsp;Because free markets encourage the lowest priced goods, the energy used in&nbsp;producing&nbsp;any good is minimized.Money, which is the representation of the work required to generate goods and services, can also be viewed as stored energy.<br></p></div></div><div data-aspect-ratio="51.69491525423729" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1546761626522_12337"><div>

The concept was popular due to its sound money characteristics, including:&nbsp;a well-defined unit of account, easy measurement/not easily counterfeited, divisibility into smaller units, and fungibility (that these units would be equivalent to any other unit).However, energy money was flawed — it could not be transmitted or stored easily.</p><p>To enjoy this article in its fullest, I recommend playing this song then continue reading.

Bitcoin’s Proof of Work (PoW) was originally invented as a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system" target="_blank">measure against email spam</a>. Only later did Satoshi adapt it to be used in digital cash.&nbsp;What PoW mining does under the hood, is use dedicated machines (ASICs) to convert electricity into Bitcoins (via block reward).&nbsp;The machine repeatedly performs hash operations (guesses/votes) until it solves a cryptographic puzzle and receives Bitcoins (block reward).&nbsp;The solution to the puzzle proves that the miner spent energy in the form of&nbsp;ASICs&nbsp;and electricity, a proof that a miner put in work.&nbsp;Bitcoin has a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/pow-cheapest/" target="_blank">capitalistic</a>&nbsp;voting mechanism, “money risked, votes gained”&nbsp;through the energy/ASICs used to generate hashes (votes). — <a href="https://medium.com/u/3efc6d31e61c" target="_blank">Hugo Nguyen</a></p><p>When Satoshi designed PoW, he was&nbsp;fundamentally changing how consensus between humans is formed from political votes to&nbsp;apolitical votes (hashes)&nbsp;via the conversion of energy.&nbsp;PoW is proof of burn, or the validation that energy was burnt.&nbsp;Why is that important?&nbsp;It’s the most simplistic and fair way for the physical world to validate something in the digital world.&nbsp;PoW is about physics, not code.&nbsp;Bitcoin is a super commodity, minted from energy, the fundamental&nbsp;<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/energy-and-civilization" target="_blank">commodity</a>&nbsp;of the universe.&nbsp;PoW transmutes electricity into digital gold.</p><p>The Bitcoin ledger can only be immutable if and&nbsp;only if it is costly to produce.The fact that Proof of Work (PoW) is “costly” is a feature, not a bug.&nbsp;Until very recently, securing something meant building a thick physical wall around whatever is deemed valuable. The new world of cryptocurrency is&nbsp;unintuitive and weird — there are no physical walls to protect our money, no doors&nbsp;to access our vaults.&nbsp;Bitcoin’s public ledger is secured by its collective hashing power: the&nbsp;sum of all energy&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@dergigi/bitcoins-energy-consumption-6dd7d7a2e463" target="_blank">expended</a>&nbsp;to build the wall.&nbsp;And through its transparent costly design, it would take an equivalent amount of energy to tear it down (<a href="http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2008/08/" target="_blank">unforgeable costliness</a>).</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610323703673_15325"><div><h3>Energy Consumption</h3><p>The cryptopocalypse is coming — Bitcoin’s (PoW) is so bad that it’s going to destroy the world in 2020! You may have noticed that&nbsp;most of the “doomsday” articles were based on the results of an analysis provided by Alex De Vries, a “financial economist and blockchain specialist” working for PWC Netherlands and author of the site&nbsp;<a href="https://digiconomist.net/" target="_blank">Digiconomist</a>. His estimation has already received a fair share of criticism due to its poor energy consumption calculation. But&nbsp;the KPI of his choosing was intentionally misleading: “the electricity consumption per transaction”&nbsp;for several reasons:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>The&nbsp;energy spent is per block, which can have a varying number of transactions.&nbsp;More transactions does not mean more energy</p></li><li><p>The&nbsp;economic density of a Bitcoin transaction is always increasing(Batching, Segwit, Lightning, etc).&nbsp;As bitcoin becomes more of a settlement network,&nbsp;each unit of energy is securing exponentially more and more economic value.</p></li><li><p>The average cost per transaction isn’t an adequate metric for measuring the efficiency of Bitcoin’s PoW, it should be defined in terms of the security of an economic history.&nbsp;The energy spend secures the stock of bitcoin, and that percentage is going down over time as inflation decreases.&nbsp;A Bitcoin “accumulates” the energy associated with all the blocks mined since its creation.&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/u/1852b393b452" target="_blank">LaurentMT</a>, a researcher, has found&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@laurentmt/gravity-10e1a25d2ab2" target="_blank">empirically</a>&nbsp;that&nbsp;Bitcoin’s PoW is indeed becoming more efficient over time:&nbsp;increasing cost is counterbalanced by the even greater increasing total value secured by the system.</p></li></ul><p>Now that we know what the right KPI is for ROI on energy consumption, let’s take a look at how energy costs are trending for Bitcoin’s PoW.</p><p>The&nbsp;rate of ASIC efficiency improvement is slowing.

The same concerns around “unfair” energy consumption existed for aluminum nearly 40 years ago — <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1979/10/29/aluminum-industry-at-center-of-northwests-energy-fight/62fdb02f-ad72-4685-a450-490e12a58059/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.126a3788a2a4" target="_blank">1979</a>&nbsp;(including concerns of centralization).

<p>In my first week on the job as a software developer, I deleted an entire table’s worth of data from a client’s database. Luckily, we had a backup from the night before and that table was low traffic. What happened was that I <em>thought</em> I was on the staging server and I was doing some testing and needed to clear out the existing data. I was not on staging. I was on production. I learned a valuable lesson and I was determined never to make the same mistake again.</p>



<p>Enter, color coded SSH sessions:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="686" height="607" src="https://stevenwadejr.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/EB9DL-_XkAEbAYp.png" alt="" srcset="https://stevenwadejr.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/EB9DL-_XkAEbAYp.png 686w, https://stevenwadejr.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/EB9DL-_XkAEbAYp-300x265.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px"></figure>



<p>I developed color schemes for different environments that would easily stand out and alert me of where I was.</p>



<p>For my local environment, I use a black background with green text. This is part Matrix and part me not having a computer growing up in the 90s and missing out on the nostalgia of pre-GUI terminals. On staging, I use a blue/violet mix that isn’t jarring to the eye or mind but still catches my attention and makes me aware of the environment. Lastly, for production-based servers I use a red background which definitely stands for “ALERT, whatever you do will have consequences!”</p>



<p>To color code the environments I use separate profiles within <a href="https://iterm2.com/documentation-dynamic-profiles.html">iTerm</a>. Once I customized the profiles to my liking, I needed a way to easily and dynamically switch between them. I did some googling and came across a bash function on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/53683101">StackOverflow</a> called it2prof. Essentially this function is a shortcut to an iTerm command to switch profiles but the function is a lot cleaner to use: <code>it2prof staging</code>. That command will then switch the current iTerm window’s profile to the profile and color scheme of my “staging” profile.</p>



<p>To connect to an environment, I use shortcuts and aliases to run my commands at once, for instance: <code>ssh staging</code> aliases to <code>it2prof staging &amp;&amp; ssh steven@stage01</code> which will change the terminal profile and then ssh into my staging server.</p>



<p>This level of safe guarding will likely do for most people, however, I am paranoid and now I have multiple production environments to deal with. For instance, at work, we use a control box to do our releases, but we also have individual production servers that you can log into. So I wanted an extra notification of where I was to pop up.</p>

<p>Text to ASCII! I wanted a proper warning message to pop up and be as in my face as possible to let me know which boxes I was on. I used <a href="http://ascii.mastervb.net/">this tool</a> to convert my text to ASCII art which I then saved to text files either on my local machine or the remote server.</p>



<p>If you have your own user on a server you could do like what I did on the staging environment and update the .bashrc file to output the contents of a file when your Bash profile is loaded (upon log in). To do this, update your .bashrc file with a line like <code>cat env_msg.txt</code> where “env_msg.txt” is the text file containing your ASCII art.</p>



<p>My production servers use different user permissions so instead, I stored those warning files locally and just updated my aliases. For work, I created a <code>fub</code> (short for <a href="https://www.followupboss.com/">Follow Up Boss</a>) function that helps me do various things, one of them being ssh-ing into a server. I simply updated each SSH command with a call to <code>cat</code> my text file like so: <code>it2prof control &amp;&amp; cat /Users/steven/production-warning.txt &amp;&amp; ssh production01</code>. Now all I have to type into my terminal is <code>fub ssh prod01</code> and my terminal profile turns red, I get the boldface production warning, and I’m ssh’d into the proper machine.</p>



<p>Now, I’m always aware of what machine I’m working on and I haven’t made the same mistake again as I did all those years ago.</p>



<p>Do what you need to to guard/help yourself. Remember, stay safe out there.</p>

        <p>Over the past year and a half, I've been collaborating with <a href="https://darklang.com/">Dark</a> (a new programming language startup) to research programming languages and tools. Today we are sharing these reviews publicly.</p>
        <p>The Whole Earth Catalog was before my time, but I grew up immersed in many of the conversations it began. This series borrows its name, and continues in its tradition of "access to tools". Stewart Brand’s original inspiration for the Catalog was helping his "friends who were starting their own civilization hither and yon in the sticks." This series is likewise designed to help visionary friends, but where his friends were living off-the-grid, my friends are creating the programming environments of the future. This series is democratizing access to tools one-step removed. These reviews are for the makers of tools, those that are pushing our computational interfaces forward. The goal of the Whole Code Catalog is to provide inspiration for the tools you will one day create.</p>
        <p>Other similar efforts to catalog futuristic computational interfaces include:

<h2>Problem</h2>



<p>You’re at dinner with a group of friends. Everyone knows how much their meal cost. You have to add up each person’s meal cost to get a total.</p>



<ul><li>You: $11</li><li>Alice: $10</li><li>Bob: $12</li><li>Claire: $13</li></ul>



<h2>Procedural</h2>



<p>You call out to each person and ask them how much their meal cost. As they answer, you write on a piece of paper.</p>



<blockquote><p>11 + 10 = 21</p><p>21 + 12 = 33</p><p>33 + 13 = 46</p></blockquote>



<h2>Object-Oriented</h2>



<p>You have a calculator. You announce to everyone to key in their meal cost. You key in 11. You give the calculator to Alice. When Claire hands it to you it reads 46.</p>



<h2>Functional</h2>



<blockquote><p>You: Alice, what was the total for you and everyone to your left?</p><p>Alice: Bob, what was the total for you and everyone to your left?</p><p>Bob: Claire, what was the total for you and everyone to your left?</p><p>Claire: What was the total for you and everyone to your left?</p><p>You: $11 Claire</p><p>Clair: $24 Bob</p><p>Bob: $36 Alice</p><p>Alice: $46</p></blockquote>

    <p>In my <a href="https://paranoidenough.com/2021/01/25/The-Battle-of-Gamestop.html">last post</a>, I wrote about the GameStop short squeeze, the allure of Wall Street Bets, and how the theory of reflexivity can teach us about the broader societal implications of the trading frenzy. Two weeks later, the party is over and (once again) retail investors <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/02/gamestop-story-you-think-you-know-wrong/617905/">got the short end of the stick</a>.</p>

<p>Small investors were inveigled into a trade where they lost their shirts and some <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-hedge-fund-made-700-million-on-gamestop-11612390687">big players</a> and market makers made out like bandits. For about two days, buying GameStop stock was a “movement”. That is, until it became clear that the market is brutally efficient and doesn’t care about populist rhetoric. At that point, the GameStop trade turned into a game of “who is holding the bag”. When your investment thesis depends on the assumption that the mainstream media is outright lying to you and that massive fraud exists in the market, it’s time to get out.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>How did this happen? I’m not going to go into a play-by-play of what happened – enough has been said about this.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Rather, I’ll use GameStop as a case study for how reasonable, smart people get caught up in manias, cults, and mass movements.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/protest.jpg" alt="Protest"></p>

<h3 id="wall-street-bets-is-dead">Wall Street Bets is Dead…</h3>

<p>…and we have killed her. A month ago, Wall Street Bets was a subreddit with some stupid memes and outlandish options bets, but also with people who actually knew something about finance LARPing as “retards”.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> There was solid due diligence: in-depth analysis of companies’ financial statements along with market sizing and strategic growth prospects. Some of the analysis wasn’t that much different from the first draft of an investment memo for a buy-side firm.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/l7bl3z/brokers_of_reddit_how_crazy_is_it_where_you_work/gl64yau/">this Reddit comment</a> states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Redditors never seem to stop and think about why the WSB guys know so much about derivatives trading. Or how they seem to know how to access and read from a Bloomberg terminal. Or why there are so many users there that can seemingly drop tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars on complicated meme plays.</p>

  <p>How do you think that WSB knew that GME was open to a short squeeze and a gamma squeeze play?</p>

  <p>WSB’s power users are younger finance bros. It’s 30-something investment bankers and portfolio managers memeing with each other and cosplaying as “autists.”</p>

  <p>If you didn’t know what a gamma squeeze was 48 hours ago, you are their exit strategy and the down payment on their next Porsche.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When the subreddit was a fringe group of people who actually knew something about finance, there was alpha to be found in its insights. Wall Street Bets was about getting some laughs in the pursuit of fuck-you money. However, over the past few weeks, Wall Street Bets was flooded with newcomers (it <a href="https://subredditstats.com/r/wallstreetbets">quadrupled in size over the course of about a week</a>) who, along with the mainstream media, turned the GameStop trade into a “movement” and “taking on the hedge funds”.</p>

<p>In retrospect, this was the writing on the wall:<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup></p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Gamestonk!! <a href="https://t.co/RZtkDzAewJ">https://t.co/RZtkDzAewJ</a></p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1354174279894642703?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 26, 2021</a></blockquote>


<h3 id="we-are-all-monkeys">We Are All Monkeys</h3>

<p>Let’s revisit a classic psychology experiment, which <a href="https://www.throwcase.com/2014/12/21/that-five-monkeys-and-a-banana-story-is-rubbish/">apparently never happened</a>. Nevertheless, it is a good allegory for the GameStop trade (and the business world in general).</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/monkey_mirror.jpg" alt="Monkey Looking in Mirror"></p>

<p>A scientist places five monkeys in a locked room. Inside the room, there is a ladder with a bunch of bananas at its top. Each time a monkey climbs the ladder to try to reach the bananas, the scientist pulls him down and sprays him – as well as all of the other monkeys in the room – with a stream of cold water.</p>

<p>After this cycle repeated a few times, the monkeys learn that climbing the ladder leads to a faceful of cold water. So, each time that a monkey begins to climb the ladder, the other monkeys in the room pull him down so they can avoid being sprayed.</p>

<p>The scientist removes one of the original monkeys from the room. The monkeys’ self-policing continues. When the new monkey tries to climb the ladder, the others pull him down. The new monkey learns that he shouldn’t climb the ladder.</p>

<p>Here’s the kicker: The scientist replaces all of the monkeys in the room, one by one. By the end of the experiment, none of the original monkeys (the ones that had been sprayed with cold water) are left in the room. But all of the new monkeys continue to pull down any monkey that climbs the ladder, without knowing why they are doing it.</p>

<p>Now we modify this experiment slightly. Rather than replacing the monkeys in the room, the scientist simply adds new monkeys. But midway through the experiment, the power goes out! The scientist can’t see any monkeys climbing the ladder. The original monkeys realize that this is their opportunity – they scramble up the ladder and eat all of the bananas. By the time the power comes back on, the new monkeys continue to pull one another down from the ladder and are left <a href="https://paranoidenough.com/2021/01/25/The-Battle-of-Gamestop.html#the-allure-of-wall-street-bets">diamond-handing</a> (💎 🤲) banana peels.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/banana_peel.jpg" alt="Banana Peel"></p>

<h3 id="cults-are-fun">Cults Are Fun</h3>

<p>It’s fun to be one of the monkeys in this room. You’re among a group of people who are excited about something; they have some special knowledge that promises to make them fabulously wealthy. Their knowledge is doubted by the mainstream, but their prophecies keep coming true.</p>

<p>They have a special language that distinguishes them from the outgroup. You are welcomed as a part of the tribe, you start to lose yourself in the fantasy of becoming rich and become swept up in the mob, experiencing a bit of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_psychology">loss of self</a> that comes from being a part of a mass movement.</p>

<p>There is a huge sense of urgency. You can get in on this thing, but only if you act <strong>now</strong>. Your heart beats a little bit faster – that’s FOMO. You’re experiencing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_bias">optimism bias</a> – because you understand what is happening, this is bound to work out for you.</p>

<p>All you need to do is buy in and hold on. Anyone who defects from the party line is subject to ad hominem attacks. They are relegated to the outgroup.</p>

<p>The goalposts keep moving. Every time a price target is reached, the ceiling is raised. $100 is not a meme. $420.69 is not a meme. $1,000 is not a meme. $10,000 is not a meme!</p>

<p>The mainstream media is not to be trusted. They weren’t on your side to begin with – why would they be now? There is a disinformation campaign going on – your group has been infiltrated. You don’t know who and what to trust, so you need to stop thinking for yourself and have blind faith in the process. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink">Groupthink</a> abounds.</p>

<p>Retail investors are <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-29/reddit-traders-on-robinhood-are-on-both-sides-of-gamestop">selling more than they’re buying</a>? That data is suspect. You choose to ignore information from sources that you previously considered valid because this doesn’t fit the <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/narrative-fallacy#:~:text=The%20narrative%20fallacy%20addresses%20our,help%20them%20make%20more%20sense">narrative (fallacy)</a> that you and the others have created.</p>

<p>As you begin to lose money (or unrealized gains) on your position, you dig in deeper. You become <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_(cognitive_bias)">anchored</a> to the gains that you were already counting in your head. You won’t settle for anything less! You’d never buy in at these levels, but what you already have? Of course you let it ride – the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect">endowment effect</a> in action. You fall for the <a href="https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/resources/mini-encyclopedia-of-be/sunk-cost-fallacy/">sunk cost fallacy</a> and throw good money after bad to double down on your position.</p>

<p>It’s hard to exit the echo chamber. You don’t want to admit to yourself that you were taken for a ride; that you only have yourself to blame for the losses you endured. You want to keep believing. The ending to the story is so much better if you keep believing.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/creed.gif" alt="Creed on Cults"></p>

<p>Originally I included this gif simply because it was funny, but in writing this essay, I realized that it’s actually quite apt. The people who got in and out of this trade early made a boatload. The followers had a lot of fun (for a while), got caught up in the mania, and lost money.</p>

<p>We all want to belong to something greater than ourselves. Smart people are no different – they are drawn to cults all of the time.</p>

<p>Look at the annual mass exodus from San Francisco to Black Rock City to celebrate Burning Man. Or Silicon Valley executives who wear <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90334124/from-hacking-the-mind-to-punishing-ennui-techs-brightest-are-taking-to-silent-retreats">Vipassana retreats</a><sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> as a badge of honor. The best startup cultures are often described as “cult-like”. You either fully buy into the mission or you’re out. Think Uber and its “you eat what you kill” attitude (at least until Travis left), or Roam Research, which fully embraces the #roamcult hashtag and even has a <a href="https://twitter.com/Conaw/status/1350645949513699331">compound in Utah</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/roam.jpg" alt="Roam Cult"></p>
<p>Cult Vibes (image via <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/a-200-million-seed-valuation-for-roam-shows-investor-frenzy-for-note-taking-apps">The Information</a>)</p>

<p>Zooming out a bit, <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22195549/soulcycle-decline-reopening-bullying-bike-explained">SoulCycle</a> and other premium fitness classes are both:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A signal of wealth and</li>
  <li>Cult-like in their intensity, adherence to strict guidelines, and hero worship of individual instructors.</li>
</ol>

<p>Even mainstream (i.e., moderate) organized religion is simply a cult that has stopped taking itself so seriously.<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup> Moving to extremist religion, terrorists are relatively wealthy and well-educated. They disproportionately <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2009/12/why-do-so-many-terrorists-have-engineering-degrees.html">hold engineering degrees</a>. Scott Alexander makes the compelling argument that this can, at least partially, be attributed to <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/03/repost-epistemic-learned-helplessness/">epistemic learned helplessness</a>, the idea that sometimes the most rational thing that someone can do is to ignore an argument that they can’t refute.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>[A] sufficiently smart engineer has never been burned by arguments above his skill level before, has never had any reason to develop epistemic learned helplessness. If Osama comes up to him with a really good argument for terrorism, he thinks “Oh, there’s a good argument for terrorism. I guess I should become a terrorist,” as opposed to “Arguments? You can prove anything with arguments. I’ll just stay right here and not blow myself up.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So perhaps epistemic learned helplessness (or rather, lack thereof) can help explain why smart people can be so drawn to scams, cults, and mass movements. When one is used to seeing the world in a way that others don’t – and, quite frankly, feeling intellectually superior to others – it is easy to lose the humility and self-doubt that would have helped during the GameStop scenario. Being intellectually aware of the cognitive biases that we face as human beings is different from (and even perhaps inversely correlated to) the ability to step back and say, “This is crazy, I’m out.”<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8">8</a></sup></p>

<p>Cults aren’t inherently a bad thing.<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9">9</a></sup> Just know when you’re in one and have an exit strategy for when …</p></div></div>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2020/iot-header.png" width="100%" alt="SSH into a Self-driving Vehicle"></p>

<p>Over the last couple of years, we’ve started to see computers take to the street, and lucky for us, it’s been mostly to help us get deliveries or transport us around. These robots are a combination of sensors, compute units, and some form of connectivity. They have personalities, and if you look closely, two cute eyes on <a href="https://serve.postmates.com/">Postmates’ Serve</a> that provide it with stereo vision to navigate the streets.  While ‘Serve’ is fully equipped to navigate the streets, even the smartest robots need help from a human sometimes.</p>

<p>Many of us have taken accessing computers remotely for granted, despite the fact that our production servers are running behind NAT.  This has been made possible by SREs  who set up public endpoints and bastion hosts, and configure identity-based authentication as we’ve covered in a previous post called <em><a href="https://goteleport.com/blog/how-to-ssh-properly/">How to SSH properly</a></em>. But what if your computer is on the move? What happens if you have thousands of them in thousands of cities? How do you provide access for system-level debugging? Which technical hurdles will you have to overcome?</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2020/iot-1.png" width="100%" alt="SSH into a Robot"></p>

<h3 id="connectivity-and-the-network">Connectivity and the Network</h3>

<p>We are lucky to have a range of connectivity options available to IoT devices, from high speed LTE connections to new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa">LoRaWAN</a> networks. Once connected to a network, the next step is to get access to the device. This post will focus on using SSH by following best practices. Earlier, we’ve outlined how to configure the local ssh-agent to connect to a Bastion Host. This method works well, but unless you start off with a very good naming convention, it becomes much harder to find that one robot stuck in Berlin at 3am.</p>

<p>We’ve taken the best practices of accessing systems and rolled them into our open source project, Teleport. Teleport was designed as a drop-in <a href="https://goteleport.com/blog/introducing-teleport-4-point-3-modern-replacement-for-openssh/">replacement for OpenSSH</a>, but with a focus on fleets of servers (clusters) where individual nodes such as self-driving trucks (or regular AWS instances) can be located anywhere in the world. The certificate authority and the audit log are deployed in secure networks with only the proxy available to the public internet. Let’s dive a bit deeper into it.</p>

<h3 id="ssh-into-a-self-driving-truck">SSH into a Self-driving Truck</h3>

<p>While the technical details of delivery robots are often kept under wraps, we know other people have gone to great lengths to be able to <a href="https://blogs.wcode.org/2015/04/howto-ssh-to-your-iot-device-when-its-behind-a-firewall-or-on-a-3g-dongle/">SSH into lamp posts</a> with David’s Awesome <a href="https://blogs.wcode.org/2015/01/playable-city-award-2014-shadowing-part-1-hardware/">Shadowing Project</a>. The same approach could be applied to self-driving robots using a reverse SSH tunnel, but this method only scales so far, and it requires more than 50 steps to set up.</p>

<p>A reverse SSH tunnel is an SSH connection initiated by the host (self-driving vehicle) to the proxy. This connection is maintained for as long as the host is online, and if an engineer or an Ansible script wants to connect to the vehicle, they connect to the proxy, which in turn proxies the connection through the tunnel to the host who initiated it.</p>

<p>We had many <a href="https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/803">long standing requests</a> to support reverse tunnels, and with OSS Teleport  4.0, we’ve made setting up and managing these reverse tunnels simpler. This can be set up on the node in a couple of quick steps.</p>

<p>On the robot/lamp post/self-driving truck, the Teleport daemon will be installed and will then dial back to a central Teleport Cluster.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">$ teleport start --roles=node
 --token=n92bb958ce97f761da978d08c35c54a5c --auth-server=teleport-proxy.example.com</code></pre></div>
<p>Extra configuration options can be set up to add labels and extra supporting metadata to help the operator.</p>

<p>After connecting to the proxy, the ‘node’ - in our case a single Raspberry Pi - will show in the Teleport web UI and you can see it by using the CLI client as well:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">➜  ~ tsh ls
Node Name             Address         Labels
--------------------- --------------- --------------------------------------------------

Truck-1821             ⟵ Tunnel      arch=Linux, hostname=postmate-serve-342145
                                      uptime=up 0 minutes, 📍=SF
                                      📶=5G</code></pre></div>
<p>I’m now able to SSH into the node using it’s node name.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">➜  ~ tsh ssh truck-1821
$truck-1821:~</code></pre></div>
<p>This has a few benefits</p>

<ul>
<li>You can ssh into truck-1821 using it’s nodename, meaning you no longer have to worry about IP addresses or having to setup Dynamic DNS at its location.</li>
<li>Labels can provide both system and location data. This makes managing a large fleet of devices much easier.</li>
<li>It allows for one centralized access system for ARM, Linux, and MacOS applications.<br></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="accessing-moving-kubernetes-clusters-in-a-self-driving-truck">Accessing moving Kubernetes Clusters in a self driving Truck</h3>

<p>Moving up in scale, we’ve started to see more computers move to the edge, and some have speculated that this could be the <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/11/15/the-end-of-cloud-computing-2/">end of cloud computing</a>. For context, a self driving truck generates 10 gigabytes of data per mile. Some self-driving companies have published how they manage and set up network infrastructure. Cruise has a <a href="https://medium.com/cruise/container-platform-networking-kubernetes-e888a07407ab">great blog</a> for anyone interested in the topic.</p>

<p>As these systems become more complex, having more compute and extra redundancy running a container-orchestration system makes sense to scale the workloads associated with many gigabytes of data every mile. Yet for operators, these systems can be increasingly difficult to update, debug, and access. Providing access opens Pandora’s box of issues. If robots or humans can access machines, there needs to be an audit trail, approval workflows, and full visibility into what’s been run on these clusters.</p>

<p>These problems can be easy to solve on a small scale, but become increasingly difficult with 100+ Clusters. Combining a large cluster with hundreds of employees can create extra operational complexity. We have had many users facing the same problem and by using external identity providers combined with a flexible Role Based Access Control (RBAC), They get access quickly and securely.</p>

<p>In this quick example we’ll show how a fictional company has deployed multiple kubernetes clusters into trucks, yet still require a centralized command and control over the cluster.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2020/iot-2.png" width="100%" alt="SSH into a Truck"></p>

<p>Teleport provides users two options for connecting to a Kubernetes cluster, it can be run as a proxy outside the cluster or deployed inside a cluster. We recommend deploying inside a cluster, then registering the cluster back to a central root cluster using t<a href="https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/trustedclusters/">rusted clusters</a>.</p>

<p>All of these features are available in the OSS version of Teleport, using Github as an SSO provider. We’ve more information on our <a href="https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/kubernetes-access/">Kubernetes integration here</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2020/iot-3.png" width="100%" alt="SSH into a K8s"></p>

<h3 id="connect-to-any-computer-anywhere">Connect to any computer anywhere</h3>

<p>No matter where you run a computer, be it a small home lab, a small robot or many thousands of self-driving trucks, these patterns can be used to get secure access quickly. The use of reverse tunnels to access infrastructure can be very powerful when you don’t have full control over the network.</p>

        <p>If you publish your roadmap, one of two good things will happen: your stakeholders will be happy and you can go forward, or you will learn that you got it wrong and you can correct it.</p>

<p>If you tell your team member that she’s not doing part of her job, one of two good things will happen: she’ll agree and work with you to improve, or she will disagree and you’ll learn she’s unwilling to improve.</p>

<p>If you tell your cofounder that your vision is different from his, one of two good things will happen: he’ll move toward you and you’ll find a common way forward, or you’ll learn that you have really different goals.</p>

<p>If you ask your tech team to explain the return on investment of their rebuild, one of two good things will happen: you’ll understand their thinking and the value of what they’re doing, or you’ll learn that they don’t have a financial justification for their work.</p>

<p>Every one of these is drawn from work with my clients in the last week. Every one represents a real opportunity to learn and improve. But the people involved needed to take action first to create that opportunity.</p>

<p>Are you taking those opportunities? Why not? You have nothing to lose but your ignorance.</p>

February 11, 2021 | https://www.emilykager.com/writing/2021/02/10/mozilla.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.emilykager.com/writing/2021/02/10/mozilla.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>I don’t think any little girl grows up with the goal of “I want to be an OSS Android browser developer” and to be totally honest, even as an adult I just kind of fell into it. I first joined Mozilla as an intern during my change-career journey mainly because I had taken one Android class, knew some Java, and applied on a whim at the right time to hit the recruiter’s inbox. Despite not actively seeking Mozilla or Android out, I immediately fell in love with the project and team and knew I had stumbled into a very special place. The problems were interesting, I had opportunities for leadership and growth from the start, and the people were kind, smart, and supportive.</p>

<p>At Mozilla you’ll meet the smartest and most passionate people who could be tech leaders at any other major company (and almost certainly make more money) but are choosing to work specifically on Firefox because they believe in the product and the mission. It’s definitely intimidating to come in as an intern to one of the original “software companies” but everyone I’ve met is truly wonderful and welcoming. It was (mostly) fun to be the underdog and celebrate our wins, large and small alike. I felt connected to the mission and the products we were creating. I felt like I had a large impact in my team after only a short amount of time (most teams are quite small and tight-knit). The fans and the community were passionate and many times I had the cool experience of wearing a Firefox t-shirt in public and people thanking me for my work (now that I’m writing this, it feels a bit odd. I guess you had to be there).</p>

<p>So if it’s so great then why am I leaving? I know it’s not a satisfying answer, verging on cliche, but I’m just looking to do something new. That and.. I am also extremely burnt out. The very small mobile team has been through a gauntlet in order to ship a full rewrite of the flagship Firefox for Android browser (partly during the pandemic no less). Working too much during the week for the last 2 years was normal for me and while never asked for from my team, I cared deeply about the product and the success and it would have been impossible to hit our deadlines and ship something I was proud of without it. And when we finally did ship, I WAS proud of our team and what we had accomplished, but the release just felt like a blip in our planned schedule before jumping into more sprints and fires and thinking about the next iteration.</p>

<p>I did take one week of PTO right after our release! … which just so happened to be the week that the large layoffs happened. I was safe from layoffs, but morale plummeted, and I was definitely not refreshed. The cherry on top was being specifically targeted for harassment that same week after the release by unhappy users of Firefox looking for someone to direct their frustrations at<sup><a href="#myfootnote1">1</a></sup>. There’s nothing that Mozilla really could have done in this scenario, but it left a terrible taste in my mouth after all of the blood, sweat, and tears I had put into this project. For someone who thought of themselves as an empathetic dev overworking myself FOR the end users and product, this hurt and I’m not sure I ever really recovered. While the pace is slowing down now and there’s a promise of no more deadline crunches, I just feel that I haven’t been able to catch my breath no matter how much time I take off. Whether that’s the project, pandemic fatigue, or all of the above, I’m very ready for a break, a fresh start, and a change of pace.</p>

<p>Working in open source full-time has been an incredible experience that has had its extreme ups and downs. On the positive side, I’ve loved mentoring new contributors to get their first open source PR merged. I’ve enjoyed all the positive interactions with the lovely community volunteers who care as much about making the product better as I do. On the negative side, it has become increasingly hard for me to separate work from not work. I found myself “contributing” (read - working) at all hours of the day. Replying to issues, emails, and public chats when I was in bed at midnight, when I just woke up at 7am, in the car on the way to go hiking on the weekend, and then while ON the hike. This might be a me problem, but boundary setting when there’s a public repo always getting new issues, comments, emails, and chatroom messages was difficult for me. And of course not all of those messages are nice; the constant stream of negative comments from unhappy and rude users during the work week and outside of it was extremely draining. Besides politicians, this might be one of the only jobs where you can wake up to an inbox full of emails and messages about how much everyone thinks you suck at your job. You definitely grow a thick skin quickly, but it’s still exhausting.</p>

<p>I think a lot of people tend to forget that Mozilla was also my very first job in tech. I learned so much there and there’s always more I could learn, but it’s good to try new experiences and face new problems, especially early in my career. I will be forever grateful for the experiences I’ve had at Mozilla and the people I’ve met. It was my “big break” into tech and I will never forget that! I will keep using and supporting Firefox and take a lot of the Mozilla ideals with me wherever I go. My experience was super formative for how I view ethics, privacy, and other important issues inside the tech space.</p>

<p>I am excited about my break and my next adventure but I’m definitely very sad to be leaving Mozilla and the wonderful people. The (good) problem with working with people who are true friends is it’s painful when people leave, including yourself. I will miss everyone dearly, especially all of my mobile team peers. I hope you all stay in touch and our paths cross again once conferences are a thing again (or maybe I’ll just crash the next All Hands, I’m not above it). If you’re at Mozilla and want to say goodbye, please ping me in the next 2 weeks! I’ve also heard I’m quite easy to find online! 😉</p>

<p>Love you all ❤️ XOXO</p>

<p><a name="myfootnote1">1</a>: EDIT: Saw this made it onto Hacker News and people in the comments were doubting this harassment happened. Classic. I documented it well on my Twitter at the time, but I’m happy to give more context. I tweeted around the time of release that I was proud of the team for all our hard work and I’m not “worrying about the haters” with a photo of me drinking a beer and flipping off the camera. I never referenced users. “Haters” is just a saying that the youngins say that isn’t specific but according to the internet, <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hater-4589594">“a hater is a slang term used in everyday language and especially online to describe an individual who talks and behaves negatively in response to other people’s success and goal achievement.”</a> It was a light-hearted joke for my Twitter friends after a year of hard work and constant negativity. In response this tweet was posted all over Reddit and 4chan and then there were coordinated doxxing attacks, multiple 4chan threads full of violent sexual and death threats, troll PRs opened in our repo, all of my photos pulled off of my Instagram and posted into these threads with disgusting commentary, and actual calls to my work from fake “journalists” to try to get me fired. I’m not going to post the comments here because they make me sick but feel free to search the archives to see for yourself. If you think this is ever an appropriate response to a dev on the team telling a joke online, I can’t help you.</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>Like many start-up stories, the co-founders of Routable, Tom and Omri began theirs in a basement that they entered each morning in the dark and left each evening... also in the dark. Over the course of 9 months and 300 customer development interviews, they realized that business payments were a <em>lot</em> like pull requests— the mechanism software engineers use to alert their team about changes to code and get it reviewed before it’s deployed. With the vision of building an engineering and technology-centered company for finance teams, this insight was key to making that vision a reality.</p><p>That insight has remained core part of Routable's DNA to this day — it influences not just our product development and design process, but also our hiring process. It's how we get the best engineers in the world to work on modernizing business payments with us.</p><p>Here’s how business payments are similar to pull requests.</p><h3 id="tickets-are-just-bills-and-invoices">Tickets are just bills and invoices</h3><p>If you're an engineer, you're probably familiar with tickets — at most of the places I've worked, we've had some form of ticket driven development where you begin coding a feature or fixing a bug after a ticket has been assigned to you. This is important to stop rogue coding and ensure that there is a record of every change in the product for compliance, debugging and more.</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/cWSJpOY9sdmlK_UXj8GYiwR0tYiSwwEXolbgG4RwEzGFKjFN5fE85ubW8Tj6WBZb2elAqGFiuiX414TyynHsIEA8bCRZDeuDn4ffDXyrOcIajr4Og1RBSN_cO8ddoWa-JSi4ekux" alt=""><figcaption>These are basically tickets.</figcaption></figure><div><p>Like an engineering team is driven by tickets, finance teams are driven by bills and invoices. Before they can transfer or request money, they need to make sure there is a record of every transaction for compliance and reporting purposes.</p><p>Bills can come in at any time of day, in a million different formats, and from a bunch of different sources. Invoices that are sent out are hopefully in a more standardized format, but different vendors will still have different requirements that you must meet to get paid.</p></div><h3 id="new-code-and-new-payments-need-to-be-double-checked-for-validity">New code and new payments need to be double-checked for validity</h3><p>So let’s say you’re an engineer. &nbsp;You got a JIRA ticket and coded up a brilliant solution. The next step is to open up a pull request and share your work with the team for feedback.</p><p>The tests aren't passing. Your team has a continuous integration service that checks for known security vulnerabilities, style violations, and broken tests. Until you've made all those checks happy and gotten the ✅ s that you need, you can't send this out to your team to review.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NTRE0NFCc50DrbrTcmaUQU5EpZvoYlxZ-Ax4n5chap-TKOP5AOMKZY6K5w_GfsQcQ-FQ4lCeXNcLQSNfLIh51sXRDupz_9z1CYSmyr3a9XbiyCg-XjkrvW9B8ZKiwIyiwzO546NX" alt=""></figure><p>Finance is really similar. Before an invoice or payment can be submitted, someone on the team needs to check bank account validity, if there is money in the account to spend, if they’re past your bank's cut-off time for same day wires, and much much more. Finally, they need to ensure that the invoice or payment is properly recorded in your accounting software/ERP so there is a clear record of everything (especially come tax season).</p><h3 id="there-are-multiple-levels-of-approval">There are multiple levels of approval</h3><p>Excellent — the tests are passing! Now it's time to send this to your team to review. Depending on what part of the codebase you're working in, you might even need to satisfy that principal engineer that's held personally responsible for any defect that makes its way into production.</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/7G2S0taLHgcVyDdxKYHhMtZZFbBOOIfxhfjsoou-rnnLxW0UPBs_nqWgdj36QjKrKIa63CHPpKXIQPx07E7dYttuZvIDRGxfBSXOVuFuAFIAoZIAZK-xhMb2jTYvVGh76-oGRmkl" alt=""></figure><p><br>Again, finance is really similar — they can't just move $15,000 without at least one other set of eyes. For large transfers of money, expect multiple levels of approval all the way up to the CFO before an invoice can be sent or a bill can be paid. Just like in software, an extra 0 or a period in the wrong place can have a huge impact.</p><h3 id="shipping-code-is-just-like-sending-a-large-payment">Shipping code is just like sending a large payment</h3><p>In an incredible turn of events, the principal engineer loved your code and even gave you a little 🚢-it emoji. It's the end of the day Thursday though and you have a concert that evening — You're pretty sure your code is good to go, but you've been wrong before and you're not trying to get paged during the show. You hold off until Friday morning to merge.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5yuOH7t08tmfTYflhVymeLqu4Lf2bViyWgQwzjHh0InzMfa9bBqDNTjoa1SCsqnjKrsRK0B-eitdPFoVoeWYx9HquJECaJI7SwTTEm8v4f9gSjQBldZRiIJ7Avfs0cTMhT6OyedO" alt=""></figure><p><br>Same deal in finance — they’re pretty sure there’s enough to cover a large transfer, but they also know that a large transfer into the company account will clear tomorrow morning. So just to be safe, they schedule the payment to send tomorrow. ✨</p><h3 id="rolling-back-code-is-like-cancelling-a-payment-sort-of-">Rolling back code is like cancelling a payment (sort of)</h3><p>It turns out that you made the right decision to delay shipping your code... an hour after it went out. 💥 Luckily, it impacted very few users and you were able to roll back the code right away and mitigate the damage. The principal engineer is happy with your good judgement to ship in the morning and you'll live to code another day.</p><p>This is where finance really has a rough go of it — it's not always as convenient to roll back. Invoices are pretty straightforward to cancel, but payments are trickier. There's usually a window of only hours that they can cancel a check or ACH payment. That's why all the checks and processes that we've grown used to in software are even more important in the finance world!</p><h3 id="business-payments-as-prs-is-our-ethos">Business payments as PRs is our ethos</h3><p>Engineers are usually unaware of the complexities inherent in business payments. We're used to PayPal and Venmo where it's literally a click of a button to transfer money to a friend for lunch.</p><p>If you pause for a second to think about it though, it's obvious that there is a boatload of complexity that those companies are hiding behind a beautiful, simple interface.</p><p>It's the same at Routable — behind our simple UI, we've hidden away the complex problem of integrating with multiple accounting ledgers, legacy banking processes and managing the multi-step process of moving money between businesses.</p><p>Once we share this analogy, it's an aha moment for engineers — business payments become an interesting problem to solve. Not only that, it builds empathy for our customers and helps us build a better product.</p><p>It's also made product development really simple for us 👏</p><p>Interested in working at Routable?

<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="538" height="388" src="https://thedefiant.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://thedefiant.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png 538w, https://thedefiant.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1-300x216.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px"></figure></div>



<p>MetaMask is making about $170k per day thanks to its token swap feature, Tom Schmidt of Dragonfly Capital <a href="https://twitter.com/tomhschmidt/status/1359393949568303104">said in a tweet</a>, which was later confirmed with data the wallet’s team published in a <a href="https://duneanalytics.com/codefi/metamask-swaps-">Dune Analytics dashboard</a>.</p>



<p>The decentralized wallet and most popular gateway to DeFi is processing between $15M and $20M in daily trading volume through the swap feature <a href="https://thedefiant.substack.com/p/metamask-token-swaps-are-only-the">launched in October</a>, Dune Analytics data show. MetaMask takes 0.875% in fees from each trade, which resulted in as much as $198k of revenue from a record $22.7M in volume on Jan. 24.</p>



<h4>Sustainable Business</h4>



<p>These numbers show that wallets and decentralized exchanges and aggregators can grow into sustainable businesses. This contradicts the common take that open source protocols can’t be profitable because developers can easily copy the code and create a competitor with lower or no fees.</p>



<p>“I have a feeling that this is going to be good news for wallets everywhere. A lot easier to invest in something with a validated business model,” said MetaMask developer Dan Finlay, in response to a tweet.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/sSmypLPVEFAYsdj_gJG3DeGyzIlmkyy70FSUBkhhFTyd1fpOnkxZMBkXLxFMBEjOYz7dA3IPrlqEK3pdS_RUzHczEBwP6nY6-Ss7TtGdAVOrSvR8O9J6O2quUtJBdBu7Hs4JnkUD" alt=""></figure>



<p>Over 100K unique accounts have executed 236k swaps within MetaMask, the data show. That’s still a small portion of the ~1.3M total accounts interacting with DeFi protocols.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MetaMask’s daily swap volume is 10 times lower than other aggregators, like 1inch Exchange, whose daily volume has fluctuated around $200M during January.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>All About The Fees</h4>



<p>MetaMask’s 0.875% in fees is nearly three times what flagship decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap does with its 0.3% cut.</p>



<p>The wallet’s token swaps feature serves as an aggregator, accessing many DEXs at once, some of which are themselves aggregators, in an attempt to be for token swaps, what Expedia is for travel quotes, Finlay <a href="https://medium.com/metamask/real-time-data-on-metamask-swaps-c50d2c9ab020">said in a post</a> yesterday. Perhaps convenience trumps low fees as users attempt to keep their trading processes simple.</p>



<p>The revelation that MetaMask is making ~170K a day in fees has some Twitter users asking “when airdrop.” Uniswap airdropped its UNI token to users in September and 1inch dropped did the same in late December, so doubtless others are hoping for a similar event with MetaMask.</p>

			<span>Encryption and decentralized technologies are giving people who value their real life freedoms options for their online life.</span>
		</p>
		<p>Imagine a day when you wake up and see zero likes on your latest post. You upload a new meme your friends would like and still see no activity. Clicking open a chat window you ask a friend if they’d like to come over later, but still no response. You finally call that friend and ask if you’ve done something to alienate them — only to find out they haven’t seen your comments, posts, or messages. Googling this scenario you realize you’ve been shadow banned; muzzled and isolated by a tech company without realizing it and no recourse.</p>
<p>This is a real scenario some Americans have faced. Through subtle nudges on every interaction, social media has the ability to shape how people communicate. Algorithms, selective censorship, shadow banning, surveillance and a host of other tricks are being leveraged to drive global conversations, and by extension, how people think.</p>
<p>While the United States Constitution provides there will be no abridging the freedom of speech by government, this constitutional right only limits governmental actors and not private actors. Social Media companies like Facebook, Twitter, et al. have the ability (and right) to curate their environment how they like, just as users have the right to choose not use their platform.</p>
<p>Despite the rights involved, Americans <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/17/big-tech-economic-political-power-poll-417024">increasingly</a> feel <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2020/12/13/facebook-tracks-apple-iphone-locations-even-ios-14-and-iphone-12-12-pro-and-pro-max/?sh=1eb74166156b">watched,</a> <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/10/15/facebook-and-twitter-cross-a-line-far-more-dangerous-than-what-they-censor/">manipulated</a> and censored by “big tech”. Some <a href="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/issues/big-tech">politicians</a> have even claimed that social media companies are turning into unaccountable monopolies that must be regulated.</p>
<p>Thankfully, innovators are already meeting this demand and providing competitive alternatives which prioritize free expression and privacy. Programs utilizing encryption and decentralized communication technology are pioneering new ways for users to interact without fear of surveillance and censorship, and without need of government regulation.</p>
<p><a href="https://keybase.io/">Keybase</a>, for instance, is an end-to-end encrypted messenger. That means a corporation or third party can’t read your messages even if they wanted to. By extension this means they aren’t <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/25/whatsapp-to-share-user-data-with-facebook-for-ad-targeting-heres-how-to-opt-out/">mining</a> your private conversations for personal information, arbitrarily deleting your groups, or silently blocking your ability to send links they disagree with. Instead the technology underlying Keybase allows you to chat 1-1 with individuals and larger teams completely uncensored. The app also does other things like help validate identity and encrypt file sharing, but most people looking for a home after deleting Facebook will find the chat and team functionality of Keybase a close enough replacement.</p>
<p>Online existence is a simulacrum of real life and critical to modern society. Many people understandably don’t want their life, thoughts and politics dictated by “big tech” or to give up their digital privacy in exchange for access to the Internet. Encryption and decentralized technologies are giving people who value their real life freedoms options for their online life.</p>

<p>Bad air is bad for you. The air purifier market, though, is a mess. Every purifier uses incompatible proprietary filters, presumably to lock you into buying replacements. How do we know these actually work? Few seem to publish lab tests. And why does it cost $100-$300 for a big plastic box with a fan and a filter inside?</p>

<p>It’s common to build DIY air purifiers by basically strapping a filter to a fan. I like the idea of these, but again, it’s hard to be confident they really work. There’s a few experiments out there, but not enough to make me comfortable. So I decided to do some experimenting of my own. I made a purifier, generated smoke, and measured how well it removes tiny particles.</p>



<p>If you’re in a hurry, this post says that if you strap two HEPA filters to a box fan, it will clear the air of basically all the particles we can measure, and it will do it faster than a commercial filter that costs twice as much.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/smallroom_log.jpg" alt="in a large room the DIY filter does slightly better than the commercial filter"></p>



<h3 id="diy-purifier">DIY purifier</h3>

<p>My DIY purifier was <em>very</em> simple. (I don’t want to promote any particular brands here. Contact me if you want the exact products.)</p>

<ul>
  <li>A standard box fan. (Cost: $19)</li>
  <li>Two HEPA air filters, each approximately 32 cm x 22 cm and 5cm thick. (Cost: $35 for both)</li>
  <li>A bungie cord. (Cost: Free)</li>
</ul>

<p>Assembly takes about 30s. You put the filters on the intake side of the fan and strap them on with the bungie cord. Here’s a picture:</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/filter_notape.jpg" alt="DIY purifier" max-width="60%" min-width="35%"></p>

<p>Timeless elegance and grace, it is not. I get the shakes just looking at that bit of crinkled filter.</p>

<h3 id="commercial-purifier">Commercial purifier</h3>

<p>As a comparison, I got a $100 air purifier from a well-known brand that’s intended for small rooms. It uses uses a single HEPA filter that’s about 25cm x 12cm and 4cm thick. Replacement filters currently cost around $25.</p>

<h3 id="smoke">Smoke</h3>

<p>It’s surprisingly hard to repeatedly generate a consistent amount of smoke. I tried burning various things (paper, cardboard) and found that the number of particles generated can vary by an order of magnitude, depending on the burn pattern. This is difficult to control and effectively random.</p>

<p>Ideally, I’d have liked to burn some food product like oil, since the kitchen is usually the biggest source of indoor air pollution. I couldn’t figure out a good way of doing this, either: You’d need to have the same amount of oil distributed in the same way and heated to the same temperature.</p>

<p>I finally settled on using incense. I cut sticks to the length of a standard credit card and then attached the ends horizontal to the ground. This seemed to be pretty consistent. In retrospect, I bet that burning toast in a toaster would work well. (I didn’t have one on hand.)</p>

<h3 id="measurements">Measurements</h3>

<p>I borrowed a cheap-ish ($100) air quality monitor from a friend. I think it’s made by some company in China and then re-sold by various white-label brands. I can’t figure out who the original manufacturer is. Based on data I’ve seen for the reliability of other air quality monitors, I wouldn’t trust the absolute numbers, but the I think the <em>relative</em> measurements should still be OK.</p>

<p>The typical measurement for particulate pollution is “PM 2.5” which is in units of μg/m³. This is intended to measure what you’d get if you did the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Take a cubic meter of air.</li>
  <li>Filter all the solid particles out of the air.</li>
  <li>Keep only the solid particles that are are 2.5 micrometers (μm) or smaller.</li>
  <li>Weigh all the particles you kept in micrograms (μg).</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some ways to interpret these numbers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The EPA says yearly averages should be below 12 and daily averages below 35.</li>
  <li>The average outdoor level ranges from 6 in Finland to almost 100 in Nepal. Rich countries are typically under 15. The highest levels are typically found in Asia and Africa.</li>
  <li>Cooking can easily cause PM 2.5 measurements to spike into the hundreds. I’ve observed myself that this can happen with only a small amount of visible smoke.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="logging">Logging</h3>

<p>Since the air quality monitor doesn’t log data, I used an ultra-hacky alternative: I set the monitor next to a laptop running a stopwatch. I then aimed a tabet at both of those screens and took a timelapse video. Finally, I manually transcribed the data by going to each minute marker in the data. (This was even more tedious than it sounds.)</p>



<p>I ran a first experiment in a tiny room of around 8 ㎥. Due to worries that wind from the purifiers might change the speed the incense burned, I placed it on the opposite side of a wall, with a gap of around 20 cm near the ceiling.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/setup_tinyroom.jpg" alt="tiny room setup"></p>

<p>I repeated the experiment once with no filter, once with a commercial filter, and once with the DIY filter. Here are the results:</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/smallroom_linear.jpg" alt="smallroom measurements in linear space"></p>

<p>Things are a bit random around the beginning, probably due to the drifting of the smoke before it’s equalized in the room. With no filter at all, this spikes all the way to 1000 μg/m³, the maximum the instrument can show.</p>

<p>If we make the y-axis logarithmic, it becomes quite clear that the DIY filter is cleaning the air at a better rate. (This is the picture from the top of this page.)</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/smallroom_log.jpg" alt="smallroom measurements in log space"></p>

<p>If we take the EPA’s threshold of 12 μg/m³, the DIY filter gets there in around 15 minutes, while the commercial filter take around 25 minutes.</p>



<p>Thankfully, I don’t spend most of my time in an 8 ㎥ room. Thus, I repeated the experiment in a large room of around 100 ㎥. Here there was no wall between incense and purifier. Instead I left around a meter of distance between the incense and purifier and the purifier and the monitor.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/setup_largeroom.jpg" alt="large room setup"></p>

<p>Here are the results:</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/largeroom_linear.jpg" alt="large room measurements in linear space"></p>

<p>There’s even more randomness around the beginning, probably just due to how the smoke drifts around. Based on the room volume we’d expect a peak concentration with no filter of around 80 μg/m³ = 1000 μg/m³ * (8/100). Reassuringly, this is pretty close to what we see.</p>

<p>The DIY purifier looks a bit better. If we plot in log space, it’s more clear that it is indeed filtering at a better rate:</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/largeroom_log.jpg" alt="large room measurements in log space"></p>



<p>It’s common advice for DIY purifiers like this to seal around the edges of the filter so that all air must pass through it.  I share the intuition that this would help, but it’s hard to be sure: If you block airflow, you slow down the fan. This could be counterproductive.</p>

<p>In this case at least, experiment is easier than theory. I took packing tape and carefully sealed around the intake side.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/filter_tape.jpg" alt="DIY purifier with tape" max-width="60%" min-width="35%"></p>

<p>And the results are…</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/taping.jpg" alt="taping around the filter has no effect"></p>

<p>…nothing!?</p>

<p>This was unexpected. I thought the tape would help, but I wouldn’t have been surprised if it hurt instead. Instead, there’s basically no difference at all. I don’t know enough about fluid dynamics to even speculate about what’s happening here, so I won’t try.</p>

<p>There could be some weird quirk in how I ran this experiment. This doesn’t necessarily mean that all the advice to tape around the filter is <em>wrong</em>. However, I’ve never seen any experriments that show taping helps either.</p>



<p><strong>Cost.</strong> The DIY purifier isn’t dramatically cheaper than the commercial one, but I expect the filters would need to be replaced much less often. The commercial purifier uses a single filter with an area of 300 cm², whereas the DIY purifier uses two filters with a total area of around 1400 cm², and also slightly thicker. It’s reasonable to assume the DIY filters could remove ~4 times as many particles before replacement.</p>

<p><strong>Durability.</strong> One concern is that box fans aren’t meant to be used with filters attached and could wear out. This is reasonable. However, box fans are much cheaper than commercial purifiers, and I’ve been using this particular fan with various filters attached for several years now without issue.</p>

<p><strong>Electricity.</strong> The cost of electricity is another factor. Typical box fans seem to use around 55W, whereas commercial purifiers typically use 30-45W. If electricity costs $0.13 / kWh, the box fan would cost around $62 to operate 24 hours a day for a year, while a 30-watt purifier would cost around $34. Obviously, these numbers decrease if you run the purifier less. Some (more expensive) commercial purifiers have air quality sensors built in and automatically turn on only when needed.</p>

<p><strong>MERV or HEPA?</strong> Most people who build box-fan purifiers use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_efficiency_reporting_value">MERV</a>-rated filters intended for furnaces. Commercial air purifiers use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HEPA">HEPA</a>-rated filters. Roughly speaking, HEPA filters are “better” in that they are rated to remove a higher percentage of particles in one pass. It’s not clear that HEPA filter will actual perform better when attached to a fan, though: A filter that catches fewer particles in one pass might still be better if it allows for faster airflow.</p>

<p><strong>That one video.</strong> If you’re reading this article after it was linked from some forum, I’d bet you that someone in the comments links to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kH5APw_SLUU">this video</a> from the Michigan Sinus Center. I found this inspirational, but note a couple of things: First, while the description says they use HEPA filter, the video clearly indicates a MERV filter. Again, that’s not necessarily bad! They claim that around 90% of particles sized 0.3 microns are larger are eliminated in a single pass. That’s good, but not totally reassuring. The question is, does it remove 99% in two passes? If 90% of the particles in the ambient air were large and the filter only catches large particles, then additional passes would never get rid of the most dangerous small particles. This is why I trust HEPA filters a bit more: since they remove almost all particles in one pass, I’m confident they should remove almost all particles eventually. This is also why I strongly prefer experiments that actually measure particles removed from the air in a room, rather than just the air coming out of the purifier.</p>

<p><strong>Further questions.</strong> There’s a lot of things that further experiments could look at:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Does the fan speed make a huge difference?</li>
  <li>How does the purifier compare to larger commercial purifiers?</li>
  <li>How do MERV-rated furnace-type filters compare under the same conditions?</li>
  <li>How can it not matter if there’s tape around the filters!?</li>
  <li>Does fan speed matter? (I always ran the box fan at maximum speed.)</li>
  <li>Is it better to put the filters on the intake or outtake side of the fan? Intuition suggests the intake …</li></ol></div></div></div></div>

<p>– <a href="https://youtu.be/O1kTTOdHgC4">745 sticky (Black Dresses Remix)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My previous post on <a href="https://www.boringcactus.com/2020/08/13/post-open-source.html">post-open source</a> appeared to resonate with a lot of people, but unsurprisingly, not much has changed since then.
Recently, the company Elastic, who makes the database Elasticsearch, changed the license on Elasticsearch from Apache to the Server-Side Public License, which (to oversimplify <a href="https://writing.kemitchell.com/2019/06/13/SSPL-Not-Commons-Clause.html">the analysis of the excellent Kyle E. Mitchell</a>) is AGPL but even more so.
And unsurprisingly, as happened with Redis and MongoDB before it, everyone got mad.
When I wrote this snippet of my post-open source post, I was referring to Redis, but it's the exact same playbook that's happening again now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>you made a cool database server that's under an open source license?
amazon's selling it as a service now, and they're not paying you a fuckin dime.
you want to change your license to stop them from doing that?
now the open source people are yelling at you, because when they say they're apolitical they mean they support the status quo.
and the free software people are also yelling at you, because you didn't do it their way with their license, you did it a different way with a different license, and that goes against amazon's freedom to screw you over.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we're back here again.
Open source ideology leads to intra-corporate exploitation, the exploitees want to get out from under the exploiters, everyone gets mad that the status quo has been upset, and Amazon forks the last permissively-licensed version of the software and laughs all the way to the bank.
The only way for Elastic to win would've been to have licensed Elasticsearch under something restrictive like the SSPL from day one.</p>
<p>But since they didn't, we get shit like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Capitalism concerns itself with making monopolies — FOSS instead concerns itself with the socialized creation of software wealth.</p>
<p>– some jackass who loves being wrong on the internet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>FOSS is not socialist. The free software movement is <a href="https://lipu.dgold.eu/original-sin.html">right-libertarian / "anarcho"-capitalist</a>, and the open source movement is neoliberal; neither of these is even particularly close to socialism.
If you want a software ideology that is actually opposed to capitalism, instead of sucking up to capital, you might be looking for <a href="https://anticapitalist.software/">the Anti-Capitalist Software License</a>.
It's good, it links to my previous writing on post-open source (and the Fuck Around and Find Out License), and the FSF hate it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Anti-Capitalist Software License is a nonfree license because it extends the four freedoms only to some kinds of organizations, not to all.
Such a restriction in a software license, in the name of any cause whatsoever, imposes too much power over users.
Please don't use this license, and we urge you to avoid any software that has been released under it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What's not to love!
As an author of some software released under the Anti-Capitalist Software License, I also urge people who take the FSF seriously to avoid my software which has been released under the ACSL.
And my software released under any other license.
And just me in general.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Richard M. Stallman (the "M" stands for "Making female students extremely uncomfortable <a href="https://selamjie.medium.com/remove-richard-stallman-appendix-a-a7e41e784f88">for 30 years</a>") has done some handwringing about the vital importance of Freedom 0's "for any purpose" that we can make fun of.
Essentially, his points are</p>
<ul>
<li>enforcement against governments or big corporations is impossible because they can just make excuses and dodge jurisdiction and accountability</li>
<li>for small stuff, ethics vary, so if we accept a thousand orthogonal usage restrictions ("only this music genre", "can't be used in meat processing because i'm vegan", etc) we'll have a shitshow of an ecosystem and everyone will just give up and go back to using "nonfree" software</li>
<li>who are we as developers to even tell users what they can and can't do with our software? you wouldn't buy a pen that had a "you can't use this pen to do X" on it, right? that'd be ridiculous!</li>
</ul>
<p>First, lmao, "don't bother doing this because enforcement is impossible" applies equally to copyleft and the GPL in general.
Second, if we set aside masturbatory trolling bullshit like Bruce Perens's "Vaccine License", nobody makes licenses that are that narrowly tailored to one specific thing - and even the Vaccine License is still a world away from a hypothetical Country Music Only License or Vegan Software License or what have you.
This is a textbook slippery slope argument, and if you think "you can't use this software to violate human rights" is anywhere near "you can't use this software to listen to BTS" then fuck all of the way off.
(Although, one time I mentioned on IRC that I was throwing a simple script together in Python, and someone said "Hopefully it's Python 2, but if not I'll just rewrite it in Python 2", so I threw together the <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~boringcactus/gotbruh/tree/main/item/LICENSE.md">Why The Fuck Would You Even Do That Holy Shit Public License</a> to prohibit exactly that.)
Third, god <em>damn</em> libertarians hate when anyone tells them that some actions are bad.
If I was going to buy a pen, and I saw that it had a "hey, don't use this pen to violate human rights" sticker on it, I would go "fair enough I guess" and just buy the damn pen.</p>
<p>The libertarian position here is that toolmakers should have no say in how those tools are used, and the only way they should control what can be done with their tools is by directly adding or removing capabilities from the tools.
Unsurprisingly, the libertarian position here is bullshit.
A tool is not a morally neutral thing, and toolsmithing is not an act which must by necessity end when the tool leaves the smith's hands.</p>
<p>Let me now list some of the ethical principles from the <a href="https://ethics.acm.org/">ACM Code of Ethics</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A computing professional should...</p>
<ol>
<li>Contribute to society and to human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing.</li>
<li>Avoid harm.</li>
<li>Be honest and trustworthy.</li>
<li>Be fair and take action not to discriminate.</li>
<li>Respect the work required to produce new ideas, inventions, creative works, and computing artifacts.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Points 1 and 2 are broadly aligned with the idea that software should be used for good, and point 5 suggests that authors should be compensated for their work.
As such, ethical restrictions in software licenses are perfectly compatible with this code of ethics, as are restrictions on commercial use.
It is possible to go even further than this, and I think I will, because I'm in the mood to start some fights:</p>
<p>In my view, <strong>it conflicts with the ACM Code of Ethics to release software under a license which permits ethical misconduct and economic exploitation.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						<p>I had no intention to discuss the <a href="https://www.galoisrepresentations.com/2019/07/17/the-ramanujan-machine-is-an-intellectual-fraud/">Ramanujan Machine</a> again, but over the past few days there has been a flurry of (attempted) trollish comments on that post, so after taking a brief look at the latest version, I thought I would offer you my updates. (I promise for the last time.)</p>
<p>Probably the nicest thing I have to say about the updated paper is that it is better than the original. My complaints about the tone of the paper remain the same, but I don’t think it is necessary for me to revisit them here. </p>
<p>Concerning the intellectual merit, I think it is worth making the following remarks. First, I am only address the contributions to mathematics, Second, what counts as a  <i>new</i>  conjecture is not really as obvious as it sounds. Since continued fractions are somewhat recherché, it might be more helpful to give an analogy with infinite series. Suppose I claimed it was a new result that</p>
<p>\( \displaystyle{ 2G = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{5}{36} + \frac{5}{72}  + \frac{269}{3600} – \frac{1219}{705600} + \ldots } \)</p>
<p>where  for \(n \ge 4\) one has</p>
<p>\(2 n^2 a_n = n^2 a_{n-1} – 2 (n-2)^2 a_{n-2} + (n-2)^2 a_{n-3}.\)</p>
<p>How can you evaluate this claim? Quite probably this is the first time this result has been written down, and you will not find it anywhere in the literature. But it turns out that</p>
<p>\( \displaystyle{ \left(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{2^n} \right) \times \left(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)^2} \right)<br>
 = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n}\)</p>
<p> and letting \(x=1\) recovers the identity above and immediately explains how to prove it. To a mathematician, it is clear that the proof explains not only why the originally identity is  true, but also why it is not at all interesting. It  arises as more or less a formal manipulation of a definition, with a few minor things thrown in like the sum of a geometric series and facts about which functions satisfy certain types of ordinary differential equations. The point is that the identities produced by the Ramanujan Machine have all been of this type. That is, upon further scrutiny, they have not yet revealed any new mathematical insights, even if any particular example, depending on what you know, may be more or less tricky to compute. </p>
<p> What then about the <i>improved</i> irrationality measures for the Catalan constant? I think that is a polite  way of describing a failed attempt to prove that Catalan’s constant was irrational. It’s something that would be only marginally publishable in a mathematics journal even with a proof. Results about the irrationality measure <i>in the range where they are irrational</i> have genuine implications about the arithmetic of the relevant numbers, but these results do not.</p>
<p>What then about the new continued fractions developed over the last year — maybe these are now deeper? Here you have to remember that continued fractions, especially of the kind considered in this paper, are more or less equivalent to questions about certain types of ordinary differential equations and their related periods. (But importantly, not conversely: most of these interesting ODEs have nothing to do with continued fractions since they are associated with recurrences of length greater than two.) For your sake, dear reader, I voluntarily chose to give up an hour or two of my life and took a closer look at one of their “new conjectures.” I deliberately chose one that they specifically highlighted in their paper, namely:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.galoisrepresentations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Catalan-300x103.png" alt="" width="600" height="206" srcset="https://www.galoisrepresentations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Catalan-300x103.png 300w, https://www.galoisrepresentations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Catalan.png 680w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></p>
<p>Where \(G\) here is Catalan’s constant \(L(2,\chi_4)\). As you might find unsurprising, once you start to unravel what is going on you find that, just as in the example above, the mystery of these numbers goes away. This example can be generalized in a number of ways without much change to the argument. Let \(p_0=1\) and \(q_0 = 0\), and otherwise let </p>
<p>\(\displaystyle{\frac{p_n}{q_n}  = \frac{3}{1}, \frac{33}{13}, \frac{765}{313}, \frac{30105}{12453}, \frac{1790775}{743403},  \ldots} \) </p>
<p>denote the (non-reduced) partial fraction convergents. If</p>
<p> \( \displaystyle{ P(z) = \sum \frac{4^n p_n z^n}{n!^2} = 1 + 12z + 132 z^2 + \ldots<br>
\quad Q(z) = \sum \frac{4^n q_n z^n}{n!^2} = 4z +52 z^2  + \ldots} \)</p>
<p>Then, completely formally, \(DP(z) = 0\) where</p>
<p>\( \displaystyle{ D = z(8z-1)(4z-1) \frac{d^2}{dz^2}  + (160 z^2 – 40 z + 1) \frac{d}{dz} + 12(8z – 1)}\)</p>
<p>and \(DQ(z) = 4\).   If \(K\) and \(E\) denote the standard elliptic functions, one observes that \(P(z)\) is nothing but the hypergeometric function</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.galoisrepresentations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/HyperF-300x40.png" alt="" width="480" height="64" srcset="https://www.galoisrepresentations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/HyperF-300x40.png 300w, https://www.galoisrepresentations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/HyperF-768x101.png 768w, https://www.galoisrepresentations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/HyperF-940x126.png 940w, https://www.galoisrepresentations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/HyperF.png 954w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px"></p>
<p>But now one is more or less done! The argument is easily finished with a little help from mathematica. Another solution to  \(DF(z) = 0\) is of course</p>
<p>\( \displaystyle{ R(z) = \frac{ 2 E((1-8z)^2) -2 K((1-8z)^2) }{(1 – 8z)^2} = \log(z) + 2 + \ldots } \)</p>
<p>and knowing both homogenous solutions allows one to write \(Q(z) = u(z) P(z) + v(z) R(z)\) and then easily compute that</p>
<p>\(\displaystyle{ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{p_n}{q_n}<br>
= \lim_{z \rightarrow 1/8} \frac{P(z)}{Q(z)} = \frac{2}{-1 + 2G}.}\)</p>
<p>as desired. For those playing at home, note that a convenient choice of \(u(z)\) and \(v(z)\) can be given by</p>
<p>\( \displaystyle{ v(z) = \int \frac{ E(16 z(1-4z))}{\pi}  = 4 z – 8 z^2 + \ldots }\)</p>

															<h2>No, Globalization isn’t Taking Our Jobs, Either</h2>										<div>
				<p>In my <a href="https://rhsfinancial.com/2018/09/robots-jobs/">last post</a> I dispelled the notion of technological unemployment – despite all the hype, it simply can’t be the case that automation is reducing the need for human labor because if it were then we would see a negative correlation between wage growth and GDP growth. In fact, we see the opposite; countries with faster-growing economies continue to have faster-growing wages and higher labor-force participation. Demand for labor, including unskilled labor, is actually quite high right now and it should continue to grow for decades to come (granted it will ebb and flow with the business cycle as it always has).</p>
<p>But I left one question unanswered: why have lower-income Americans seen so little wage-growth compared to higher-income Americans? Since the early 1980s the highest-earning households have significantly outpaced their lower-earning counterparts.</p>
<div id="attachment_2214"><a href="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Growth-Real-Mean-Income.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2214" loading="lazy" src="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Growth-Real-Mean-Income.png" alt="" width="1380" height="958"></a><p id="caption-attachment-2214">Source: United States Census</p></div>
<p>So if it’s not robots, then why is it that income inequality is increasing and the American working class is struggling to keep up? Again, the key to understanding what’s going on lies in the international data. In my last post I looked at the relation between wages and GDP among OECD countries since the turn of the millennium. If we look at those same wage growth figures for OECD countries over the 2000-2017 period it turns out there’s one simple variable that explains half of the variation in outcomes between these countries: whatever their average wage was back in 2000. Specifically, the higher a country’s wages were back in 2000, the slower they grew over the next 17 years. This can be seen by the negative relation between the log of 2000 average wages and subsequent growth rates below.</p>
<div id="attachment_2273"><a href="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/OECD-Wages.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2273" loading="lazy" src="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/OECD-Wages.png" alt="" width="1511" height="932"></a><p id="caption-attachment-2273">Source: OECD</p></div>
<p>So basically, countries that already had high wages around the turn of the millennium have had little to no wage growth since then, while lower-income countries have fared much better. In 2000, the United States had the third highest wages in the OECD, just barely behind Switzerland and Luxembourg. We’re still number 4 (Iceland recently pulled ahead of us), but the rest of the developed world has narrowed the gap by a significant degree.</p>
<p>Notice how this pattern in the <em>international&nbsp;</em>data&nbsp;is the opposite of what we saw above with the&nbsp;<em>intranational</em> household income data: while the affluent have pulled ahead of the working class within the US, around the world it’s the lower-income countries that have been growing faster than the high-income countries. Thus far we’ve only looked at OECD data, but this is hardly just a developed-world phenomenon. On the contrary, catch-up growth has been one of the most striking global trends in recent decades. Let’s broaden our horizons now and consider growth around the developed and developing world. Looking at data from the world’s largest 100 economies with full-sample data (this excludes micro-nations that may represent statistical outliers), below I recreate the graph above of income by quintile across countries for the 2000 – 2017 period. Because wage data are not available for many developing economies I use per-capita GDP figures, which we have established have a very high correlation with wages.</p>
<div id="attachment_2230"><a href="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Cumulative-GDP-Growth-by-Country.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2230" loading="lazy" src="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Cumulative-GDP-Growth-by-Country.png" alt="" width="1178" height="665"></a><p id="caption-attachment-2230">Source: IMF</p></div>
<p>We see convergence on every level of the income distribution, a complete reversal of the within-US results we saw above. The richest 20 countries experienced the slowest income growth of any quintile, and the richest 5 countries (which includes the US), had slower growth still. The bottom quintile, on the other hand, nearly quintupled its average per-capita GDP, from a pitiful $401 per year to $1,977. Of course, to American readers, both these numbers sound like crushing poverty, and they often are. That a billion or more people around the world still live on such meager earnings is a sobering reminder of how well we in the developed world have it, even among those in the lower income brackets. But to the average Ethiopian or Laotian or Ukrainian (all members of the bottom 20), the difference between $401 and $1,977 can be literally life or death. Here’s a graph I’ve shared before: the percentage of the world in extreme poverty over time, currently defined by the World Bank as less than $1.90 a day, roughly what it takes to get adequate daily calories from staple crops.</p>

<p>This is the happiest infographic there is, and in my opinion represents mankind’s greatest accomplishment. For most of human history until about 50 years ago, roughly half the world constantly lived on the verge of starvation. Today it’s less than 10% (about 8% according to the <a href="http://worldpoverty.io/">latest numbers</a>, or ~635 million people, still too many). Since about 1980 global extreme poverty has been falling rapidly and is now in virtual freefall. Most people alive today will live to see the day that the scourge of hunger is forever wiped off the face of this earth.</p>
<p>But notice that the acceleration of the alleviation of poverty around the world around 1980 roughly corresponds to the time frame that most observers point to as when income inequality in the US and other developed nations started taking off. So here is my hypothesis: income inequality is increasing in the US and other developed countries&nbsp;<em>because&nbsp;</em>poverty is falling everywhere else.</p>
<h3>Solow Mojo</h3>
<p>This is not an exotic or fringe idea: it’s actually textbook development economics, namely, it’s exactly what we would have predicted under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solow%E2%80%93Swan_model">Solow growth model</a>, a staple of undergraduate economics courses. Basically, under standard economic theory, capital acts like water seeking its lowest level, flowing away from parts of the economy with high capital to labor ratios towards low capital to labor ratios. In other words, rich, developed countries will tend to see net capital outflows towards poor, developing countries, lifting incomes in the latter and slowing them in the former until equilibrium is achieved. Sweeping a lot of details under the rug for now, this is basically the process we have seen take place over the last 30-odd years. As a result, those at the bottom – workers in the developing world – and those at the top – capitalists, executives, and entrepreneurs around the world able to access newly open markets – have seen their fortunes rise at unprecedented rates, while those in the middle – the working classes of the developed world – have experienced relative stagnation. This is hardly a utopia where everybody is made better, but nor is it the dystopia often portrayed in the media where the rich get richer by squeezing the poor out of the last nickel and dime. Economics doesn’t always make for easy storytelling.</p>
<p>There is plenty to feel ambivalent about in our world today. While we should all applaud the rise of the formerly-poor citizens of the developing world into the middle class, most people in the developed world understandably feel concern for the fate of the middle class in their own country, and the politics of the day on both the right and left are a reflection of that fact. There is plenty of room for discussion on what role governments should play in supporting its citizens in this great capital-labor equilibration process known as globalization, but one option that doesn’t help anybody is trying to stop it altogether.</p>
<p>One question to consider with the Solow growth model as it relates to recent world economic history: why now? If the natural tendency is for capital and incomes to equalize across countries, how did we end up with rich countries and poor countries in the first place, and why did it take until 1980 or so for this process of convergence to finally take off?</p>
<p>We know that the industrial revolution kicked off in Britain around 1800 and quickly spread to the rest of “the West”, broadly speaking. But while industrialization caught on in Europe, North America, and a few other places and brought with it capital formation, technological innovation, and steadily rising standards of living, most of the rest of the world was slow to catch on. Economists generally agree that the main reason for this is institutions. Since at least the industrial revolution, the governments of Western nations have mostly been more-or-less liberal, more-or-less democratic, and more-or-less committed to encouraging commerce and industry by protecting private property, enforcing contracts, etc. But for many years most of the rest of the nations of the world lived under communist, fascist, colonial, monarchist, or just simply corrupt and incompetent governments that were not conducive to the capital formation necessary to spur economic growth. But starting in the mid-1970s with the opening up of China, then accelerating with the fall of the Soviet Union, more and more nations around the world started moving towards democracy, liberalism, and capitalism, opening up their markets and inviting Western investors in. We can liken this process to the West having been an isolated bucket with a water level representing capital that was slowly rising, fed from the faucet of technological innovation, for 150+ years. Then, over a relatively short period of time, several valves opened up near the bottom of this bucket leading into several other mostly-empty chambers representing the rest of the world. Water flows out until the other chambers are either filled or their water levels are equal.</p>
<p>How big these chambers are and how fast the water flows is largely determined by how much economic freedom a society has, and this is something that can be measured. In 1995 the Wall Street Journal and the Heritage Foundation created the <a href="https://www.heritage.org/index/">Index of Economic Freedom</a>, an annual ranking of the nations of the world based on how open and free their markets are. The index uses a quantitative rules-based approach to score each country on several sub-categories of …</p></div></article></section></div></main></div></div></div>

<p>It seems like nowadays, every company is a SaaS company. We’ve even begun stratifying by what is sold, replacing the “software” in SaaS to whatever the product’s core competency is, <a href="https://www.algolia.com/">search-as-a-service</a>, <a href="https://sendbird.com/">chat-as-a-service</a>, <a href="https://corp.kaltura.com/">video-as-a-service</a>. So, when we, at <a href="https://goteleport.com/">Teleport</a>, set sail for the cloud after years of successfully navigating on-prem software, we came in with a different set of experiences.</p>

<p>Turns out, porting a tool designed to be self-hosted to something hosted isn’t as simple as pulling our build image from quay.io. Well, in a way it is, but what I mean is that the SaaS route poses a different series of design challenges than on-prem. The product is the same, but not how users interface with it. This post explores how we deployed <a href="https://goteleport.com/blog/teleport-cloud/">Teleport Cloud</a> on Kubernetes, deliberately designing for maximizing security, minimizing resource consumption, and self-service.</p>

<h2 id="teleport-cloud-terminology">Teleport Cloud Terminology</h2>

<p>To follow along with Teleport-specific concepts and terms, we need to cover the basics.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/how_teleport_works_detailed_updated.png" width="100%" alt="simplified-teleport-architecture"></p>

<p>Figure 1: How Teleport Works</p>

<p>At its core, Teleport Unified Access Plane enables engineers to quickly access any computing resource anywhere.</p>

<ul>
<li>Teleport terminology includes:

<ul>
<li>Resource - Server, database, web app, or Kubernetes cluster</li>
<li>Client - Users and machines processes attempting to access resources</li>
<li>Proxy Service - Stands between users and resource</li>
<li>Auth Service - Responsible for issuing and authenticating certificates</li>
<li>Node Service - Daemon running on resource(s)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Client initiates connection to resources through the proxy service, either presenting a short-lived certificate or requesting one from the auth server</li>
<li>Auth service authenticates the digital signature on the certificate</li>
<li>Proxy service grants access resources behind it</li>
<li>Node service queries auth service API to check permissions described in the certificate</li>
<li>User has obtained role based access to the resource</li>
</ul>

<p>For all the <a href="https://goteleport.com/blog/microservices-containers-kubernetes/">standard reasons</a>, we deployed Teleport Cloud as a Kubernetes cluster on AWS. Each customer is given their own Kubernetes namespace to isolate resources like pods, deployments and supporting services like load balancers, S3 buckets, and databases. Taken together, each customer has their own tenant within the Kubernetes cluster. Teleport Cloud is currently in a private beta, but is <a href="https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/preview/upcoming-releases/">slated for GA</a> on March 1st.</p>

<h2 id="self-service">Self-Service</h2>

<p>Our core design principle was to make it convenient for developers to use Teleport Cloud. Many of us use Teleport and other software in our home labs. We don’t want to have strings attached to play with new software. To meet this design principle, we had to remove ourselves entirely from the equation, leaving behind a functional closed system. We landed on introducing two new components between Teleport and Teleport Cloud, a single billing-service and single custom Kubernetes operator.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/teleport_deployment.png" width="100%" alt="cloud-components"></p>

<p>Figure 2: Teleport Deployment</p>

<p>The billing-service is a Go app complete with its own council of microservices and APIs to manage customer account information - think billing and subscription. When customers fill out the sign-up form and describe their tenants, the information gets propagated to the billing-service. Using a built in Kubernetes client, the billing-service creates a custom resource <code>kind: Tenant</code>.</p>

<p>The tenant-operator is a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#custom-controllers">custom controller</a>, built using the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder">kubebuilder</a> framework. It extends the Kubernetes API to manage stateful operations - in this case, on AWS. Whenever a new state change is made to a <code>Tenant</code> resource in a cluster (like creating a new tenant), the tenant-operator responds by provisioning compute infrastructure to match the expected state. The Teleport instance itself communicates to the billing-service to report usage. Through an API in the billing-service, customers can review their usage and make changes to resource consumption as necessary, starting the loop all over again.</p>

<p>In the darkest timeline, we would take the place of the billing-service, forcing some contrived interaction. But with the billing-service, customers are mostly able to interact with their deployment without us.</p>

<h2 id="idle-resource-consumption">Idle Resource Consumption</h2>

<p>Just like every cloud-hosted offering in existence, Teleport Cloud needed to be lean, balancing a fine line between cost and availability. We had powerful tools at our disposal by deploying on Kubernetes, letting us monitor CPU usage and dynamically scale in real time. Problem is, we needed time to collect and draw conclusions from the data… But what do we do until then?</p>

<p>Figuring out how to allocate processing power was a bit of a guessing game for us. With our on-prem version, we never sent any data from Teleport back to us, obfuscating patterns in user behavior. We only had partial answers to questions like, “What’s the difference between a deployment of 5 Teleport proxies vs. 50 vs. 500?” and “How does usage change when Teleport is used for server access and Kubernetes access?” Having this information would give us some confidence in efficiently provisioning server resources to new sign-ups based on descriptive inputs, like number of users, resource type, region, and a dozen other details.</p>

<p>In time, we would collect this data. Not that it would be difficult. Running Prometheus to monitor our Kubernetes cluster lets us gather system data on containers, pods, and nodes. Once aggregated across resource consumption, requests, and limits, we could answer questions that we were previously in the dark about. Not to mention the basic promise of Kubernetes with horizontal and vertical autoscaling.</p>

<p>But we’re skipping a step here, attempting to run without learning to walk. Right now these metrics mean very little to us; the sample size is too small. Instead, we had to create a default state for creating new tenants. We needed a naive allocation policy. To this end, we had only one data point to work with, the cost of an idle Teleport instance, between the proxy and auth server, is roughly  50 millicores. Packing a core for 20 tenants would max out capacity, assuming no user activity. (This number goes down as more proxy/auth servers are added to a tenant, increasing idle consumption.) To account for activity, we used a 1:4 ratio of dedicated resources to pooled resources to be shared between tenants. In other words, we reserve 75% of CPU for bursts forcing the Kubernetes scheduler to only allocate ¼ of available compute. As new tenants are created, nodes are packed tighter and tighter until idle consumption reaches 25%. At this point, we manually provision a fresh CPU to begin packing, though at some point we’ll introduce an autoscaler to do the part.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/allocated_cpu_cores.png" width="100%" alt="millicores-tenants-graph"></p>

<p>Figure 3: Allocated CPU Cores</p>

<p>This ratio of 1:4 is somewhat the result of guesswork. After all, we made this approximation exactly because we haven’t had time to gather data. But as we learn how server resources are actually used by customers, we can tune their configuration and start to shrink that 75% down to something more reasonable.</p>

<h2 id="authentication-and-authorization">Authentication and Authorization</h2>

<p>It took us five years to join our peers in the cloud because cloud did not provide the security and privacy that necessitated a product like Teleport in the first place. Most of our early customers were uncomfortable letting Teleport call home, let alone exposing their bare-metal production environments to a public endpoint. As we grew, we began to be approached by companies without these limitations, but being a component of critical infrastructure still required strict security standards. Over the years we gained valuable experience going through dozens of vendor security reviews and compliance checks. And with that information, we designed Teleport Cloud to preempt any objections we could expect.</p>

<p>On the surface, we made sure tenants never shared resources or data. Recall each customer has their own Teleport instance and set of supporting services. All tenants are deployed on the same physical cluster, but by attributing individual namespaces to each, customers had their own dedicated virtual cluster.</p>

<p>Digging deeper, we see that the billing-service and tenant-operator have their own scope of responsibilities and permissions. For example, the tenant-operator has privileged access to databases, load balancers, and S3 buckets while the billing-service provides billing and usage information through the Teleport web UI. It follows that these components should have their own IAM policy, just like a sysadmin and QA tester have theirs. Using <a href="https://github.com/uswitch/kiam">kiam</a>, we can associate IAM roles to pods. Kiam adds a meta-data description to pods, which the agent reads as it intercepts requests to the AWS API, rejecting any that do not correspond to their IAM role. The pod below, belonging to the <code>billing_service</code> IAM role, would be prohibited from requesting database credentials from Amazon’s metadata services, something that could have saved <a href="https://goteleport.com/resources/white-papers/top-10-hacks-of-the-decade/">CapitalOne</a> a lot of trouble in their 2019 data breach.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: foo
  namespace: acme.corp
  annotations:
    iam.amazonaws.com/role: billing_service</code></pre></div>
<p>On the topic of secrets and credentials, another important security design choice was using <a href="https://github.com/external-secrets/kubernetes-external-secrets">kubernetes external secrets</a>, which extended the Kubernetes API to access external secret managers, like AWS Secret Manager or Hashicorp Vault. It’s main use case is to manage our support and sales access to customer account data. When spinning up a new database with Terraform, a random password is generated and stored as credentials in AWS Secret Manager. Using the kubernetes external secrets project to fetch credentials, they need not be stored in plaintext in the deployment file, and can be rotated and encrypted within the secret manager.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Teleport-ing to the cloud has been a dream of ours for a while, but just wasn’t viable at the time - we open-sourced Teleport back in 2016, just two years after Kubernetes was. In the four years we waited, the Kubernetes ecosystem has exploded in depth and breadth. Only recently have kiam and kubernetes external secrets become production ready. Without …</p></article></div>

This article discusses the choices and tradeoffs we made while standardizing the IAM policy format for access via SQL and shows off the potential of IAM Policy analysis when normalized.</p><br><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre><code><p><span>{</span><span>                                        </span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2012-10-17"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Statement"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>  </span></p><p><span>    </span><span>{</span><span>     </span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Sid"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"MustBeEncryptedInTransit"</span><span>,</span><span>   </span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Action"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"s3:*"</span><span>,</span><span>                  </span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Effect"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Deny"</span><span>,</span><span>                      </span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Resource"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>                          </span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"arn:aws:s3:::vandelay-ind-bucket"</span><span>,</span><span>  </span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"arn:aws:s3:::vandelay-ind-bucket/*"</span><span> </span></p><p><span>      </span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span>                                     </span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Condition"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>   </span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"Bool"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span></p><p><span>          </span><span>"aws:SecureTransport"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"false"</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>}</span><span> </span></p><p><span>      </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Principal"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"*"</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span> </span></p><p><span>  </span><span>]</span><span> </span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre><code><p><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Statement"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Action"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"s3:*"</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Condition"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"Bool"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>          </span><span>"aws:securetransport"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>            </span><span>"false"</span><span></span></p><p><span>          </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Effect"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Deny"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Principal"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"AWS"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>          </span><span>"*"</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Resource"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"arn:aws:s3:::vandelay-ind-bucket"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"arn:aws:s3:::vandelay-ind-bucket/*"</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Sid"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"MustBeEncryptedInTransit"</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2012-10-17"</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><br><h2 id="why-be-normal--">Why be Normal  ?</h2><p>AWS IAM policies can have multiple representations that mean the same thing. Converting to a standard, machine-readable format makes them easier to search, analyze, join with other data and to calculate differences.</p><p>When working through the normalization process for an API, we generally work with 3 forms of each response:</p><ol><li>The original <strong>source</strong> form, verbatim (or as verbatim as the API allows). This is usually a string, including whitespace, comments, etc. The value of the keeping the source format varies - it's usually important for YAML but less important for JSON, for example. </li><li>The <strong>object</strong> form - A 'usable' form where the source (which is usually a string) is transformed into an object that can be manipulated in a standard way. Such transformation may be lossy - duplicate keys may be removed, comments are typically not included, etc. For steampipe, this format is typically <code>jsonb</code>.</li><li>A <strong>standard</strong> form - A single, canonical form that objects are converted to. The <strong>source</strong> and <strong>object</strong> forms may allow multiple syntaxes to represent a single semantic meaning. In such cases, converting all of these equivalent syntaxes to a single format simplifies and optimizes searching, comparing, and analyzing the object. </li></ol><p>Note that which forms are important vary by API, object, etc. For AWS IAM policies, Steampipe currently returns the object form (in the <code>policy</code> column) and the standardized form as <code>policy_std</code>. Because the source form is JSON and it sufficiently similar to the object form, we do not currently include it. </p><p>Many of the AWS IAM policy elements in the object form may be single elements or arrays. To search these elements, you don't just need to look for values, you would need to evaluate the <strong>structure</strong> of the result as well. For example, let's says you want to search for policies that allow the <code>s3:DeleteBucket</code> action. Without the standard form, you would need to look for both cases:</p><ul><li>Where the action is a string, and has value <code>"s3:DeleteBucket"</code><div><div><div><div><div><pre><code><p><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2012-10-17"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Statement"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Effect"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Allow"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Action"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"s3:DeleteBucket"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Resource"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"*"</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre></div></div></div></div></div><br></li><li>Where the action is an array, and the array includes the value <code>"s3:DeleteBucket"</code><div><div><div><div><div><pre><code><p><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2012-10-17"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Statement"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Effect"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Allow"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Action"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"s3:CreateBucket"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"s3:DeleteBucket"</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Resource"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"*"</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre></div></div></div></div></div></li></ul><p>In fact, the real world situation is even more complex - The action value may be any case, the resource may also be either string or array, etc. By converting policies to a single, standardized format, Steampipe makes it easier to find what you are looking for regardless of the source format.</p><h2 id="baseline-normalization-rules">Baseline Normalization Rules</h2><p>The general guidelines for building the standard policy are:</p><ol><li>Normalize the structure. In IAM policies, many elements may optionally contain either a single item, or an array of items, in these cases <strong>convert any single item values into a single item  array</strong>.</li><li>Standardize the case. For values or keys that are case insensitive, <strong>convert to consistent case (lower case)</strong>.</li><li>Order the elements consistently. Generally, the order of array elements is not important in the IAM policy, so <strong>sort array elements alphabetically</strong> to make them easier to read and easier to to compare/diff. </li></ol><h2 id="applicability-for-each-aws-iam-policy-element">Applicability for each AWS IAM Policy Element</h2><p>The devil is in the details, and so it is worthwhile to consider each policy element individually.</p><h3 id="statement"><code>Statement</code></h3><p>A policy can contain a single <code>Statement</code> object or an array of <code>Statement</code> objects, thus the following are equivalent:</p><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre><code><p><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2012-10-17"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Statement"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>"Effect"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Allow"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>"Action"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"s3:PutObject"</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>"Resource"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"*"</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre><code><p><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2012-10-17"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Statement"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Effect"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Allow"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Action"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"s3:PutObject"</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Resource"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"*"</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>The standard form will always convert the <code>Statement</code> to the array format.</p><h3 id="action-and-notaction"><code>Action</code> and <code>NotAction</code></h3><p>Like <code>Statement</code>, a policy may represent a single <code>Action</code> as a string, or one or more actions as an array.

In the standard form, we convert all actions to <strong>lower case</strong> to simplify equivalency and matching operations. An argument could be made for camel case as well, as the documentation most frequently refers to them in camel case; however, we chose lower case because it is simple and unambiguous. This also has the benefit of avoiding stylistic choices that can arise in camel case (e.g. <code>IpAddress</code> v/s <code>IPAddress</code>).</p><p>Actions may appear in any order.

                                                <p>In the race for global technological supremacy, “the European Union is trying to get its groove back,” <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/european-commission-margrethe-vestager-next-big-fight-will-be-with-europe-regulation-competition-big-tech">Politico reported last year</a>. Actually, Europe has been looking for its groove for some time: Ambitious industrial policy schemes have long been a central part of Europe’s effort to compete with the United States and China for leadership in computing, communications and artificial intelligence, among other things.</p>
<p>Thus far, however, the Europeans don’t have much to show for their attempts to produce home-grown tech champions. Despite highly targeted and expensive efforts to foster a domestic tech base, the EU has instead generated a string of industrial policy failures that should serve as a cautionary tale for U.S. pundits and policymakers, who seem increasingly open to more government-steered innovation efforts.</p>
<h3><strong>Picking Losers</strong></h3>
<p>Industrial policy is often criticized for devolving into a game of picking winners and losers. However, some industrial policy advocates believe that wagering public resources on risky technological bets is worth it if it helps spur the rise of at least a few winners.</p>
<p>In Europe’s case, however, it seems like they’ve picked mostly losers. It also matters little whether these industrial policy initiatives were established at the EU level or by member states; almost all of them have met with failure. Consider a few prominent examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minitel &amp; internet access:</strong> Minitel was France’s attempt to develop its own early version of the internet in the 1980s and ‘90s. Minitel terminals were distributed free of charge and eventually gave an estimated 25 million French citizens access to bank accounts, the yellow pages and various other services. But Minitel’s centralized and closed network model ultimately could not serve consumers as well as the wide-open global internet.“It was the whole model that was doomed,” <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-18610692">says Benjamin Bayart</a>, the former head of France’s oldest internet provider, French Data Network. “Basically, to set up a service on Minitel, you had to ask permission from France Telecom. You had to go to the old guys who ran the system, and who knew absolutely nothing about innovation.”Users of Minitel also faced steep costs, roughly $22.95 per hour accounting for inflation, which has been noted as a major downside of the technology. As for the French government, the development of the service cost <a href="https://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/industries/technology-industry/france-telecom-takes-minitel-offline/">tens of billions of French francs</a> before it was finally <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/how-france-fell-out-love-minitel-7831816.html">discontinued in 2012</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Galileo &amp; GPS:</strong> In 1999, the EU announced a public-private endeavor to establish Europe’s own global positioning service, called Galileo. Within three years, the project was “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/dec/08/world.internationaleducationnews#:~:text=Last%20year%2C%20the%20EU%20press,%22Galileo%20is%20almost%20dead%22.&amp;text=Moving%20the%20signal%20will%20lead,accurate%20to%20within%20eight%20metres.">almost dead,</a>” but the EU continued on, allocating $5 billion for Galileo. By 2006, the public and private sector partnership had <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/galileo-public-private-partnership-crashes-to-earth-2">dissolved</a>, and the project was officially nationalized. After billions of dollars of cost overruns and poor strategy, Galileo finally got satellites in the sky in 2011 for a validation test, but it was not until 2019 that satellites became fully operational. <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201601291033933836-european-satellite-galileo-project/">The project</a> was 12 years late, triple the original budget and provided virtually no novel technology to the continent.</li>
<li><strong>Quaero &amp; search:</strong> In 2008, Germany and France teamed up to launch Quaero, a $400 million search engine that was initially hyped as a “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/21/technology/21iht-quaero24.html">Google-killer</a>.” While many in Europe were optimistic about the creation of a service that would rival what was on offer from American tech companies, within a year the Franco-German alliance <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-pulls-away-from-quaero-search-engine-project/a-2287489">began to fracture</a>. The project officially ended in 2013, with no semblance of a search engine to show for a boondoggle costing hundreds of millions of euros.</li>
<li><strong>GAIA-X &amp; cloud services:</strong> GAIA-X represents the latest European push to develop home-grown tech—in this case a unified, interoperable ecosystem of <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/what-is-gaia-x-a-guide-to-europes-cloud-computing-fight-back-plan/">cloud services throughout Europe</a>. In October 2020, EU countries issued a joint declaration to collectively fund a “European Alliance on Industrial Data and Cloud,” <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/towards-next-generation-cloud-europe">to create</a> a “common approach to building the European cloud supply [that] will reinforce Europe’s digital sovereignty and increase the competitiveness of European business and industry.” Founding members of GAIA-X include 22 companies from a cross-section of industries. So far, things are off to a slow start: As of right now, <a href="https://www.squirepattonboggs.com/-/media/files/insights/publications/2020/11/what-is-gaia-x-and-what-do-i-need-to-know/what-is-gaia-x-and-what-do-i-need-to-know.pdf">no European states have supplied public funding</a>.</li>
<li><strong>France’s Netflix:</strong> Meanwhile, other industrial policy efforts are also afoot in France, which <a href="https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2019/08/13/salto-the-french-netflix-gets-green-light-but-with-conditions">recently gave the green light</a> for a group to create their own version of a Netflix-like video streaming service. The project is being taken on by a conglomerate, made up of the TF1 Group, which was founded in 1975 by the French government but went private in 1987; the Groupe M6, a private media conglomerate; and France Télévisions, the state-owned French public broadcasting company. This mélange of the French public and private sector is intended to rival American video streaming giants like Netflix, Disney and HBO MAX. It’s early days, but if history is any indicator, this targeted industrial policy may prove fruitless.</li>
<li><strong>France’s Airbnb:</strong> A video-streaming service is not the only popular technology the French are trying to emulate. The country’s government said it also <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/france-airbnb-government-version-holiday-booking-website-a9526666.html.">plans to develop its own version</a> of Airbnb and Booking.com so as to “regain a link” with tourists. While France obviously wants to push back against U.S.-based tech giants like Airbnb, that desire must be weighed against the benefits that Airbnb has brought to the country and the costs of a French-run accommodations service. In 2015 alone, according to <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/press/news/economic-impact-of-airbnb-in-france-grows-to-2-5-billion">a study conducted by Airbnb</a>, the company contributed 2.5 billion euron total economic activity, supported 13,300 jobs and increased the likelihood of travelers returning to France. Indeed, 23% of Airbnb guests said they would not have visited France had it not been for the option to use Airbnb.</li>
</ul>
<p>Targeted European industrial policies like these demonstrate the problems associated with state-led efforts to steer technology or incubate certain companies or sectors. Innovation isn’t a precise recipe that can be easily cooked up by the state just tossing money at technology sectors.</p>
<h3><strong>And Now It’s AI’s Turn</strong></h3>
<p>Undeterred by its long string of costly failures, Europe appears ready to apply the same <a href="https://medium.com/@AdamThierer/europes-new-ai-industrial-policy-c5d945c5579f">top-down vision</a> to artificial intelligence technologies, again in an attempt to catch up with the U.S. and China. In early 2020, the European Commission published a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/commission-white-paper-artificial-intelligence-feb2020_en.pdf"><em>White Paper on Artificial Intelligence</em></a>, which proposed developing “ecosystems of excellence” through “the creation of excellence and testing centres” that will “concentrate in sectors where Europe has the potential to become a global champion.”</p>
<p>A laundry list of impressive-sounding programs followed, including: Digital Innovation Hubs, Enterprise Resource Planning, the Digital Europe Programme, the Key Digital Technology Joint Undertaking and a number of broad-based public-private partnerships. This is all part of a broader official “Coordinated Plan” prepared together with EU member states “to foster the development and use of AI in Europe.”</p>
<p>Europe is essentially circling the wagons and creating what Christian Borggreen, vice president of Computer and Communications Industry Association Europe, calls an “<a href="http://www.project-disco.org/innovation/020320-ai-fortress-europe/">AI Fortress Europe</a>” strategy. For example, Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission’s executive vice president for digital, now advocates the equivalent of a “<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/european-commission-margrethe-vestager-next-big-fight-will-be-with-europe-regulation-competition-big-tech">Europe First</a>” strategy to produce national champions that can compete with the U.S. and China on the global stage. The express goal of GAIA-X, for example, is to reduce European reliance on international cloud companies like Amazon and Microsoft.</p>
<p>The problem with that approach, Borggreen notes, is that it “runs counter to the European Commission’s ambition of becoming a global leader in the data economy.” Europe knows it cannot completely divorce itself from global digital networks, which is why American companies like Microsoft are included in GAIA-X. But the EU appears determined to just keep beating down U.S. tech companies with more regulations and taxes and then hoping that such punitive steps, combined with its industrial policy efforts, will somehow ensure that Europe isn’t left behind in the new technological era.</p>
<h3><strong>Industrial Policy Can’t Overcome a Hostile Innovation Culture</strong></h3>
<p>However, no amount of centralized state planning or spending will be able to overcome Europe’s aversion to technological risk-taking and disruption. The EU’s innovation culture generally values <em>stability</em>—of existing laws, institutions and businesses—over disruptive technological change. Competition policy scholars <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2e33a29f-b619-4623-82af-2ad352bba898">Nicolas Petit and David Teece observe</a> that the EU came away from the digital revolution with “the complete absence of superstar companies.”</p>
<p>There are no European versions of Microsoft, Google or Apple, even though Europeans obviously demand and consume the sort of products and services those U.S.-based companies provide. It’s simply not possible given the EU’s current regulatory regime. “Public policy and attitudes explain the relative technological decline and lack of economic dynamism,” Petit and Teech argue, and it has resulted in “weak venture capital markets, fragmented research capabilities, low worker mobility and frustrated entrepreneurs.”</p>
<p>With laws and regulations piling up and discouraging business formation and venture capital investment, most of the important action in digital tech increasingly has been happening elsewhere—primarily in the U.S. and China. European leaders have responded by doubling down on their regulatory efforts (now mostly targeted at U.S. tech companies), as well as with all their industrial policy gambits.</p>
<p>These policies have significant costs. Some of these costs are discrete, like fines for violating the European data protection law—the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)—which are levied against companies when they aggregate too much data or do not adequately safeguard aggregated data. These fines, which were recently …</p></div></div>

<blockquote>
<p>I started writing this piece in October 2020, around when I was beginning to transition out of my role at Jupiter. At the time, twelve months prior was October 2019.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Life was good in October 2019. Venture capital investment activity was on the cusp of hitting another <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/us-venture-capital-investment-surpasses-130-billion-in-2019-for-second-consecutive-year-300986237.html">record</a>, the stock market was reaching all-time <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_milestones_of_the_S%26P_500#The_Mid_2010s_Bull_Market_(2013-2020)">highs</a>, and the California wildfire season had been <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-09-10/fires-california-wildfire-season-now">mild</a> so far. I was recently <a href="https://www.natecation.com/why-i-dropped-out/">dropped out</a> of college and starting my first full-time job as a startup software engineer at <a href="http://jupiter.co/">Jupiter</a>, and I had just moved into a spacious new home with my coworkers in San Francisco, a few blocks away from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EL65KLdEHE&amp;t=72">Painted Ladies</a>.</p>

<p>Yet — this year’s wildfires were the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/05/us/california-mammoth-pool-reservoir-camp-fire/index.html">worst</a> in California history, the air filling with so much smoke that the sun <a href="https://breakingground.us/exodus/">didn’t rise</a> one day, and that’s not even getting to the hell of a year otherwise — pandemic, economic crisis, protests, racial injustice — that 2020 has been so far for all of us.</p>
<p>From its highest highs to its lowest lows, it’s been quite the year. Between all that’s been going on, I’m thankful to have had the fortune (I’d love to say foresight, but I can’t) to choose to leave school last year to work for a startup, and I’m thankful to have been generally spared from the overall crisis. I hope that things get better for all of us in the weeks and months ahead.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’m writing this now because — amidst the whirlwind of changes happening in the world right now — there has also been a big change in my personal life: I’ve left my job at Jupiter.</p>
<p>Over the past year, I’ve learned from and thought a lot about this startup experience, from:</p>
<ol>
<li>specific skills I’ve developed on the job as a software engineer</li>
<li>to new perspectives on starting my career at an early-stage company</li>
<li>to certain feelings about life that I think only living independently in San Francisco could impart</li>
</ol>
<p>In my review below, I’ll go over the detailed pros and cons of each of these aspects of my experience from the past year. I’ll start with an evaluation of <a href="#i-on-the-job">my job</a> in itself, followed by observations applicable to <a href="#ii-on-career">my career</a> overall, followed by thoughts on <a href="#iii-on-living">“living”</a>, in a more general sense, that I think are worthwhile to share.</p>
<p>I’m excited for what this next year will bring, but in the meantime, I hope this review can serve as a useful chronicle of my startup experience in 2020, inform those who may be thinking about taking the startup route as well, and most importantly, express my thanks to the team that decided to take a chance on me one year ago.</p>
<h2 id="i-on-the-job"><a href="#i-on-the-job" aria-label="i on the job permalink"></a>I. On the Job</h2>
<h3 id="pros"><a href="#pros" aria-label="pros permalink"></a>Pros</h3>
<h4 id="autonomy"><a href="#autonomy" aria-label="autonomy permalink"></a>Autonomy</h4>
<p>From the start, I had the autonomy to choose the entire <a href="https://starship.jupiter.co/jupiter-stack/">tech stack</a> — from the TypeScript frontend all the way to the Kubernetes infrastructure — and the result was that no matter what I was working on, I’d be using a technology that I was personally invested and interested in and thought was the best tool for the job.</p>
<p>I was able to get a better sense of how to make good technical decisions going forward, as certain tools turned out to be great choices and others, a little bit less than great.</p>
<div id="natecation-dropdown-1">
<div>
            <div>
              <h4>Choosing Kubernetes, Rollup, and Bazel</h4>
              <p>424 words</p>
            </div>
            </div>
<div id="natecation-dropdown-content-1">
<ol>
<li>I’d initially chosen to put our infrastructure on Amazon’s proprietary container orchestration service, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/">Fargate</a>, since I had prior experience with AWS and some of our other infrastructure was already on AWS. I figured there would be good interoperability. However, community support for Fargate was lacking (and we weren’t ready to pay for premium AWS support) and documentation was poor, leading to a bunch of hard-to-debug issues. We moved to Google Cloud’s <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine">GKE</a> instead. Kubernetes’ thriving <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes">open-source community</a> was invaluable in helping us get set up and debug issues, and I learned the importance of developer mindshare and the power of open-source.</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>I initially set up Gradle as our build tool because it was the most modern JVM build tool that also had significant buy-in from the ecosystem (the second constraint reduced the scope of potential options to essentially Gradle or Maven). However, we ran into a lot of trouble with Gradle’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">protobuf</a> compilation. Because Google invented protobufs, I prototyped Google’s <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a> build tool instead (which I was initially wary of because of the lack of a strong ecosystem outside of Google-supported projects), and it worked like a charm. Nonetheless, since implementing it, we’ve had problems with Bazel that we’ve only been able to resolve by combing through BUILD files in Google open source repositories — problems that could have been avoided if Bazel had a stronger community. Ultimately, it’s all about tradeoffs, and if the team ends up switching back to Gradle, I’d be disappointed that Bazel didn’t end up working out but not completely surprised.</li>
</ol>
</div></div>
<p>I now have better instincts for which characteristics of a tool I should weight most heavily, depending on factors like the problem at hand and the impact of adopting the tool.</p>
<div id="natecation-dropdown-2">
<div>
            <div>
              <h4>Choosing Kotlin</h4>
              <p>203 words</p>
            </div>
            </div>
<div id="natecation-dropdown-content-2">
<p>Although there was a decent amount of switching tools and prototyping early on, one choice I stand firmly behind is that of Kotlin as our main backend language, which seemed kind of risky at the time given its novelty. Nonetheless:</p>
<ol>
<li>by compiling Kotlin for the JVM, we were able to take advantage of the strength of the JVM ecosystem (with battle-tested libraries like <a href="https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java">gRPC-Java</a> and <a href="https://commons.apache.org/">Apache Commons</a>)</li>
<li>the syntax was relatively much easier to learn, especially coming from a Java- and JavaScript-heavy background (compared to say, a Scala or Clojure)</li>
<li>overall, the language was expressive, readable, and a joy to work with</li>
</ol>

<p>For what it’s worth, the most recent Stack Overflow <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020">Developer Survey</a> seems to support the choice, too: Kotlin was the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted">fourth-most loved</a> language by developers in 2020, after Rust, TypeScript, and Python.</p>
</div></div>
<h4 id="scope"><a href="#scope" aria-label="scope permalink"></a>Scope</h4>
<p>Outside of autonomy in technical decision-making, working in such a wide technical scope also kept my days interesting: I could be optimizing React performance in the morning and then figuring out how to write a <a href="https://github.com/Jupiter-Inc/terraform-provider-hex">custom Terraform provider</a> in Go in the afternoon; later that evening, I could be debugging a gRPC proxy issue. I gained a better understanding of everything that needs to come together to deploy a reliable production application.</p>
<p>Scope extended outside of the purely technical aspects, too: I was also given wide latitude to contribute to engineering processes and culture from scratch.</p>
<p>Besides instituting code review and introducing a few tests (which I unfortunately began to neglect as our product and code changed faster than I could keep up), I learned a lot during my initial research into development processes about concepts like:</p>
<ol>
<li>Continuous integration and continuous delivery (<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-ci-cd">CI/CD</a>)</li>
<li>Git workflows: tradeoffs between <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing">rebasing vs. merge</a> commits and <a href="https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/">trunk-based</a> development vs. long-lived <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow">feature branches</a></li>
<li>Releasing: continuously vs. daily or weekly</li>
</ol>

<p>All in all, I was able to do and learn a lot of things that I don’t think I would have been able to do in a larger organization or as a later hire.</p>
<h3 id="cons"><a href="#cons" aria-label="cons permalink"></a>Cons</h3>
<p>A quick disclaimer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is all from my personal perspective and reflects my opinions alone.</p>
<p>You probably aren’t hearing the full story about working at a startup from other startup employees. I think it’s a cultural thing. All startups are challenging in one way or another; it’s just that nobody is willing to say anything remotely not positive. The fact that I feel comfortable enough to speak honestly about my experience at Jupiter — both the things I loved and the things I had difficulty with — probably speaks more highly of the founding team of Jupiter than it does of all the other startups that you don’t hear much about — so keep that in mind.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I want Jupiter to succeed. <a href="https://firstround.com/review/The-Right-Way-to-Grant-Equity-to-Your-Employees/">Equity aligns incentives</a>, and I own a small part of the company. If they do great, I do great.</p>
<p>Every situation is unique, and my experience will never map one-to-one to anyone else’s (and vice versa). I believe in the power of transparency, and I share the details of my experience with the hope that if you’re considering joining a startup, this helps you make a more informed decision, and if you just started working for one, this prepares you for the road ahead. We’re all best off when we’re in the places we can thrive the most.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="technical-and-nontechnical"><a href="#technical-and-nontechnical" aria-label="technical and nontechnical permalink"></a>Technical and Nontechnical</h4>
<p>One of the hardest parts of the job — especially as a highly technical person — was working with a majority nontechnical founding team (one engineer and three MBAs). Much of the founders’ prior experience was with physical products and e-commerce <em>operations</em>, not necessarily software.</p>
<p>Jupiter was an ops-heavy business, so it made sense, but it was difficult in two ways.</p>

<p>The second challenge, perhaps related to the above, was that I wasn’t used to communicating with less-technical people about technical concepts on such a frequent basis. While not hiring an engineer <em>as</em> early as I suggested might’ve made sense given the priorities on the operations side, I think if I had been able to better communicate the technical challenges we were facing as an engineering team to the other founders, we might have gotten a senior engineer a bit earlier, which would’ve made work on the engineering side less chaotic and would’ve established a stronger technical foundation for us.</p>

<h4 id="team-composition"><a href="#team-composition" aria-label="team composition permalink"></a>Team Composition</h4>


<p>Nonetheless, I’ve learned to prioritize explicit communication and to say what I really think as early as I can, so progress and discussion can happen as soon as possible. This was not something I was automatically accustomed to doing before working at Jupiter.</p>
<h4 id="pace-of-learning"><a href="#pace-of-learning" aria-label="pace of learning permalink"></a>Pace of Learning</h4>
<p>Learning was the main reason I joined the company. After maybe six months or so, however, I felt the learning begin to slow down; after the initial technical architecture was set up, there was a lot of <a href="http://howtocenterincss.com/">“aligning divs”</a>/optimization-type work that wasn’t as exciting as the initial parts. While I didn’t expect the work to <em>always</em> be something novel and exciting (I think it’s unreasonable …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the past couple of months, we planned and implemented a move from a Slack group to a Discord server. There are many pros and cons of both platforms, and in fact, we covered them in detail, along with Discourse, in our blog post <a href="https://orbit.love/blog/slack-vs-discord-vs-discourse/">Slack vs Discord vs Discourse: The best tool for your community</a>.</p><p>But as our community grew, we began feeling the limitations of Slack as a community platform, and generally felt the need for more flexibility. That’s why we made the switch to Discord.</p><p>In this post, I’ll share our playbook for the move, along with several ideas and gotchas for anyone else considering setting up Discord for their own community.</p><h2>Early results</h2><p>As of this writing, the total number of members in Discord is smaller than the user count in Slack, but it’s catching up fast.</p><p>In that sense, we did take a short-term hit in terms of the gross user count. But as you know, not all user accounts represent actual engaged humans, so we’ve paid closer attention to the frequency and quality of conversation on the new platform, more than the simple total count of members.</p><p>Since the migration, we’ve received positive feedback form the community, and our community activity overall has increased, with more conversations happening across more channels.</p><p>In sum, the move has proven a success on all accounts, and I’m glad we made the move now rather than in the future.</p><p>Alright, how did we do it?</p><p><strong>Here’s the TLDR on our process</strong></p><ul><li>Invite community input and buy-in before making any moves</li><li>Design your Discord server well before migration day</li><li>Create incentives for early adopters</li><li>Phase the rollout</li><li>Bootstrap the initial interactions</li></ul><p>Before digging into the specifics of each step, let’s look at a few key points that drove our decision in the first place.</p><h2>Why we migrated our community from Slack to Discord</h2><p>There were several reasons, from tactical issues related to message history, to higher level concepts, like wanting more flexibility as the community grows.</p><h3><strong>No message limits</strong></h3><p>Most communities, including ours, are on Slack’s Free plan, which only allows you to see and search for the 10,000 most recent messages. More specifically:</p><blockquote>Members can send unlimited messages in Slack, but only the most recent 10,000 can be searched and viewed in your workspace. (<a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/115002422943-Message-file-and-app-limits-on-the-free-version-of-Slack#:~:text=Message%20visibility%20limit,your%20direct%20messages%20when%20searching.">source</a>)</blockquote><p>10k may sound like a lot, but by the time your community hits 250–300 members, you’ll blow right past the limit. We certainly did.</p><p>Discord enforces no such messaging limit, which means we don’t have to worry about losing context and conversations as the community grows.</p><h3><strong>Easy voice chat and screen share</strong></h3><p>In addition to the usual chat channels, Discord offers voice channels, which can be used for everything from casual chats to support to live discussions. These rooms also offer one-click video and screen sharing, making impromptu conversations fast and easy.</p><h3><strong>Moderation tools</strong></h3><p>As the community grows, moderation and permissions will become more important. Discord offers better capabilities along these lines.</p><h3><strong>More flexibility for everyone</strong></h3><p>Discord offers more options for channels and groups, allowing for a fine-grain architecture of channels. For example, we’ll be able to spin-up private chat and voice channels for customers inside of the server, while creating standalone public channels for events and more.</p><h2>Our playbook from migrating from Slack to Discord</h2><p>If you decide to make the move, here are my recommendations for planning and implementing the migration.</p><h3>Secure community buy-in</h3><p>As we thought about switching to a new platform, it was important for us to get community input and buy-in. After all, our members had been sharing ideas with each other and getting support in the Slack group for months.</p><p>And ultimately, there are way more community members than there are Orbit team members, so we didn’t want to just unilaterally impose the change.</p><p>Most agree that transparency should be a core value of any community, and this seemed like a great way to put that idea into action.</p><p>To do that, we drafted a proposal outlining our rationale, and left the Google Doc open to comment, so folks were able to add questions and ideas right in the doc. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PFHhZyyYmiIHNufYpS6fX7gUMEJVo3FM0Y0RZa7DuDo/edit?usp=sharing">Check out the proposal (now read-only) here ››</a></p><p>We then shared a post in the existing channel giving folks a heads-up.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/3c43a7f63c2ba85cc4393525b0a25be1de2584fd-1999x796.png" alt="Announcement in Slack" title="Announcement in Slack"></p><p>The comments were generally positive, with some asking questions about longevity and discoverability of discussions.</p><p>While we worked to secure community buy-in, we also got to work setting up our Discord server.</p><h3>Configure the Discord server for your needs</h3><p>Discord offers loads of flexibility for configuring your server, but with power comes complexity. In other words, there are lots of ways to fine-tune your server, but more thought and effort is required versus spinning-up a Slack instance.</p><p>By the way, in Discord world, <strong>"server" is just Discord's word for "workspace."</strong></p><p>To help us wrangle the moving parts of our server, we worked with <a href="https://twitter.com/domitriusclark/">Domitrius Clark</a>, who’s helped set up Discord servers for communities like Apollo GraphQL, Black Tech Pipeline, Open Sauced, Streaming in Color, and Rebuild Black Business, and for events like GraphQL Summit.</p><p>Working with Dom gave our team a <em>huge</em> head-start.</p><p>There are many things to keep in mind with your server setup, and the specifics probably warrant a separate post.</p><p>That said, let’s go into the weeds a bit on these points, since a broad understanding here will provide helpful context for the rest of the post.</p><p><strong>Roles basics</strong></p><p><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/214836687-Role-Management-101">Read the Discord docs on Roles ››</a></p><p>On a Discord server, permissions are associated with roles. A member can have multiple roles, affording them different abilities to do things like send messages, create channels, use voice and video, invite other members, and more.</p><p>Practically, here are few things to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>Roles are visible on member profiles, and, optionally, in the sidebar.</li><li>Channel permissions are associated with roles as well.</li><li>Roles are created and assigned manually.</li></ul><p>Here are some of the high-level roles and permissions we created:</p><p><strong>Orbit Employee</strong></p><p>This role is reserved for members of the Orbit team. With this role, all community members know immediately who actually works for Orbit.</p><p>From a safety perspective, this means it’s impossible for a nefarious actor to impersonate us. More often, though, it just means folks know who to turn to for help.</p><p>You can also configure roles to allow anyone to @mention everyone with that role. This is another quick and easy way to get the attention of all users with a certain Role.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/a664ea022409219c9d0d41f5902e2c23dba9fac8-1282x144.png" alt="Screenshot of the @Orbit Employee role" title="The Employee role"></p><p>In addition to a special color for our usernames, Orbit team members always appear at the top of the users list:</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/787c8fe6818a0a5658631f4d2523ea0588a57eb9-570x532.png" alt="Screenshot of the user's list " title="User's List "></p><p><br><strong>Beta Program</strong></p><p>We work with a small subset of the community for quick feedback and iteration on new features and ideas. To facilitate easy discussion, we created a Beta Program category with two channels.</p><p>We also created a Beta Program role, which has access to the private channels.</p><p>With an understanding of Roles, let’s talk about the next key concepts: categories and channels.</p><p><strong>Setting up Categories and Channels</strong></p><p>Like Slack, Discord lets you create public and private channels, and group them into Categories. The two types of channels are chat and voice.</p><p><strong>The interesting thing about voice channels is that they can also turn into streaming and live video channels with a click or two.</strong> This facilitates super simple meetings and screen sharing, which can be great for general hangouts or to quickly troubleshoot an issue.</p><p>At the outset, we created several public and private categories and channels.</p><p>Our Core categories include #random, #general, and #orbit-model, where folks discuss concepts about the Orbit Model. There are also two special channel types in Core.</p><p>The first is #announcements, which is a read-only channel where we share product and community updates. The second is #voice-chat, where anyone can drop-in for an impromptu conversation. This is also where we hangout on community game days.</p><p>When someone joins the server, they land in the #getting-started channel, which is read-only:</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/ff5173f4f8871251e7f7d985259b384f5613cdc2-1936x542.png" alt="Screenshot of the Orbit Discord server welcome message" title="Welcome Message"></p><p>We encourage folks to say Hello in #intros. Here are a few other key categories and channels:</p><p><strong>Product &amp; Support</strong> - channels for getting help and for talking about potential features</p><p><strong>Collaboration</strong> - for sharing integrations and apps built on top of Orbit</p><p><strong>Beta Program</strong> - a private category for folks in, well, the beta program</p><p>With your channels in place, there’s one more configuration choice you probably want to consider.</p><p><strong>Configure your server as a Community Server</strong></p><p>Discord offers a special designation for community servers, which unlocks several features highly relevant for you if you’re reading this article. This setting is not enabled automatically, but easy to do in Server Settings.</p><p>The first benefit is <strong>Membership Screening</strong>, which lets you require new members to verify their email for joining, and asks them to accept your guidelines before entering. This screen is fairly customizable and lets you spell out your expectations for behavior on your server. Here’s what ours looks like:</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/579265a0e3294e9273fcee7679ab3c5aa7f9e292-1730x1702.png" alt="Screenshot of the Membership Screening dialogue " title="Membership Screening"></p><p>Additionally, community servers offer a customizable <strong>welcome screen</strong>, which lets you set context and point new members in the right direction upon joining. As your community grows, you’ll add more categories and channels, so the welcome screen will help reduce any feeling of overwhelm for new users joining for the first time. Here’s ours:</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/b1408cc4fada97b8c676e1f45981a70b96abfdc6-1194x1548.png" alt="Screenshot of the Orbit Discord Welcome Message" title="Welcome Message"></p><p>Alright, you now have many of the key Disord concepts in mind. Let’s return to the implementation plan.</p><h3>Create incentives for early adopters</h3><p>To kickstart the move to Discord, we planned to offer several incentives to encourage early adopters to join us on Discord.</p><p><strong>First, we created a limited-run sticker commemorating the move.</strong> To get one, members had to join the Discord by February 1. Turns out, people like stickers! Here's our space canary, commemorating the migration 👇</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/3ad93f042804b265386f46417ab5fceacb772272-2400x812.png" alt="Illustration of a canary in a space suit " title="Canary sticker"></p><p>Second, <strong>we hosted a community game day in #voice-chat,</strong> and invited community members to join us for a few rounds of <a href="http://skribbl.io/">skribbl.io</a>. I can’t imagine trying to facilitate this kind of experience without Discord; setting up a Zoom call just feels too heavy.</p><p>Finally, we worked with …</p></div></div>

                <div>
                    <p>Since about 2017, I've been using <a href="https://cmder.net/">Cmder</a> almost daily as my console emulator of choice. There were a few key reasons why I gravitated towards it, and why it has stuck around for so long, but few issues have now led me elsewhere.</p><h2 id="would-i-still-recommend-cmder">Would I still recommend Cmder?</h2><p>After so many years of using Cmder, I actually still recommend it to newer analysts, people who migrate computers a lot, or folks who don't have administrative rights on their work computers. For anyone who is a little more settled in their development careers though, the question gets a little more complicated. Let's dive into some of the positives and negatives that in the end led to me searching for alternatives.</p><h3 id="the-good">The Good</h3><ul><li>It had a portable version! This was especially important since I was not allowed to have admin rights on my work computer and wanted the same terminal console everywhere.</li><li>It came with git and ssh out of the box.</li><li>The default theme settings looked pretty good particularly in comparison to PowerShell or the Windows Command Prompt.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/mridgers/clink">Clink</a> and the Git aware prompt were new to me at the time and really interesting.</li></ul><h3 id="the-bad">The Bad</h3><p>You might be thinking this all sounds great! It has some handy features to make it feel more like Linux and required minimal configuration! What went wrong?</p><ul><li>Speed - Cmder often feels slow. Really slow. Admittedly my work computer has a terrible hybrid drive which entirely negates the otherwise powerful machine, but when Windows Update runs in the background, I can barely open Cmder or run basic commands like <code>ls</code>. While admittedly not nearly as bad, it also feels slow on my home laptop and desktop even though they both have SSDs.</li><li>Settings Menu - Cmder offers a lot of customizability, but it presents so many options that I found it difficult to find what I wanted or to discover new features. As I got more comfortable setting up my own command line and dev tools, the sensible defaults that drew me to Cmder in the first place eventually led it to be a little more frustrating later on.</li></ul><h2 id="enter-alacritty">Enter Alacritty</h2><p>Alacritty initally made waves on Hacker News back in 2017 for being a fast GPU-accelerated terminal emulator written in Rust. It was fast, but didn't have some basic features like tabs or scrollback. I initially dismissed it since it also did not have Windows support, but I came across it while searching for a Cmder replacement.</p><p>Many of the initial positives for Cmder did not matter to me any more, and Alacritty addressed the negatives too. The minimal configuration Alacritty offers is through a YAML file, but the options are all clear and there are few enough that it is easy to look them up. It feels fast, even when working with files quickly in VIM something that was especially annoying in Cmder. I needed to install Git and OpenSSH anyway for other tools, so it didn't bother me not having it built in. I finally knew enough to set up a Git aware prompt myself.</p><h3 id="configuring-alacritty">Configuring Alacritty</h3><p>By default, Alacritty looks very plain out of the box.</p><figure><img src="https://justjensen.co/content/images/2020/05/Alacritty-Base-Opening.png"><figcaption>Alacritty Defaults</figcaption></figure><p>For a full list of configuration options, see the <a href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/blob/master/alacritty.yml">example configuration file</a>, with all options commented out. For now, creating the config file:</p><pre><code>mkdir $env:APPDATA\alacritty
nvim alacritty.yml</code></pre><p>I started out by setting up the window defaults, fixing the font, and introducing a hint of transparency.</p><pre><code>window:
  title: SuperFun🚄
  dimensions:
    columns: 100
    lines: 30

font:
  normal:
    family: 'Source Code Pro for Powerline
 
background_opacity: 0.95</code></pre><p>I also copied the <code>gruvbox_dark</code> theme colors from the <a href="https://github.com/eendroroy/alacritty-theme">Alacritty Themes GitHub page</a>, since it is the theme I use for all of my other software. </p><p>Already we have an immediate improvement (in my eyes):</p><figure><img src="https://justjensen.co/content/images/2020/05/Alacritty-after-Visual-Configuration.png"><figcaption>Alacritty with Source Code Pro, Transparency, and Gruvbox Dark</figcaption></figure><p>Next, let's introduce a few functional changes to make it easier to use on my laptop:</p><pre><code>selection:
  # When set to `true`, selected text will be copied to the primary clipboard.
  save_to_clipboard: true
  
# Updating to PowerShell 7 (added to my PATH variable as pwsh)
shell:
  program: pwsh

# Paste text with right click, instead of the default middle mouse wheel
# click
mouse_bindings:
  - { mouse: Right, action: PasteSelection }</code></pre><p>And that's it! If all you wanted was a fast terminal emulator, this is pretty much all there is to it. There is some remaining work to do though to make it look especially good and add back in a Git aware prompt.</p><h3 id="powershell-oh-my-posh-and-posh-git">Powershell, Oh-My-Posh and Posh-Git</h3><p>Since Alacritty is just a terminal emulator, it still needs a shell to run inside it. Despite a pretty good experience with Clink in Cmder, I decided it was time to try out PowerShell. Microsoft has released it on MacOS and Linux too now, and honestly, I just felt like trying something new. Furthermore, WSL does not work well on my work computer, and WSL2 is not available on it yet at all. The new Windows Terminal looked interesting, but the Windows Store at work is limited to only a couple apps approved by the IT department, of which it is not one.</p><p>To make PowerShell look a little more attractive, you can install some <a href="https://github.com/powerline/fonts">P</a><a href="https://github.com/powerline/fonts">owerline fonts</a> and <a href="https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh">Oh-My-Posh</a>, a prompt theming engine for PowerShell (it was designed for ConEmu intially, but it works on Alacritty too).</p><pre><code>Install-Module posh-git -Scope CurrentUser
Install-Module oh-my-posh -Scope CurrentUser</code></pre><p>Then, if you add the four lines below to your PowerShell profile, it will auto-import everything as soon as you open Alacritty. Rather than finding the profile file, you can just <code>nvim $PROFILE</code> instead.</p><pre><code>Import-Module posh-git
Import-Module oh-my-posh
Set-Theme Agnoster
$DefaultUser = $Env:UserName # Hide the username, since I only use one account</code></pre><p>I didn't seem to need it, but if you are running the PowerShell Core, you will apparently need this too:</p><pre><code>Install-Module -Name PSReadLine -AllowPrerelease -Scope CurrentUser -Force -SkipPublisherCheck</code></pre><p>So what does this all this work actually result in?</p><figure><img src="https://justjensen.co/content/images/2020/05/Alacritty-with-Oh-My-Posh.png"><figcaption>Alacritty with Oh-My-Posh</figcaption></figure><p>I think it looks good! And more importantly, it is faster to load than Cmder (even with Anaconda and Oh-My-Posh), more responsive, and styled to my own preferences. Hopefully this inspired you to switch up your setup too!</p><p>P.S. You might need to initialize Anaconda in Powershell for environments to work correctly:</p><pre><code>conda init powershell</code></pre><p>Note that this will slow down your PowerShell boot time significantly (about 1.5 seconds for me on Powershell v7.0.1 on my laptop SSD). I have not figured out how to only load it when I run <code>activate base</code> unfortunately.</p>

<h2> Command Line Programs for the Blind </h2>
<h4> by Karl Dahlke </h4>

<h3> Introduction </h3>

Word processors, Internet browsers, and email clients typically present information in two dimensions,
spreading text and icons across the screen.
This interface is remarkably efficient
thanks to the parallel processing capabilities of the retina and the visual cortex.
In fact this screen to brain interface is so efficient,
there is no need to count the bits as they fly by.
Amateur webmasters and professional software developers
routinely exploit this high band width channel, which is almost "too cheap to meter".
Web pages often present reams of irrelevant information
in the form of extraneous links and rarely used buttons and icons.
Carefully crafted applications are a little more organized,
but they still employ toolbars and widgits that clutter the screen.
This ancillary data is quickly tossed aside as your eyes focus on the item of interest.
However, a blind user cannot assimilate this data at a glance, and separate the wheat from the chaff.
He is forced to read every word on the page, using a voice synthesizer or braille display.
These adapters are imperfect at best,
as they ratchet the flow of information down to an agonizing crawl.
By analogy, a high speed cable modem has been replaced with a dial-up connection,
turning a rich multimedia experience into an exercise in frustration and futility.
Is there a practical alternative?
I believe there is, but certain critical applications must be rewritten from the ground up.
To this end, I have developed a combination editor/browser called edbrowse, which is 100% text based.
Output is measured and conserved like a precious commodity
as it passes through the narrow channel of speech or braille.
Edbrowse gives the blind user exactly what he asks for, no more and no less.
Sighted users also find its unique features helpful in certain situations, which will be described below.
This open source program is in the
<a href="http://edbrowse.org/">
public domain</a>,
and is bundled in several Linux distributions.
An early perl version (with limited functionality) runs on virtually any computer.

<p>
This has implications for software development in general.
When a program or utility is "web based",
i.e. accessible through a browser,
with some common sense restrictions on the underlying html and javascript,
it is easily adapted to a wide range of disabilities.
Each user employs the browser that caters to his particular needs and preferences.
The interface is automatically tailored to the individual -
no additional programming required.
The semantics of the data, and its representation on the screen, or in speech,
or on a braille display, have been neatly separated.
Of course this approach doesn't work for all applications,
(a blind user isn't going to play Flight Simulator),
but it can be employed in many situations.
Even a toolkit, such as Microsoft VB, might be enhanced
to create interactive web pages, instead of using the screen and the mouse.
If this project proves feasible,
a wide variety of common VB applications will become accessible over night.
The key is the accessible client, in this case a command line browser,
combined with a suite of streaming applications
that use these adapted clients as front end programs.

</p><p>
The benefits of this approach are not limited to the totally blind.
A color-blind individual might use his browser to change the color of the background,
text, headings, and hyperlinks to improve the contrast,
while A user with low vision might increase the font size.
Disabled users,
and folks who simply prefer their text in a particular font,
are hoping for a software revolution
that sequesters functionality within the application,
and leaves the details of the interface unspecified,
to be determined by the wants and needs of the individual.

</p><h3> The Early Human-Machine Interface </h3>

Today's computer professionals, with laptops in hand, can hardly imagine the awkward interfaces that prior generations had to endure.
When I was a freshman at Michigan State University,
I learned how to use a key punch machine and a card reader;
that was how you "talked" to the computer.
Each punch card represented one line of text,
and a stack of several thousand cards might hold the source code for your master's project.
There was no file server on campus;
you kept your box of cards with you at all times.
And if you ever dropped your box of cards in the snow
while walking from the dorm to the computer center in January,
you were in a world of hurt.
Even an accidental spill from table to floor was cause for consternation,
as you carefully put your cards back in order.
Apparently this scenario was not uncommon,
prompting more than a few students to place sequence numbers on their cards
in the rightmost columns -
columns that were ignored by the computer.
Some people left gaps in these numbers, e.g. counting by tens,
so that additional lines of code could be inserted as necessary.
My roommate, who did not bother to number his cards, always carried them in a sealed cardboard box.
This led to more than a few jokes on my part.
"Quit singing in the shower at 6 A.M., or i'll scatter your box of cards all over the floor."

<p>
Once a student arrived safely at the computer center with cards in hand,
he might make some last minute corrections to his stack,
then feed the cards, at a rate of ten per second, through the card reader.
This created a "batch job", which resulted in a printout some 20 minutes later.
Wait times were highly variable, depending on load,
which is why many students worked at night.
Having placed the cards carefully back in his box,
our weary student anxiously waits for the results of his labors.
Did the program compile?
Did it run?
Was there an error in logic?
Can he turn his printout in for a grade, or is there more work to do?
If anything has to be changed, he goes back to the punch machine,
hammers out new cards, slides them into position,
and walks back to the card reader for another run.
The smallest typo represents another hour's work.
It was not unusual to see bleary-eyed students stumbling back into the dorm at 2 or 3 in the morning,
card box under one arm and a stack of printouts under the other.

</p><p>
Imagine my joy when the University installed interactive teletypes!
These look like electric typewriters, but the keystrokes are transmitted directly to the central computer.
When you hit return, the computer responds, then waits for your next command.
The interface had become a dialog,
which clipped along at 110 bits per second, or 300 bits per second if you glommed onto one of the newer teletypes.
The paper retained a written transcript of the entire session;
your commands and the computer's responses.
These machines are all but forgotten, except for the vestigial letters tty, which are an abbreviation for teletype.
The software that facilitates communication between you and your computer, through the keyboard and screen,
is still called a tty today.
Type `tty' into any Unix or Linux computer, and it will tell you which tty driver you are using,
e.g. /dev/tty1 on console 1.
A large Unix machine can have hundreds of tty drivers, supporting hundreds of simultaneous users.

</p><p>
The clatter of the teletype was an annoyance for most, but it was a blessing for me.
I knew when the computer had responded, and the nature of that response.
If a volunteer reader was not available, and the homework assignment was modest,
I could log onto the system,
type my program into the editor,
compile the program,
and run the executable,
based solely on the clicks of the teletype.
After my roommate read through the printout and verified the results,
I tucked it away in my notebook and turned it in the next day for a grade.
Although I now have a speech synthesizer at hand,
I still miss the audio feedback that was an unintentional feature of the mechanical teletype.
To this end, I modified the Linux tty driver to create similar sounds using the PC speaker.
When the computer sends text to the screen, soft clicking sounds accompany the nonspace characters,
while a longer swoop indicates a new line,
as though the print head was swinging back to the left.
These modules are available from the drivers directory in the following project.

</p><p>
git clone https://github.com/eklhad/acsint

</p><p>
The chirps and clicks are subtle, and are easily ignored by those around me;
yet they form an important part of my audio interface.
Like the systems of yesteryear,
my tty tells me when the computer has responded to my commands,
and the quantity and format of that response,
even before my synthesizer has spoken a word.

</p><p>
This project also contains a linear speech adapter, the only one of its kind.
Like the paper teletype, this adapter retains a log of all tty output,
and allows the user to review that log,
reading the entered commands and the computers responses.
All other adapters,
whether on MS-dos, Windows, Mac-OS, or Linux,
read the words or icons on the screen.
My adapter can read screen memory as well, but it typically runs in linear mode, which is optimal for the command line interface.
This adapter, and various applications such as edbrowse, all work together to present a new
(i.e. old) paradigm,
a paper teletype inside your computer.

</p><p>
Over the next few years, universities around the country
replaced their paper teletypes with cathode ray tube terminals, also known as CRTs.
Trees everywhere heaved a sigh of relief;
yet the interface was still the same.
A user types a command, and the computer responds on the next line.
The dialog continues.

</p><h3> Early Editors and Word Processors </h3>

When I began my career at AT&amp;T Bell Labs,
I learned to use the standard Unix text editor, which is simply called ed.
This is a command line program, consistent with the interface of its day.
If you want to see the seventh line in a file, type 7 and hit return.
To find the line containing the string "xyz", type /xyz/.
Lines can be changed, deleted, moved, or copied using this program,
but you only …</div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>tldr: Demonstrated with interactive visualizations and simulations — over the course of a month, we were able to discover successive new mathematical properties of a “degenerate” hyper-dimensional game of life" to take a “7 dimensions may just barely be possible on a commercial PC, could we ever reach 10 dimensions?” to “10 dimensions is easy enough to be run on any modern browser (<a href="#gol2D">jump</a> <a href="#gol3D">to</a> <a href="#gol4D">spoilers</a> <a href="#golFlat">here</a>), and 60 dimensions can be reached with a compiled language”.</p>
<p>This is a story about breaking a degenerate hyper-dimensional game of life via interactive exploratory visualizations and math!</p>
<p>T’was the night before Thursday, December 17, 2020, the release of <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/17">“Conway Cubes”</a>. It was Day 17 of <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020">Advent of Code 2020</a>, a series of fun little themed coding puzzles building up to Christmas; I always enjoyed these puzzles because they are so self-contained and tidy that they are often <em>open-ended</em> in the interesting ways you can solve them or expand on them (which I’ve written <a href="https://blog.jle.im/entries/series/+advent-of-code.html">many blog posts on</a>).</p>
<p>On the surface, Day 17 seemed to be a straightforward extension of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway’s Game Of Life</a> (“GoL”). GoL is a simulation played out on a 2D grid, where cells are “on” and “off”, and at each step of the simulation the states spread and propagate in interesting ways based on the state of their neighbors (a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton">2D cellular automaton</a>). The twist of the Advent of Code puzzle is it asks what would happen if we played out the rules of GoL in 3D instead, and then 4D.</p>
<p>I submitted my solution on my assigned puzzle input with a naive implementation (placing 66 and 66 on the leaderboards for that day), concluding the “competitive” part. Of course, the real fun always starts after. When discussing with some friends (on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode">subreddit</a> and freenode’s <code>##advent-of-code</code> channel), we started talking about the trade-offs of different implementations and realized that the extra dimensionality was no joke: as you upped the number of dimensions, the number of points you have to consider grow exponentially, and so does the number of neighbors at each point to check. 4D can be solved naively, but anything higher is going to be strained. My naive solution on 6D took three minutes, and 7D in a reasonable amount of time (requiring as much as 612,220,032 points with 2,186 neighbors each) seemed <em>impossible</em> on commercial consumer hardware because of the sheer number of points in 7D space. But I thought…what if a breakthrough in optimization was possible? I set an (arbitrary) personal goal of reaching 10D (3,570,467,226,624 points with 59,048 neighbors each), not knowing if it would ever be possible.</p>
<p>And soon…a breakthrough did come! Someone brought up that if we look at the 3d version, we see there’s actually a <em>mirror symmetry</em>! Because everything starts off on the xy plane, with z=0, the resulting progression must be symmetrical on both sides (positive and negative z).</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://blog.jle.im/img/entries/advent-gol/life3d.gif" title="3D GoL animation demonstrating mirror symmetry by u/ZubSpAcE" alt=""><figcaption>3D GoL animation demonstrating mirror symmetry by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/kfa3nr/2020_day_17_godot_cubes_i_think_i_went_a_bit_too/">u/ZuBsPaCe</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This meant that we only have to simulate the <em>positive</em> points (since the negative points are identical). This saves down the number of points by a factor of two for each extra dimension! Unfortunately, this wouldn’t quite get us to 10D, but the discovery completely changed how we saw this puzzle. With one breakthrough down, we began to believe that there would be more just around the corner, made possible by our problem’s special 2D-slice starting degeneracy.</p>
<p>Such a dream (as posed in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/kfb6zx/day_17_getting_to_t6_at_for_higher_spoilerss/">this reddit thread I started</a>) turned into a month-long ride of breakthrough after breakthrough, exploiting different aspects of this degeneracy. It was a month full of sudden twists and turns and bursts of excitement whenever new innovations came. And in the end, the hopeful question “7D is barely in reach; what if 10D was possible?” turned into “10D in 100ms, 40D in eight minutes…can we do 60D quickly?” This post even includes simulations to prove that we got 10D fast enough to run on easily on any modern browser. The whole journey became an adventure in the power of visualization combined with abstract thinking.</p>
<p>So, let’s take a deep dive — deeper than you probably ever expected to dive into any particular degenerate starting conditions of a hyper-dimensional game of life :D</p>
<p>There will be python code samples here and there, but just for context, my actual solvers I developed along the way were <a href="https://github.com/mstksg/advent-of-code-2020/blob/master/src/AOC/Challenge/Day17.hs">written in Haskell</a>, and all of the solving logic embedded in this post was written in Purescript (<a href="https://github.com/mstksg/inCode/blob/master/app-purescript/Gol.purs">online here</a>) and compiled to Javascript.</p>

</ul>
<p>I recommend trying out some of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Examples_of_patterns">other interesting well-known patterns</a> from 2D GoL, as well! If you find any interesting ones, I would be excited to hear about them!</p>
<p>For fun, here’s a 2D vanilla game of life implementation (for six time steps) to test out your creation. Remember that some starting conditions will putter out in 2D, but expand forever in 3D+ due to the abundance of neighbors.</p>
<div id="gol2D">
<p><strong>Element 2:</strong> 2D Game of Life</p>
<p>Please enable Javascript</p>
</div>
<p>Now that that’s there, let’s start at the beginning: what’s the naive, baseline solution?</p>
<p>A reasonable initial thought would be:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Keep a 2D (or 3D, or 4D, etc.) array of booleans.</li>
<li>At each step:
<ol type="a">
<li>Make a fresh copy of the entire space (<span>\(O(n^d)\)</span>).</li>
<li>Loop over each item in your array (<span>\(O(n^d)\)</span>). Count all of the neighbors (<span>\(O(3^d)\)</span>) that are <code>true</code> (“alive”), and write to the new array based on the rules table of GoL (2 or 3 neighbors for a live cell stays alive, 3 neighbors for a dead cell turns alive).</li>
</ol></li>
<li>You have a new array! Loop again six times.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sounds reasonable enough! This does work for the 2D case pretty well (like in the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/11">Day 11 puzzle</a>). However, there are some clear issues when moving into higher dimensions. The size of your array grows exponentially on your dimension, and so does the number of neighbors you’d have to check. And the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality">curse of dimensionality</a> assures us that more and more of that array would become wasted as the proportion of “on” points shrinks to zero for higher dimensions.</p>
<p>Oh, but what’s that? The percentage of “on” points shrinks to zero for higher dimensions? That actually sounds like something we can use to our <em>advantage</em>! The <em>blessing</em> of dimensionality*, I daresay? Because we know the vast majority of our points will be “off”, there’s another approach:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Keep a <em>set</em> of points that are “on”.</li>
<li>At each step:
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Initialize a dynamic map (key-value store, like a python dict or Counter) of points to integers. This map associates each point to the number of live neighbors it has.</p></li>
<li><p>For each step, iterate over each of your “on” points, expand all of their neighbors <span>\(n_i\)</span> (<span>\(O(3^d)\)</span>), and increment the value associated with <span>\(n_i\)</span> in your dynamic map.</p>
<p>For example, if the point <code>&lt;2,3&gt;</code> is in your set of live points, you would add increment the map’s values at keys <code>&lt;1,2&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;2,2&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;3,2&gt;</code>, etc.: all 8 neighbors of <code>&lt;2,3&gt;</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Collect your new set of “on” points: keep all of the keys in your dynamic map corresponding to live points if their integers are 2 or 3, and keep all of the keys in your dynamic map corresponding to dead points if their integers are 3.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li>You have a new set! Loop again six times!</li>
</ol>
<p>(I discuss this algorithm much more deeply with actual code in <a href="https://github.com/mstksg/advent-of-code-2020/blob/master/reflections-out/day17.md">my solutions write-up in my Advent of Code reflections journal</a>)</p>
<p>This method nets us a huge advantage because we now only have to loop over the number of items that we know are alive, and any points away from our set of alive points can be properly ignored. This narrows down our huge iteration space, and the benefits compound with every dimension due to the blessing of dimensionality.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Both methods can be generalized to any dimension; in this second method, this just means a different sized tuple/vector in your set of alive points (<code>[x,y]</code> vs.&nbsp;<code>[x,y,z]</code>). One extra concern, though, is that you need to think through generating all <span>\(3^d-1\)</span> neighbors: that’s going to come down to a d-ary <a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-cross">cartesian product</a> of <code>[-1,0,1]</code> to itself.</p>
<p>Here’s a python implementation of the set-based method, using a nice trick I learned from <a href="https://twitter.com/phaazon_">phaazon</a> and <a href="https://github.com/glguy">glguy</a> to get the right neighbors by doing a cartesian product against <code>[0,-1,1]</code> instead of <code>[-1,0,1]</code>, which leaves the first item as the <code>&lt;0,0&gt;</code> “original point” we want to exclude.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

February 11, 2021 | https://blog.repl.it/alwayson | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.repl.it/alwayson">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Today we're excited to announce that Always On repls are available to all hackers! Anyone with <a href="https://repl.it/pricing">Hacker plan</a> can choose up to 5 repls and keep them running all the time. With Always On, you can for example spin up and host an app like a Discord bot in 30 seconds:</p>

<p>As a reminder, Replit gives you most of what you need to rapidly build and ship apps in the cloud -- at lightning speed:</p>
<ul>
<li>A blazing fast <a href="https://repl.it/site/ide">online IDE</a></li>
<li>Automatic <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/packages">Package Management</a></li>
<li>Automatic <a href="https://repl.it/site/hosting">hosting</a></li>
<li>Automatic <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/web-hosting">SSL/HTTPS</a></li>
<li>Domain <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/web-hosting">linking</a></li>
<li>A simple and fast <a href="https://docs.repl.it/misc/database">Database for persistence</a></li>
<li>A secure way to <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/secret-keys">store secrets</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The one missing piece was a reliable way to keep your apps from going to sleep. Always On means we host your code and keep it running even if you close your Replit browser tab.</p>
<p>Prior to Always On, you might have noticed that when your repl is inactive for a little while it automatically goes to sleep. Because Replit wants to give everyone in the world the ability to code and access cloud computing, this has been a super important cost-saving mechanism and vital to the design of our infrastructure (you can read about the technical details <a href="https://blog.repl.it/killing-containers-at-scale">here</a>). As much as we'd like it to, hosting 100 million repls all the time for free just wouldn't work out. Instead we've invested in getting really fast at starting repls when they're needed and pretending like they were up the whole time. It has served us and our users well, but doesn't work in every use-case. </p>

<p>Some repls expect to be running all the time (things like cron or Discord bots), and some apps can't afford to drop some requests as the repl wakes up. As our users built increasingly ambitious apps, the need for a repl to keep running all the time has become apparent. With Always On your repl will function mostly like before, but now it won't stop running when you close the workspace.</p>
<p>Always On repls can be incredibly useful for a variety of programs and unlocks many long-requested features. The most obvious and commonly requested is for web servers to stay up. If you're tired of waiting for your webserver to wake up every time you visit, Always On is a great way to fix that. But Always On isn't just for web repls, regular old repls work too! If you have a cron job you'd like to run on a schedule, Always On makes it super easy. Discord bots, Slack bots, and other chat bots with a persistent outbound connection are another great use for Always On. And if you have a workload that's taking a long time (like say scraping a site), you can Always On the repl and go one with your life.</p>
<p>Of course, it's worth noting a few limitations of Always On </p>
<ul>
<li>Your repl will be occasionally restarted as it is migrated between physical servers.</li>
<li>Changes your program makes to the filesystem won't persist, so we suggest you use <a href="https://blog.repl.it/database">Replit Database</a> rather than, for example, writing to text files.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/database/database1.gif" alt="Database"></p>
<p>We also want to make it clear that the use of pinging services will continue to work just as before.</p>
<p>Happy coding! If you create something interesting or novel using this technology then make sure to <a href="https://repl.it/talk/ask/Share-your-Always-On-repls/120784">share it with us</a>.</p>
<h2 id="one-more-thing">One more thing</h2>
<p>Oh one more thing. right now replit doesn't differentiate between dev and prod apps. We're going to fix that too, and it will be epic. Stay tuned.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Class destructors have painful <a href="#The-trouble-with-class-destructors">limitations</a> when called by the GC.
</p>
<p>But there is a way to make a class holding a resource that:
</p>
<ul>
<li>works with scoped ownership (<code>std.typecons.RefCounted</code>, <code>std.typecons.Unique</code>, <code>std.typecons.Scoped</code>)
</li>
<li>works with manual release (<code>object.destroy</code>)
</li>
<li>warns when the GC call the destructor and then release the resource, which is <em>coincidental correctness</em> and dangerous to rely on.
</li>
</ul>
<p>The general idea behind the <strong>GC-proof resource class</strong> is to check why the destructor was called and act accordingly.
</p>
<pre><code>class MyGCProofResource
{
    void* handle;

    this()
    {
        // acquire resource
        handle = create_handle();
    }

    ~this()
    {
        // Important bit.
        // Here we verify that the GC isn't responsible
        // for releasing the resource, which is dangerous.
        import core.memory;
        assert(!GC.inFinalizer, "Error: clean-up of MyGCProofResource incorrectly" ~
                                " depends on destructors called by the GC");

        // release resource
        free_handle(handle);
    }
}
</code></pre><p>You'll get a clear message whenever you rely on the GC to release resources.
</p>
<p>This idiom was first introduced in the <a href="https://github.com/d-gamedev-team/gfm">GFM</a> library.
</p>
</div><div><p><a href="#Don't-use-@property">Link
</a></p>
<p>The current agreement on best practices with regards to <code>@property</code> is to <strong>not use it.</strong>
</p>
<p><code>@property</code> does very little and you can always avoid it.

<p>DUB is an essential piece of the modern D language experience. <strong>However,</strong> that experience doesn't include <em>"Running unit tests with optimizations"</em> by default.

</a></p>
<p>It just happens that in D you can't use <code>new</code> to get a pointer to a newly allocated static array.
</p>
<pre><code>void main()
{
    alias T = int[4];

    // This line does not compile!
    // Error: new can only create structs, dynamic arrays or class objects, not int[4]'s
    auto t = new T; 
}
</code></pre><p><em>"You can only call new with structs, dynamic arrays, and class objects"</em> says the compiler.
</p>
<p><strong>Unrelated:</strong> actually the compiler is lying a bit, since it is possible to allocate a single (builtin type) value on the heap:
</p>
<pre><code>void main()
{
    int* p = new int;  // Works
}
</code></pre><p>But this can't be with static arrays, despite them being <a href="#Static-arrays-are-value-types">value types</a>. Doesn't that sound like an inconsistency? Something that would have to be <strong>explained.</strong>
</p>
<h2 id="why"> Why?</h2>
<p>The reasoning for <code>new</code> and static arrays was probably that you rarely really want to allocate a static array on the heap; it could just as well be a slice.
</p>
<p><strong>So there is no syntax to do this</strong>.<br>When you do write <code>new int[4]</code> this will instead return an <code>int[]</code> <em>slice</em> with a length of 4, which adds the benefits of holding a length.
</p>
<pre><code>writeln(typeof(new int[4]).stringof); // output: "int[]"

auto arr = new int[4];
writeln(arr.length); // output: "4"
arr ~= 42;
writeln(arr.length); // output: "5"
</code></pre><p>So far, so good. 
</p>
<p><a href="#Type-qualifiers-and-slices-creation">It gets weirder</a> whenever <code>shared</code>, <code>const</code> and <code>immutable</code> get introduced...
</p>
<h2 id="do-it-anyway"> Do it anyway</h2>
<p>If for some reason you really need a <em>static</em> array allocated on the heap instead of a slice, you can do it anyway by using <code>std.experimental.allocator</code> (or its DUB equivalent <a href="https://code.dlang.org/packages/stdx-allocator">stdx-allocator</a>):
</p>
<pre><code>import std.experimental.allocator;

void main()
{
    alias T = int[4];

 // T* t = new T;                 // Won't work.
    T* t = theAllocator.make!T;   // Fine!
    assert((*t).length == 4);     // Safe too.

    (*t)[1] = 42;                 // Needs pointer dereference and parentheses before use.
    assert(*t == [0, 42, 0, 0]);  // Features default initialization.
    
 // (*t) ~= 43; // Error: cannot append type int to type int[4]

<p>A <em>Voldemort type</em> is simply a type that can't be named by the user.
</p>
<h2 id="an-example-from-ae-utils-graphics"> An example from <code>ae.utils.graphics</code>:</h2>
<pre><code>template procedural(alias formula)
{
    alias fun = binaryFun!(formula, "x", "y");
    alias Color = typeof(fun(0, 0));

    // Returning auto is necessary here.
    // Procedural can't be named outside of the procedural function.
    auto procedural()
    {
        struct Procedural
        {
            auto ref Color opIndex(int x, int y)

                return fun(x, y);
            }
        }
        return Procedural();
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Outside of the <code>procedural</code> function of this <a href="#Eponymous-templates">eponymous template</a>, there is no way to name <code>Procedural</code>. Therefore, <strong>Voldemort types can only be passed around in auto variables or auto returns.</strong>
</p>
<h2 id="why"> Why?</h2>
<p>Hiding information about types. Because the user can't name or instantiate Voldemort types at will, expressions in a Voldemort lazy computation chain can change types without changing user code.
</p>
<p>Voldemort types were promoted and named by Andrei Alexandrescu. They are typically used in chains of lazy computations, like ranges.

<p>When a slice is created with <code>new</code> and a type qualifier, the qualifier applies to <em>pointed elements</em> <br>instead of the whole slice as would be expected.

void main(string[] args)
{
    // Output: "const(int)[]"

<p><em>(Note: on this whole website, with "static arrays" we mean fixed-size arrays, not arrays declared with</em> <code>static</code><em>).</em>

</p>
<h2 id="static-arrays-convert-implicitely-into-slices"> Static arrays convert implicitely into slices!</h2>
<p>To pass static arrays by reference, either write a function taking a slice or use ref.

While coding with Elixir and using ExUnit to write tests nowadays, I caught myself finding ways to nest RSpec "context" blocks inside each other. Let's look at a simple example: you wanted to build a chef robot to prepare dinners based on the leftover food in your fridge. Depending on what's available in your kitchen, it'll choose how to prepare the appropriate dishes.</p><h3>Nested contexts in RSpec</h3><p>This is how I would write TDD tests for this scenario in RSpec.</p></div><div><div><pre data-enlighter-language="ruby">ruby
  describe "make_dish_from_left_over" do
    context "with dishes that are served cold" do
    # before: set up cold dishes
    # ...
    # end
    context "seasoning available" do
      # before: set up seasoning
      # ...
      # end
      expect(add_seasoning).to be_truthy
    end
    context "extra protein available" do
      # before: set up extra protein
      # ...
      # end
      expect(add_protein).to be_truthy
    end

  context "with dishes that are served hot" do
      # before: set up hot dishes

    context "microwave available" do
      # before: set up microwave

end
</pre></div></div><p>As you can imagine, if these tests are filled up and more nested contexts are added, such as microwave settings depending on size of dishes, stove top heat amount and time, etc... they will eventually become too long and too complicated to read and follow. This readability problem is then compounded for other developers who haven't worked on this area of the robot. But there's another issue in moving from Ruby to Elixir; there is no way to write nested "contexts" like this in Elixir's ExUnit — and there is a good reason for that.</p><div data-inherit-lp-settings="1" data-css="tve-u-1778e041318" tcb-template-name="Quote 05" tcb-template-id="60950" data-keep-css_id="1"><div data-css="tve-u-1778e0414c4"><div data-css="tve-u-1778e04131b"><div data-css="tve-u-1778e04131d"><div data-css="tve-u-1778e04131e"><div data-css="tve-u-1778e04131f"><div data-css="tve-u-1778e041320"><div><p><span><img alt="" data-id="60893" width="99" data-init-width="175" height="77" data-init-height="137" title="quotation_mark_afs" loading="lazy" src="https://vendorful.com/wp-content/uploads/tcb_content_templates/images/quotation_mark_afs.png" data-src="//vendorful.com/wp-content/uploads/tcb_content_templates/images/quotation_mark_afs.png" data-width="99" data-height="77" ml-d="0" data-css="tve-u-1778e041322"></span></p></div></div></div></div><p data-css="tve-u-1778e04132a">By forbidding hierarchies in favor of named setups, it is straightforward for the developer to glance at each describe block and know exactly the setup steps involved.</p></div></div></div></div><div><p>With ExUnit, what you can (and will want to) do is to use named setups.</p><h3>What are named setups?</h3><p>If you haven't come across this, it's not surprising. The documentation for named setups in ExUnit is <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/ex_unit/master/ExUnit.Case.html#describe/2" target="_blank">kind of buried</a> somewhere in the middle of ExUnit.Case docs. Named setups are simply configurations of tests used to put together test data for the tests that follow. Each setup is actually just a function that configures the test data and returns the variables to be used in the tests themselves. If you are familiar with writing tests in ExUnit then these configuration functions are exactly the setup blocks. For example:</p></div><div><div><pre data-enlighter-language="ruby">elixir
defp setup_cold_dishes(context) do
temp = 35
size = if context.size, do: size, else: :small
dish = set_temperature(temp)
|&gt; set_size(size)
|&gt; set_time_in_fridge(:15_hours)
|&gt; build_dish


%{temp: temp, size: size, cold_dish: dish}
end
</pre></div></div><p>Note that a <span data-css="tve-u-1778e57900e">context</span> variable is passed in this setup function so that the previous configurations can be accessed in this setup as <span data-css="tve-u-1778e57c597">context.size</span> in this case. You can also grab the <span data-css="tve-u-1778e57ea83">size</span> variable out of this <span data-css="tve-u-1778e580e83">context</span> right in the function signature like so:</p><div><div><pre data-enlighter-language="ruby">elixir
defp setup_cold_dish(%{size: size}) do
end</pre></div></div><p><h3>How do I use it in the tests?</h3></p><div><div><pre data-enlighter-language="ruby">elixir
describe "make COLD dishes from left over" do
  setup [:setup_cold_dish]
  it "", context do
    ...
  end
end
</pre></div></div><p>Let's make it even nicer by combining the condition "seasoning available":</p><div><div><pre data-enlighter-language="ruby">elixir

end
</pre></div></div><p><h3>Passing variables to other setup functions</h3></p><p>Note that if you have multiple setup functions in sequence like this, <strong>the latter ones on the right can read the "context" variables returned by the previous ones on the left</strong>. So <span data-css="tve-u-1778e46a275">:set_seasoning</span> can actually access <span data-css="tve-u-1778e4728d6">temp</span>, <span data-css="tve-u-1778e470109">size</span> and <span data-css="tve-u-1778e474efb">cold_dish</span> variables from <span data-css="tve-u-1778e478abc">:setup_cold_dish</span>, but we just not doing anything with them in this scenario.</p><div><h4>Putting the pieces together</h4><p>Now let's write the whole thing with combined conditions!</p></div><div><div><pre data-enlighter-language="ruby">elixir

And the beauty of it is that there are no more nested context/describe blocks, no more mazes but with shared setup functions and cleaner code!</p><p>Although the above example scenario is &nbsp;very simple to demonstrate the basic functionalities of named setups, I hope you can build on these ideas and apply them to your test suite when you need it.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

    <div id="post-body">
        <p>&lt;rant&gt;Two years ago I sat in on a security meeting. The subject was protecting the code and associated websites from attack.</p><p>"I'd just attack the npm packaging system, introducing subtle changes in several that would work together to do whatever I wanted."</p><p>All I got was blank stares, and this was from professionals. From <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/researcher-hacks-over-35-tech-firms-in-novel-supply-chain-attack">this week's reading</a>:</p><blockquote>Unlike <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malicious-npm-project-steals-discord-accounts-browser-info/">traditional typosquatting attacks</a> that rely on social engineering tactics or the victim misspelling a package name, this particular supply chain attack is more sophisticated as it needed no action by the victim, who automatically received the malicious packages.<p>This is because the attack leveraged a unique design flaw of the open-source ecosystems called <strong>dependency confusion.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Even using things like Test-Driven Development, programmers can only reason about a small part of the code in front of him in the IDE. (In fact, one of the reasons TDD is so successful is because programmers have no idea at how much they suck at actually understanding what they're doing).</p><p>From a recent study:</p><figure><img src="https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/2021/02/EsXlJyCXYAAD9x7.png" alt="" srcset="https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/EsXlJyCXYAAD9x7.png 600w, https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/EsXlJyCXYAAD9x7.png 1000w, https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/EsXlJyCXYAAD9x7.png 1600w, https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/2021/02/EsXlJyCXYAAD9x7.png 1890w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Here's the takeaway graphic:</p><figure><img src="https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/2021/02/2021-02-11_9-41-46.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/2021-02-11_9-41-46.jpg 600w, https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/2021/02/2021-02-11_9-41-46.jpg 678w"></figure><p>Note: this result is seeking out a mean, regular coders writing regular code. Your mileage may vary.</p><p>Why is this? Let's take two code samples:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>echo Hello World
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>#include &lt;cstdio&gt;

int main()
{
    printf("hello from %s!\n", "HelloWorld");
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>In the first example, how many symbols is the programmer manipulating to reach their goal? Only one, "echo" In the second example, how many symbols are being manipulated?</p><p>I counted seven, but I wasn't trying to be strict.</p><p>What do these seven involve? There's namespaces, libraries, standard function signatures, string substitution, OS return values, and so on.</p><p>Do any of these matter to the new C# programmer? Of course not! That's why it's called "Hello World". You're supposed to be able to type in a few symbols and start doing something useful right away.</p><p>The waters get murky very quickly after that. Let's say your boss sends you an email:</p><p>"Jenkins, add the cover sheet to all of those TPS reports"</p><p>Something goes wrong. The boss is unhappy. You two have a conversation about what you did that was mistaken.</p><p>Suppose instead you're looking at the following code:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>WorkingStack.Reports.AddSheet(cover);
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The boss is mad because it's not working right.</p><p>You can certainly go into the boss's office and have that same conversation, just this time over code instead of an email. <em>In fact, that's what you have to do</em>. Without a bunch more source code, what the hell does that C# code do, anyway? You don't know. It says it does the same thing as the boss wanted, but for all you know it's mailing off your tax returns to Russian hackers.</p><p>Most of modern programming is spent creating and consuming fake abstractions that are much more leaky and buggy than we'd like admit. In fact, it's grown far, far beyond our ability to reason about. It's magic. We spend a lot of time pretending that this isn't the case, then cursing when reality rears its ugly head again.</p><p>When I was writing <a href="https://leanpub.com/info-ops2">my second book</a>, I had to address this problem because reasoning about code and controlling complexity is the number one problem in software development today. It's the reason we have buildings full of hundreds of developers wasting a lot of time and money. Our incentives are wrong.</p><p>The best thing to look for in any professional, doctor, lawyer, coder, etc is their ability to not engage with a problem, instead solving it in a simple and non-intrusive way. The worst behavior from professionals are the folks who are going to do a lot of work no matter what. These guys look busy, and they’re deep in a bunch of technically wonky stuff that nobody understands, so naturally they look like they know what they’re doing and are doing a good job. The guy who shows up in flip-flops and after a five-minute conversation solves your problem? He’s just some smart eleck showman, probably a con man.</p><p>We don’t teach coders the one skill they need most of all: adding incremental complexity as-needed. Nobody talks about choosing what to add and why. Nobody talks about ways to understand you’ve gone too far (except for a few folks like me. Apologies for the shameless plug.)</p><p>For some odd reason, discussions on frameworks and complexity always devolve into some version of “Dang kids!” vs. “Talentless luddite!” As many people have pointed out, not only do we not teach or talk about incremental complexity, if you don’t have the appropriate buzzwords in your CV, you don’t get hired. So BigCorps naturally end up with scads of people who did well on scads of tech that somebody decide they had to use/learn but nobody very good at actually making things happen.</p><p>This can't continue, and I want to do my part in making it end. The answer I came up is something I call it <strong>Code Cognitive Load (CCL)</strong>. It's the amount of risk you take on as a programmer looking at any piece of code to manipulate it, whether coding fresh or doing maintenance on existing code.</p><ol><li>It's scoped first by method/function and then by compilation unit. There's no other scoping (namespace, class, module, etc.)</li><li>To compute, you add up four things: symbols you are required to look at to do your work, exceptions that using those symbols may throw, &nbsp;any editable code underneath that you may have to read or write for those symbols to work, and exceptions that code may throw</li></ol><p>You can see for the first Hello World example, there's only one symbol, echo, and there's only one general type of exception, and that's related to system resources. For the second example, the count easily goes into the dozens.</p><p>Why is this related to the security problem I led off with? Because if you have code you can't reason about, you don't just have a risk for bugs, it's a security risk too. The code doesn't care whether it's busy screwing up your beautiful solution or hacking your local network. You can't reason about it. Period. That's the problem. It's doing whatever it's coded to do.</p><p>Do npm packages count as "editable code underneath that I have to read or write for these symbols to work"? Sure, if you're downloading code and compiling it, you may have to edit it. It's a risk. If you're just hotlinking to a dll or something, that's different. If you're using precompiled code, whatever you've got, you've got. It may be buggy as hell and it may do nasty things that make you sad and drink by yourself late at night, but it's not a complexity issue, it's some other kind of issue, security, performance, and so on. Don't confuse them. You address and work with the problems of that precompiled library in a totally different way than you would with code you may one day have to plow through.</p><p>Code Cogntivie Load (CCL) is not a good/bad metric. It's a measure of the risk in complexity you're assuming to do whatever work you have to do. Some problems may naturally require a great deal of complexity risk. Others not so much. That's your call, not mine.</p><p>The point is that you're measuring it, instead of just ignoring it until something goes wrong. Is your solution doing mostly the same thing but your CCL is going through the roof? You're most likely doing something wrong, since your code's value is staying the same while your coding risk is dramatically increasing. </p><p>There's no way of knowing whether code is appropriately complex or not, but we can (and should) measure how much <em>complexity risk</em> we're taking on ourselves and our downstream maintenance workers.</p><p>This will change the way you code and the way you think about coding. Good. Looking at the software landscape today, things need changing.</p><p>&lt;/rant&gt;</p>    </div>

                <p>Let us assume for the sake of the argument that software quality matters. There are many ingredients to software quality, of which one must be the care that every programmer devotes to the job. The Personal Software Process, developed by Watts Humphrey in the 1990s [1], prescribes a discipline that software developers should apply to produce good software and improve their professional ability over their careers. It has enjoyed moderate success but was never a mass movement and rarely gets mentioned nowadays; few software developers, in my experience, even know the name. Those who do often think of it as passé, a touching memory from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990s" target="blog_illustrations"><span>era </span></a>of Monica Lewinsky and the Roseanne show.</p>
<p>Once cleaned of a few obsolete elements, PSP deserves to be known and applied.</p>
<p>PSP came out of Watts Humphrey’s earlier work on the Capability Maturity Model (see my earlier article on this blog, <a href="https://bertrandmeyer.com/2013/05/12/what-is-wrong-with-cmmi/" target="blog_illustrations"><i><span>What is wrong with CMMI</span></i></a>), a collection of recommended practices and assessment criteria for software processes, originally developed in the mid-eighties for the U.S. military contractor community but soon thereafter embraced by software outsourcing companies (initially, Indian ones) and later by other industries. Responding to complaints that CMM/CMMI, focused on processes in large companies, ignored the needs of smaller ones, and lacked individual guidance for developers, Humphrey developed TSP, the Team Software Process, and PSP.</p>
<p>The most visible part of PSP is a six-step process pictured in the middle of this diagram:<br>
<a href="https://bertrandmeyer.com/wp-content/upLoads/cmmi.jpg"><img src="https://bertrandmeyer.com/wp-content/upLoads/cmmi.jpg" alt="cmmi" width="506" height="344" srcset="https://bertrandmeyer.com/wp-content/upLoads/cmmi.jpg 987w, https://bertrandmeyer.com/wp-content/upLoads/cmmi-150x102.jpg 150w, https://bertrandmeyer.com/wp-content/upLoads/cmmi-500x339.jpg 500w, https://bertrandmeyer.com/wp-content/upLoads/cmmi-768x521.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px"></a></p>
<p>The most visible and also the most corny. Who today wants to promise always to follow such a strict sequence of steps? Always to write the code for a module in full before compiling it? (Notice there is no backward arrow, the process is sequential.) Always to test at the end only? Come on. This is the third decade of the 21st century.</p>
<p>Today we compile as we code, using the development environment (IDE) as a brilliant tool to check everything we do or plan to do. For my part, whenever I am writing code and have not compiled my current draft for more than a few minutes I start feeling like an addict in need of a fix; my fix is the Compile button of EiffelStudio. At some eventual stage the compiler becomes a tool to generate excutable code, but long before that it has been my friend, coach, mentor, and doppelgänger, helping me get things (types, null references, inheritance…) right and gently chiding me when I wander off the rails.</p>
<p>As to tests, even if you do not buy into the full dogma of Test-Driven Development (I don’t), they get written and exercised right from the start, as you are writing the code, not afterwards. Compile all the time, test all the time.</p>
<p>It’s not just that a process such as the above ignores the contributions of agile methods, which are largely posterior to PSP. As analyzed in [2], agile is a curious mix of good ideas and a few horrendous ones. But among its durable contributions is the realization that development must be incremental, not a strict succession of separate activities.</p>
<p>This old-style flavor or PSP is probably the reason why it has fallen out of favor. But (like the agile rejection of upfront lifecycle activities) such a reaction is a case of criticism gone too far, ignoring the truly beneficial contributions. Ignore PSP’s outmoded sequence of activities and you will find that PSP’s core message is as relevant today as it ever was. That message is: we should learn from the practices of traditional engineers and apply a strict professional discipline. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep a log of all activities. (See “Logs” in the above figure.) Engineers are taught to record everything they do; many programmers don’t bother. This practice, however, is essential to self-improvement.</li>
<li>Keep measurements of everything you do. (There are lots of things to measure, from hours spent on every kind of task to bugs found, time to fix them etc.)</li>
<li>Estimate and plan your work.</li>
<li>Clearly define commitments, and meet them.</li>
<li>Resist pressure to make unreasonable commitments (something that agilists approach also emphasize).</li>
<li>Understand your current performance.</li>
<li>Understand your programming style and how it affects various measures. (As an example, code size, as a function of the number of routines, depends on whether you are more concise or more verbose in style).</li>
<li>Continually improve your expertise as a professional.</li>
</ul>
<p>PSP does not limit itself to such exhortations but gives concrete tools to apply the principles, with a view to: measuring, tracking and analyzing your work; learning from your performance variations; and incorporating the lessons learned into your professional practices. On the topic of measurement, for example, PSP includes precise guidelines on what to measure and how to measure it, and how to rely on proxies for quantities that are hard to assess directly. On this last point, PSP includes PROBE (PROxy-Based Estimating, you cannot have a method coming out of the world of US government organizations without cringeworthy acronyms), a general framework for estimating size and resource parameters from directly measurable proxies.</p>
<p>This is what PSP is about: a discipline of personal productivity and growth, emphasizing personal discipline, tracking and constant improvement. It is not hard to learn; a technical report by Humphrey available online [3] provides a sufficient basis to understand the concepts and start a process of self-improvement.</p>
<p>Watts Humphrey himself, as all who had the privilege to meet him can testify, was a model of seriousness and professionalism, the quintessential engineer. (I also remember him as the author of what may be the best pun I ever heard — ask me sometime.) PSP directly reflects these qualities and — ignoring its visible but in the end unimportant remnants from outdated technical choices — should be part of every software engineering curriculum and every software engineer’s collection of fundamental practices.</p>

My only contribution is formatting. </em></p><p>2020 Q4 Letter</p><p>Dear Partner,</p><p>Our thesis at Oakmaha Capital is to be as transparent as possible. I am deeply disappointed in the performance of our fund this past quarter, which we believe was largely driven by poor investor decisions. But I believe there is reason for optimism.</p><p>The market has clearly been irrational. We are on the edge of a great financial bubble, but we are also on the edge of great economic growth. The investment team is focused on the long-term. That is to say, the short-term market will eventually go down and the value of the stock will rise in tandem with the value of the business. After all, market performance over a long period of time is the best predictor of future returns. We don’t have much in the way of evidence for these views.&nbsp;</p><p>When we asked our partner to describe the benefits of having a large, well-managed private firm owned by his or her own parents, his reply was, “I feel like I’ve got the best part of half a dozen candy bar wrappers on the desk at the same time.” We would agree. &nbsp;</p><p>I know that there are a million and a half words that appear in these letters. They are for the most part irrelevant. Our letter will include detailed notes on the investment method, our holding balance—whether it is gold or bonds, whatever you want. I am going to describe our approach to investing.</p><p>OUR INVESTMENT APPROACH</p><p>It is simply my duty to maximize the portfolio over the long term.&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Buy things at a discount</p></li><li><p>Invest in companies if they feel like they are worth investing in</p></li><li><p>Profitable for several years</p></li><li><p>A large margin of safety</p></li><li><p>Our portfolio is very concentrated</p></li><li><p>Companies with pricing power</p></li></ul><p>OUR TOP 5 POSITIONS</p><p>Our portfolio is comprised of (i) positions that are likely to trade at or below our estimated returns over the next few years (ii) and businesses that are under sustained market pressure.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Cisco</strong>: has had a lot of bad news this year, most notably the FCC’s net neutrality rules. The company is currently running one of the most expensive and inefficient competitively-minded businesses in the world. This remains our largest holding. We’ve been patiently adding our capital to this thesis as this position represents a significant drag on the returns of our funds.</p></li><li><p><strong>Vladiad</strong>: is a Czech company that grows about €400 annually from scratch but also generates €30m in revenues from its software. Under the current CEO, the company will continue to generate an operating margin improvement of +4%. We estimate it can achieve EBITDA margins closer to 20% this year. This will create a virtuous cycle that will improve the overall business as inventory reduces costs and that will increase the value of the remaining inventory as economies of scale increase with scale and as economies of scale with inventory become ever greater.</p></li><li><p><strong>Global Dairy King</strong>: is well positioned for continued growth in the future. GM has a solid pipeline of incremental product additions, a mid-sized market, highly repeatable product line, and a long-term track record. We think this is a very well-capitalized company that should grow for several years. With the dividend on a 5%+ cash basis paying $5-6 million dollar basis basis basis basis</p></li><li><p><strong>Microsoft</strong>: has been selling shares since late 2008, but in June of last year the company announced a turnaround plan. In April of this year the company announced a $10 million buyback, which has since been completed. If one considers the company’s 10+ years of operating in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and Europe, it’s clear that Microsoft has not been evolving its software. That being said, it seems clear that Microsoft is in the process of taking over a large amount of U.S. software.</p></li><li><p>One of our investments is in a company that is not yet regulated, and the company is selling securities to the public. This is a very unusual situation, and we are concerned that the government may not be able to act quickly. <em>You would see how low I am willing to go to make an investment</em>.</p></li></ul><p>I continue to believe the possibility that some of the businesses we own have significant potential for eventual collapse.&nbsp;</p><p>ON RISK MANAGING RISK</p><p>“How do you build a business that is not regulated?” The answer is fourfold. “The first question I think people often have when they think about “regulating” is “how do you manage the risk?” When you think about the risks that we are taking, the answer is always “regulating.” I think we are in very good position to manage them. Our investments are made with risk in mind. So, what is the hidden risk? A lot of people think that even the best investment decisions are not worth betting on, because that is just gambling. But if we are deliberately not taking the risk, then surely the investment returns will be better than people think? The answer is that the hidden risk is that it is not that hard to get in the first place.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>We have drilled our toes into this problem a number of times, but it is hard to believe that the American Society of National Geographical Geographers has not warned us about the dangers of over-penetrating. But I don’t think there is a single clue about the dangers we are taking, and we have been very conscious in the past that we are not taking it too seriously. &nbsp;</p><p>ON CORONAVIRUS</p><p>Coronavirus is a very serious virus, and it is everywhere we look. It is especially prevalent in developing countries, particularly in developed markets. In the developed world, it is in decline. Unfortunately, the private equity funds that own the companies that carry out the largest portion of infectious disease testing are not equipped to deal with this virus. Not equipped at all. Pre-emptive measures may be necessary in the near term, but they are not required to protect investors against exposure to pandemics. The pandemic has limited the fund’s ability to eliminate the virus. The fund’s exposure to the virus is limited to limited partners.</p><p>Hey, it’s an interesting situation.</p><p>PERSONAL UPDATES</p><p>In the summer I spend the rest of the year in Mexico, visiting the countryside and hunting. On the other hand, in the winter I spend the rest of the year traveling. Therefore, in the middle of this year (in autumn) we spend the rest of our years in the middle of the year, and so forth. And we are all aware that it is not always easy to spend eight months in a row – in fact, it is more difficult to spend more, but it is also possible to lose track of time. In either case, the situation is unsustainable.&nbsp;</p><p>For the next quarter I was asked to speak to my wife, for a simple reason - one of us had written so many letters. So it worked out that the only way we could have communicated with my wife was in the letter. It has been a lot of conversations. The question is, do we have the time? I was not present. My wife never showed up for me. I was able to take her to the coffee shop and ask her to come over. By now one assumes a lot.</p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>So, basically, my life savings are invested in companies that are unlikely to survive a recession.</p><p>Thank you from the bottom of my heart.</p><p>DISCLAIMER</p><p>THE SOFTWARE SHALL GO EATISHLY INACCURATE WITH ANY PURCHASE OR DISCLOSURE OF PURCHASE.&nbsp; THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE OBJECTIVE TO AN SUBSCRIPTION OR AN OFFER TO SELL IN ANY MANNER. THAT JURISDICTION IS FINAL AND CONFIDENTIAL AND THERE CAN BE NO GUARANTEE THAT AN INVESTMENT&nbsp; IN THE SAME WILL BE INVESTED.&nbsp; AN INVESTMENT IN THE SOURCE MARKETS IS NOT INDICATIVE OF LOWER THAN 10% AND SHOULD NOT BE UNARISED IN ANY ACCORDANCE WITH REGARD TO SOURCE MARKETS OR ANY EQUITY MATTER. BEFORE MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION, AN INVESTOR SHOULD CONSIDER THE SECURITIES’ INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES, RISKS, CHARGES AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING THE EXPECTED RETURN OF THE INVESTMENT, THE SIZE AND&nbsp; DURATION OF THE INVESTMENT, THE SIZE OF THE INVESTMENT TO BE MADE AND THE ASSOCIATED EXPECTED&nbsp; FEES AND EXPENSES.&nbsp; INVESTORS SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER, WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF A LICENSED INVESTMENT ANALYST, WHETHER THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES&nbsp; PROVIDED COMPLY WITH ALL FEDERAL, STATE AND TERRITORY LAWS AND REGULATIONS.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

                    <p>Much has been covered about developer salaries based on coding language, location, job title, and so on. However, little has been done to chart the rise and fall of developer salaries over the years.</p><p>Tracing developer salaries over the last 20 years was an interesting endeavor. Researching the topic meant changing the language I used to search for data. <br>Back in the early 2000s, tech and software were referred to as “Information Technology” (IT) or “Information and Communications Technology” (ICT), developers were still referred to as “IT workers” and little was mentioned about the many specialized roles we have today.</p><p>To go back in time, I mainly referred to data published by the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/tables.htm">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> as they offered the most comprehensive year on year data. I looked at data from alternate years, from 2001 to 2019.</p><h2 id="starting-in-the-year-2000">Starting in the year 2000</h2><p>At the turn of the century, <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2000/07/21/career/q_degreecompsci/">CNN Money</a> reported that the average starting salary for an entry-level computer programmer was $40,800.</p><p>Fresh graduates were also paid differently based on the degrees they held:</p><ul><li>Computer engineering: $49,505</li><li>Computer science: $48,740</li><li>Information science: $38,900</li><li>Management information systems: $41,800</li></ul><p>Due to the shortage of skilled workers going into tech fields, salaries in America for IT graduates became more and more competitive. Salaries in 2000 were already 10% higher than the previous year and, apart from information science majors, were well above the <a href="https://www.naceweb.org/job-market/compensation/salary-trends-through-salary-survey-a-historical-perspective-on-starting-salaries-for-new-college-graduates">national average starting salary</a> of $39,824.</p><figure><img src="https://codesubmit.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/cs-grads-2000-2.png"><figcaption>The "IT Industry" looked different in 2000 than it does today</figcaption></figure><p>The following table shows the average annual salary for developers, programmers, and other IT-related job functions, across all industries in the year 2000:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><table>

As we head into 2013 through to 2019, the annual mean salary for developers and programmers increased from $92,820 to $106,980, a mere 15% increase compared to the whopping 21% increase experienced in the previous decade.</p><p><strong>Average salary increase from 2013-2019:</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><table>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>One of the reasons for the slower rate of increase is that the data does not show wages based on seniority and experience. Today, there are more entry-level and junior roles available compared to the early 2000s, and there are more people able to fill those roles. </p><p>Interestingly, in <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2015#profile-education">2015</a>, Stack Overflow reported that 42% of developers indicated they were self-taught while in <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#education">2019</a>, 63% of developers said they majored in computer science, computer engineering, or software engineering, with 86% of respondents reporting to have taught themselves a new language, framework or tool without taking a formal course. </p><p>Another survey by <a href="https://insights.dice.com/2020/02/21/technology-job-newbies-face-stagnant-salaries/">Dice</a> reported that while wages have dropped for developers with less than two years experience, salaries pick up after the three-year mark. Much like other jobs, developer salaries increase with more experience they accumulate.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><table>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="what-to-expect-in-the-future">What to expect in the future</h2><p>In the years to come, industry experts expect <a href="https://medium.com/predict/are-programmers-headed-toward-another-bursting-bubble-528e30c59a0e">low-level coding and programming jobs to become obsolete</a> with the development of new tools that remove the need to code completely. Take for example the role of Web Developers when it comes to building websites. With popular CMS tools like WordPress and Squarespace, almost anyone can build a website for their business, reducing the need for people who know “just a little bit of front end web development”. </p><p>As automation takes away the need for “basic” coding jobs, new skills or a combination of skills will be needed in the future for roles that don’t even exist yet. The need for field experts and true problem solvers will never disappear. The key is to adapt and learn as new technologies emerge. </p><p><strong>Additional sources:</strong><br><a href="http://www.oecd.org/digital/ieconomy/1939833.pdf">OECD Technology Outlook Report 2000</a><br><a href="http://www.oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/37620123.pdf">OECD Technology Outlook Report 2004</a><br><a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/it_outlook-2010-sum-en.pdf?expires=1612698150&amp;id=id&amp;accname=guest&amp;checksum=7DC9765AA37510F78D7BBDA7FF42254D">OECD Information Technology Outlook Summary 2010</a><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iGfVr1j-VStKVwSWvVvSo3qbwwHTL_V9tPttpeBTmK4/edit?usp=sharing">BLS data in Google Sheets</a></p>

                    <div><p>Operational analytics is a type of analytics that informs day-to-day decisions with the goal of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of your organization’s operations. Now, that’s a fairly boring definition for an idea that I sincerely believe has the potential to change how organizations use data. </p><p>Instead of using dashboards or reports to understand your data, operational analytics drives action by automatically delivering real-time data to the exact place it’ll be most useful, no matter where that is in your organization. </p><p>And when implemented well, this flow of real-time data (from data warehouses to people who can actually do something with that data) becomes an undercurrent of insights powering important daily decisions, both big and small.</p><p>Here’s a quick thought experiment. What if you could do the following?: &nbsp;</p></div><ul><li>Prioritize support tickets by product usage</li><li>Use sales outreach data to segment audiences for marketing email drip campaigns</li><li>Plug early churn indicators right into your customer relationship management platform</li></ul><div><p>I could go on (and I just might, if you want to <a href="https://getcensus.com/demo">hop on a call</a>), but the point is that operational analytics can make all of what I just listed happen automatically behind the scenes. When it’s time to resolve a support ticket, create an email list, or give a customer a call, team members can jump right into action without having to mess with emails, dashboards, reports, or spreadsheets.</p><p>At its core, operational analytics is about putting an organization’s data to work so everyone can make smart decisions about your business. You might’ve heard such a promise before from other technologies or platforms, but operational analytics is the <em>only</em> way to accomplish this at scale, because it introduces a set of

alt="image.png"></figure><h2 id="traditional-analytics-vs-operational-analytics">Traditional Analytics vs. Operational Analytics</h2><div><p>Traditional analytics uses data to <em>understand </em>business operations, while operational analytics uses data to <em>drive </em>business operations. This difference may seem subtle at first glance, but it cuts deep into the role data plays within your company.</p><p>I’m defining traditional analytics here as the data presented viabusiness intelligence (BI) dashboards and static reports created at a regular cadence (weekly/monthly/quarterly). Broadly speaking, the job of traditional analytics is to use data to provide an understanding of what’s going on in your business to inform strategic decisions over time.</p><p>The types of questions traditional analytics answers are along the lines of “Is this product line generating revenue?”</p><p>Operational analytics is a flow of data from your data warehouse into other tools, like <a href="https://getcensus.com/integrations/zendesk">Zendesk</a>, <a href="https://www.getcensus.com/integrations/hubspot">Hubspot</a> or <a href="https://getcensus.com/integrations/intercom">Intercom</a>. The job of operational analytics is to inform specific activities inside your company, whether that's sales, marketing, support, or customer success. </p><p>The types of questions operational analytics answers are something like “Which support ticket should I tackle first?” </p><p>The difference is in what you use the data to achieve. Traditional analytics looks at data over time to inform long-term strategy; operational analytics looks at data in the moment to inform strategic action. </p></div><h3 id="a-specific-example-of-traditional-analytics-vs-operational-analytics">A Specific Example of Traditional Analytics vs. Operational Analytics</h3><div><p>Let’s take a customer success (CS) team at a growing startup as an example. This team would use traditional analytics to measure performance and plan ahead while using operational analytics to get stuff done.</p><p>A CS director might need a BI dashboard to track how long it would take to resolve support tickets on average. Ticket resolution time is a good metric for measuring past performance while providing a rough indication of future CS team workload. These insights can inform staffing decisions or changes in CS team processes, but they won’t help individual CS reps resolve more tickets in the next hour.</p><p>To resolve more tickets in the next hour, a CS rep might need help with support ticket prioritization. Operational analytics can pull customer information into each support ticket and automatically prioritize them based on a few key characteristics, like if the customer is part of a VIP program, if they’ve shown risk of churn, or if they might be open to an upsell. </p><p>For the CS rep, this might look like a few more fields plugged into each support ticket, while the list of tickets overall is automatically ranked by importance. As they settle in over their morning coffee, the CS rep doesn’t have to think through “Which ticket should I tackle first?” Operational analytics answers this question for them, so they can take action.</p><p>Over time, the performance of your CS team will improve, leading to higher retention, less churn, and more satisfied customers overall — all because each CS rep will know which support ticket to tackle first in order to have the most impact on your business’s bottom line.</p><p>If you empower every team in a similar way as this CS team example, you can start to see the overall impact operational analytics can have. It makes every decision made by each individual a strategic choice that’s backed by real-time data.</p></div><h2 id="how-operational-analytics-works">How Operational Analytics Works</h2><div><p>There is a kind of new standard data stack that has emerged in the last few years, centered on a data warehouse that can support both traditional and operational analytics. If you invest in this core infrastructure, implementing operational analytics becomes fairly attainable for businesses of just about any size.</p><p>The modern data stack is made up of four sections: data integration, data storage, data modeling, and data activation. </p></div><figure><img src="https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/2021/02/modern_data_stack_hub_spoke.png" alt="Modern Data Stack" srcset="https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/modern_data_stack_hub_spoke.png 600w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/modern_data_stack_hub_spoke.png 1000w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/modern_data_stack_hub_spoke.png 1600w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/2021/02/modern_data_stack_hub_spoke.png 1941w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>A simple data stack might have the following tools filling out each of these four sections:</p><ul><li>Data Integration: <a href="https://fivetran.com/">Fivetran</a>, an ETL (extract, load, transform) tool, will integrate all your data sources into your data warehouse.</li><li>Data Storage: <a href="https://blog.getcensus.com/p/839c412a-1b36-4859-ad58-a70059cf47a5/snowflake.com">Snowflake</a>, a data warehouse, can store structured and unstructured data all in one place.</li><li>Data Modeling: <a href="https://blog.getcensus.com/p/839c412a-1b36-4859-ad58-a70059cf47a5/getdbt.com">dbt</a>, a data modeling tool, helps you manage your data with a library of data models, which will make your data usable for different purposes.</li><li>Data Activation: <a href="https://getcensus.com/">Census</a> (that’s us!), a data automation tool, will pull your usable data out of your data warehouse, validate it automatically, and send it to the tools that need it (like our CS rep’s CRM).</li></ul><div><p>A conceptual way to think of this data stack is as a <a href="https://blog.getcensus.com/hub-and-spoke-vs-point-to-point-data-synchronization-theres-one-clear-winner/">hub and spoke</a>, where Snowflake serves as a “hub” for all data. From this hub extends “spokes,” which are places that data comes from and places that data goes to (e.g., CRMs, marketing automation platforms, a/b testing software). </p><p>It’s the job of Fivetran to move data from the spokes into Snowflake. Once the data is in Snowflake, dbt helps make all that data ready for use. Then, Census moves the prepared data from Snowflake to the spokes it needs to go to. </p><p>Traditional analytics sends data out of your data warehouse for very specific tools, like a BI platform. Operational analytics sends data out of your data warehouse to just about whichever spoke needs it. They’re essentially different types of spokes that extend out of a single source of truth: your data warehouse.</p><p>None of the tools listed here will break the bank (although <a href="https://blog.getcensus.com/snowflake-vs-redshift-just-choose-snowflake/">Snowflake can get expensive</a> if you’re not careful). And they’re easy to set up —<a href="https://www.hashpath.com/2020/11/build-a-modern-data-analytics-stack-from-scratch-in-under-an-hour/"> Seth Rosen proved it can be done in around 40 minutes</a> — and modular, so if you need to swap them out for another tool you can. The point is that this data stack’s barrier for entry is fairly low.</p></div><h2 id="why-you-should-use-operational-analytics">Why You Should Use Operational Analytics</h2><div><p>Any company with more than a handful of customers will likely need operational analytics. Once you reach a point of having a few customers’ data flowing into your data warehouse, you’ll quickly find the limitations of the individual tools you’re currently using. Operational analytics not only provides a way to overcome these limitations at scale but also allows your data team to step up and take a more proactive role in how your business uses data.</p><p>Without operational analytics, you have to rely on the analytics capabilities of your individual tools (aka spokes, as we outlined above). There are two types of limitations this places on your team’s capabilities:</p></div><ol><li><strong>You’re limited by the data you have in that system. </strong>If you’re running a complex email drip campaign in Marketo, you need to segment your audiences using Marketo.</li><li><strong>You have to connect the dots on your own. </strong>Say you need to call a customer to prevent churn because they haven’t used your product in a while. First, you need to identify that they’re not using your product in your product analytics tool, and then you need to convey that message to your CS team so they can make the call.</li></ol><div><p>Companies will often use spreadsheets as a work-around. Which can work well, up to a point. But once you start dealing with any sort of scale (think 5-10 customers), the data quickly outgrows the capabilities of a Google Sheets doc and some filtering.</p><p>Even worse, you’re relying on overworked operations people to manage how those tools work together. There’s a marketing operations person wrestling with Marketo day in and day out, managing these audiences and lists manually. There are CS reps swapping between dashboards, email, the help desk, and spreadsheets, trying to prioritize what to do next.</p><p>With operational analytics, you can automate all of these daily brain-draining tasks so these employees can actually start doing their work. </p><p>Marketo can now include ad campaign and sales outreach data to help your marketing ops person create hyperspecific drip campaigns, all within Marketo. The CS team can know, without any extra work on their part, which customers are at risk of churn by importing product-usage data — all without wading through miles of spreadsheets or relying on traditional analytics that are just not suited for these types of use cases. The data is just there.</p><p>The “X factor” making all of this possible …</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>

                    <p>Alex Birsan recently published his article <a href="https://medium.com/@alex.birsan/dependency-confusion-4a5d60fec610">"Dependency Confusion: How I Hacked Into Apple, Microsoft and Dozens of Other Companies"</a> in which he explains how he used language level package managers like npm (Javascript), pip (Python), and gems (Ruby) to get companies to install and run his malicious code on their infrastructure.</p><p>The problem boils down to companies referencing internal packages by name, e.g. <em>"my-internal-package"</em> and an attacker then publishing a package by the same name <em>"my-internal-package"</em> with a higher version number on the central registry / package repository for that language (for PHP that would be <a href="https://packagist.org/">packagist.org</a>). The companies then installed and ran these malicious packages instead of their internal packages because their package manager chose the higher version number from the default package repository over their internal repository.</p><p>Prompted on Twitter for our take on this issue for Composer and Packagist <a href="https://twitter.com/seldaek/status/1359417655762055171">Jordi briefly explained the different measures</a> Composer and Packagist have in place to help protect companies from this serious problem:</p><ol><li><strong>Composer package names always include a vendor prefix</strong>, e.g. <em>"my-company/our-internal-pkg". </em>This naming is strictly enforced by the command line utility and on packagist.org. Packagist.org reserves vendor name prefixes for the maintainer as soon as they publish a first package. Nobody else can then publish another package with the <em>my-company/</em> vendor prefix without a maintainer's consent. <p>If your company has <strong>at least one public package on packagist.org</strong> with your vendor prefix (even an empty one works), e.g. <em>"my-company/dummy-pkg"</em>, <strong>attackers cannot create packages there which would match any of your internal package names</strong> using your vendor prefix. If you required <em>"my-company/my-internal-package" </em>internally, attackers cannot hijack this name on packagist.org.</p></li><li>As of Composer 2.0 custom repositories are <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/repository-priorities.md#canonical-repositories"><strong>canonical by default</strong></a>. This means that if a package name is found in a custom or private package repository, only those versions are loaded at all. If the same package name exists on lower priority repositories or on packagist.org, it is ignored. Even <strong>if an attacker publishes a package</strong> by the same name as your internal package <strong>with a higher version number, Composer will not install it</strong>.</li><li><a href="https://packagist.com/">Private Packagist</a> has always treated third party mirrored repositories including packagist.org as canonical and never loaded package information from mirrors if a private package by that name exists. So <strong>Private Packagist protects users on Composer 1.x in the same way as Composer 2</strong> now does by default.</li><li><strong><a href="https://packagist.com/">Private Packagist</a> allows you to manually approve each newly mirrored package</strong> from a third party repository like packagist.org before it can be installed with Composer. This is an optional feature to give customers even more control over the third party code they use.</li><li><strong>Composer always generates a lock file</strong> with list of the concrete versions and download URLs of dependencies installed. We strongly recommend you commit the lock file to a version control system and only use <em>composer install</em> during build steps, which will only ever install the exact versions listed in the lock file. You can make reviewing changes to the lock file a part of your regular workflows to ensure code is not loaded from untrusted third parties.</li><li>With Composer 2 you can <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/repository-priorities.md#filtering-packages">exclude</a> package names or patterns from loading for each repository. So you can ensure even mistyped non-existent packages without a registered prefix on packagist.org cannot be loaded from packagist.org by replacing the default configuration in composer.json. The exclude filter can be used on additional third party package repositories too.</li></ol><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>    "repositories": {

<h3>heic2103 — Science Release</h3>




<p>11 February 2021</p>






<p>Scientists were expecting to find an intermediate-mass black hole at the heart of the globular cluster NGC 6397, but instead they found evidence of a concentration of smaller black holes lurking there. New data from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope have led to the first measurement of the extent of a collection of black holes in a core-collapsed globular cluster.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Globular clusters are extremely dense stellar systems, in which stars are&nbsp; packed closely together. They are also typically very old — the globular cluster that is the focus of this study, NGC 6397, is almost as old as the Universe itself. It resides 7800 light-years away, making it one of the closest globular clusters to Earth. Because of its very dense nucleus, it is known as a core-collapsed cluster.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When Eduardo Vitral and Gary A. Mamon of the Institut d’Astrophysique de Paris set out to study the core of NGC 6397, they expected to find evidence for an “intermediate-mass” black hole (IMBH). These are smaller than the supermassive black holes that lie at the cores of large galaxies, but larger than stellar-mass black holes formed by the collapse of massive stars. IMBH&nbsp; are the long-sought “missing link” in black hole evolution and their mere existence is hotly debated, although a few candidates have been found (see <a href="#1">[1]</a>, for example).&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">To look for the IMBH, Vitral and Mamon analysed the positions and velocities of the cluster’s stars. They did this using previous estimates of the stars’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_motion">proper motions</a> <a href="#2">[2]</a> from Hubble images of the cluster spanning several years <a href="#3">[3]</a>, in addition to proper motions provided by ESA’s <a href="https://sci.esa.int/web/gaia">Gaia space observatory</a>, which precisely measures the positions, distances and motions of stars. Knowing the distance to the cluster allowed the astronomers to translate the proper motions of these stars into velocities.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">“<em>Our analysis indicated that the orbits of the stars are close to random throughout the globular cluster, rather than systematically circular or very elongated,</em>” explained Mamon.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“<em>We found very strong evidence for invisible mass in the dense central regions of the cluster, but we were surprised to find that this extra mass is not point-like but extended to a few percent of the size of the cluster,</em>” added Vitral.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This invisible component could only be made up of the remnants (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf">white dwarfs</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star">neutron stars</a>, and black holes) of massive stars whose inner regions collapsed under their own gravity once their nuclear fuel was exhausted. The stars progressively sank to the cluster’s centre after gravitational interactions with nearby less massive stars, leading to the small extent of the invisible mass concentration. Using the theory of stellar evolution, the scientists concluded that the bulk of the unseen concentration is made of stellar-mass black holes, rather than white dwarfs or neutron stars that are too faint to observe.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Two recent studies had also proposed that stellar remnants and in particular, stellar-mass black holes, could populate the inner regions of globular clusters.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“<em>Our study is the first finding to provide both the mass and the extent of what appears to be a collection of mostly black holes in a core-collapsed globular cluster,</em>” said Vitral.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">“<em>Our analysis would not have been possible without having both the Hubble data to constrain the inner regions of the cluster and the Gaia data to constrain the orbital shapes of the outer stars, which in turn indirectly constrain the velocities of foreground and background stars in the inner regions,</em>” added Mamon, attesting to an exemplary international collaboration.</p>
<p>The astronomers also note that this discovery raises the question of whether mergers of these tightly packed black holes in core-collapsed globular clusters may be an important source of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave">gravitational waves</a> recently detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) experiment.</p>

<p>How big is big data <i>really</i>? From time to time, various organizations brag about how much data they have, how big their clusters are, how many requests per second they serve, etc. Every time I come across these statistics, I make note of them. It's quite amazing to see how these numbers change over time... looking at the numbers from just a few years ago reminds you of this famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTmXHvGZiSY">Austin Powers scene</a>. Here's another <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2F-DItXtZs">gem</a>.</p>

<h3>Twitter Infrastructure (January 2017)</h3>

<p>Overview of Twitter's current infrastructure:</p>

<img src="https://lintool.github.io/my-data-is-bigger-than-your-data/images/Twitter2017-infra-distribution.png">

<p>Highlights:</p>

<ul>

<li>Hadoop: We have multiple clusters storing over 500 PB divided in four groups (real time, processing, data warehouse and cold storage). Our biggest cluster is over 10k nodes. We run 150k applications and launch 130M containers per day.</li>

<li>Manhattan (the backend for Tweets, Direct Messages, Twitter accounts, and more): We run several clusters for different use cases such as large multi tenant, smaller for non common, read only, and read/write for heavy write/heavy read traffic patterns. The read/only cluster handles 10s of millions QPS whereas a read/write cluster handles millions of QPS. The highest performance cluster, our observability cluster, which ingests in every datacenter, handles over tens of million writes.</li>

<li>Graph: Our legacy Gizzard/MySQL based sharded cluster for storing our graphs. Flock, our social graph, can manage peaks over tens of million QPS, averaging our MySQL servers to 30k - 45k QPS.</li>

<li>Logging (Scribe, but transition over the Flume): We handle over a trillion messages per day and all of these are processed into over 500 categories, consolidated and then and selectively copied across all our clusters.</li>

<li>Caching: We operate hundreds of clusters with an aggregate packet rate of 320M packets/s, delivering over 120GB/s to our clients. We logically partition our caches by users, Tweets, timelines, etc. and in general, every cache cluster is tuned for a particular need. Based on the type of the cluster, they handle between 10M to 50M QPS, and run between hundreds to thousands of instances.</li>

<li>Haplo: Primary cache for Tweet timelines and is backed by a customized version of Redis (implementing the HybridList). Haplo is read-only from Timeline Service and written to by Timeline Service and Fanout Service. Aggregated commands between 40M to 100M per second. Aggregated service requests 800K per second.</li>

<h3>Internet Archive (October 2016)</h3>

<p>In October of 2012, we held just over 10 petabytes of unique content. Today, we have archived a little over 30 petabytes, and we add between 13 and 15 terabytes of content per day (web and television are the most voluminous).</p>

<p>Currently, Internet Archive hosts about 20,000 individual disk drives. Each of these are housed in specialized computers (we call them “datanodes”) that have 36 data drives (plus two operating systems drives) per machine. Datanodes are organized into racks of 10 machines (360 data drives), and interconnected via high-speed ethernet to form our storage cluster. Even though our content storage has tripled over the past four years, our count of disk drives has stayed about the same. This is because disk drive technology improvements. Datanodes that were once populated with 36 individual 2-terabyte (2T) drives are today filled with 8-terabyte (8T) drives, moving single node capacity from 72 terabytes (64.8T formatted) to 288 terabytes (259.2T formatted) in the same physical space! This evolution of disk density did not happen in a single step, so we have populations of 2T, 3T, 4T, and 8T drives in our storage clusters.</p>

February 11, 2021 | https://pii-tools.com/detect-person-names-in-text/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://pii-tools.com/detect-person-names-in-text/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
Detecting people’s names is part and parcel of PII discovery. Traditional techniques like regexps and keywords don’t work, because the set of all names is too varied. How do open source Named Entity Recognition (NER) engines compare, and can we do better?</p><p>
<em>This Part 1 has NER results and benchmarks. There’s also <a href="https://pii-tools.com/detect-person-names-in-text-part-2-technical/">Part 2 with technical neural network details</a>.<br>
</em></p><h2 id="sota_ner">Developing a state-of-the-art named entity recognizer</h2><p>
A good named entity recognizer (NER) is essential for detecting names, home addresses, <a href="https://twitter.com/PII_tools/status/1230905790745260032">passport scans</a> etc, for purposes of compliance or <a href="https://pii-tools.com/pii-exclusions-data-breach/">breach incident management</a>.</p><p>
One could use a prepared list of names and surnames for this task, but such gazetteer obviously cannot be exhaustive and will fail on sentences like this:</p><blockquote><p>“<b>Calvin Klein</b> founded Calvin Klein Company in 1968.”</p></blockquote><p>Humans recognize easily what is a person’s name and what isn’t. For machines, the task is more difficult because they have trouble understanding context. This leads to the famous two types of errors:</p><ul><li><strong>False positives</strong>: words detected as personal names that are not, typically because they’re capitalized (<code>"Skin Games and Jesus Jones were one the first western bands."</code>); as well as</li><li><strong>False negatives</strong>: names missed by the detection, typically because they’re lowercased, foreign or uncommon. Example: <code>"bill carpenter was playing football."</code></li></ul><p>
So in order to recognize person names in text it is necessary to know not only what names look like, but also in what context they’re used and have a general domain knowledge.</p><h2 id="motivation">Why not just use open source?</h2><p>
NER is a well-studied task in academia. Naturally, we turned to open source NER solutions first. We evaluated the most popular ready-made software: Stanford NER and Stanza from the Stanford University, FLAIR from Zalando Research, spaCy from Explosion AI.</p><p>
To cut the story short, <strong>none of these open source tools were precise and fast enough</strong> for our purposes. While they work great on well-behaved data such as news articles or Wikipedia, their academic pedigree implodes when applied to the wild, messy documents of the real world.</p><p>
For this reason we developed our own NER, with special focus on <strong>names as they appear in real company documents</strong>. The resulting NER is proprietary (part of <a href="https://pii-tools.com/">PII Tools</a>) but we decided to share some technical design tips and results here, in the hope they help others.</p><p>
In this article, we’ll compare our creation against popular open source options. Additionally, we’ll benchmark a simple gazetteer-based NER that uses a predefined list of names, to serve as a <strong>baseline</strong>.</p><table><caption>Description of tested NERs</caption><tbody><tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>version</th><th>type</th><th>language</th><th>source</th></tr><tr><th>list</th><td>–</td><td><abbr title="contains 5.6M unique names">list of names</abbr></td><td>multi-language</td><td>inhouse</td></tr><tr><th>stanford</th><td>4.1</td><td>CRF classifier</td><td><abbr title="each language has a separate model">single</abbr></td><td><a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.html">https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.html</a></td></tr><tr><th>stanza</th><td>1.1.1</td><td>neural network</td><td><abbr title="each language has a separate model">single</abbr></td><td><a href="https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/">https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/</a></td></tr><tr><th><abbr title="ner-multi-fast model">flair</abbr></th><td>0.6.1</td><td>neural network</td><td>multi-language</td><td><a href="https://github.com/flairNLP/flair">https://github.com/flairNLP/flair</a></td></tr><tr><th><abbr title="xx_ent_wiki_sm model">spacy</abbr></th><td>2.3.2</td><td>neural network</td><td>multi-language</td><td><a href="https://spacy.io/">https://spacy.io/</a></td></tr><tr><th>pii-tools</th><td>3.8.0</td><td>neural network</td><td>multi-language</td><td><a href="https://pii-tools.com/">https://pii-tools.com/</a></td></tr></tbody></table><p>
Our requirements for the new NER were:</p><ul><li><strong>multi-language</strong>, with special focus on English, Spanish, German and Portuguese/Brazilian;</li><li>to accept <strong>arbitrary document contexts</strong>: text coming from PDFs, Word documents, Excel, email, database field, OCR…;</li><li><strong>efficient</strong>, to process <strong>large amounts of text quickly on a CPU</strong> (no need for specialized GPU hardware) and with a <strong>low memory footprint</strong>,</li><li><strong>flexible</strong> to be able to evolve the model behaviour: retraining, adding new languages, correcting detection errors;</li><li>and of course to be <strong>accurate</strong>, to minimize false positives and negatives.</li></ul><p>
To compare our NER we evaluated performance on standard benchmark datasets, <a href="https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/conll2002/ner/">CoNLL-2002</a> (for Spanish), <a href="https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/conll2003/ner/">CoNLL-2003</a> (English, German) and <a href="https://cic.unb.br/~teodecampos/LeNER-Br/">LeNER-Br</a> (Portuguese).</p><p>We also included a manually annotated <code>openweb</code> dataset, to make sure we test on data that no NER system (including ours!) has seen during training. Text for this dataset was randomly sampled from the English <a href="https://skylion007.github.io/OpenWebTextCorpus/">OpenWebTextCorpus</a>. We value results on <code>openweb</code> the most, because OpenWeb reflects the real (messy) data found in real documents the closest, among these public datasets.</p><h2 id="accuracy">Accuracy</h2><p>
We measured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score">F1 scores</a> for person names detected by each software. F1 scores range from 0 to 100, the higher the better. A “hit” (true positive) means the entire name was matched exactly, beginning to end. This is the strictest metric; we specifically <emph>don’t</emph> calculate success over the number of correctly predicted tokens, or even individual characters.</p><table><caption>Performance benchmark [F1 score – higher is better]</caption><tbody><tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>English</th><th>Spanish</th><th>German</th><th>Portuguese</th><th>openweb</th></tr><tr><th>list</th><td>59.1</td><td>62.3</td><td>54.9</td><td>45.2</td><td>74.5</td></tr><tr><th>stanford</th><td>94.9</td><td>91.1</td><td>93.6</td><td><abbr title="no model available">—</abbr></td><td>92.6</td></tr><tr><th>stanza</th><td>82.2</td><td>98.4</td><td>87.6</td><td><abbr title="no model available">—</abbr></td><td>86.7</td></tr><tr><th>flair</th><td>95.8</td><td>96.9</td><td>91.3</td><td>62.9</td><td>90.6</td></tr><tr><th>spacy</th><td>86.1</td><td>87.0</td><td>74.1</td><td>42.0</td><td>81.3</td></tr><tr><th>pii-tools</th><td>92.3</td><td>90.6</td><td>89.3</td><td>85.9</td><td>95.7</td></tr></tbody></table><div id="attachment_4542"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4542" loading="lazy" src="https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1.png" alt="F1 scores for NER software that detect personal names." width="1015" height="482" srcset="https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1.png 1015w, https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1-300x142.png 300w, https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1-768x365.png 768w, https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1-100x47.png 100w, https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1-924x439.png 924w" sizes="(max-width: 1015px) 100vw, 1015px" data-srcset="https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1.png 1015w, https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1-300x142.png 300w, https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1-768x365.png 768w, https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1-100x47.png 100w, https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1-924x439.png 924w" data-src="https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></p><p id="caption-attachment-4542">F1 scores of NER software that detect person names.</p></div><p>
In all tests our NER is among the top contenders – but keep in mind that accuracy was just one of our 5 design goals. For example, we “lost” a few F1 points on purpose by switching from Tensorflow to TF lite, trading accuracy for a much smaller &amp; faster model.</p><p>
For the Portuguese language (Brazil, LGPD) and <code>openweb</code> dataset, PII Tools is the clear winner. As mentioned above <code>openweb</code> reflects “real data” the closest, so this is great.</p><p>
Let’s look at some concrete examples:</p><table><caption>Text samples and NER detections (actual expected names are <strong>in bold</strong>)</caption><tbody><tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>stanford</th><th>stanza</th><th>flair</th><th>spacy</th><th>pii-tools</th></tr><tr><td><b>Calvin Klein</b> founded Calvin Klein Company in 1968.</td><td>ok</td><td>ok</td><td>ok</td><td>ok</td><td>ok</td></tr><tr><td><b>Nawab Zulfikar Ali Magsi</b> did not see <b>Shama Parveen Magsi</b> coming.</td><td>ok</td><td>ok</td><td>ok</td><td>fail</td><td>ok</td></tr><tr><td><b>bill carpenter</b> was playing football.</td><td>fail</td><td>fail</td><td>fail</td><td>ok</td><td>ok</td></tr><tr><td><abbr title="a village in Wales">Llanfihangel Talyllyn</abbr> is beautiful.</td><td>fail</td><td>fail</td><td>fail</td><td>fail</td><td>ok</td></tr><tr><td>Skin Games and Jesus Jones were one the first western bands.</td><td>fail</td><td>fail</td><td>fail</td><td>fail</td><td>fail</td></tr></tbody></table><p>
These samples are rather edge cases, but serve to get an idea of what detectors have to deal with, and how successful they are.</p><h2 id="performance">Performance</h2><p>
Now we will look into other aspects of our requirements. Detection performance was measured on CPU, our <code>pii-tools</code> NER was artificially restricted to a single process with a single thread, others were left in default settings.</p><table><caption>Speed and memory comparison</caption><tbody><tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th><abbr title="short documents of ~500 bytes">speed short [kB/s]</abbr></th><th><abbr title="long documents of ~2.5 kB">speed long [kB/s]</abbr></th><th><abbr title="time to initializate NER + tag a 20 character text">startup time [s]</abbr></th><th><abbr title="peak RAM while tagging 270 kB of text">RAM usage [MB]</abbr></th></tr><tr><th>list</th><td>350.0</td><td>1100.0</td><td>1.1</td><td>1420</td></tr><tr><th>stanford</th><td>30.0</td><td>30.0</td><td>1.5</td><td><abbr title="for one language only">248</abbr></td></tr><tr><th>stanza</th><td>0.4</td><td>1.2</td><td>6.1</td><td><abbr title="input had to be chunked to limit RAM">1073</abbr></td></tr><tr><th>flair</th><td>0.1</td><td>0.1</td><td>5.2</td><td><abbr title="input had to be chunked to limit RAM">5341</abbr></td></tr><tr><th>spacy</th><td>70.0</td><td>200.0</td><td>0.5</td><td>123</td></tr><tr><th>pii-tools</th><td>35.0</td><td>230.0</td><td>1.3</td><td>387</td></tr></tbody></table><p>
Overall FLAIR and Stanza are definitely out, due to their super slow speed and high RAM usage. A worthy competitor from the performance perspective is spaCy, whose authors put a great deal of effort into optimization. Unfortunately spaCy’s tokenization quirks and opinionated architecture proved too inflexible for our needs.</p><p>
Likewise, Stanford NER is the most accurate among the open source alternatives, but is quite rigid – it’s really hard to update its models or add a new language. Plus its GNU GPL license won’t be to everyone’s liking.</p><h2 id="flexibility">Flexibility</h2><p>
Our focus on industry use calls for frequent model modifications: adding new languages, new kinds of documents (document contexts in which names may appear), fixing detection errors.</p><p>
In order to adapt the PII Tools NER model quickly, we built a pipeline that utilizes several “weaker” NERs and automatic translation tools to build a huge training corpus from varied sources. This focus on real-world data, along with a robust automated Tensorflow training pipeline allows adding new languages and controlling NER outputs more easily than the open source solutions.</p><p>
While developing our <code>pii-tools</code> NER we implemented most components from scratch, including:</p><ul><li>a large scale annotated dataset (proprietary data)</li><li>a tokenizer (critical; none of the open source variants do this part well)</li><li>token features (input to the neural network)</li><li>convolutional neural network (NN architecture)</li><li>data augmentation and training pipeline (for grounded model updates)</li><li>various tricks to push performance or to squeeze a lot of information into a smaller parameter space</li></ul><p>

February 11, 2021 | https://cri.dev/posts/2021-02-09-my-reading-stack-miniflux-rss-pocket/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://cri.dev/posts/2021-02-09-my-reading-stack-miniflux-rss-pocket/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>I want to outline the tools I use to consume textual content, and why it <em>perfectly</em> fits my needs.</p>
<p>Who knows, maybe this can be helpful for you too.</p>

<p>(This should have been a pun on “HTTPS everywhere”…)</p>
<p>Been an avid RSS consumer for the past years.</p>
<p>But I’ve always encountered the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>lost RSS feeds while distro-hopping (either forgot or lost backups of the config files)</li>
<li>didn’t like the RSS reader’s UI</li>
<li>needed to install an extra native application for reading my news (both on my PC and phone)</li>
</ul>
<p>(Yes, I know you could use Feedly, Reedr and others, but it didn’t suit my needs)</p>
<h3 id="embrace-the-web"><a href="#embrace-the-web">#</a> Embrace the Web</h3>
<p>I am a web-guy (whatever that means).</p>
<p>I almost exclusively use the Web, be it for apps one would have a native app for or browsing in general.</p>
<p>Lately I’ve found my perfect stack for keeping up to date with the latest news:</p>
<p>RSS for</p>
<ul>
<li>blogs (obviously)</li>
<li>HackerNews frontpage (yes, there is an RSS for it)</li>
<li>Twitter (although I added only a few feeds, via Nitter RSS)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hackernews-frontpage"><a href="#hackernews-frontpage">#</a> HackerNews frontpage</h3>
<p>I found myself checking the HN frontpage <strong>way</strong> too often, only to make a visual diff in my brain to skim through the articles I already read.</p>
<p>This changed finally once I discovered HN-RSS:</p>
<p>E.g. I get all posts that make it to the HackerNews frontpage via this RSS feed</p>
<pre><code>https://hnrss.org/frontpage
</code></pre>
<h3 id="tweets"><a href="#tweets">#</a> Tweets</h3>
<p>And the tweets from a handful of Twitter users through Nitter’s RSS feeds:</p>
<pre><code>https://nitter.eu/&lt;TWITTER_HANDLE&gt;/rss
</code></pre>
<p>You can host your own instance if you prefer, or choose one from any other <a href="https://github.com/zedeus/nitter/wiki/Instances" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener external">public one’s</a></p>
<h2 id="miniflux-to-the-rescue"><a href="#miniflux-to-the-rescue">#</a> Miniflux to the rescue</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Miniflux is a minimalist and opinionated feed reader.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The awesome part of <a href="https://miniflux.app/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener external">miniflux</a> is that I can</p>
<ul>
<li>self-host it (a baby could run it via docker and set up a reverse-proxy with nginx)</li>
<li>Integrate Pocket (<a href="https://getpocket.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener external">getpocket.com</a>) for bookmarking articles or reading them later on</li>
<li>Read the whole article without leaving Miniflux</li>
</ul>
<p>(The last point is because Miniflux will fetch the original article automatically if the RSS entry only contains a summary)</p>
<p>You want other reasons?</p>
<p>Privacy, simplicity, clean and no-frills UI, FOSS</p>
<p>This is how the UI looks like:</p>
<p><img src="https://cri.dev/assets/images/posts/miniflux-example.png" alt="miniflux example"></p>
<p>By clicking on the article I can read it in full.</p>
<p>I use the <code>Save</code> button to offload the articles to Pocket, and read them later.</p>
<h3 id="bookmarklet"><a href="#bookmarklet">#</a> Bookmarklet</h3>
<p>Through a simple bookmark in my browser (both on PC and phone), I can simply subscribe to any website or blog that has an RSS feed.</p>
<p>This makes it super easy to subscribe to someone’s RSS feed.</p>
<p>You stumble upon an article, click on the bookmarklet, and Miniflux will find the RSS feed(s) for that website automatically.</p>
<p>No searching for the RSS icon no more.</p>
<p><img src="https://cri.dev/assets/images/posts/miniflux-bookmarklet.png" alt="miniflux bookmarklet"></p>
<h2 id="pocket-(%23longreads)"><a href="#pocket-(%23longreads)">#</a> Pocket (#longreads)</h2>
<p>I set up the Pocket integration mainly for reading longer articles, in a deferred fashion.</p>
<p>Pocket’s UI and reading experience suits me very well.</p>
<p>This part is totally optional, as you could get away with it by just using Miniflux.</p>
<p>You could also customize the CSS to make the font-rendering more pleasant and use custom fonts for example.</p>
<h2 id="you-want-to-try-it-too%3F"><a href="#you-want-to-try-it-too%3F">#</a> You want to try it too?</h2>
<p>Below is the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> I am using.</p>
<p>(just generate a secure password for postgres, define an admin user, and optionally set the <code>POCKET_CONSUMER_KEY</code> variable)</p>

<p>Maybe your travel plan is postponed for now, maybe you are actively seeking your next destination, or you are planning the details of your upcoming trip. No matter what your current travel status is, the travel facts that you will find here will spice up your knowledge or perhaps it will inspire you to look for less-known destinations. At the very least you will have fun time while you go through the travel-world of extremes, opposites and interesting travel facts.</p>
<h2>1. <strong>How Covid-19 helped to break the record for longest commercial flight in 2020?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>According to<a href="https://www.airfarewatchdog.com/blog/50107247/the-new-longest-flight-in-the-world-thanks-to-covid-19-restrictions/#:~:text=The%20Longest%20Flight%20in%20the%20World%20by%20Distance%20in%202020,miles%20from%20Singapore%20to%20Newark." target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Airfarewatchdog</a> Air Tahiti Nui flight from Papeete (French Polynesia) to Paris with a distance of 9,775 miles or 15 hours and 45 minutes was the longest flight in 2020. It broke the record held by Singapore Airlines which was 9,534 miles from Singapore to Newark (New Jersey).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The aircraft used for the flight was Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Normally the airline had a stopover in Los Angeles, but because of Covid restrictions this was no longer possible. With reduced number of passengers and weight, the aircraft spends less fuel and this made it possible to fly over such a long distance. This flight was an exception and the airline has discontinued the record breaking direct route with a stopover in a different city.</p>

From Papeete (Tahiti Island) to Paris" title="29 travel facts to quench your thirst for curiosities and fun 2 | BagsAway" data-recalc-dims="1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Travel fact animation: Longest commercial flight in 2020</figcaption></figure></div>
<h2>2. Why would you take a 2 miles flight? [The shortest commercial flight in the world]</h2>
<p>According to<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/shortest-airline-routes-in-the-world-2020-4#the-true-shortest-commercial-route-in-the-world-however-is-between-westray-and-papa-westray-in-scotland-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> BusinessInsider</a> the shortest commercial flight is between Westray and Papa Westray islands in Scotland. </p>
<p>The airports are 2 miles apart. The flight takes<a href="https://thepointsguy.com/news/worlds-shortest-flight-from-westray-to-papa-westray/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 90 seconds</a> and according to The Points Guy itâ€™s a much better transportation alternative than the 20 minutes choppy boat trip from one to the other island.</p>
<h2>3. By how much travel makes you happier</h2>
<p>Scientific study has shown that the intention itself or the<a href="https://bagsaway.com/blog/how-to-plan-a-trip-in-2021/"> plan to go on a holiday</a> makes vacationers to be almost as happy as the trip itself. The study compared vacationers to non-vacationers and the results showed that vacationers had an 8% higher pre-trip happiness score than non-vacationers.</p>
<p>Other studies have also confirmed this psychological phenomenon.</p>
<h2>4. Maybe the language that you speak affects you more than you think</h2>
<p>A study of the top 10 most used languages globally (English, Mandarin, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Indonesian, German, Korean, Russian and Arabic) showed that<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2952082/Spain-s-place-live-Spanish-happiest-language-world-people-love.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Spanish is the happiest language</a>, followed by Portuguese, English, German and French.</p>
<p>Possibly this is one of the reasons why Spain is in the top 10 or top 5 countries globally by life expectancy, and some media are reporting it is well placed to overtake Japan in two decades.</p>
<h2>5. The most irresistible travel destinations</h2>
<p>Some countries get the most visitors repeatedly. They are like travel magnets. Here is the list of the top 5 globally. France is the most visited country by travelers in the world with 89 million arrivals, according to the latest <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ST.INT.ARVL?end=2018&amp;most_recent_value_desc=true&amp;start=1995&amp;type=shaded&amp;view=chart" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UNWTO data</a> related to 2018 travel flows. The next most visited countries are Spain, United States, China and Italy.</p>

<p>When it comes to cities, Bangkok is the global leader with 22 million international overnight visitors in 2018, followed by Paris, London, Dubai and Singapore making together the top 5 most visited cities globally according to<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexandratalty/2019/09/04/bangkok-is-the-most-visited-city-in-the-world-again/?sh=7a95aa1b5f1b" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Mastercardâ€™s Global Destination Cities Index</a>.</p>
<h2>6. How one famous tourist attraction changes itself over the seasons</h2>
<p>Eiffel Towerâ€™s size<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/travel-eiffel-tower-vatican-hamburg-fun-facts/g-54904054" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> increases 15 cm</a> (6 inches) during summer time because the steel structure expands on higher temperatures. A little reminder on physics ðŸ˜Š&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>7. Cities with the most bridges in the world</h2>
<p>Crossing a river or non-walkable path is less of a problem in some cities. Hamburg has more than<a href="https://www.traveltrivia.com/cities-with-most-bridges/XqgZkXU1XQAGkiVC" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 2300 bridges</a>, the largest number of bridges in the world. Next is Amsterdam with 1281 bridges, New York City with 789, Pittsburgh with 446 and Venice with 391.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So many bridges sometimes represent a problem. </p>

<h2>8. Peaceful nation</h2>
<p>Costa Rica is one of the few countries globally that has abolished the army and lives without military forces for more than 70 years.</p>
<h2>9. $1 can get you a long way or a “short way”. The cost to get around a city.</h2>
<p>Egypt is a country with the cheapest taxi ride, it costs less than a dollar to get a three-mile ride. That’s a handy travel fact to be aware of when you travel to Egypt. On the other end is Switzerland as a country with the most expensive taxi ride. It costs<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2019/06/28/best-and-worst-countries-for-cheap-taxi-rides/1600113001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $25</a> for a three-mile ride, according to USA Today and Taxi2Airport.Â&nbsp;</p>
<h2>10. Remarkable age-defying trees. The oldest tree in the world. </h2>
<p>According to<a href="https://www.thespruce.com/great-trees-of-the-world-1709081#:~:text=The%20Oldest%20Tree%20in%20the%20World&amp;text=It's%20not%20always%20easy%20to,is%20over%204%2C700%20years%20old." target="_blank" rel="noopener"> The Spruce</a>, the oldest tree in the world is nicknamed Methuselah. Itâ€™s a bristlecone pine tree located in California’s White Mountain range. Its estimated age is over 4700 years. Itâ€™s a non-clonal tree which means it cannot reproduce itself, unlike the clonal trees that have this ability. Big Pharma dreams to replicate the anti-aging secret of living organisms like this.</p>
<p>When it comes to clonal trees the oldest one is<a href="https://www.oldest.org/nature/trees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Old Tjikko</a> in Sweden. Itâ€™s roughly 10,000 years old and its trunk survives about 600 years after which a new one sprouts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tallest tree in the world is located in the Redwood National Park in California. Itâ€™s called<a href="https://www.thespruce.com/great-trees-of-the-world-1709081#:~:text=The%20Oldest%20Tree%20in%20the%20World&amp;text=It's%20not%20always%20easy%20to,is%20over%204%2C700%20years%20old." target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Hyperion</a> and has a height of 380 ft or 115m. Itâ€™s about one third of the height of Eifel Tower.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>11. The little-known biggest pyramid in the world</h2>
<p>Giza and Egypt. Probably this comes on top of your mind when you think about pyramids. But, itâ€™s not in Giza. </p>
<p>The biggest pyramid in the world by volume is located in Cholula de Rivadavia, Mexico. Over time, nature did its job and camouflaged it with soil, grass and other vegetations, so it was not easy to spot it and to see what lies beneath the hill at its location. The Great pyramid of Cholula is only<a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-pyramid/?fb_comment_id=710759905675048_1132778176806550" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 54 m</a> (177 ft) tall, but with a base<a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20160812-the-giant-pyramid-hidden-inside-a-mountain" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> four time larger</a> than the Great Pyramid at Giza, having a volume of 166k ftÂ³ (3.3 million mÂ³) compared to the 84k ftÂ³ (2.4 million mÂ³) of the Pyramid of Khufu. According to BBC itâ€™s also the largest monument on earth ever built by humans.</p>
<h2>12. Stop thinking about Egypt for a while. Which country has the most pyramids in the world? </h2>
<p>The biggest pyramid in the world is in Mexico, but Egypt is the country of pyramids, you may think. Not exactly. According to the<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/africa/sudan-pyramids-twice-number-egypt-meroe-soleb-prudhoe-lions-tours-a7579141.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Independent</a>, Sudan has more than twice the number of pyramids that Egypt has.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>13. Is your wallet ready for going out on a date </h2>
<p>Going on a date out of your town is not a bad idea. Just collect some travel facts before you do so. According to Deutsche Bank Research of 54 cities globally, Zurich and Oslo are the most expensive cities to go out on a date. A night out with your date in these two cities costs $202 and $163 respectively. Cairo, Bangalore and Buenos Aires are the cheapest ones. If you go on a date there you need to have roughly $42 in your wallet.</p>

<h2>14. Your love for coffee is not valued equally everywhere</h2>
<p>Have you thought how much your love for coffee may cost you in different cities in the world? Well, a cup of cappuccino in an expat area of a city is most expensive in Copenhagen $6.3, the cheapest one is in Milan $1.7, according to Deutsche Bank Research.</p>
<h2>15. Planning a trip, but you are tired of mosquitos? </h2>
<p>Wondering whether you need to pack in your bags a mosquito repellant for your trip? Iceland is<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/iceland-has-no-mosquitoes-2016-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> one of few</a> countries in the world that doesnâ€™t have mosquitos. A convenient advantage for such an interesting destination.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>16. Country in Western Europe with the most time zones in the world. How come?</h2>
<p>You will often see information that France is a country with most time zones, 12 particularly. The reason for this is because France still administers territories placed far away across the world. Otherwise Russia and the USA cover 11 time zones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>17. Machu Picchu construction design</h2>
<p>Machu Picchu is built in a way that protects it from earthquakes. The stones used to build it are precisely cut and free of mortar. According to<a href="https://epod.usra.edu/blog/2013/05/seismic-resistant-features-of-machu-picchu.html#:~:text=Some%20of%20the%20most%20sacred,held%20together%20by%20gravity%20alone.&amp;text=But%20Inca%20construction%20has%20a,against%20collapsing%20in%20an%20earthquake." target="_blank" rel="noopener"> USRA</a> it allows the stones to move, but also to come back to the original position after an earthquake. Itâ€™s one of the few advanced architectural features that Machu Picchu has.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>18. The steepest street slope in the world&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>For those a little bit lazy or for those eager to get fit by walking on a steeper slope, the<a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2020/4/baldwin-street-in-new-zealand-reinstated-as-the-worlds-steepest-street-614287" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> steepest street</a> in the world is Baldwin Street, in Dunedin, New Zealand. The slope of the street is 34.8%.</p>
<h2>19. Having trouble to remember names? It’s not your brain, it’s the country.</h2>
<p>Itâ€™s easier to remember surnames in China than in the USA. According to<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/16/china/chinese-names-few-intl-hnk-dst/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> CNN</a>, China has about 6000 surnames in use and 100 of these surnames are common for 86% of the population. In the United States there are 6.3 million surnames, and most of them appear only once.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Airports</h2>
<h3>20. Busiest airports</h3>
<p>Hartsfieldâ€“Jackson Atlanta International Airport is the busiest one in the world with<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_busiest_airports_by_passenger_traffic" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 110 million</a> passengers in 2019. The next four busiest are Beijing Capital International Airport with 100 million passengers, Los Angeles International Airport with 88 million passengers, Dubai International Airport with 86 million passengers and Tokyo Haneda Airport with 85 million passengers. Let’s wait a bit for the 2020 numbers to see whether the ranking will change. </p>
<h3>21. Worst airports</h3>
<p>According to<a href="https://www.airhelp.com/en/airhelp-score/airport-ranking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> AirHelp</a> the worst top 10 airports in the world in 2019 based on on-time performance, service quality, and food and shops are:</p>

February 11, 2021 | https://ricardoanderegg.com/posts/easy-feedback-button-fastapi-htmx-javascript-hyperscript/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ricardoanderegg.com/posts/easy-feedback-button-fastapi-htmx-javascript-hyperscript/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>Feedback is one of the most importante things when you are creating a product (probably the most important one!), so it should be easy for users to give feedback. In this post we’ll see how to implement a feedback button easily. This exact code is what I’m using at <a href="https://drwn.io/">drwn.io</a>, a little project I’m working on with a friend.</p>
<p>The button does the following: after you use it, it will change its text to “Thank you!”, then it will fade out we will have our backend handle the message. Let’s see it in action:</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polyrand/rand/minimal2/rand/static/img/social/feedbackbtn.gif" alt="Feedback button in action"></p>
<p>The first thing we need is an html button, it’s styled using Tailwind CSS. Notice the <code>_="on click ..."</code>, this is where we will put our <a href="https://hyperscript.org/"><code>hyperscript</code></a> code. To use hyperscript, add this to your page’s <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>(Now I’m using version 0.0.3, make sure to update it if you are reading it in the future)</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html">&lt;script src=<span>"https://unpkg.com/hyperscript.org@0.0.3"</span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>And now our HTML button with hyperscript:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html">&lt;div id=<span>"get-feedback-div"</span> class=<span>"inline-flex ml-3 shadow rounded-md transition-opacity duration-500 ease-in"</span>&gt;
	&lt;button id=<span>"get-feedback-button"</span> _=<span>"on click call getFeedback() then set #get-feedback-button.innerText to 'Thank you!' then wait 1000ms then toggle .opacity-0 on #get-feedback-div then wait 600ms then toggle .hidden on #get-feedback-div"</span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; class=<span>"inline-flex items-center justify-center px-5 py-3 text-base font-medium text-blue-600 bg-white border border-transparent rounded-md hover:bg-blue-50"</span>&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Give us feedback
	&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>We can go step-by-step with hyperscript:</p>
<p><code>on click call getFeedback()</code>: when the button is clicked, execute the function <code>getFeedback()</code> (explained later).</p>
<p><code>then set #get-feedback-button.innerText to 'Thank you!'</code>: after that, get the element with id <code>get-feedback-button</code> and change the innerText to <code>'Thank you!'</code></p>
<p><code>then wait 1000ms</code>: self-explanatory I guess</p>
<p><code>then toggle .opacity-0 on #get-feedback-div</code>: toggle the CSS class <code>opacity-0</code> in the element with id <code>get-feedback-div</code></p>
<p><code>then wait 600ms then toggle .hidden on #get-feedback-div</code>: finally, wait again and toggle the class <code>hidden</code> on the element</p>
<p>What I love about hyperscript is:</p>
<ul>
<li>The code is all in one place, I don’t have to go back and forth between javascript and html files</li>
<li>It feels like I’m writing in a declarative language. I tell it what I want, and it does it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now our <code>getFeedback()</code> function. It’s straightforward, use <code>prompt()</code> to get a message, if the user writes something, send a JSON request to the <code>/feedback_prompt</code> endpoint.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>function</span> getFeedback() {
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>var</span> message = prompt(<span>"Write your message here:"</span>, <span>""</span>);

&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>if</span> (message != <span>""</span>) {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>const</span> data = {msg: message};

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fetch(<span>'/feedback_prompt'</span>, {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; method: <span>'POST'</span>,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; headers: {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>'Content-Type'</span>: <span>'application/json'</span>,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; },
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; body: JSON.stringify(data),
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; })
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .then()
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .<span>catch</span>((error) =&gt; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; alert(<span>"There was an error sending your message, please try it later."</span>);
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; });
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
}
</code></pre></div><p>And now our backed with <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a> to wrap everything up. We have an endpoint that reads the message and passes it to a <code>notify()</code> function. This function can be whatever you want, in my projects it’s usually sending the message to telegram, slack and/or email.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> pydantic <span>import</span> BaseModel
<span>from</span> fastapi <span>import</span> FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

<span># whatever you want to do with the feedback message</span>
<span># save to the database, send to telegram, slack, email...</span>
<span>def</span> notify(message: str):
	<span>return</span> message

<span>class</span> <span>FeedBackPrompData</span>(BaseModel):
&nbsp; &nbsp; msg: str


@app.post(<span>"/feedback_prompt"</span>)
async <span>def</span> feedback_post(data: FeedBackPrompData):

&nbsp; &nbsp; content = f<span>"Feeback from drwn.io:</span><span>\n\n</span><span>{data.msg}"</span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; notify(content)

&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>return</span>

</code></pre></div><p>And that’s it, we now have a working full-stack system to have a feedback button.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><article data-theme="classic" id="article"><header><h2>Or, "Any excuse to talk about folk music"</h2><h3>by <a href="https://senryu.pub/users/robotmay">Robert May</a> on <a href="https://senryu.pub/afternoonrobot/articles">Afternoon Robot</a></h3></header><section><h2>Background</h2>

<p>A few years ago I had quite bad RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury) caused by working entirely on a small laptop for 6 months. It was a mistake for many reasons, but the major one was that I had inadvertantly changed my typing style to work with it. I was resting my wrists on the laptop case, I was using the touchpad, and I had it quite close to my body because it was small. I had to make a fairly dramatic change to halt the onset of the RSI, but at the time I didn't understand what I had done to cause it - after all, I've been typing a lot, at a reasonable speed, since I was ~10 years old.</p>

<p>It took 20 years, but finally I had suffered the consequences of my constant computer use.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>

<p>Immediately I set out to spend money. The first change I made was to buy an "ergonomic" keyboard, and I went for an <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">Ergodox EZ</a>, which is a nice bit of kit. I also bought a wireless trackball; a <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/products/mice/mx-ergo-wireless-trackball-mouse.910-005179.html">Logitech MX Ergo</a>. I'm now on my second of these and I really like it.</p>

<p>At the same time I started trying to learn the <a href="https://workmanlayout.org/">Workman</a> layout, which I think is largely rather smart, and which focuses on home-row typing. I initially tried Colemak but that seems oddly flawed in applying too much frequency to keys under the little fingers.</p>

<p>After some time, rather wonderfully, my RSI was substantially improved.</p>

<p>However, it wasn't actually for the reasons I originally thought. In fact, the RSI started disappearing because I essentially took a 3 month break from typing a lot, due to the high learning curve of swapping to a split board and new layout at the same time. Once I was back up to speed, the RSI started coming back.</p>

<h2>Why does it still hurt?</h2>

<p>Had I broken my body irreparably? No, as it turns out. In fact, all I had to do was just go back to everything I was doing before the laptop incident, and give myself time.</p>

<h3>As in all things, folk music is the cure</h3>

<p>Discovering the real cause of the problem came about by comparing typing on a computer to my musical instruments. I never get RSI on my diatonic accordions, or on the piano. Why are they different? Surely they use the same muscles, more or less. In fact their key weight is notably heavier. Even more weirdly, my RSI was non-existent when I played on them, even when it was at its worst on the computer.</p>

<p>There are a variety of ways to play the diatonic accordion but I tend to use a single strap and use the weight of the instrument to allow me to shift my hands whilst still holding it relatively still; I prefer this to strapping it tightly to my body and having entirely free hands. Here's an example video from a few years back:</p>



<p>There are better tunes and examples I could make but that would involve filming something new and I had this lying about. This video is a fairly good example in that I regularly slide my hand quickly downwards instead of stretching. It's more tempting to stretch when first learning the instrument as you don't want to lose your reference point, but learning to shift up and down the keys makes more difficult passages playable and actually quite comfortable. It's generally more comfortable to keep your fingers straight-ish and shift your hand up and down in that position. I now do this even more than in this video and regularly play tunes that use the full length of the keyboard. In fact, they're often my favourite ones to play! I now usually play with my thumb behind the keyboard, which I find makes it very easy to slide up and down. Here's another, rougher, old example, sure to give you motion sickness, from when I was selling an unwanted instrument:</p>



<p>Yes, accordions are a very quick way to ruin a motion-stabilisation algorithm-writer's day.</p>

<p>The hands aren't as free-floating as on a piano, as you have to hold the instrument at the same time. The key weight is actually fairly comparable to a computer keyboard, though at the heavier end. The piano is different, in that the key weight is actually pretty immense, particularly at the lower-end on a grand piano keyboard, and therefore requires a somewhat different method of striking the keys to a computer keyboard - the strength doesn't come from moving your finger up and down (but I won't go into that here as there are a million piano ergonomics articles).</p>

<h3>Problems with ergonomic or split keyboards</h3>

<p>The primary goal of many ergonomic keyboard enthusiasts is to reduce movement entirely and to move everything onto modifier layers. The Ergodox is known to be flawed in this regard as the thumb cluster is a bit of a stretch for most people, as well as the larger keys around the outside being a bit of an odd stretch. It's almost like it has two competing designs: one to reduce movement entirely, and the other to require movement in order to hit these extra buttons.</p>

<p>But the major flaw for me is that it ensures you can only ever use each hand on one half of the keyboard, and this means that keys which could often be a shared workload, such as <code>T,Y,G,H,B</code> are now dedicated to a hand. This is also a flaw I see with the "ortho-linear" layouts which remove key staggering. The argument for these optimisations is to remove stretching, which I agree with, but they do it by reducing movement, which I don't.</p>

<p>Instead of forcibly splitting the workload, I share it even more between my hands. But not by stretching! Instead my hands move freely over the keyboard, picking up letters or symbols in awkward places without having to perform difficult stretches with my fingers.</p>

<h3>The problem with home-row typing</h3>

<p>In my personal experience I found home-row typing to actually be unergonomic mostly because of the additional bend required from moving both hands closer together. This produces more strain on your wrist in order for your hand to be straighter on the keyboard. This is one aspect the split-keyboard design does solve, but it's also solvable on a normal keyboard.</p>

<p>It can be alleviated somewhat by moving the keyboard further away from you, allowing your wrists to be straighter. This however often means applying more pressure to the under-side of the wrist or arm as holding the weight of your hands further from your body is more tiring.</p>

<p>Instead I looked back at how I used to type, and realised that although my left hand sat more-or-less in the home-row position, i.e. with the index finger on <code>F</code>, my right hand sat further to the right, with the index finger somewhere between <code>K</code> and <code>L</code>. This is a wider "stance" and results in straighter wrists, as well as less stretching required for the <code>Enter</code> and <code>Right Shift</code> keys.</p>

<h2>This is the Way</h2>

<p>Looking at both instruments and reflecting on how I had typed before <em>The Laptop, First-born of Satan</em>, I settled on some ideas that are completely contrary to the accepted ergonomics of typing:</p>

<ol>
<li>The wrists themselves should not be under strain or pressure, including wrist-rests</li>
<li>The hands should move freely over the keyboard</li>
<li>The idea of "less movement" is incorrect, and instead I should aim for "less stretching"</li>
</ol>

<p>So I eBay'd the Ergodox, and used the money to buy a RealForce Topre keyboard. Weirdly, I bought a Japanese layout keyboard, which has some very slight advantages specific to my work that I'll explain shortly. I also ditched the Workman layout - it's nice, and I would recommend it, but most likely for those writing more prose than those programming. It flows well for words and becomes more awkward when using, say, <code>vim</code>, but it was particularly awkward in combination with the flaws of the Ergodox. Ultimately I dropped it because I realised my issues weren't down to QWERTY.</p>

<p>One aspect of the Ergodox which is nice is the ability to cant the keyboard over or away from you - I recommend doing this. If you raise a keyboard up, say with the feet usually attached at the back, you apply extra strain to the back of your hands to accommodate for the extra angle. Having a flatter keyboard is better in this regard.</p>

<h3>So this weird choice to use a Japanese layout keyboard huh?</h3>

<p><img title="RealForce Topre R2" alt="RealForce Topre R2" src="https://img.senryumedia.net/1ed11afe34645b232188eab4a32ce7d7.jpg"></p>

<p>So I bought a <a href="https://www.realforce.co.jp/products/R2TL-JPV-IV/">Japanese layout RealForce Topre R2 keyboard</a> with variably weighted springs. I love it, it's by far the best keyboard I've ever used. It was also hideously expensive, so if anyone from RealForce is out there and wants to supply me with keyboards to shill I am 100% <em>on-board</em>.</p>

<p>The Japanese layout both is and isn't odd. The extra keys for kana writing can be ignored, I just rebind them in <code>.Xmodmap</code> and use them for things like push-to-talk on Discord. The rest of the layout isn't too far from the UK ISO layout. Where it gets interesting is in the symbols.</p>

<ol>
<li>Double-quotes are above <code>2</code>, which I like as it splits them between the hands. I typically use <code>Right Shift</code>+<code>2</code> to type it</li>
<li>Single-quotes are above <code>7</code>, which is hella weird at first, but actually I now really like it. I use it 50/50 with left or right shift, always using both hands</li>
<li>Both semi-colon and colon are first-level keys. This is awesome for programming</li>
<li><code>@</code> is a first-level key. This is particularly nice for <em>Ruby</em></li>
<li>Underscore is a bit weird, and sits directly next to a shortened shift. This was the hardest key to get used to. I tend to move my right hand over and use two fingers to press the combination</li>
<li>Everything else is slightly shifted from the UK ISO layout but not weirdly so</li>
</ol>

<p>Because I like it so much now, I also have a Bluetooth Japanese-layout HHKB for a travel keyboard, which is very nice. I just stick it on top of any laptop I might have to use, to show who's in charge.</p>

<h3>Demonstration</h3>



<p>This was surprisingly easier to film than I expected. You'll have to forgive me the dusty desk, I currently don't have a carpet in my office so it's almost entirely pointless dusting as it's back to this state within 2 days.</p>

<p>I've noticed my left hand moves less than my right, but you can see that it often covers over to <code>Y</code> and I also move frequently to <code>7</code> for the single-quote on this keyboard. I rarely use my pinky fingers on either hand for letters. The right hand moves very freely across <code>Enter</code>, modifiers, punctuation, and …</p></section></article></section></div></div>

          <p>Istio is one of the most popular and <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/2019/" target="_blank">fast growing</a> open-source projects in the
cloud-native world; while this growth speaks volumes about the value users get from Istio, its rapid release cadence can
also be a challenge for users who may be managing several different versions of Istio clusters at the same time and
manually configuring CA certificates for cloud platforms.</p>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>We launched a new open-source project called GetIstio today, offering users the easiest way to install and upgrade
Istio. GetIstio provides a vetted, upstream distribution of Istio – a hardened image of Istio with continued support
that is simpler to install, manage, and upgrade. It will have integrations with cloud native and popular on-prem
certificate managers (e.g., AWS ACM, Venafi, etc). This launch includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>GetIstio CLI, the easiest way to install, operate, and upgrade Istio. GetIstio provides a safe, vetted, upstream Istio
distro, tested against AKS, EKS, and GKE.</li>
<li>A free, online course on Istio Fundamentals, that is available now at Tetrate Academy.</li>
<li>A new community to bring together Istio and Envoy users and technology partners.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="getistio-cli">GetIstio CLI</h3>
<p>GetIstio is an integration and lifecycle management CLI tool that ensures the use of supported and vetted versions of
Istio. Enterprises require the ability to control Istio versioning, support multiple versions of Istio, easily move
between the versions, integrate with cloud providers’ certification systems, and centralize config management and
validation. The GetIstio CLI tool supports these enterprise-level requirements as it:</p>
<ul>
<li>enforces fetching certified versions of Istio and enables only compatible versions of Istio installation</li>
<li>allows seamlessly switching between multiple istioctl versions</li>
<li>Includes a FIPS-compliant flavor</li>
<li>delivers Istio configuration validations platform based by integrating validation libraries from multiple sources</li>
<li>uses a number of cloud provider certificate management systems to create Istio CA certs that are used for signing
Service-Mesh managed workloads, and</li>
<li>provides multiple additional integration points with cloud providers</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="quick-start">Quick start</h3>
<p>The command below obtains a shell script that downloads and installs the GetIstio binary that corresponds to the OS
distribution detected by the script (currently macOS and Linux are supported). Additionally, the most recent supported
version of Istio is downloaded. Also, the script adds the GetIstio location to the PATH variable (re-login is required
to get PATH populated)</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"> curl -sL https://tetrate.bintray.com/getistio/download.sh | bash
</code></pre></div><p>The following video shows the basic use of the GetIstio command line tool.</p>

<h3 id="get-involved">Get involved</h3>
<p>As part of GetIstio we are also launching a new community for developers, end users and technology partners of Istio,
Envoy, and service mesh. Community is open to all. The GetIstio.io website also includes
<a href="https://getistio.io/istio-in-practice/">practical tutorials</a> for using Istio.</p>
<p>If you want to take your learning to the next level, we have also prepared a free <a href="https://certifications.tetrate.io/" target="_blank">Learn Istio Fundamentals course</a> as part of Tetrate Academy. It is a self-paced
course that has 8 modules with theoretical lessons where we explain the theory and concepts, practical lessons which
consist of labs, and quizzes so you can check your knowledge. Join our weekly meetings, file issues, or ask questions in
Slack. No contribution is too small and your opinions and contributions matter!</p>
<h3 id="getistio-subscription">GetIstio Subscription</h3>
<p>Tetrate provides commercial support for GetIstio for direct access to Istio experts, priority bug fixes and 24/7
support. More details <a href="https://www.tetrate.io/getistio" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Historically, I’ve struggled to find a concise, simple way to explain what it means to practice type-driven design. Too often, when someone asks me “How did you come up with this approach?” I find I can’t give them a satisfying answer. I know it didn’t just come to me in a vision—I have an iterative design process that doesn’t require plucking the “right” approach out of thin air—yet I haven’t been very successful in communicating that process to others.</p>

<p>However, about a month ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/lexi_lambda/status/1182242561655746560">I was reflecting on Twitter</a> about the differences I experienced parsing JSON in statically- and dynamically-typed languages, and finally, I realized what I was looking for. Now I have a single, snappy slogan that encapsulates what type-driven design means to me, and better yet, it’s only three words long:</p>

<p><strong>Parse, don’t validate.</strong></p>
<!-- more-->



<p>Alright, I’ll confess: unless you already know what type-driven design is, my catchy slogan probably doesn’t mean all that much to you. Fortunately, that’s what the remainder of this blog post is for. I’m going to explain precisely what I mean in gory detail—but first, we need to practice a little wishful thinking.</p>

<h2 id="the-realm-of-possibility">The realm of possibility</h2>

<p>One of the wonderful things about static type systems is that they can make it possible, and sometimes even easy, to answer questions like “is it possible to write this function?” For an extreme example, consider the following Haskell type signature:</p>



<p>Is it possible to implement <code>foo</code>? Trivially, the answer is <em>no</em>, as <code>Void</code> is a type that contains no values, so it’s impossible for <em>any</em> function to produce a value of type <code>Void</code>.<sup><a href="#2019-11-05-parse-don-t-validate-footnote-1-definition" name="2019-11-05-parse-don-t-validate-footnote-1-return">1</a></sup> That example is pretty boring, but the question gets much more interesting if we choose a more realistic example:</p>



<p>This function returns the first element from a list. Is it possible to implement? It certainly doesn’t sound like it does anything very complicated, but if we attempt to implement it, the compiler won’t be satisfied:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>head</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span>
<span>head</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span><span>_</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<pre><code>warning: [-Wincomplete-patterns]
    Pattern match(es) are non-exhaustive
    In an equation for ‘head’: Patterns not matched: []</code></pre>

<p>This message is helpfully pointing out that our function is <em>partial</em>, which is to say it is not defined for all possible inputs. Specifically, it is not defined when the input is <code>[]</code>, the empty list. This makes sense, as it isn’t possible to return the first element of a list if the list is empty—there’s no element to return! So, remarkably, we learn this function isn’t possible to implement, either.</p>

<h2 id="turning-partial-functions-total">Turning partial functions total</h2>

<p>To someone coming from a dynamically-typed background, this might seem perplexing. If we have a list, we might very well want to get the first element in it. And indeed, the operation of “getting the first element of a list” isn’t impossible in Haskell, it just requires a little extra ceremony. There are two different ways to fix the <code>head</code> function, and we’ll start with the simplest one.</p>

<h3 id="managing-expectations">Managing expectations</h3>

<p>As established, <code>head</code> is partial because there is no element to return if the list is empty: we’ve made a promise we cannot possibly fulfill. Fortunately, there’s an easy solution to that dilemma: we can weaken our promise. Since we cannot guarantee the caller an element of the list, we’ll have to practice a little expectation management: we’ll do our best return an element if we can, but we reserve the right to return nothing at all. In Haskell, we express this possibility using the <code>Maybe</code> type:</p>



<p>This buys us the freedom we need to implement <code>head</code>—it allows us to return <code>Nothing</code> when we discover we can’t produce a value of type <code>a</code> after all:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>head</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>a</span>
<span>head</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span><span>_</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>x</span>
<span>head</span> <span>[]</span>    <span>=</span> <span>Nothing</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Problem solved, right? For the moment, yes… but this solution has a hidden cost.</p>

<p>Returning <code>Maybe</code> is undoubtably convenient when we’re <em>implementing</em> <code>head</code>. However, it becomes significantly less convenient when we want to actually use it! Since <code>head</code> always has the potential to return <code>Nothing</code>, the burden falls upon its callers to handle that possibility, and sometimes that passing of the buck can be incredibly frustrating. To see why, consider the following code:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>getConfigurationDirectories</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>[</span><span>FilePath</span><span>]</span>
<span>getConfigurationDirectories</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>configDirsString</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>getEnv</span> <span>"CONFIG_DIRS"</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>configDirsList</span> <span>=</span> <span>split</span> <span>','</span> <span>configDirsString</span>
  <span>when</span> <span>(</span><span>null</span> <span>configDirsList</span><span>)</span> <span>$</span>
    <span>throwIO</span> <span>$</span> <span>userError</span> <span>"CONFIG_DIRS cannot be empty"</span>
  <span>pure</span> <span>configDirsList</span>

<span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>configDirs</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>getConfigurationDirectories</span>
  <span>case</span> <span>head</span> <span>configDirs</span> <span>of</span>
    <span>Just</span> <span>cacheDir</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>initializeCache</span> <span>cacheDir</span>
    <span>Nothing</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>error</span> <span>"should never happen; already checked configDirs is non-empty"</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>When <code>getConfigurationDirectories</code> retrieves a list of file paths from the environment, it proactively checks that the list is non-empty. However, when we use <code>head</code> in <code>main</code> to get the first element of the list, the <code>Maybe FilePath</code> result still requires us to handle a <code>Nothing</code> case that we know will never happen! This is terribly bad for several reasons:</p>

<ol>
 <li>
  <p>First, it’s just annoying. We already checked that the list is non-empty, why do we have to clutter our code with another redundant check?</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Second, it has a potential performance cost. Although the cost of the redundant check is trivial in this particular example, one could imagine a more complex scenario where the redundant checks could add up, such as if they were happening in a tight loop.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Finally, and worst of all, this code is a bug waiting to happen! What if <code>getConfigurationDirectories</code> were modified to stop checking that the list is empty, intentionally or unintentionally? The programmer might not remember to update <code>main</code>, and suddenly the “impossible” error becomes not only possible, but probable.</p></li></ol>

<p>The need for this redundant check has essentially forced us to punch a hole in our type system. If we could statically <em>prove</em> the <code>Nothing</code> case impossible, then a modification to <code>getConfigurationDirectories</code> that stopped checking if the list was empty would invalidate the proof and trigger a compile-time failure. However, as-written, we’re forced to rely on a test suite or manual inspection to catch the bug.</p>

<h3 id="paying-it-forward">Paying it forward</h3>

<p>Clearly, our modified version of <code>head</code> leaves some things to be desired. Somehow, we’d like it to be smarter: if we already checked that the list was non-empty, <code>head</code> should unconditionally return the first element without forcing us to handle the case we know is impossible. How can we do that?</p>

<p>Let’s look at the original (partial) type signature for <code>head</code> again:</p>



<p>The previous section illustrated that we can turn that partial type signature into a total one by weakening the promise made in the return type. However, since we don’t want to do that, there’s only one thing left that can be changed: the argument type (in this case, <code>[a]</code>). Instead of weakening the return type, we can <em>strengthen</em> the argument type, eliminating the possibility of <code>head</code> ever being called on an empty list in the first place.</p>

<p>To do this, we need a type that represents non-empty lists. Fortunately, the existing <code>NonEmpty</code> type from <code>Data.List.NonEmpty</code> is exactly that. It has the following definition:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>data</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span> <span>:|</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Note that <code>NonEmpty a</code> is really just a tuple of an <code>a</code> and an ordinary, possibly-empty <code>[a]</code>. This conveniently models a non-empty list by storing the first element of the list separately from the list’s tail: even if the <code>[a]</code> component is <code>[]</code>, the <code>a</code> component must always be present. This makes <code>head</code> completely trivial to implement:<sup><a href="#2019-11-05-parse-don-t-validate-footnote-2-definition" name="2019-11-05-parse-don-t-validate-footnote-2-return">2</a></sup></p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>head</span> <span>::</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span>
<span>head</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:|</span><span>_</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Unlike before, GHC accepts this definition without complaint—this definition is <em>total</em>, not partial. We can update our program to use the new implementation:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>getConfigurationDirectories</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>(</span><span>NonEmpty</span> <span>FilePath</span><span>)</span>
<span>getConfigurationDirectories</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>configDirsString</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>getEnv</span> <span>"CONFIG_DIRS"</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>configDirsList</span> <span>=</span> <span>split</span> <span>','</span> <span>configDirsString</span>
  <span>case</span> <span>nonEmpty</span> <span>configDirsList</span> <span>of</span>
    <span>Just</span> <span>nonEmptyConfigDirsList</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>pure</span> <span>nonEmptyConfigDirsList</span>
    <span>Nothing</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>throwIO</span> <span>$</span> <span>userError</span> <span>"CONFIG_DIRS cannot be empty"</span>

<span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>configDirs</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>getConfigurationDirectories</span>
  <span>initializeCache</span> <span>(</span><span>head</span> <span>configDirs</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Note that the redundant check in <code>main</code> is now completely gone! Instead, we perform the check exactly once, in <code>getConfigurationDirectories</code>. It constructs a <code>NonEmpty a</code> from a <code>[a]</code> using the <code>nonEmpty</code> function from <code>Data.List.NonEmpty</code>, which has the following type:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>nonEmpty</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>(</span><span>NonEmpty</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>The <code>Maybe</code> is still there, but this time, we handle the <code>Nothing</code> case very early in our program: right in the same place we were already doing the input validation. Once that check has passed, we now have a <code>NonEmpty FilePath</code> value, which preserves (in the type system!) the knowledge that the list really is non-empty. Put another way, you can think of a value of type <code>NonEmpty a</code> as being like a value of type <code>[a]</code>, plus a <em>proof</em> that the list is non-empty.</p>

<p>By strengthening the type of the argument to <code>head</code> instead of weakening the type of its result, we’ve completely eliminated all the problems from the previous section:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>The code has no redundant checks, so there can’t be any performance overhead.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Furthermore, if <code>getConfigurationDirectories</code> changes to stop checking that the list is non-empty, its return type must change, too. Consequently, <code>main</code> will fail to typecheck, alerting us to the problem before we even run the program!</p></li></ul>

<p>What’s more, it’s trivial to recover the old behavior of <code>head</code> from the new one by composing <code>head</code> with <code>nonEmpty</code>:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>head'</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>a</span>
<span>head'</span> <span>=</span> <span>fmap</span> <span>head</span> <span>.</span> <span>nonEmpty</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Note that the inverse is <em>not</em> true: there is no way to obtain the new version of <code>head</code> from the old one. All in all, the second approach is superior on all axes.</p>

<p>You may be wondering what the above example has to do with the title of this blog post. After all, we only examined two different ways to validate that a list was non-empty—no …</p></article></div></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3><strong>Remote Friendly is a Vague Term</strong></h3><p>Remote friendly is a term that has abruptly outlived its usefulness. In today's world where <a href="https://www.shinkim.io/posts/shift-to-remote-work-based-on-7-000-hacker-news-job-posts">70% of companies hiring on Hacker News are open to permanent remote positions</a> as of January 2021, one could argue that most of the tech industry is remote friendly. Remote friendly is ambiguous — it could mean that remote candidates are welcome to apply. It might mean that remote employees are surely first-class citizens. Or that the team is remote only.</p><p>Many companies have made formal transitions to embrace remote work in 2020 and they've spelt out their intentions in announcements and interviews. Going through these and the Hacker News job posts in documenting the <a href="https://www.shinkim.io/posts/shift-to-remote-work-based-on-7-000-hacker-news-job-posts">shift to remote during the pandemic</a>, I've noticed that more nuance and specificity had developed to describe a company's stance on remote work. The binary labeling of remote friendly or not doesn't cut it — remote friendliness is a spectrum.</p><p>In 2021, as founders look to guide their onsite team back to the office while blending them with the permanent remote team, they will feel pressure to clarify the company's stance towards remote work. My hope is that the full remote spectrum presented in this article can serve as a framework to help founders decide and articulate where they want to land.</p><h3><strong>The Remote Spectrum</strong></h3><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e12757f0227d019c07ef2b9/6012e857dbc713f0884b771b_yHHoiiAiDWqBx11G5_pfplTa5yzrcRg7L8OmrBPQgWuyE2oi4ehTQ4Rh5WkbmOM5JYUjIj_Z1ERpALJgF-3ipYS7dE9fmcoQfUW2pnIwkhHUDNeS-FB5ve42KOTJ5D7QlYvmwzPi.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Broadly speaking, once the pandemic is over, I propose that all companies should fall under one of the five categories on the remote spectrum. The most remote friendly companies are on one end and the least remote friendly companies are on the other end. Here are descriptions of each of the archetypes:</p><p><strong>Onsite Only</strong></p><p>Onsite only companies will not hire permanent remote employees. Some allow a flexible schedule where employees are free to work from home a few days a week. But employees are not allowed to work remotely indefinitely. A new employee must be either local or willing to relocate.</p><p>Many small startups fall under this category. I could not confirm any scaled technology company (500+ employees) having a 100% onsite employee base. Please correct me if you know otherwise.</p><p><strong>Remote OK</strong></p><p>Remote OK companies are comfortable with having some permanent remote employees. Certain functions like engineering or sales may even have a substantial remote contingent. However, the default mode of work is office-centric. Workflows, collaboration, communication, and events are planned around the onsite team. The remote minority often has a sense of missing out. Founders and most members of the executive team are onsite.</p><p>Examples include<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflixs-reed-hastings-deems-remote-work-a-pure-negative-11599487219"> Netflix</a> and<a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/locations/virtual-locations"> Amazon</a>. Most technology companies belong to this segment of the spectrum.</p><p><strong>Remote Equal</strong></p><p>Remote equal companies take the affirmative stance that remote employees are first class citizens and want to ensure that they are as empowered and productive as onsite employees. The remote employee experience is proactively designed from onboarding and team-building to meeting policies. Personnel — a head of remote or a remote council — and resources are dedicated to ensure remote employees are supported. However, many non-engineering roles may only be offered in an onsite format.</p><p>Examples are<a href="https://stripe.com/blog/remote-hub-one-year"> Stripe</a> and<a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-work-is-changing-at-figma/"> Figma</a>.</p><p><strong>Remote First</strong></p><p>Remote first companies assume the vast majority of employees including the leadership team are remote and remote is the default mode of work. Offices are encouraged to be used for in-person collaboration and team-building activities instead of individual work. Efforts are made to erase synchronous meetings and emphasize documentation. Companies choose remote first over remote equal because they do not have to maintain two modes of work or worry about subtle inequities developing against remote employees.</p><p>Examples are Shopify, Dropbox, Coinbase, Brex, and Quora.</p><p><strong>Remote Only</strong></p><p>Remote only companies exist without an office — the purest form of remote. Some companies were remote only from founding (e.g.<a href="https://getshogun.com/remote-work-guide"> Shogun</a>) and others became incrementally embraced remote (e.g.<a href="https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/our-journey-to-all-remote/"> Sourcegraph</a>). Many companies that started during the pandemic are remote only by accident. Remote only companies may have aligned working hours (e.g. InVision does 10am to 6pm EST) or not (e.g. GitLab). Rapport building and social interactions cannot be left to spontaneous hallway interactions, so remote only companies will regularly host in-person offsites and virtual events.</p><p>Gitlab and InVision are scaled examples (~1,000 employees) of remote only.</p><h3><strong>Traversing the Spectrum</strong></h3><p>Many companies have moved to a different part of the spectrum during the pandemic, with the vast majority moving to a more remote friendly stance. For example, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-21/shopify-is-joining-twitter-in-permanent-work-from-home-shift">Shopify</a>,<a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/company/dropbox-goes-virtual-first"> Dropbox</a>,<a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/post-covid-19-coinbase-will-be-a-remote-first-company-cdac6e621df7"> Coinbase</a>,<a href="https://www.affirm.com/careers"> Affirm</a>,<a href="https://www.quora.com/q/quora/Remote-First-at-Quora"> Quora</a>,<a href="https://medium.com/building-brex/remote-first-at-brex-1252cb30e347"> Brex</a> have all announced their decision to be remote first. As more management teams update and clarify their post-COVID remote stance, here are some questions that are worth asking.</p><p>First, how will you make sure remote employees aren't second-class citizens? The inequities will surface in subtle but pervasive ways — remote employees may feel harder to interject during meetings, only onsite employees may hold the marker if you use a physical whiteboard, and onsite employees may have better access to onsite leadership. This is a tricky problem that requires commitment from onsite and remote employees to address.</p><p>Second, what is the role of the office? The office will continue to host day-to-day work for onsite employees. But as a company hires more remote employees, the office will also take on the role of a home base for remote teams to hold off-sites like for<a href="https://www.fullstory.com/blog//fullstory-goes-remote/"> FullStory</a>. And as the company further leans into remote, the office may become purely a place for in-person collaboration and team-building, like for<a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/company/dropbox-goes-virtual-first"> Dropbox</a>. Consequently, you may need less office space.</p><p>Third, how are you reallocating your budget based on cost-savings from shifting to remote work? Immediate savings will be from reduced office rent, which is estimated to be $1,100-1,400 per employee per month in large cities. In addition, adopting location-based compensation could result in up to 15% compensation adjustment for US companies if an employee moves out of SF or NYC. Companies should partially re-allocate cost-savings into home office or co-working subsidies, travel budgets for team get-togethers, and best-in-class collaboration software.</p><p>Fourth, should you re-think communication protocols? A unanimous refrain among seasoned remote forward companies is the importance of written asynchronous communication. Remote first Grafana Labs anticipates "you will need to persist and distribute more data than you can imagine". And as for synchronous meetings, meeting etiquettes need to be reexamined. For example,<a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/meetings/#avoid-hybrid-calls"> GitLab</a> encourages everyone to use their own camera even if a subset of meeting attendees are sitting in the same room to provide equal footing for everyone.</p><h3><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h3><p>As companies start charting their paths back to the office, management teams that have not figured out a formal go-forward stance on remote work should do so now. Just like the exit from the office happened swiftly across the board, so will the return back to the office. But this time the transition need not be so chaotic and disorderly. Your employees and candidates will rightly be asking to clarify your remote work stance. Where does your company stand on the remote spectrum? The only wrong answer is to not have an answer.</p><p>Follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/_shinkim">Twitter @_shinkim</a> as I&nbsp;continue exploring these trends.</p><p>Thanks to Yin Wu and Chris Cheng for reviewing drafts of this article.</p><p>Source: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=whoishiring">Hacker News: Who is Hiring</a>.

                    <p>On December 1st, 2020, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/want-more-postgresql-you-just-might-like-babelfish/">Amazon AWS announced Babelfish</a>. Babelfish “<em>adds an endpoint to PostgreSQL that understands the SQL Server wire protocol Tabular Data Stream (TDS), as well as commonly used T-SQL commands used by SQL Server. Support for T-SQL includes elements such as the SQL dialect, cursors, catalog views, data types, triggers, stored procedures, and functions</em>”. Wow. <strong>SQL Server wire and application compatibility for PostgreSQL!</strong></p>
<p>What this means is that Babelfish will be able to “impersonate” a SQL Server database. Applications may be able to run unchanged, believing that they are connecting to SQL Server, when they will actually be connecting to PostgreSQL-Babelfish.</p>
<p>Surely, compatibility will not be 100% at the beginning. But it will keep improving, and <strong>as long as it provides enough compatibility for a nice set of applications to run unchanged on Babelfish, it will open the door to migrations and replacing SQL Servers with Babelfish</strong>. This is very good news for the PostgreSQL Community!</p>
<h2 id="brief-analysis-on-postgresql-popularity">Brief analysis on PostgreSQL popularity</h2>
<p><a href="https://db-engines.com/en/blog_post/85">PostgreSQL has been named (again) database of the year 2020</a>. This award is given based on “<em>DBMSs sorted by how much they managed to increase their popularity in 2020</em>”, which means that <strong>PostgreSQL was the database that grew the most in popularity in 2020</strong>. <strong>But in absolute terms, PostgreSQL’s popularity is still way behind that of Oracle, MySQL and SQL Server</strong>. Let’s analyze <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/ranking_trend">db-engines popularity trend chart</a> for the Top4 DBMS, on a linear scale (db-engines presents results on a logarithmic scale):</p>
<p><img src="https://postgresql.fund/img/dbengines_popularity_ranking-linear-900.png" alt="DB-engines popularity ranking - linear scale"></p>
<p>The trends for the last 8 years are clear: Oracle and SQL Server are constantly declining in popularity; MySQL is slightly declining; and PostgreSQL is clearly growing in popularity. But while PostgreSQL almost tripled in popularity in these eight years, it is still far behind the other three.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL became the database of 2020 because its popularity grew the most in the last year. The other three mentioned databases declined in popularity during 2020. If we assume the same rate of change in popularity will continue for the upcoming years, by 2025 PostgreSQL would still remain in the 4th place, albeit close to SQL Server. It won’t overtake SQL Server until 2026, and by 2030 PostgreSQL would still lag behind Oracle and MySQL.</p>

<p>How is this analysis related to Babelfish? <strong>Babelfish opens the door to new users, new markets, new opportunities. <strong>Babelfish may bump PostgreSQL’s popularity further, targeting use cases that either PostgreSQL is not able to reach today; or can only reach via complex technology migrations.</strong> Babelfish could be one of the many potential boosts that PostgreSQL needs in order to become a more universally used database</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="to-fork-or-not-to-fork-thats-the-question">To fork, or not to fork, that’s the question</h2>
<p>In their announcement, AWS said that “<em>We are open sourcing Babelfish in 2021. […] We are releasing Babelfish under the Apache 2.0 license. We invite others to become active in the project, and we will see it as a sign of success when developers outside of AWS become committers or maintainers. You can help by adding or extending Babelfish functionality, submitting feature requests, working on documentation, and contributing test cases</em>”. They also mentioned the code will be published on GitHub.</p>
<p><strong>At the time Babelfish will be published, it will likely require changes to PostgreSQL to enable Babelfish to be an extension</strong>. Some people may call that a “fork” of PostgreSQL, and others may call it a “development branch”. The difference between the two will only be clear over time. Note that PostgreSQL development model doesn’t use feature branches, and in my opinion it’s a great model –but this is an entirely different topic. It is really appreciated that AWS is releasing the code as open source, and under a permissive license (that should be compatible with PostgreSQL’s). <strong>If AWS developers work with the PostgreSQL Community to get the necessary changes merged into PostgreSQL core, then it would have been a development branch, and not a fork. This is something that the PostgreSQL Community and all parties involved need to figure out</strong>.</p>
<p>On January 25th, Amazon AWS made a first move. In an <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/CAGBW59d5SjLyJLt-jwNv%2BoP6esbD8SCB%3D%3D%3D11WVe5%3DdOHLQ5wQ%40mail.gmail.com">email to PostgreSQL’s hackers mailing list</a>, Jan Wieck, a well-known Postgres-er, proposed to start discussing the implementation of protocol hooks. These hooks would enable to implement SQL Server’s protocol as an extension, rather than a fork.</p>
<p>Protocol hooks are, possibly, not the only hooks or modifications to PostgreSQL core that would be required to integrate the whole Babelfish project. With those changes to the core most of the Babelfish code could possibly be integrated in core as an extension(s). I cannot estimate the complexity of these core changes. But I believe that it would be a worthwhile effort, an effort that may further increase PostgreSQL outreach.</p>
<p>Only very recently (Feb 10th, 11th) some initial, very interesting, discussion around this proposal has started (including a very interesting offer to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/CADUqk8UndFi7WHVNZscs4ZCk37_2aBUw-K32QA7sQd_3cJ%2Bqng%40mail.gmail.com">open source MySQL protocol compatibility for Postgres!</a>). It’s understandable, it’s a very busy time for PostgreSQL hackers (the last Commitfest for feature inclusion into PostgreSQL 14 is ongoing). But Babelfish was already announced more than two months ago; and it could be published anytime. I believe we need to start a deeper conversation about Postgres-Babelfish integration sooner than later. And what is being discussed so far are mainly technical considerations around the integration of one of the possibly several integration points that may be required. <strong>I’d love to also have a strategic discussion, where the Community would address, from a leadership perspective, what would be the plans for integrating, or not, Babelfish</strong>. <strong>Is Babelfish the Elephant in the Room?</strong> Probably not anymore, but I anyway hope this post will help, at the very least, to spark the strategic discussion.</p>
<p>What is the alternative? What will happen if PostgreSQL would not implement such hooks or will not pursue understanding with AWS, for the common benefit, and help Babelfish and PostgreSQL cooperate and allow for code bases integration?</p>
<p><strong>Under this scenario, AWS will probably have to keep Babelfish as a fork</strong>. For one, AWS already keeps Aurora as a fork, even though it’s an internal one. Given AWS’ well-known customer obsession and that AWS doesn’t kill services that they started offering, I think that if given no other chance they will keep Babelfish as a separate fork, getting its own share of features and contributors. Surely AWS knows that maintaining a fork is expensive. And I believe they have no intention to have it as a fork (otherwise, they won’t be publishing it as open source). So there will be serious intentions and efforts to merge it into PostgreSQL, for the benefit of all. But the recent Elastic case has demonstrated that AWS is committed to the open source software that is part of their managed services, and are willing to step up with a lot of resources when they are required to continue serving their customers. Apparently AWS has around 200 open job positions (!!) for developers working on Elasticsearch. Surely they can do the same for Babelfish, especially given that RDS Postgres/Aurora/Babelfish is probably a much larger business for them than Elastic.</p>
<h2 id="on-protocol-hooks">On protocol hooks</h2>
<p>Jan also argued that “<em>Creating the necessary infrastructure in the postmaster and backend will open up more possibilities, that are not tied to our compatibility efforts. Possible use cases for wire protocol extensibility include the development of a completely new, not backwards compatible PostgreSQL protocol or extending the existing wire protocol</em>”. I cannot agree more. This effort not only benefits the Babelfish integration; but also opens the door for new PostgreSQL protocols.</p>
<p>The current PostgreSQL protocol (v3) <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/7.4/release-7-4.html">has been in use since PostgreSQL 7.4</a>, released in 2003. It works well, and has spun the broadest possible set of drivers, tools and even compatible databases that use it (like CockroachDB, Crate.io or NoisePage, for example). But it also has some limitations and well-known problems. There is an entry in PostgreSQL “TODO” about <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Todo#Wire_Protocol_Changes_.2F_v4_Protocol">proposed changes for an eventual v4 version of the protocol</a>. I also participated in another <a href="https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/blob/95ba7b261e39754674c5817695ae5ebf9a341fae/backend_protocol_v4_wanted_features.md">“brain dump” on v4 proposed features</a>. But despite much talk, v4 has not happened and there’s no ongoing effort to make it happen. v3 is to stay for long.</p>
<p>Why is that, why can’t the protocol evolve? Have a look at <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/CD5C1525-8B2C-4986-87F0-B1CB3B52ACA7%40wa-research.ch">this thread</a>, where a proposal to implement an HTTP protocol for PostgreSQL was made. Other than the proposal about HTTP itself –which has its own merits, and is a topic that I believe should definitely be discussed again–, the general sentiment was that <strong>any new protocol would have to provide all the features that the current protocol has, work for every use case, do not disrupt existing drivers or provide good means for driver rewrites; and do it significantly better than the current one</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="the-innovators-dilemma">The Innovator’s Dilemma</h2>
<p>I don’t have an MBA, but this to me is a clear case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma">The Innovator’s Dilemma</a>. PostgreSQL protocol v3 is the incumbent, and protocol v4 and/or other protocols like HTTP are the potential disruptive innovators. In what looks like a perfect match for Christensen’s book, a disruptive protocol innovation “<em>would not initially satisfy the demands of even the high end of the market</em>”. In other words, initial versions of these protocols should not target feature parity with the incumbent. They should rather focus on doing the basics, but much better, with a compelling higher value proposition.</p>
<p>Eventually, these protocols “<em>will surpass sustaining technologies</em>” and may end up replacing the current v3 protocol. This was very well explained by Prof. Clayton and is represented on his famous graph comparing the product …</p></div></div></div></div></section></div>

    <p><strong><em>This is a part of the ongoing <a href="https://zverok.github.io/spellchecker.html">“Rebuilding the spellchecker”</a> series, dedicated to explaining how the world’s most popular spellchecker Hunspell works, via its Python port called <a href="https://github.com/zverok/spylls">Spylls</a>. You can start reading from the <a href="https://zverok.github.io/blog/2021-01-05-spellchecker-1.html">first part</a> (or look into the series <a href="https://zverok.github.io/spellchecker.html">TOC</a>), but this is not a requirement: I provide here all the necessary context to follow this article.</em></strong></p>

<p>In the heart of every spellchecker is the algorithm for suggesting corrections, called just <strong>suggest</strong> in Hunspell. Ideally, it should provide a list of suggestions that is comprehensive yet concise, trying hard not to miss the right suggestion for a severely misspelled word, and at the same time not to overwhelm the user with too many variants.</p>

<p>As we’ve seen in the <strong><a href="https://zverok.github.io/blog/2021-01-21-spellchecker-4.html">suggest overview</a></strong>, the task is not only complicated, but also it doesn’t have a singular right answer, and the quality of the solution is quite hard to estimate objectively.</p>

<h2 id="full-dictionary-search">Full dictionary search</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <a href="https://zverok.github.io/blog/2021-01-28-spellchecker-5.html">previous part</a> demonstrates Hunspell’s approach to simple misspellings: it generates a list of “edits” (like inserting one letter, removing one letter, and so on), and tries to find out whether some of them are correct dictionary words. Too often, though, it is not enough: all corrections found via edits are one or two characters different from the misspelling, so the search space is limited. In real life, even the accidental typos of the perfectly educated writer will not always be possible to correct this way. If we consider genuine spelling mistakes, we’ll see a wide range of possibilities for how severely a word can be corrupted while still staying recognizable to the human reader.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When all attempts to generate suggestions based on edits have failed, Hunspell uses another strategy: just stop guessing and <strong>search for similar words through the entire dictionary</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://zverok.github.io/img/spellchecker-6-akchualy.png" alt=""></p>

<!--
```python
from spylls.hunspell import Dictionary

english = Dictionary.from_files('en_US')

print(*english.suggester.suggestions('akchualy'))
# Suggestion[ngram](actually)
# Suggestion[phonet](catchall)
# Suggestion[phonet](actionable)
```
-->

<p>Those who follow the series long enough might remember that we have a problem here: there is <strong>no complete list of all possible words</strong>. Hunspell’s dictionary is <a href="https://zverok.github.io/blog/2021-01-09-spellchecker-2.html">a list of stems and affixes</a> that can be attached to them. Iterating through all possible word forms is computationally expensive—not even mentioning the problem of iterating through <a href="https://zverok.github.io/blog/2021-01-14-spellchecker-3.html">compound words</a>… because the lookup through entire dictionary ignores them completely.</p>

<p>Another problem is how to estimate the similarity of suggestion to a misspelling so it will be aligned with the user’s intuitive understanding. Hunspell uses two approaches (the first one much more often): lexicographical, or <strong>n-gram-based</strong> similarity; and <strong>phonetic</strong> similarity.</p>



<p>For a full-dictionary similarity search, Hunspell first needs to handle the problem of the efficient iteration through the list of possible word forms. Producing them all on the fly is unrealistic performance-wise, so when the <strong>n-gram similarity</strong> is used, Hunspell (and Spylls) acts this way:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Iterate through all the stems and find 100 of them most similar to a misspelled word (with rough-and-quick scoring formula)</li>
  <li>For those 100 stems, generate all possible affix forms and find 200 of them most similar to a misspelled word (with another rough-and-quick scoring formula)</li>
  <li>Calculate a very sophisticated similarity score for those 200 chosen forms</li>
  <li>Sort by the final score, and return the best ones (up to 4)</li>
</ol>

<p>This “funneling” approach—first choosing stems, and then only looking at forms of those stems—means that the whole algorithm is only suitable for dictionaries with long stems and short affixes (where “misspelled word is similar to a stem” = “misspelled word is similar to most of the word”). This assumptions is wrong, for example, for Korean (very short words), or Brazilian Portuguese (“longuissimamente” = “longo” + “uissimamente”).</p>

<p>Scoring formulae are based on <strong>n-gram counting</strong> (though there are more components to each formula). Thus, Hunspell (and Spylls) colloquially refer to this stage of suggestion algorithm as “n-gram search” or “n-gram suggest”. It is just counting <code>n</code>-letter combinations that are common for two different words: the higher the score, the more they are similar. For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>spylls.hunspell.algo.string_metrics</span> <span>import</span> <span>ngram</span>

<span>ngram</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>'actually'</span><span>,</span> <span>'akchualy'</span><span>)</span> <span># n is up to 3
# 11 = a, c, u, a, l, l, y, ua, al, ly, ual
</span>
<span>ngram</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>'actually'</span><span>,</span> <span>'akshuly'</span><span>)</span>
<span># 6 = a, u, a, l, l, y, ly
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The full scoring formulae, though, use not only n-gram counting but several other lexicographical metrics—and are, if I may say, <em>beautifully ad-hoc</em>. It seems that they were grown through years of trial-and-experimentation to choose the coefficients and the order of summands—not related to any theoretical linguistic meaning but just found empirically. Those parts of the algorithms strongly resemble how machine learning works; only, in this case, it were Hunspell developers who adjusted “weights” after each evaluation. <strong>ML analogy is an interesting topic</strong> that we’ll investigate in one of the later chapters.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just to have a taste of it: the detailed similarity score of step 3 is calculated based on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the longest common substring length of the misspelled word and candidate;</li>
    <li>leftmost common substring length;</li>
    <li>the number of same characters in same positions;</li>
    <li>ngram score with N=4;</li>
    <li>and <em>weighted</em> ngram score (absent ngrams add negative points) with N=2.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>It also adds a reward for words with long common substring (putting the candidate in the “very good” bag), and a penalty based on too low 2-gram score and <code>MAXDIFF</code> setting of aff-file (typically putting the candidate in the “very questionable” bag).</p>

  <p>For those more in favor of formal descriptions, <a href="https://spylls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hunspell/algo_ngram_suggest.html#spylls.hunspell.algo.ngram_suggest.precise_affix_score"><code>ngram_suggest.precise_affix_score</code></a> code provides one.</p>

  <p>And the <a href="https://spylls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hunspell/algo_ngram_suggest.html#spylls.hunspell.algo.ngram_suggest.ngram_suggest"><code>ngram_suggest.ngram_suggest</code></a> method gives a full definition of the algorithm.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The math typically pays off:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>english</span><span>.</span><span>suggest</span><span>(</span><span>'procudur'</span><span>))</span>
<span># procedure

<span># magnificent
# ...
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>…but some unexpected results are also quite possible:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>english</span><span>.</span><span>suggester</span><span>.</span><span>suggestions</span><span>(</span><span>'rielistik'</span><span>))</span>
<span># Suggestion[ngram](Kristie)      # The first ones feel "just wrong" for a human :(
# Suggestion[ngram](Christlike)

# Suggestion[ngram](Listerine)
# Suggestion[phonet](realistic)   # Oh, here we are -- phonetic suggestion
# Suggestion[phonet](moralistic)
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The last example brings us to…</p>

<h3 id="phonetic-similarity-useful-yet-unused">Phonetic similarity: useful yet unused</h3>

<p>The “rielistik” example shows a very typical spelling error of a child or non-native language user: the word is spelled close to its remembered pronunciation. Correcting this class of errors requires understanding of the <strong>phonetic similarity</strong> of two lexicographically different words. It is an important feature of a spellchecker—and Hunspell actually implements it… But it so happens that almost no Hunspell user can make use of it. We’ll discuss the reason in a few paragraphs, but first, let’s see how it works.</p>

<p>Phonetic similarity suggestion, like the n-gram-based suggestion, is performed via a full dictionary search. But the similarity is calculated between <em>metaphones codes</em> of misspelled word and each stem, instead of their literal values. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphone">Metaphone</a> is defined in Wikipedia as “a phonetic algorithm […] for indexing words by their English pronunciation”: it is a way of converting words into such representation (metaphone code) that similarly-pronounced words have same or similar representations.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>spylls.hunspell.algo.phonet_suggest</span> <span>import</span> <span>metaphone</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>metaphone</span><span>(</span><span>english</span><span>.</span><span>aff</span><span>.</span><span>PHONE</span><span>,</span> <span>'rielistik'</span><span>))</span>
<span># RLSTK
</span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>metaphone</span><span>(</span><span>english</span><span>.</span><span>aff</span><span>.</span><span>PHONE</span><span>,</span> <span>'realistic'</span><span>))</span>
<span># RLSTK
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that <a href="https://spylls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hunspell/algo_phonet_suggest.html#spylls.hunspell.algo.phonet_suggest.metaphone"><code>metaphone</code></a> (which is the method used by phonetic suggest internally) needs data from aff-file. <code>PHONE</code> directive stores the table of phonetic equivalence in <a href="http://aspell.net/man-html/Phonetic-Code.html">quite complicated format</a>, which was initially designed for aspell spellchecker. Hunspell is an international product, so it can’t include the data for language-specific algorithms in its code and transfers the responsibility of providing it to the dictionary authors.</p>

<p>And here lies the <strong>first problem</strong> of the phonetic suggestions: of all LibreOffice and Firefox dictionaries I’ve checked, only one has <code>PHONE</code> table defined, namely, <code>en_ZA</code> (South African English). Even other English dictionaries—American, British, Canadian, etc.—don’t use this table for reasons that are a mystery for me (but the table is definitely not SA-English specific). I am also not aware of any attempt to create a <code>PHONE</code>-table for languages other than English, though there are several pronunciation-encoding algorithms. Many are multi-lingual or designed for languages other than English (for example, <a href="https://abydos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/abydos.phonetic.html">abydos</a> Python package lists and implements two dozens of state-of-the-art ones).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>en_US</code> dictionary that is distributed with Spylls and used for examples in this article is a Frankenstein made from the latest dictionary from the <a href="http://wordlist.aspell.net/dicts/">SCOWL</a> project (it doesn’t have <code>PHONE</code>), plus <code>PHONE</code> table from the dictionary <a href="http://hunspell.sourceforge.net/en_US.zip">stored</a> on Hunspell’s site which is recommended by Hunspell for suggestion quality testing (the README says it is OpenOffice dictionary from 2007).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <strong>second problem</strong> with Hunspell’s implementation is that, unlike n-gram-based suggestion search, it iterates <strong>only through root stems</strong>. E.g., no word with suffix or prefix would ever be found this way, significantly limiting the probability of a relevant suggestion.</p>

<p><em>Akchualy</em>, I had to spend some time to find the misspelling of “actually” for this article’s title: most of the others wouldn’t have “actually” in a list of suggestions. The phonetic suggestion could’ve solved the issues (as all misspellings have metaphones very similar to the correct word):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>print</span><span>([</span><span>metaphone</span><span>(</span><span>english</span><span>.</span><span>aff</span><span>.</span><span>PHONE</span><span>,</span> <span>word</span><span>)</span>
      <span>for</span> <span>word</span> <span>in</span> <span>[</span><span>'actually'</span><span>,</span> <span>'akshually'</span><span>,</span> <span>'akchualy'</span><span>,</span> <span>'akshully'</span><span>]])</span>
<span># ['*KTL', '*KXL', '*KXL', '*KXL']
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>…but the expected suggestion isn’t provided by Hunspell (or Spylls):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>english</span><span>.</span><span>suggester</span><span>.</span><span>suggestions</span><span>(</span><span>'akshually'</span><span>))</span>
<span># Suggestion[ngram](squally)
# Suggestion[phonet](eggshell)
# Suggestion[phonet](catchall)
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>…because stem “actual” + suffix “ly” will never be considered by phonetic suggest. The same is true for, say, the word “excersized” …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><div><p>Thought experiment: should the use of non-cryptographically secure <code>random()</code> be flagged to developers (examples: <a href="https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blacklists/blacklist_calls.html#b311-random" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bandit</a> and <a href="https://github.com/securego/gosec/blob/a4746e18e3df52bfb21f59420d2c57cb12ef40ec/rules/rand.go#L44" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gosec</a>)? Assume we find the function calls 100% accurately (all true positives, no false positives), and we prevent merging when it’s present.</p>
<p>Academics would say yes — the <code>random()</code> rule always detects what it promises and could be a vulnerability. But the practitioners amongst us are likely to hesitate — does it matter enough to stop engineers’ work? Isn’t <code>random()</code> often used for non-cryptographically sensitive operations?</p>
<p>Herein lies the disconnect between static analysis theory and practice: the world’s most accurate static analysis rule is valueless if developers don’t agree the result has impact, yet as an industry we use the rate of true vs. false positives as the measure of quality.</p>
<p>At r2c we wanted to know how static analysis rules for Semgrep perform in practice. So we set out to create a better metric for <a href="https://semgrep.dev/docs/managing-findings/#analytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Semgrep App</a> users. We call it Fix Rate.</p>
<p>Fix Rate is the percentage of merge-blocking findings that are fixed (i.e., not muted*) in CI. We believe this is a proxy for engineering value. As we run our own developer-focused security programs, we’re obsessing over how to increase the Fix Rate for the rules on our projects.</p>

<p>Observing a bad 0% Fix Rate for <code>random()</code> (with only 7 data points from our projects), we decided to silence the rule for r2c developers but send a Slack notification to the security team using <a href="https://semgrep.dev/docs/managing-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multi-policy projects</a> and <a href="https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep-action/#audit-mode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CI audit mode</a>. Even in this first version, we’re finding Fix Rate incredibly powerful for evolving our own rules, policies, and development practices.</p>
<p>We shared Fix Rate with the Figma security team early on, which they used for rule development.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>With its GitHub integration, Semgrep brings security analysis to where development happens. Figmates get security feedback in their PRs, while rule analytics gives the security team feedback on the effectiveness of our rules and patterns. The simple grep like syntax allows us to extend Semgrep to catch new patterns, going from idea to live in an hour.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>— Dev Akhawe, Head of Security, Figma</em></p>
<p>We’re excited for developer action to determine the efficacy of static analysis rules. For this you need to surface real findings to real engineers writing real code; no pre-existing benchmark will suffice.</p>
<p>To a future of fast, delightful, and confidence-inspiring static analysis.</p>

      <div>
  
  <p><span>09 Feb 2021</span></p><p>Anyone who ever tried to cross-compile a C/C++ program knows how big a PITA the whole process could be. The main reasons for this sorry state of things are generally how byzantine build systems tend to be when configuring for cross-compilation, and how messy it is to set-up your cross toolchain in the first place.</p>

<p>One of the main culprits in my experience has been the GNU toolchain, the decades-old behemoth upon which the POSIXish world has been built for years.
Like many compilers of yore, GCC and its <code>binutils</code> brethren were never designed with the intent to support multiple targets within a single setup, with he only supported approach being installing a full cross build for each triple you wish to target on any given host.</p>

<p>For instance, assuming you wish to build something for FreeBSD on your Linux machine using GCC, you need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A GCC + binutils install for your host triplet (i.e., <code>x86_64-pc-linux-gnu</code> or similar);</li>
  <li>A GCC + binutils complete install for your target triplet (i.e. <code>x86_64-unknown-freebsd12.2-gcc</code>, <code>as</code>, <code>nm</code>, etc)</li>
  <li>A sysroot containing the necessary libraries and headers, which you can either build yourself or promptly steal from a running installation of FreeBSD.</li>
</ul>

<p>This process is sometimes made simpler by Linux distributions or hardware vendors offering a selection of prepackaged compilers, but this will never suffice due to the sheer amount of possible host-target combinations. This sometimes means you have to build the whole toolchain yourself, something that, unless you rock a quite beefy CPU, tends to be a massive waste of time and power.</p>

<h2 id="clang-as-a-cross-compiler">Clang as a cross compiler</h2>

<p>This annoying limitation is one of the reasons why I got interested in LLVM (and thus Clang), which is by-design a full-fledged cross compiler toolchain and is mostly compatible with GNU. A single install can output and compile code <em>for every supported target</em>, as long as a complete sysroot is available at build time.</p>

<p>I found this to be a game-changer, and, while it can’t still compete in convenience with modern language toolchains (such as Go’s gc and <code>GOARCH</code>/<code>GOOS</code>), it’s night and day better than the rigmarole of setting up GNU toolchains. You can now just fetch whatever your favorite package management system has available in its repositories (as long as it’s not extremely old), and avoid messing around with multiple installs of GCC.</p>

<p>Until a few years ago, the whole process wasn’t as smooth as it could be. Due to LLVM not having a full toolchain yet available, you were still supposed to provide a <code>binutils</code> build specific for your target. While this is generally much more tolerable than building the whole compiler (<code>binutils</code> is relatively fast to build), it was still somewhat of a nuisance, and I’m glad that <code>llvm-mc</code> (LLVM’s integrated assembler) and <code>lld</code> (universal linker) are finally stable and as flexible as the rest of LLVM.</p>

<p>With the toolchain now set, the next step becomes to obtain a sysroot in order to provide the needed headers and libraries to compile and link for your target.</p>

<h2 id="obtaining-a-sysroot">Obtaining a sysroot</h2>
<p>A super fast way to find a working system directory for a given OS is to rip it straight out of an existing system (a Docker container image will often also do).
For instance, this is how I used <code>tar</code> through <code>ssh</code> as a quick way to extract a working sysroot from a FreeBSD 13-CURRENT AArch64 VM <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ mkdir ~/farm_tree
$ ssh FARM64 'tar cf - /lib /usr/include /usr/lib /usr/local/lib /usr/local/include' | bsdtar xvf - -C $HOME/farm_tree/
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="invoking-the-cross-compiler">Invoking the cross compiler</h2>

<p>With everything set, it’s now only a matter of invoking Clang with the right arguments:</p>

<p>In the snipped above, I have managed to compile and link a C++ file into an executable for AArch64 FreeBSD, all while using just the <code>clang</code> and <code>lld</code> I had already installed on my GNU/Linux system.</p>

<p>More in detail:</p>
<ol>
  <li><code>--target</code> switches the LLVM default target (<code>x86_64-pc-linux-gnu</code>) to <code>aarch64-pc-freebsd</code>, thus enabling cross-compilation.</li>
  <li><code>--sysroot</code> forces Clang to assume the specified path as root when searching headers and libraries, instead of the usual paths. Note that sometimes this setting might not be enough, especially if the target uses GCC and Clang somehow fails to detect its install path. This can be easily fixed by specifying <code>--gcc-toolchain</code>, which clarifies where to search for GCC installations.</li>
  <li><code>-fuse-ld=lld</code> tells Clang to use <code>lld</code> instead whatever default the platform uses. As I will explain below, it’s highly unlikely that the system linker understands foreign targets, while LLD can natively support <em>almost</em> every binary format and OS <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</li>
  <li><code>-stdlib=libc++</code> is needed here due to Clang failing to detect that FreeBSD on AArch64 uses LLVM’s <code>libc++</code> instead of GCC’s <code>libstdc++</code>.</li>
  <li><code>-lz</code> is also specified to show how Clang can also resolve other libraries inside the sysroot without issues, in this case, <code>zlib</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The final test is now to copy the binary to our target system (i.e. the VM we ripped the sysroot from before) and check if it works as expected:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>rsync zpipe FARM64:<span>"~"</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Success! It’s now possible to use this cross toolchain to build larger programs, and below I’ll give a quick example to how to use it to build real projects.</p>

<h3 id="optional-creating-an-llvm-toolchain-directory">Optional: creating an LLVM toolchain directory</h3>

<p>LLVM provides a mostly compatible counterpart for almost every tool shipped by <code>binutils</code> (with the notable exception of <code>as</code> <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>), prefixed with <code>llvm-</code>.</p>

<p>The most critical of these is LLD, which is a drop in replacement for a plaform’s system linker, capable to replace both GNU <code>ld.bfd</code> and <code>gold</code> on GNU/Linux or BSD, and Microsoft’s <code>LINK.EXE</code> when targeting MSVC. It supports linking on (almost) every platform supported by LLVM, thus removing the nuisance to have multiple specific linkers installed.</p>

<p>Both GCC and Clang support using <code>ld.lld</code> instead of the system linker (which may well be <code>lld</code>, like on FreeBSD) via the command line switch <code>-fuse-ld=lld</code>.</p>

<p>In my experience, I found that Clang’s driver might get confused when picking the right linker on some uncommon platforms, especially before version 11.0.
For some reason, <code>clang</code> sometimes decided to outright ignore the <code>-fuse-ld=lld</code> switch and picked the system linker (<code>ld.bfd</code> in my case), which does not support AArch64.</p>

<p>A fast solution to this is to create a toolchain directory containing symlinks that rename the LLVM utilities to the standard <code>binutils</code> programs:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span> <span>ls</span> <span>-la</span> ~/.llvm/bin/
Permissions Size User  Group Date Modified Name
lrwxrwxrwx    16 marco marco  3 Aug  2020  ar -&gt; /usr/bin/llvm-ar
lrwxrwxrwx    12 marco marco  6 Aug  2020  ld -&gt; /usr/bin/lld
lrwxrwxrwx    21 marco marco  3 Aug  2020  objcopy -&gt; /usr/bin/llvm-objcopy
lrwxrwxrwx    21 marco marco  3 Aug  2020  objdump -&gt; /usr/bin/llvm-objdump
lrwxrwxrwx    20 marco marco  3 Aug  2020  ranlib -&gt; /usr/bin/llvm-ranlib
lrwxrwxrwx    21 marco marco  3 Aug  2020  strings -&gt; /usr/bin/llvm-strings
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>-B</code> switch can then be used to force Clang (or GCC) to search the required tools in this directory, stopping the issue from ever occurring:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span> clang++ <span>-B</span><span>$HOME</span>/.llvm/bin <span>-stdlib</span><span>=</span>libc++ <span>--target</span><span>=</span>aarch64-pc-freebsd <span>--sysroot</span><span>=</span><span>$HOME</span>/farm_tree <span>-std</span><span>=</span>c++17 <span>-o</span> mvd-farm64 mvd.cc

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What would happen if a &lt;iframe&gt; tag on a page pointed to the same page ? In HTML, iframes are elements designed to display documents under an URL, as if we would load it as we normally do in our browsers. See it as a small window within a web document which can display another web document. For instance, what you see here is an &lt;iframe&gt; pointing to the homepage of this website, <strong>https://ciphrd.com</strong>:</p>







<p><em>On a side note, the technique I am going to present is not really “feedback” per say, it’s more like a regular loop, but it reminds so much of a feedback effect that I found the name appropriate.</em> <strong>Source code at the end.</strong></p>



<h4>1. The most basic &lt;iframe&gt; loop</h4>



<p>Just as a quick reminder, this is how an iframe can be used:</p>



<pre><code lang="markup">&lt;iframe src="https://ciphrd.com"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code></pre>



<p>The browser, when coming accros this tag, reads the <em>src</em> attribute and loads the web document under the URL into the area available for the iframe. Such area can be defined with <strong>CSS</strong> rules, or by setting a width and height attribute to the tag. For more informations, see the article about <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_iframe.asp" target="_blank">html iframe on W3Schools</a> [1].</p>



<p>Now, the idea behind &lt;iframe&gt; feedback: let the src attribute point to the same location as the page in which the &lt;iframe&gt; is displayed. To experiment with such idea, I built a very simple html page and I hosted it on a local server at <strong>http://localhost:8080/</strong></p>



<pre><code lang="markup">&lt;!doctype&nbsp;html&gt;
&lt;html&nbsp;lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta&nbsp;charset="UTF-8"&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta&nbsp;name="viewport"&nbsp;content="width=device-width"&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;iframe loop&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h1&gt;iframe&nbsp;loop&lt;/h1&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;iframe&nbsp;src="http://localhost:8080"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>



<p>By loading http://localhost:8080/ in the browser, the document should be displayed and the &lt;iframe&gt; should display the same document, over and over. With some very simple rules we can define the size of our iframe:</p>



<pre><code lang="css">iframe&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;width:&nbsp;500px;
&nbsp;&nbsp;height:&nbsp;320px;
}

h1&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;margin:&nbsp;20px;
}</code></pre>



<p>Let’s see how it is handled by chrome (88.0.4324.150):</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="350" srcset="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic.jpg 922w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic-300x181.jpg 300w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic-768x464.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px"><figcaption>1. Our most basic example</figcaption></figure>



<p>Oh, that’s weird. It looks like the browser only loads the first &lt;iframe&gt; and then prevents an infinite loop from happening by removing the contents of the 2nd nested &lt;iframe&gt;. A quick inspection of the HTML tree will confirm our hypothesis:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="734" height="459" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tree-inspection.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tree-inspection.jpg 734w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tree-inspection-300x188.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 734px) 100vw, 734px"><figcaption>2. Inspecting the HTML tree computed by Chrome</figcaption></figure>



<p>So, the hypothesis is verified. We cannot nest infinite &lt;iframe&gt; tags because the browser prevents it, which is normal if we think about it. We wouldn’t want our computer to freeze if we were to load a webpage using such a trick.</p>



<h4>2. How to nest any number of &lt;iframe&gt;</h4>



<p>The issue here, is that the &lt;iframe&gt; tag is already present on the document loaded by the browser. Let’s see what happens if we insert the tag after the page has loaded, using javascript. Let’s reduce our HTML page to the following:</p>



<pre><code lang="markup">&lt;!doctype&nbsp;html&gt;
&lt;html&nbsp;lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta&nbsp;charset="UTF-8"&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta&nbsp;name="viewport"&nbsp;content="width=device-width"&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;Iframe&nbsp;loop&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h1&gt;iframe&nbsp;loop&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>



<p>And let’s write some Javascript which will insert the tag as soon as the page is loaded:</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript">const&nbsp;iframe&nbsp;=&nbsp;document.createElement('iframe')
iframe.src&nbsp;=&nbsp;location.href
document.body.append(iframe)</code></pre>



<p>The following javascript code needs to be loaded in the page somehow, the &lt;script&gt; tag can be used in that matter. However, because I am using <strong>webpack</strong>, my javascript gets automatically added to the document. The project I created for you to experiment with iframe feedback has the same feature, I’ll explain in <strong>on the last part of this article</strong>. For now, just assume that the javascript is added to the page. Let’s see what happens now:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="922" height="557" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic.jpg 922w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic-300x181.jpg 300w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic-768x464.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 922px) 100vw, 922px"><figcaption>3. Inserting the &lt;iframe&gt; tag programatically</figcaption></figure>



<p>The same issue remains. Maybe we can try with a delay ?</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript">setTimeout(()&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;this&nbsp;code&nbsp;will&nbsp;be&nbsp;executed&nbsp;1000ms&nbsp;after&nbsp;the&nbsp;script&nbsp;has&nbsp;loaded</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;const&nbsp;iframe&nbsp;=&nbsp;document.createElement('iframe')
&nbsp;&nbsp;iframe.src&nbsp;=&nbsp;location.href
&nbsp;&nbsp;document.body.append(iframe)
},&nbsp;1000)</code></pre>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="922" height="557" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic.jpg 922w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic-300x181.jpg 300w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic-768x464.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 922px) 100vw, 922px"><figcaption>4. Inserting the &lt;iframe&gt; tag after a delay of 1sec</figcaption></figure>



<p>Okay, so it looks like we cannot just nest infinite &lt;iframe&gt; this way. Maybe we need to trick the browser into thinking that the page displayed is not the same. To do that, I configured my local server so that any path provided after the URL will point to the index.html. So, if I try to load <strong>http://localhost:8080/home</strong>, <strong>http://localhost:8080/cucumber</strong>, <strong>http://localhost:8080/zeagjaga/ergjergeg/erg</strong>,… , the same index.html file will be loaded. We can now configure our script to set the <strong>src</strong> tag to the same domain plus a random string of characters:</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript">setTimeout(()&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;const&nbsp;iframe&nbsp;=&nbsp;document.createElement('iframe')
&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;adds&nbsp;a&nbsp;random&nbsp;string&nbsp;of&nbsp;7&nbsp;characters&nbsp;after&nbsp;the&nbsp;domain</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;iframe.src&nbsp;=&nbsp;location.origin&nbsp;+&nbsp;'/'&nbsp;+&nbsp;Math.random().toFixed(7).replace('.',&nbsp;'')
&nbsp;&nbsp;document.body.append(iframe)
},&nbsp;1000)</code></pre>



<p>Let’s see what happens…</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="921" height="558" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-its-looping.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-its-looping.jpg 921w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-its-looping-300x182.jpg 300w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-its-looping-768x465.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 921px) 100vw, 921px"><figcaption>5. Iframes with a different URL pointing to the same page</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Hehehe</strong>… It’s working. A quick inspection of the DOM can confirm this hypothesis:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="687" height="533" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5-looping-DOM.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5-looping-DOM.jpg 687w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5-looping-DOM-300x233.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 687px) 100vw, 687px"><figcaption>6. The DOM of our infinite nested iframes</figcaption></figure>



<p>Wonderful ! So, to nest “<em>self-replicating</em>” &lt;iframe&gt; tags, the constraints are the following:</p>



<ul><li>the URL path must be different</li><li>a server must be configured so that different URL points to the same document</li></ul>



<p>That’s it. We don’t even need the delay before inserting the &lt;iframe&gt;. I will keep it though, I don’t really want the browser to crash because of that (not that it will, but if we want to do more fun stuff than just adding a new &lt;iframe&gt;, it might).</p>



<h4>3. Having fun</h4>



<p>Now that we found a way to load as many nested &lt;iframe&gt; as we want, let’s have some fun ! First, let’s change the size of an &lt;iframe&gt; so that its dimensions are relative to the viewport area it renders to:</p>



<pre><code lang="css">iframe&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;width:&nbsp;90vw;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;90%&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;width</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;height:&nbsp;90vh;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;90%&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;height</em>
}

h1&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;position:&nbsp;absolute;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;makes&nbsp;the&nbsp;title&nbsp;"float"&nbsp;on&nbsp;the&nbsp;top&nbsp;left</em>
}</code></pre>



<p>Which will give us a way better result in terms of space occupation of the iframe elements:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="921" height="559" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6-better-size.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6-better-size.jpg 921w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6-better-size-300x182.jpg 300w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6-better-size-768x466.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 921px) 100vw, 921px"><figcaption>7. &lt;iframe&gt; dimensions are related to their parent dimensions</figcaption></figure>



<p>I guess you understand now why I called this technique <em>iframe feedback</em>. It just looks like it. However, <strong>this is by no mean true feedback</strong>.</p>



<p>We can remove the title and assign a random color to the background of the body to create a simple color effect:</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript"><em>//&nbsp;set&nbsp;a&nbsp;random&nbsp;color&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;body&nbsp;background,&nbsp;&nbsp;x|0&nbsp;removes&nbsp;the&nbsp;decimal&nbsp;part&nbsp;of&nbsp;x</em>
document.body.style.backgroundColor&nbsp;=&nbsp;`rgba(${(Math.random()*255)|0},&nbsp;${(Math.random()*255)|0},&nbsp;${(Math.random()*255)|0},&nbsp;1)`

setTimeout(()&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;const&nbsp;iframe&nbsp;=&nbsp;document.createElement('iframe')
&nbsp;&nbsp;iframe.src&nbsp;=&nbsp;location.origin&nbsp;+&nbsp;'/'&nbsp;+&nbsp;Math.random().toFixed(7).replace('.',&nbsp;'')
&nbsp;&nbsp;document.body.append(iframe)
},&nbsp;200)</code></pre>



<figure><video controls="" muted="" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/8-simple-colors.mp4"></video><figcaption>8. Setting a random color to the body of the document</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you are familiar with writing web applications, you may see now how much fun we can have with this technique. Let’s try adding some <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations" target="_blank">CSS animations</a></strong> [2] to the position of the &lt;iframe&gt;:</p>



<pre><code lang="css">body&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;margin:&nbsp;0;
&nbsp;&nbsp;overflow:&nbsp;hidden;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;hides&nbsp;the&nbsp;scrollbar&nbsp;if&nbsp;window&nbsp;gets&nbsp;too&nbsp;small</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;width:&nbsp;100vw;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;set&nbsp;the&nbsp;body&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;same&nbsp;size&nbsp;as&nbsp;the&nbsp;viewport</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;height:&nbsp;100vh;
}

<em>@keyframes</em>&nbsp;move&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;from&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;top:&nbsp;0;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;left:&nbsp;0;
&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;top:&nbsp;10vh;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;left:&nbsp;10vw;
&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}

iframe&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;width:&nbsp;90vw;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;90%&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;width</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;height:&nbsp;90vh;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;90%&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;height</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;position:&nbsp;absolute;
&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;the&nbsp;iframe&nbsp;with&nbsp;receive&nbsp;animation&nbsp;move&nbsp;and&nbsp;loops&nbsp;by&nbsp;alternating&nbsp;directions</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;animation:&nbsp;move&nbsp;1s&nbsp;ease-in-out&nbsp;0s&nbsp;infinite&nbsp;alternate-reverse;
}</code></pre>



<p>I’m not going into in-depth details about what this CSS animation does. But here is the result:</p>



<figure><video controls="" muted="" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/9-animatee-position.mp4"></video><figcaption>9. Animating the iframe position using CSS rules</figcaption></figure>



<p>We can add some rotation to the animation:</p>



<pre><code lang="css"><em>@keyframes</em>&nbsp;move&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;from&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;top:&nbsp;0;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;left:&nbsp;0;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transform:&nbsp;rotate(-20deg);
&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;top:&nbsp;10vh;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;left:&nbsp;10vw;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transform:&nbsp;rotate(20deg);
&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}</code></pre>



<figure><video controls="" muted="" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/9-adding-rotation.mp4"></video><figcaption>10. Adding rotation to the CSS animation</figcaption></figure>



<p>Pretty fun ! What’s great is that we can take fulfill of all the sweet features made available by our browsers to have fun with this technique. Some issues remain though:</p>



<ul><li>&lt;iframe&gt; tags are added indefinitely</li><li>each &lt;iframe&gt; is independent, we have no way to know its position in the tree</li></ul>



<p>Let’s solve those issues and create a basic starting point from which <strong>experimentation with this technique can safely be done </strong>!</p>



<h4>4. Improving the solution</h4>



<p>First of all, we can define an easy solution to prevent iframes from being inserted indefinitely. If the viewport size reaches 0, there is no need to insert an iframe because it won’t have any effect on the screen:</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript"><em>try</em>&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>if</em>&nbsp;(window.innerWidth&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;1&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;window.innerHeight&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;1)&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>throw</em>&nbsp;new&nbsp;Error()&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;exit</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}

&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;otherwise&nbsp;add&nbsp;the&nbsp;iframe&nbsp;as&nbsp;usual</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;...</em>
}
<em>catch</em>&nbsp;(error)&nbsp;{}&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;exit</em></code></pre>



<p>The trick I am using here provides a way to <em>exit</em> the main script by using the try… catch mechanism. If we throw an error in the <strong>try</strong>{} block, what’s after will be skipped and the <strong>catch</strong>{} block will be triggered. If there were no catch block, the script would still stop but the error would be sent to the <strong>console as “Uncaught Error”</strong>. Yes, that’s what it is.</p>



<p>We now have a safe guard to prevent infinite looping in most cases. What we could need is to find a way to get the index of the document in the &lt;iframe&gt; <strong>nested nightmare</strong>. Remember, we currently use the following trick to call for a new iframe:</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript">iframe.src&nbsp;=&nbsp;location.origin&nbsp;+&nbsp;'/'&nbsp;+&nbsp;Math.random().toFixed(7).replace('.',&nbsp;'')</code></pre>



<p>The <strong>location </strong>object [3] has different properties we can use to solve our problem. Let’s see what the <strong>location object</strong> is on the page <em>https://ciphrd.com/category/laboratory/</em> :</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="565" height="286" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/11-location.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/11-location.jpg 565w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/11-location-300x152.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px"><figcaption>11. The Location object on <em>https://ciphrd.com/category/laboratory/</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>It seems like the <strong>origin </strong>property stores whats before the first <strong>/</strong> and the <strong>pathname</strong> stores what’s after the origin (https://ciphrd.com), including the first <strong>/</strong>. Let’s use those properties to keep track of the index of each frame:</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript"><em>//&nbsp;gets&nbsp;what's&nbsp;after&nbsp;the&nbsp;first&nbsp;/&nbsp;,&nbsp;so&nbsp;the&nbsp;first&nbsp;url&nbsp;path</em>
<em>//&nbsp;or&nbsp;0&nbsp;if&nbsp;the&nbsp;path&nbsp;is&nbsp;empty&nbsp;(so&nbsp;t…</em></code></pre></div></div>

February 11, 2021 | https://litestream.io/blog/why-i-built-litestream/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://litestream.io/blog/why-i-built-litestream/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="document"><div><div><div><article><p><em>tl;dr—Despite an exponential increase in computing power, our applications
require more machines than ever because of architectural decisions made 25 years
ago. You can eliminate much of your complexity and cost by using SQLite &amp;
Litestream for your production applications.</em></p><h2 id="when-i-was-your-age">When I was your age…</h2><p>I can tell I’m getting old because I talk about the “good old days” of computing.
Back when knowing a single programming language and SQL was good enough to work
at most jobs. Back when you could build all your web pages with basic HTML skills.</p><p>But the good old days weren’t actually that good.</p><p>They kinda sucked.</p><p>In 1995, the <a href="https://tedium.co/2019/10/01/lamp-stack-php-mysql-apache-history/">LAMP stack</a> emerged. It was a combination of Linux, Apache,
MySQL, &amp; PHP. It’s a simple stack that all lived on one box. Unfortunately, that
box was stocked with a CPU that was measured in megahertz and memory that was
measured in megabytes. It was dog slow.</p><p>But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore’s Law</a> promised a better future as computers became
exponentially faster. So why do we need more computers than ever before?</p><h3 id="where-it-went-wrong">Where it went wrong</h3><p>Since early web languages like PHP and Ruby were slow, you didn’t want them
running on your database server so you moved them to their own servers in what
is called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture">n-tier architecture</a>. Now you can keep adding more
stateless Ruby servers to this <em>presentation layer</em> and scale your application.</p><p>Database servers like Oracle, PostgreSQL, and MySQL tended to be complicated to
operate so this architecture helped to isolate them. Scaling and managing
a fleet of database servers is a nighmare so organizations scale up their
database machine vertically as much as possible before they scaled horizontally
to multiple servers.</p><p>This n-tier architecture sounds simple at first but it has hidden complexity. On
a single machine, our server could add an in-memory cache to speed up requests
but now data is shared across multiple machines so we must add a <a href="https://memcached.org/">memcached</a>
or <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> server to share cached data. Database servers are easily overloaded
by numerous connections so we have to add intermediate services like
<a href="https://www.pgbouncer.org/">PgBouncer</a> to pool connections. If we have events in our system that must be
communicated to all our nodes then we need a cluster of <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Kafka</a> machines.</p><p>Now we have a fleet of machines to manage. These systems have then caused an
explosion in infrastructure automation with tooling like <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>. All of
these layers slow us down from our job of writing software systems that solve
real problems.</p><p>What started as a simple two-tier software system has grown into a behemoth with
a dozen layers of complexity.</p><p>Complexity begets complexity.</p><h2 id="building-litestream">Building Litestream</h2><p>My background is in writing databases. Seven years ago, I wrote a pure Go,
embedded key/value store called <a href="http://github.com/boltdb/bolt">BoltDB</a> that has seen success in other
open-source applications that use it such as <a href="https://etcd.io/">etcd</a>.</p><p>For a while, I used Bolt when writing applications and it was refreshing because
there were no depedencies to set up and performance was <em>blazingly fast</em>.
However, it lacked features like schema migration, a query language, or a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a> so it made application development difficult. But instead of going back
to database servers like Postgres, I turned to <a href="https://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>.</p><h3 id="moving-to-sqlite">Moving to SQLite</h3><p><em>“But nobody writes production applications with SQLite, right?"</em></p><p>No, there’s a growing movement of people that see the value of single process
applications. Expensify has run tests of <a href="https://blog.expensify.com/2018/01/08/scaling-sqlite-to-4m-qps-on-a-single-server/">4 million queries per second on a
single node</a> using SQLite. <a href="https://twitter.com/davidcrawshaw">David Crawshaw</a> has a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqubKSF3wig">conference talk</a> and <a href="https://crawshaw.io/blog/one-process-programming-notes">blog post</a> on building
single process applications on SQLite. Django co-creator <a href="https://simonwillison.net/">Simon
Willison</a> built a data exploration and publishing tool called
<a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> that’s built on SQLite.</p><p>SQLite is known for being bulletproof and having an <a href="https://litestream.io/blog/why-i-built-litestream/sqlite-testing">absurdly in-depth testing
suite</a>. It’s motto is <em>“Small. Fast. Reliable. Choose any three."</em></p><p>So why is SQLite considered a “toy” database in the application development
world and not a production database?</p><h3 id="that-one-big-issue">That one big issue</h3><p>The biggest problem with using SQLite in production is disaster recovery. If
your server dies, so does your data. That’s… not good.</p><p>Other database servers have replication so they can stream database changes to
another server in case one goes down. The best you can hope for with standard
SQLite is to run a nightly backup. Solutions like <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite">rqlite</a> are great but
it requires a 3-node cluster.</p><p>Why can’t SQLite have a replication tool that’s as easy to use as SQLite?</p><h3 id="the-problem-litestream-solves">The problem Litestream solves</h3><p>I built Litestream to bring back sanity to application development. Litestream
is a tool that runs in a separate process and continuously replicates a SQLite
database to Amazon S3. You can get up and running with a few
lines of configuration. Then you can set-it-and-forget-it and get back to
writing code.</p><p>You might think this sounds expensive to continuously write to cloud storage
that provides <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/">99.99% uptime</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/">99.999999999% durability</a> but
it’s astoundingly cheap. Typical costs are only about $1 per month. Litestream
is free and open-source too so there’s never a license to pay for.</p><h3 id="but-i-need-100-uptime">But I need 100% uptime…</h3><p>The software industry has chased uptime as a goal in and of itself over the last
several decades. Solutions such as Kubernetes tout the benefits of zero-downtime
deployments but ignore that their inherent complexity causes availability
issues. <a href="https://k8s.af/">There’s even a web site dedicated to public postmortems related to
Kubernetes.</a></p><p>Most cloud providers provide multiple layers of redundancy in their systems to
protect against individual node and network failures. This doesn’t provide a
100% guarantee but will provide you with very high uptime servers. Anecdotally,
I’ve run several VPS servers over the years which all have well over 99.9%
uptime and have suffered no catastrophic failures.</p><h3 id="sounds-good-but-how-do-you-scale-this">Sounds good, but how do you scale this?</h3><p>Developers always want to know how to scale but that depends on their particular
application. Typically, you want to scale vertically first by simply increasing
amount of CPUs cores and RAM on your machine first.</p><p>Servers these days have a <em>ton</em> of power. I recently wrote a Go web application
with a SQLite database that would serve an HTTP request with multiple database
queries in under <em>50µs</em> on a $5/month VPS. That translates to thousands of
requests per second per core. SQLite scales reads well with the number of cores
on a machine. Amazon AWS has machines that can then scale up to 96 CPU cores and
hundreds of gigabytes of RAM.</p><p>If you exceed the capacity of a single node, sharding your data can allow you to
scale horizontally to multiple nodes. This works particularly well for SaaS
applications where each customer is isolated from one another. Because SQLite
and Litestream simplify deployment, managing a cluster of several isolated nodes
is easy to maintain.</p><h2 id="the-future-of-litestream">The Future of Litestream</h2><p>Litestream is helping to simplify application development but that’s only the
start of it. There are exciting features coming including replication to
<a href="https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream/issues/8">read-only replicas</a>. This will give you the ability to run local
copies of your database at the edge to deliver requests instantly.</p><p>If you’re interested in trying out Litestream, the <a href="https://litestream.io/getting-started">Getting
Started</a> can get you up and running in less than 10 minutes.</p><p>I’m interested to hear from others that want to simplify and improve application
development. If you have ideas or thoughts about the future of Litestream,
please get in touch on the <a href="https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream/discussions">GitHub Discussions board</a> and drop me a
line.</p><p><em>Update: This post sparked a lot of discussion on Hacker News that you can <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26103776">read here</a>.</em></p><p>—Ben Johnson (<a href="https://twitter.com/benbjohnson">@benbjohnson</a>)</p></article></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

  Cosmopolitan lets you build executables that run natively on seven
  operating systems. One of the first questions C/C++ developers ask is
  how much bloat does that entail? Is the Cosmopolitan Runtime lean and
  mean like Go's 2mb Hello World executables? Or is it a monster like
  Electron or those hundred megabyte OpenJDK shell scripts.

</p><p>
  The answer is it takes about 12kb. That's how big a statically-linked
  executable needs to be to run natively without dependencies on Linux,
  Mac, Windows, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and BIOS. Cosmopolitan is
  designed to let you build such programs. This page will demonstrate
  why the portability benefits Cosmopolitan provides have negligible
  performance impact and therefore only serve to save time while
  ensuring your work can reach a broader audience.

  The form below lets you build and visualize hello world programs with
  a customized support vector. It will show you exactly what goes into
  an <a href="https://justine.lol/ape.html" title="Actually Portable Executable">αcτµαlly
  pδrταblε εxεcµταblε</a> that lets it integrate with so many systems.
  Since seeing is believing, the hope is that you'll choose to trust
  Cosmopolitan as your POSIX-comforming systems abstraction.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>React was introduced in May 2013. Its paradigm shift was that <strong>your UI was a function of your state</strong>. Given some component state, React can determine what your component will look like. React is <em>built</em> upon the idea of state. However, state has long been one of the most difficult parts of building a React application.</p><p>Let's imagine state management in React as a rugged tool belt. You've used this tool belt for years, slowly adding new tools as needed. Each tool serves a very specific purpose. You don't use your hammer to screw in bolts. As a craftsman, you've learned the right time and place to use each tool.</p><p><strong>State management with React is a rugged tool belt, but not everyone has the prior experience to know which tool to reach for.</strong> This post will explain the past, present, and future of state management to help you make the correct decision for your team, project, or organization.</p><h2 id="glossary">Glossary</h2><p>Before we begin, it's critical you understand some of the terms commonly used. These aren't the canonical names. A few different variations of each float around, but the underlying ideas are the same:</p><ul><li>UI State â€“ State used for controlling interactive parts of our application (e.g. dark mode toggle, modals).</li><li>Server Cache State â€“ State from the server, which we cache on the client-side for quick access (e.g. call an API, store the result, use it in multiple places).</li><li>Form State â€“ The many different states of a form (e.g. loading, submitting, disabled, validation, retrying). There's also <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html">controlled &amp; uncontrolled form state</a>.</li><li>URL State â€“ State managed by the browser (e.g. filter products, saving to query parameters, and refreshing the page to see the same products filtered)</li><li>State Machine â€“ An explicit model of your state over time (e.g. a stoplight goes from green â†’ yellow â†’ red, but never green â†’ red).</li></ul><h2 id="past">Past</h2><p>React's component model helped create reusable, composable applications. Each component had its own local state. As web apps became more complex, new solutions emerged to more easily share logic between components.</p><h3 id="timeline">Timeline</h3><p>To help you understand how state management has evolved over time, here's a rough timeline of popular state management solutions in React. This list is heavily focused on UI State. This list is not comprehensive, but is enough to give context.</p><ul><li>2013 â€“ Introduction</li><li>2014 â€“ Flux (many libraries)</li><li>2015 â€“ Redux</li><li>2016 â€“ MobX</li><li>2018 â€“ Context</li><li>2019 â€“ Hooks Introduced (+ React Query, SWR)</li><li>2019 â€“ Zustand</li><li>2019 â€“ xState</li><li>2020 â€“ Jotai, Recoil, Valtio</li><li>2021 â€“ useSelectedContext</li></ul><p>Just because an item is listed on this timeline does not mean you need to learn it. More on this later. Let's dive into the history of state management in React.</p><h3 id="redux">Redux</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://redux-toolkit.js.org/">Redux</a> was originally created as an implementation of the "<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-1/#redux-was-built-as-a-flux-architecture-implementation">Flux Architecture</a>", which was a pattern first suggested by Facebook in 2014. Redux came out in 2015 and quickly became the most popular of many Flux-inspired libraries. It's ecosystem of tools and libraries encapsulated both UI state and server caching state. <strong>Redux is still extremely popular and widely used.</strong></p><div><p><img alt="Redux Growth" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><h3 id="server-caching-state">Server Caching State</h3><p>In the early days of React, lots of state management boiled down to fetching data from APIs and caching it for use across the application. The community leaned heavily on libraries like Redux because there wasn't an easy, widely used way to manage <em>just</em> the server cache state.</p><p>With the release of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.html">React Hooks</a>, encapsulating logic into shared hooks became much easier and accessible. Libraries like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://swr.vercel.app/">SWR</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://react-query.tanstack.com/">React Query</a> emerged to solve this problem specifically.</p><p>You might think "Why have a separate library just for server caching state?". Well, <strong>caching is hard</strong>. Server caching state solves different problems than UI state. Here's a shortlist of some of the things these libraries handle for you:</p><ul><li>Polling on interval</li><li>Revalidation on focus</li><li>Revalidation on network recovery</li><li>Local mutation (Optimistic UI)</li><li>Smart error retrying</li><li>Pagination and scroll position recovery</li></ul><p>Do you want to implement those yourself? <em>Probably not.</em></p><h3 id="react-context">React Context</h3><p>With <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/29/react-v-16-3.html">v16.3</a>, React Context gave us a first-party solution to share logic between components. This also prevented passing values down as props through multiple levels of nested components (i.e. "<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/prop-drilling">prop-drilling</a>").</p><p>React Context itself is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2021/01/context-redux-differences/">not state management</a>. It can, however, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/application-state-management-with-react">be paired with hooks</a> like <code>useReducer</code> to become a state management solution. This combination solved UI state for many common use cases.</p><div><p><img alt="React Context" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><h2 id="present">Present</h2><p>In 2021, there are various ways to handle state management in React. As the community has grown to understand the different types of state, more granular libraries have been created solving very specific use cases.</p><h3 id="state-machines">State Machines</h3><p>Let's consider a switch statement. If the value of <code>state</code> matches any <code>case</code>, the corresponding code runs. There's a finite set of cases. This is the most simple state machine â€“ an explicit model of your state.</p><pre><code><span>switch</span> <span>(</span>state<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>case</span> state <span>===</span> <span>'loading'</span><span>:</span>
    
    <span>break</span><span>;</span>
  <span>case</span> state <span>===</span> <span>'success'</span><span>:</span>
    
    <span>break</span><span>;</span>
  <span>default</span><span>:</span>
  
<span>}</span>
</code></pre><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://xstate.js.org/docs/about/concepts.html#finite-state-machines">Finite State Machines</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://xstate.js.org/docs/about/concepts.html#statecharts">Statecharts</a> are fundamental Computer Science concepts, so this isn't anything React specific. You can turn <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer"><code>useReducer</code></a> into a state machine without any third-party libraries.</p><p>State Machines are well-adopted everywhere, including databases, electronics, cars, and more. As state management evolved in the React ecosystem, we realized these old ideas could solve modern state management issues. State Machines are most prevalent for solving form state.</p><p>With a Finite State Machine, you have a finite number of states your application or component could be in. In practice, State Machines help you uncover bugs as you're required to think through and define edge cases. For much more information on this, I'd recommend checking out the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://xstate.js.org/docs/">xState</a> docs or watching <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://egghead.io/courses/introduction-to-state-machines-using-xstate">this course</a>. You can also <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://xstate.js.org/viz/">visualize entire state machines online</a>.</p><div><p><img alt="State Machines" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><h3 id="zustand-recoil-jotai-valtio-oh-my">Zustand, Recoil, Jotai, Valtio, Oh My!</h3><p>Why do so many different libraries for React state management even exist?</p><p>Let's consider Figma (or any other design tool). You have a toolbar of controls that affect other elements outside of its "local" state, or where the component is rendered.</p><div><p><img alt="Figma" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>As you can imagine, an application of this scale would require a complex state management solution. Performance and frame rate are critical for a good user experience here, so you want control over when &amp; how to re-render. Unique use cases like this have led to lots of exploration in the state management space.</p><p>To summarize the differences between these libraries, let's hear from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/dai_shi/status/1348257768130560008">Daishi Kato</a>:</p><ul><li><strong>Valtio</strong> uses proxies to provide a mutation-style API</li><li><strong>Jotai</strong> is optimized for "computed values" and async actions</li><li><strong>Zustand</strong> is a very thin library specifically focused on module state</li><li><strong>Recoil</strong> is an experimental library using a data-flow graph</li></ul><p>Having complex state doesn't necessarily mean you <em>have</em> to pull for a third-party library. You can start with React and JavaScript and see how far it takes you. If optimizing requires a state management library, you can track that metric (e.g. frame rate), measure it, and verify it solves a real problem.</p><p><strong>Don't choose one of these libraries unless there's an obvious need.</strong></p><h3 id="immutable-state">Immutable State</h3><p>Another debate is mutable vs. immutable state. There's no right answers, just opinions. If you were doing state management with vanilla JavaScript, you'll likely have mutable state. You initialize a variable, and then later set it equal to some new value. There are <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://overreacted.io/on-let-vs-const/">entire debates</a> on <code>let</code> vs. <code>const</code>.</p><p>Immutable state gained a lot of popularity with React. The immutable crowd argues that allowing your state management solution of choice to mutate state directly results in more bugs. The mutable crowd argues it's not worth the complexity trade-off. Direct manipulation will always be less safe than indirect manipulation. It's a tradeoff between convenience and risk, which is up to you and your team.</p><p>Solutions like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://overreacted.io/on-let-vs-const/">Immer</a> allow you to write mutable code but <em>execute</em> it immutably. Fancy. The basic idea is you apply your changes to a <em>draft state</em>, which is a proxy of the <em>current state</em>. Once the mutations have completed Immer will produce the <em>next state</em> based on the changes to the draft state.</p><div><p><img alt="Immer Immutable State" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><h3 id="url-state">URL State</h3><p>Let's say you're building an e-commerce website like Amazon. You search for React books and filter by 4+ stars. This state is persisted as query parameters and managed by the browser. When you refresh the page, you see the same list of products. You can share this URL with others and they also see the same results.</p><div><p><img alt="Amazon URL State" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>Another interesting example of this is Nomad List. We can transform the browser URL state into a function of our data. Plus, we can make human-readable URLs (which Google prefers).</p><div><p><img alt="Nomad List URL State" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><h3 id="future">Future</h3><p>For large applications, it's possible a naive Context-based state management solutions (e.g. with <code>useReducer</code>) could have issues with excessive re-rendering. When a context value changes, all components that <code>useContext</code> will re-render. This makes UI interactions feel slow and janky. If you can't visually notice it, you can <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://brycedooley.com/debug-react-rerenders/">use React Dev Tools</a> to investigate re-rendering.</p><p>The React team has proposed a <code>useSelectedContext</code> hook to prevent performance issues with Context at scale. This <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/119">RFC was introduced</a> in July 2019 and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/20646">progress has started</a> as of January 2021 behind a feature flag. This hook allows you to select a "slice" of Context and only re-render when that piece changes.</p><p>There are ways to work around re-rendering performance already (e.g. <code>useMemo</code>) but a first-party solution for Context is preferred. There's also a community library <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/dai-shi/use-context-selector">useContextSelector</a>, which takes a similar approach (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://codesandbox.io/s/usecontextselector-demo-sixdr?file=/src/App.js">demo</a>). <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai">Jotai</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://formik.org/blog/formik-3-alpha">Formik 3</a> use this under the hood. Having <code>useSelectedContext</code> as part of the React standard library will eliminate complexity and code size in external libraries, as well as provide more performant options by default.</p><p>In the longer-term future, React will automatically figure out which components to re-render ("<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/119#issuecomment-586390430">auto-memoization</a>").</p><h2 id="state-management-options">State Management Options</h2><p>This is not a comprehensive list.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After dizzying growth in 2020, the narrative around the trajectory of Peloton has sobered a bit, recently. Concerns about supply chain constraints, margin contraction, and lengthy delivery-to-order windows (DTO) pervaded Thursday evening’s <a href="https://investor.onepeloton.com/static-files/dd43f8b8-acc9-443a-bc51-fd26433ec549" target="_blank">earnings report</a>, despite another quarter of blistering growth in both revenues and membership. At a higher level, the company also faces an existential crisis as the world evolves away from the very catalyst of its <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/peloton-posts-first-ever-profit-as-pandemic-speeds-sales-11599776415">meteoric rise</a>.<br></p><p>As an investor with a long-term focus, I am still extremely excited about Peloton’s potential. I am bullish on the future of the large, growing market of fitness technology that they’re attacking. I believe they have a distinctive product offering that has captured a passionate audience and have built a compelling business model that generates accumulating advantages. On a more micro-scale, I would also argue that what some <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/04/peloton-pton-reports-q2-2021-earnings.html">investors are calling weakness</a> in the most recent release will actually fortify Peloton’s competitive advantages moving forward.&nbsp;<br></p><p>I rely on the <a href="https://www.thenapkinvc.com/about#framework">Back of the Napkin VC framework</a> to explain why I’m riding with Peloton below.<strong><br></strong></p></div><div><p>Subscribe to get new posts from The Speakeasy sent right to your inbox. It's free!</p><div><div><p>Thank you! You're on the list. Next round's on us. :)</p></div><div><p>Oops! Please try that again.</p></div></div></div><div><p>The critical ingredient to Peloton’s success is its audience. Their network of nearly 2 million connected fitness subscribers is an engine of organic growth and enables several flywheel effects for the business.<br></p><p>Anecdotally, it’s easy to see that <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/12/the-tribe-of-peloton/600748/">users love the product</a>. The staggeringly low churn numbers (0.76% average net monthly in Q2) and growing average monthly workouts per subscriber (up to 21 in Q2 ‘21 vs 13 in Q2 ‘20) are evidence of a user base that is highly engaged.<br></p><p>The product is naturally viral. Users post workouts to signal their fitness virtues on social media or invite a friend to participate in a workout together, creating <a href="https://www.nfx.com/post/network-effects-manual/">social, belief, and bandwagon network effects</a>. This dynamic drove another quarter of explosive growth (128% in total revenue and 134% in number of connected fitness subscriptions vs Q2 ‘20 last year) on a relatively light sales and marketing expense ($177 million, or ~17% of total revenue).&nbsp;<br></p><p>In the initial stages of the business’s life, there was concern about how large the total addressable market for a company that made an expensive exercise bike really was. However, over the last several months Peloton has demonstrated an ability and willingness to expand and broaden their total addressable market through the introduction of new fitness modalities, celebrity partnerships and an entry-level digital-only subscription.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In the last year, the company has introduced new Tread hardware, as well as Strength and Pilates programming. While it’s still too early for the Tread to drive any material top line revenue growth, on Thursday’s call, CEO John Foley, noted that their initial test in the UK market, “exceeded expectations”. Bank of America research analysts estimate that the Tread market could surpass the Bike.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Beyond expanding their market of fitness interests, the critical result of these efforts has been to further engage their current subscribers. So far, the evidence suggests that the more options Peloton presents, the more workouts an average subscriber completes, and, therefore, the stickier that member is.<br></p><p>The advantages of this highly engaged community accumulate with scale. Beyond the social network aspects, a larger community enables data advantages around new and better content (<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/05/netflix-ceo-thinks-they-should-be-cancelling-more-tv-shows.html">like Netflix</a>), attracts better instructors and community leaders, and spins off more cash flow to <a href="https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-signs-agreement-acquire-precor">reinvest in critical infrastructure like supply chain</a> or new product development. All of these, in turn, improve customer engagement, reducing churn, and improve the user experience, attracting new members, and the flywheel continues.<br></p><p>Perhaps the most compelling aspect of Peloton’s business is its ability to leverage its "<a href="https://25iq.com/2018/03/10/peloton-the-saas-plus-a-box-business-case/">Saas plus a box</a>" model for profitable unit economics. Their subscription customer acquisition cost is effectively negative because their gross hardware profit is greater than the customer acquisition cost. This creates a highly lucrative SaaS business model if churn remains low. On Thursday’s call, CFO Jill Woodworth noted that despite margin % contracting due to elevated pandemic-related supply chain costs, CAC remained negative given expansion in gross profits $, which implies they have a comfortable cushion in terms of sustainable unit profitability.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>Finally, I’ll say that I believe Peloton’s recent obstacles will fortify its competitive advantage moving forward. Their investment in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/peloton-to-acquire-fitness-equipment-maker-precor-in-420m-bid-to-grow-commercial-business/">supply chain in both the US</a> <a href="https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/peloton-production-capacity-factory/585057/">and overseas</a> will solve their DTO issues in the near term and create manufacturing optionality in the long term. This will also enable them to build an inventory for the first time since their rapid expansion, enabling them to spend more aggressively on sales and marketing and pushing new users through that profitable engine we discussed. (Obviously, given the unit profitability and flywheel effects of adding members should encourage Peloton to spend more to acquire customers, which they indicated was their plan for 2021 and beyond.)<br></p><p>Looking ahead, I’m less bearish about the vaccine’s affect on in-home fitness and Peloton, generally. I think they identified a market for convenient, effective workouts that isn’t going away. Also, migration trends away from dense urban areas to dwellings with more space would be more conducive to this model. So far, the churn and growth metrics would confirm there’s no signs of slowing.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Key metrics I’m tracking for this business are subscription and revenue growth, churn, and average workouts per user. I’ll also look forward to any metrics on the success of the Tread in the UK and of the digital subscriptions effectiveness as an upsell funnel for the connected fitness products.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Businesses like Peloton, with staggering growth, unit profitability, and flywheels of accumulating advantages in a large, growing market tend to generate momentum as they grow, which is an exciting proposition for an investor. With <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/04/05/710439824/live-episode-peloton-john-foley">high quality management at the helm</a>, it’s not a stretch to see them adding products and services in tertiary verticals like meditation, sleep, diet, wellness, wearables and beyond. I’m excited to be along for the ride.<br></p></div><div><p>Subscribe to get new posts from The Speakeasy sent right to your inbox. It's free!</p><div><div><p>Thank you! You're on the list.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>How hard should I push myself?</p><p>Itâ€™s a question I ask myself a lot, and I bet you do too. On the one hand I really want to push myself. Iâ€™m ambitious, I want to leave it all out on the fieldâ€”some of my peak work moments have come from times when Iâ€™ve pushed myself to a place where I didnâ€™t think I could go. We all have more ability to adapt to stress and pressure than we think we do.ï»¿</p><p>On the other hand, I want to be kind to myself. I wonder how much the drive to push myself is really just a drive to make up for something that I feel is missing or inadequateâ€”and whether pushing myself will actually fill the hole. I also sometimes wonder whether letting myself off the hook is just laziness masquerading as self-care. Itâ€™s hard to tell.</p><p>But importantly, I wonder whether pushing myself might, in fact, kill me. Constant pressure creates chronic stress, and thereâ€™s all sorts of scientific studies that show that chronic stress is really bad for you. It makes you more susceptible to heart disease, it makes it harder to recover from illnesses, it can affect your sleep, and it can even affect your working memory.</p><p>Thereâ€™s also all sorts of literature (and conversations on Twitter) that says that stress is actually good for you.&nbsp;</p><p>What gives? How much stress is good, and how much is bad?&nbsp;</p><p>I think that in order to understand the question we posed at the topâ€”how much we should be pushing ourselvesâ€”we have to better understand stress. We need to understand what the stress of pushing ourselves does to our bodies, how much we can take of it, and how we can, hopefully, learn to cope with it better.</p><p>Thatâ€™s what&nbsp;<a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780805073690" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Why Zebra's Don't Get Ulcers</a>&nbsp;by Robert M. Sapolsky is about. Robert's a stress researcher, and as far as I can tell he's one of the good ones. He's the kind of intellectual who's smart, but also smart enough to know what he doesn't know. He's written a <span id="quill-collection-1611655017162" data-source="{&quot;text&quot;:&quot;book&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Books&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;17&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;/c/books&quot;}"><a href="https://every.to/c/books">book</a></span>, but he doesn't come across as trying to sell it to youâ€”he's kind of like your zany self-aware smart-as-hell uncle who happens to study the stress responses of baboons for a living.</p><p>In the book Dr. Sapolsky harnesses his own research, as well as a wide array of animal and human studies to figure out the answer to a fairly simple question: how does stress work, and why do humans get stress-related diseases?&nbsp;</p><p>Itâ€™s an interesting questionâ€”you can understand why a human body might react poorly to not being fed enough. But why would psychological stress have dangerous consequences? The basic gist is this:&nbsp;</p><p>The stress response is built to get us out of danger. If you're an animal in the Serengeti and you're being chased by a lion you really, really want to have a stress response. Being stressed means youâ€™re preparing your muscles to moveâ€”a lot. Your heart rate rises and pushes blood to your extremities. Glucose is released into your bloodstream to help run your muscles as fast as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>The stress response pushes certain parts of your body into high gearâ€”but it also turns certain parts of your body off. For example, when youâ€™re stressed digestion is inhibited. Whatâ€™s the point of wasting energy on digesting food for later when you might not even survive for 10 more minutes? Reproduction is also inhibited. Same reason.&nbsp;</p><p>This is all well and good in the wildâ€”you don't need to reproduce if a lion is eating your face off. But humans, and some more intelligent animals, have evolved the stress response from an unqualified Good Thing into...well, something that might kill you.</p><p>Whatâ€™s different about our stress response? Well, we have the ability to&nbsp;<em>anticipate</em>danger. Other animals have this ability too: itâ€™s a good thing to get stressed seeing the lion all the way across the savannah, instead of only when it mauls your intestines out. But humans have evolved this anticipation ability to extend far beyond other animals. We anticipate bad things months, years, or even decades out. And when we do this, the very same stress response gets turned onâ€”even though there is no immediate danger, and there is no immediate way to avoid it.&nbsp;</p><p>Suddenly, you arenâ€™t just activating the stress response for a few minutes when youâ€™re running for your life. Instead, itâ€™s activated all the timeâ€”chronically. And this is where the problems start.&nbsp;</p><p>Remember we mentioned earlier that the stress response amps some parts of your body into high gear, and turns off others? If youâ€™re doing that chronically, you start to have problems. Suddenly, your digestive system isnâ€™t just inhibited for a few minutes while youâ€™re escaping danger. Itâ€™s chronically inhibited. The same thing happens with your immune systemâ€”chronic stress tamps it down, and makes it harder for you to fight off diseases. Stress is bad for your heart tooâ€”if youâ€™re pumping blood as if you need to run from something all the time, youâ€™re going to get high blood pressure.&nbsp;</p><p>In these cases, according to Sapolsky, â€œthe stress response can become more dangerous than the stressor itself, especially when the stress is purely psychological.â€�</p><p>To be clear, stress doesnâ€™t actually make you sick. But it does leave you more vulnerable to disease and illnesses than you otherwise would beâ€”and those&nbsp;<em>can</em>&nbsp;make you very sick.</p><h3><strong>So is stress bad?</strong></h3><p>Stress isnâ€™t good or bad. Itâ€™s a tool. In small doses itâ€™s good, but too much of a good thing becomes a bad thing pretty quickly.</p><p>When your stress response is working properly it makes you run faster, your memory gets better, youâ€™re able to focus better. But when your stress response is over-activated, or chronically activatedâ€”you get ulcers and heart disease. Itâ€™s bad!&nbsp;</p><p>A good analogy is exercise. Too little exercise and you open yourself up to a whole host of diseases, both physical and psychological. Too much, and you can actually kill yourself.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>What do we do about it?</strong></h3><p>The answer to the question we posed at the top, then, is that itâ€™s great to push yourselfâ€”but you should be paying attention to the signs that tell you that you need a break. And itâ€™s to give yourself plenty of ways to manage stress while youâ€™re going through it, so that it doesnâ€™t affect you as badly as it could.</p><p>This is the really interesting nugget: stress isnâ€™t mathematical. Expose the same person to the same stressor and they will have different stress responses based on their coping strategies. Which means if you want to live a life where youâ€™re pushing yourself, itâ€™s best to develop a variety of coping strategies to help you manage it.&nbsp;</p><p>Hereâ€™s what Sapolsky recommends:</p><h4><strong>Increase your sense of control.&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>If you put a human in a room where loud noises are going off, youâ€™ll activate their stress response. If you give the human a button to reduce the volume of the loud noises theyâ€™ll be less stressedâ€”regardless of whether they even use the button.&nbsp;</p><p>What that means is, just knowing you have the&nbsp;<em>option</em>&nbsp;to reduce stress is enough to make something less stressfulâ€”even if youâ€™re not actually controlling the stressors at all.&nbsp;</p><p>Itâ€™s why the first few sessions of therapy are often so powerful for patients. Youâ€™ve finally found a way to manage how youâ€™re feeling, even though you probably havenâ€™t changed too much about your life.</p><p>When youâ€™re facing mild to moderate stressors, ask yourself,&nbsp;<em>How can I increase my sense of control in this situation?</em>&nbsp;You might find there are simple answers that will make you feel a lot better.</p><h4><strong>Increase your sense of predictability.</strong></h4><p>Rats that are exposed to repeated electric shocks are more likely to get ulcers. But if you ring a bell before you administer the shockâ€”making the shock more predictableâ€”the rats are less likely to get ulcers. If you make the stressor predictable, you only have to get stressed right before it happens. That means youâ€™re not stressed the rest of the time, and therefore the stress response doesnâ€™t wreak as much havoc on your body.</p><p>Making the stressors in your life more predictable can have a similar effect. When you see CEOs that keep their calendars clear and never do phone callsâ€”youâ€™re seeing the benefit of predictability in action.</p><p>Of course, we canâ€™t make our lives totally predictable (and in fact that wouldnâ€™t be desirable.) But the more you can expose yourself to stressors in a predictable way the better off youâ€™ll be. For example, maybe only doomscroll on Twitter once a week. Or only check email a couple of times a day.</p><h4><strong>Create outlets for frustration.</strong></h4><p>When rats that are exposed to repeated stressors are given a piece of wood to gnaw on, they are far less likely to develop ulcers. Outlets for frustration are another important coping mechanism for stress.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There are many unproductive outletsâ€”for example, taking things out on your partner or a co-worker. But there are also many productive ones, like exercise or journaling. Making a list of outlets and making sure to return to them again and again can reduce the havoc that chronic stress can wreak on your body.</p><h4><strong>Increase social support.</strong></h4><p>Social support is the last coping strategy on the list, and itâ€™s perhaps my favorite one.</p><p>If you give a primate a stressor in the lab, youâ€™ll find elevated markers of stress in its behavior and in its blood. But give the primate a stressor when itâ€™s surrounded by friendsâ€”its stress markers will be lower, even for the same level of stressor.</p><p>The same thing happens in humans. For example, in one study parents of children who have been killed in war were no more likely to get disease or dieâ€”except if they were already widowed or divorced.</p><p>Creating a vibrant sense of social support can put an unmanageable stressor into perspective and help keep it under control. Without social support, even small things can set us off in ways that are unproductive and unhealthy.</p>

	<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The mission of the PMDK team has always been and will always be to make programming persistent memory
easier for the community of software developers. One of our goals is to help simplify the integration
of persistent memory into software solutions by making it transparent as possible.
Adopting ground-breaking  and disruptive technology creates a chasm, which is
challenging to cross at first. To help with that, PMDK offers a multi-layered stack of solutions
so that developers can choose a library that is the best fit for their desired level of abstraction and purpose.</p>

<p>Intel Optane persistent memory (PMem) can be configured in two modes: Memory Mode or App Direct Mode.
In Memory Mode, the system’s DRAM behaves as a cache while PMem provides large memory capacity.
When configured for Memory Mode, applications and the operating system perceive a pool of volatile memory
no different than on DRAM-only systems. Use of PMem in Memory Mode is transparent to applications and
the operating system, so no specific persistent memory programming is needed. When configured in App Direct Mode,
however, the applications and operating system are explicitly aware that there are two types of memory on
the platform, and can direct which type of data read or write is suitable for DRAM or PMem.
PMDK is a suite of software libraries designed to take advantage of persistent memory when using App Direct Mode.</p>

<p>In this post, we will present how the cooperation between <a href="https://hazelcast.com/">Hazelcast</a> and the PMDK team
improved Hazelcast’s overall performance with PMem. We will also showcase how to mitigate one
of the most common problems with Java applications and garbage collection limitations.
This post also demonstrates how an efficient use of hardware enables solutions to 
scale better while retaining low tail latency.</p>

<p>In this article, we will focus on using Persistent Memory directly, through App Direct Mode.
One of the easiest ways to adopt PMem is to use it as a volatile extension of the existing memory
where applications use PMem as regular memory without any intention of retaining data
across power or restart cycles. The adoption barrier of integrating PMem this way
is relatively minimal, but there are some important technical considerations we discuss
in this post.</p>

<h2 id="about-hazelcast">About Hazelcast</h2>

<p>Hazelcast IMDG (In-Memory Data Grid) is a leading open source in-memory solution written in Java,
capable of storing a large amount of data in an elastic distributed cluster with a rich set
of functionality for operating on the stored data such as querying with SQL,
performing distributed computations and many more. Operating entirely in the memory is
the central concept of Hazelcast to guarantee that these operations are done with a low
and predictable latency and with a stable throughput. Hazelcast is widely used as a caching layer,
for storing web sessions, for efficient fraud detection and for many other use cases.</p>

<h2 id="working-with-big-data-in-the-java-virtual-machine">Working with Big Data in the Java Virtual Machine</h2>

<p>Given that Hazelcast is written in Java, it is inherently sensitive to the unpredictability
of the garbage collection (GC) algorithm used by the Java Virtual Machine.
The traditional GC algorithms are famously known to put a practical limit on the usable heap size.
This practical limit can manifest itself in the so-called stop-the-world GC pauses,
which means the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) suspends the application threads to ensure nothing mutates the heap
while certain phases of the GC algorithms are doing their job. The bigger the heap,
the bigger these pauses, which may render the hosted application unresponsive,
lagging or just not operating with predictable response times. This problem led the JVM vendors
to research and implement a new generation of the GC algorithms, the concurrent GC algorithms,
such as the C4 (Azul), ZGC (Oracle) and Shenandoah (Red Hat). These GC algorithms all focus on
eliminating or limiting the aforementioned pauses in order to be able to manage huge heaps,
up to terabytes in size. This is already a big enough heap for Hazelcast, but these algorithms
have their trade-offs as well. The threads of the concurrent GC algorithms run concurrently with
the application threads and can steal precious resources from them. Given that freeing up the unused
memory is done while the application threads are running - therefore, the application threads allocate
concurrently - it is possible that even these clever GC algorithms are unable to keep up with the pace
of the allocations and need to employ their so-called failure modes, which is a well-controlled form
of impacting the application to get the control back over the allocation/reclamation dynamics.
As the worst case option, these algorithms may need to suspend application threads as well.</p>

<p>To overcome the above limitations with the GC, and to guarantee the low and predictable response times,
Hazelcast improved its enterprise offering years ago by implementing an in-memory
storage that stores the data outside of the Java heap. This feature is named
High-Density Memory Storage (HDMS or just HD), also known as native or off-heap storage.
While there is still GC involved, the data Hazelcast stores in its HD storage is not subject to the GC,
therefore, that data can be very big in size without running into the problems of the GC mentioned above.
For more details on HD, refer to the <a href="https://hazelcast.org/blog/introduction-hazelcast-hd-memory/">blog post introducing HD</a>.</p>

<p>First launched in 2019, Intel Optane persistent Memory offers DIMM-compatible non-volatile memory-modules.
While the biggest breakthrough of these modules is their persistent capability, using them in
a volatile App Direct Mode is also attractive in some use cases. These modules are available with
greater capacities than that of DRAM DIMMs. Therefore, the total achievable capacity is bigger than
with DRAM modules alone, while the modules operate with near-DRAM performance, at a lower cost per gigabyte.
These advantages make the Intel Optane PMem modules a good fit for Hazelcast and after some research,
Hazelcast 4.0 added support for these persistent memory modules - in addition to DRAM - as its HD backend.
The initial implementation in 4.0 used <a href="https://pmem.io/pmdk/libvmem/">libvmem</a> for using Intel Optane persistent
memory modules in volatile App Direct Mode. Since then, Memkind became the go-to library
for using the PMem in volatile mode, therefore, Hazelcast dropped libvmem
and replaced it with Memkind in its 4.1 version.</p>

<h2 id="integration-with-memkind">Integration with Memkind</h2>

<p>Memkind is a library for managing multiple types of memory (e.g., DRAM, MCDRAM, PMem),
with different performance characteristics. This solution enables applications
to use persistent memory as the capacity tier for memory resident data.
In heterogeneous memory systems, where two or more memory types are present,
memkind is a solution that helps applications to overcome the challenge of managing
complex memory architectures.</p>

<p>In memkind, memory is managed as independent heaps, called <em>memory kinds</em>.</p>

<p>Hazelcast takes advantage of both solutions libmemkind provides for using PMem.
The PMEM kind let’s the user application allocate from the PMem medium if it is
mounted with a DAX-aware file system. The <a href="https://pmem.io/2020/01/20/memkind-dax-kmem.html">KMEM-DAX</a> mode
combines the advantages of the Linux kernel’s KMEM feature and the direct access (DAX)
capabilities of PMem by transparently allocating PMem memory from the system memory
consisted of DRAM and PMem backed regions after preliminary configuration of PMem.
The two modes will be discussed in detail later.</p>

<p>To leverage the advanced heap management offered by Memkind, Hazelcast needed to
build a Java Native Interface (JNI) bridge. Integrating Memkind was a straightforward task
since Hazelcast’s HD memory manager interacts with the memory allocators through a malloc-like
internal abstraction with an API that is similar to standard memory allocation API’s.
The notable difference with Memkind is that the caller should define a kind for an allocation,
and also may define the kind when freeing or reallocating a memory block. If the kind is not defined,
Memkind detects which kind should be used. This kind detection feature turned out to be a very
useful feature for Hazelcast, even though at the time of writing this post Hazelcast exclusively
use the <code>PMEM</code> or the <code>MEMKIND_DAX_KMEM_ALL</code> kinds.</p>

<p>Looking forward, this could help Hazelcast build a tiered HD storage feature,
for example with DRAM and PMem tiers, to take advantage of the heterogeneous platform architectures.
Implementing such a tiered storage is inherently difficult with heterogeneous memory allocators,
since allocating, freeing and reallocating a memory block has to use the same allocator.
Otherwise, various problems may occur potentially crashing the application.
To deal with this problem, one can track the allocator used for every memory block. The disadvantage
of this approach is a significant increase of the fragmentation. Since memkind internally
tracks the dedicated memory kind of a given object from the allocation metadata, it can detect the kind
for every object allocated with the library. This is a great help for the applications dealing with
heterogeneous memory resources as memkind eliminates the aforementioned problem entirely.

<p>The collaboration between the PMDK team and Hazelcast helped streamline PMem integration into the
<a href="https://hazelcast.com/product-features/high-density-memory-store/">High-Density Memory Store</a>. The Hazelcast team uses the memkind library
to explicitly allocate PMem space. When using the FS-DAX base memory kind, the Hazelcast team analyzed
memkind performance in the context of shutdown times and found the bottleneck in the form
of a punch hole operation when destroying the file-based memory kind. Punch hole operation is
used to deallocate blocks presented on filesystem and is called during deallocating memory using
memkind API so the underlying pages could be returned to …</p></div></div>

February 11, 2021 | https://www.suketk.com/feeds-considered-harmful | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.suketk.com/feeds-considered-harmful">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Technology is merely a tool. It can work for us or against us. If we use it with agency, we can leverage the world’s information to better our lives. If we use it indiscriminately, we find ourselves at the mercy of the Algorithm, passively consuming content. Our generation is at an inflection point - either we use technology intentionally or it uses us.</p>

<p>This post is about one principle that transformed my relationship with technology: feeds considered harmful. Feeds slow you down, take you in unwanted directions and encourage consumption over action. Adopting the principle enabled me to effectively focus, prioritize and act on my goals.</p>

<p>A feed is a set of algorithmically generated content provided to the user without explicit input. Almost all of our interactions with services begin with a feed - Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitch, Netflix, Reddit, Amazon, News. You name the app, it has a feed front and center. (Although this definition doesn’t include messaging apps or RSS feeds, some of the concerns below still hold.)</p>

<p>Feeds distract and slow you down. Ever catch yourself binging on The Office clips an hour after you open YouTube to learn how to revive your dying succulent? This is no accident - it’s the digital equivalent of placing the milk in the back of the grocery store. Even if you have a clear purpose for navigating to a site, it hijacks your attention with content the Algorithm has concluded you can’t resist. Instant gratification is only a click away.</p>

<p>If you’re mindlessly browsing, the effect of feeds is even more potent. The brief dopamine hit triggered by fresh content quickly evolves into analysis paralysis. Ever spend a half hour on Netflix just deciding what to watch? Then, shortly after a decision is made, feel a pang of buyer’s remorse? The abundance of options challenges the optimality of your choice, and in the face of the slightest obstacle, lures you to a replacement. Greener pastures are only a click away. And so begins the endless cycle of novelty and disillusion. The only way out is through - establishing an intent and following through.</p>

<p>You may be asking: don’t feeds broaden our exposure to new ideas? Yes, they do. But there’s no free lunch. Time spent consuming is time not spent doing. Taking meaningful action requires a delicate balance of explore and exploit. Feeds uproot this balance, disproportionately encouraging discovery instead of focused execution. This is best explained with a navigation analogy - explore is direction, exploit is movement. Explore is necessary in small doses, to make sure we’re moving in the right direction. Too much explore though, and we’ve over calibrated to our orientation - we’re no closer to our goal, but left with the illusion of progress (<em>cough</em> productivity porn <em>cough</em>).</p>

<p>You can still explore without feeds. New ideas surface everywhere. In everyday conversations, which are inherently tailored to mutual interests. From resources in the exploit phase, as a springboard into complementary subjects. By browsing the library, a physical feed optimized for education instead of engagement. Instead of preventing exploration altogether, eliminating feeds recalibrates our explore-exploit balance by compelling us to adopt healthier forms of discovery that inevitably leave more energy for execution.</p>

<p>Speaking of execution, here’s how to reduce your dependence on feeds:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Identify your triggers</strong>: What feeds consume your attention the most? As a proxy, check your most visited sites on desktop (yes, that is a feed too!) or most used apps on mobile (Screen Time for iOS, Digital Wellbeing for Android).</li>
  <li><strong>Eliminate the feed.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>(Ideal) Remove the feed entirely. The ideal page is blank, save for a search bar - intentional begins with intent! Such Chrome extensions exist for the most popular services: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg?hl=en" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/remove-youtube-recommende/khncfooichmfjbepaaaebmommgaepoid?hl=en" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, etc.</li>
      <li>(Backup) If the above isn’t entirely possible (say because you’re an active mobile user), add friction. A very effective solution is to uninstall the app and only access the service through the browser. Your muscle memory in the first few days will be a great reminder of how unconsciously you used these feeds, but it won’t take long to unlearn.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Repeat for the new triggers that emerge.</strong> As your usual suspects are solved for, you will reach for new distractions. It will take a few cycles to fully eliminate them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Side effects may include mild FOMO (which will soon subside), an enhanced feeling of control and excessive amounts of spare time to live life on your terms, not the Algorithm’s.</p>

        <section>
            <p>The ability to do precise Google searches and getting relevant results is a superpower that is easy to acquire  but most people don't have it. </p>

<p>The goal of this post is:</p>

<ul>
<li>to provide simple and tangible examples to help you gain this superpower </li>
<li>to show you how you can leverage Google for prospecting.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="googlesearchoperators">Google Search Operators</h5>

<p>Google search operators (also known as “advanced operators”) are commands that extend the capabilities of regular text searches.  With Google search operators you can do anything from market analysis, prospecting people on LinkedIn, retrieving fundraising news, finding emails, etc. Understanding the basics of Google search operators will drastically improve the quality of your search results. </p>

<h5 id="howdogooglesearchoperatorswork">How do Google search operators work?</h5>

<p>Even though there are lots of search operators for you to use, they usually follow a similar syntax like this one:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/IuxJhKz.png" alt="<image>"></p>

<p><strong>Some of the most common search operators are:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><code>site</code>: Limit results to those from a specific website</li>
<li><code>intitle</code>: Web pages with a certain keyword in the title</li>
<li><code>inurl</code>: Web pages with a certain keyword in the URL</li>
<li><code>filetype</code>: web pages with a certain file type, such as pdf or png</li>
<li><code>[number]..[number]</code>: restricts the search to a certain range of numbers</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="examplesforsalesgrowthandmarketingusecases">Examples for sales, growth, and marketing use cases:</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Find: Google spreadsheets that include “startups” and “2020” in the title</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site:docs.google.com/spreadsheets+intitle:startups+2020&amp;rlz=1CAZAQH_enPT910&amp;oq=site:docs.google.com/spreadsheets+intitle:startups+2020&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i58.1251j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8"><strong><code>site:docs.google.com/spreadsheets intitle:startups 2020</code></strong></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Use case: This search will provide you with several links to lists of Google spreadsheets with data about startups and the year 2020. For example, if you offer services for startups that are hiring remotely you’ve just found a list with 900+ potential leads.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Find: List of LinkedIn profiles that mention “Founder” and the words “We’re hiring”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1CAZAQH_enPT910&amp;ei=W91-X8nzAYbkU8eTv4AN&amp;q=site%3Alinkedin.com%2Fin%2F+%22founder+We%27re+hiring%22&amp;oq=site%3Alinkedin.com%2Fin%2F+%22founder+We%27re+hiring%22&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzoHCAAQRxCwA1Ck6ARYpOgEYKXwBGgDcAB4AIABPogBPpIBATGYAQCgAQKgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6yAEIwAEB&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJjfno2KTsAhUG8hQKHcfJD9AQ4dUDCA0&amp;uact=5"><strong><code>site:linkedin.com/in/ "founder We're hiring"</code></strong></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Use case: This search should retrieve a list of founders at startups/companies that are hiring and managing a growing team. For example, if these founders match with your ICP you can directly click on the link and reach out to this person.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Find: Google docs that contain the words “SaaS”, “conference” and “2020” in the body</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1CAZAQH_enPT910&amp;ei=td1-X8POA4Wzgwe3x6rADA&amp;q=site%3Adocs.google.com+saas+conferences+2020&amp;oq=site%3Adocs.google.com+saas+conferences+2020&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzoHCAAQRxCwA1DozgRY6M4EYK3WBGgDcAB4AIABQ4gBQ5IBATGYAQCgAQKgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6yAECwAEB&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiD_e-T2aTsAhWF2eAKHbejCsgQ4dUDCA0&amp;uact=5"><strong><code>site:docs.google.com saas conferences 2020</code></strong></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Use case: This search should find you documents related to SaaS conferences in 2020. For example, you can find lists to make sure you don’t miss out on any important event in your industry. Furthermore, you can connect with thousands of potential customers by making sure you attend and reach out to the people participating in these conferences.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Find: Airtable bases/lists that contain “investors” in the URL</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1CAZAQH_enPT910&amp;ei=At5-X-KMHfrOgweEvp7YDA&amp;q=site%3Aairtable.com+inurl%3Ainvestors&amp;oq=site%3Aairtable.com+inurl%3Ainvestors&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQA1D3jgJY944CYLGSAmgDcAB4AIABRogBRpIBATGYAQCgAQKgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6wAEB&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjileW42aTsAhV65-AKHQSfB8sQ4dUDCA0&amp;uact=5"><strong><code>site:airtable.com inurl:investors</code></strong></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Use case: Airtable has been creating tons of content with relevant lists that help you access more information about companies. For example, here you can find lists of investors that may be relevant to your fundraising needs or that fit your ICP. Keep in mind that these lists not only provide you with the names of the investors, but they also share relevant information about each one of them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Find: Find industry reports from multiple sources</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1CAZAQH_enPT910&amp;ei=Jt5-X7fyGLOcjLsP6Oy_gA0&amp;q=inurl%3Areport+intitle%3A%22SaaS+trends%22+filetype%3Apdf&amp;oq=inurl%3Areport+intitle%3A%22SaaS+trends%22+filetype%3Apdf&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzoHCAAQRxCwA1CH8gFYh_IBYMj0AWgDcAB4AIABQYgBQZIBATGYAQCgAQKgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6yAEDwAEB&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3nfbJ2aTsAhUzDmMBHWj2D9AQ4dUDCA0&amp;uact=5"><strong><code>inurl:report intitle:"SaaS trends" filetype:pdf</code></strong></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Use case: This search will help you stay up to date with your industry trends. With a quick search you can immediately find the most relevant docs for your market research activities.</p>

<h4 id="wrappingup">Wrapping up…</h4>

February 11, 2021 | https://trekhleb.dev/blog/2019/nano-neuron/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://trekhleb.dev/blog/2019/nano-neuron/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="tldr">TL;DR<a href="#tldr" aria-label="tldr permalink"></a></h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/trekhleb/nano-neuron">NanoNeuron</a> is an <em>over-simplified</em> version of the Neuron concept from Neural Networks. NanoNeuron is trained to convert temperature values from Celsius to Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/trekhleb/nano-neuron/blob/master/NanoNeuron.js">NanoNeuron.js</a> code example contains 7 simple JavaScript functions (which touches on model prediction, cost calculation, forward/backwards propagation, and training) that will give you a feeling of how machines can actually "learn". No 3rd-party libraries, no external data-sets or dependencies, only pure and simple JavaScript functions.</p>
<p>☝🏻These functions are <strong>NOT</strong>, by any means, a complete guide to machine learning. A lot of machine learning concepts are skipped and over-simplified! This simplification is done on purpose to give the reader a really <strong>basic</strong> understanding and feeling of how machines can learn and ultimately to make it possible for the reader to recognize that it's not "machine learning MAGIC" but rather "machine learning MATH" 🤓.</p>
<h2 id="what-our-nanoneuron-will-learn">What our NanoNeuron will learn<a href="#what-our-nanoneuron-will-learn" aria-label="what our nanoneuron will learn permalink"></a></h2>
<p>You've probably heard about Neurons in the context of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network">Neural Networks</a>. NanoNeuron is just that but simpler and we're going to implement it from scratch. For simplicity reasons we're not even going to build a network on NanoNeurons. We will have it all working on its own, doing some magical predictions for us. Namely, we will teach this singular NanoNeuron to convert (predict) the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>By the way, the formula for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit is this:</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="Celsius to Fahrenheit" title="Celsius to Fahrenheit" src="https://trekhleb.dev/static/228baf7755f8ac68971b55b5b14c5ee7/04c57/02-formula-C-to-F.png" srcset="https://trekhleb.dev/static/228baf7755f8ac68971b55b5b14c5ee7/04c57/02-formula-C-to-F.png 165w" sizes="(max-width: 165px) 100vw, 165px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p>
<p>But for now our NanoNeuron doesn't know about it...</p>
<h3 id="the-nanoneuron-model">The NanoNeuron model<a href="#the-nanoneuron-model" aria-label="the nanoneuron model permalink"></a></h3>
<p>Let's implement our NanoNeuron model function. It implements basic linear dependency between <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> which looks like <code>y = w * x + b</code>. Simply saying our NanoNeuron is a "kid" in a "school" that is being taught to draw the straight line in <code>XY</code> coordinates.</p>
<p>Variables <code>w</code>, <code>b</code> are parameters of the model. NanoNeuron knows only about these two parameters of the linear function.
These parameters are something that NanoNeuron is going to "learn" during the training process.</p>
<p>The only thing that NanoNeuron can do is to imitate linear dependency. In its <code>predict()</code> method it accepts some input <code>x</code> and predicts the output <code>y</code>. No magic here.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>NanoNeuron</span><span>(</span><span>w<span>,</span> b</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>this</span><span>.</span>w <span>=</span> w<span>;</span>
  <span>this</span><span>.</span>b <span>=</span> b<span>;</span>
  <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>predict</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> x <span>*</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>w <span>+</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>b<span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>...wait... <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression">linear regression</a> is it you?  🧐</p>
<h3 id="celsius-to-fahrenheit-conversion">Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion<a href="#celsius-to-fahrenheit-conversion" aria-label="celsius to fahrenheit conversion permalink"></a></h3>
<p>The temperature value in Celsius can be converted to Fahrenheit using the following formula: <code>f = 1.8 * c + 32</code>, where <code>c</code> is a temperature in Celsius and <code>f</code> is the calculated temperature in Fahrenheit.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>celsiusToFahrenheit</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> w <span>=</span> <span>1.8</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> b <span>=</span> <span>32</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> f <span>=</span> c <span>*</span> w <span>+</span> b<span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> f<span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Ultimately we want to teach our NanoNeuron to imitate this function (to learn that <code>w = 1.8</code> and <code>b = 32</code>) without knowing these parameters in advance.</p>
<p>This is how the Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion function looks like:</p>
<p><span>

<p>Before the training we need to generate <strong>training</strong> and <strong>test data-sets</strong> based on the <code>celsiusToFahrenheit()</code> function. Data-sets consist of pairs of input values and correctly labeled output values.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In real life, in most of cases, this data would be collected rather than generated. For example, we might have a set of images of hand-drawn numbers and the corresponding set of numbers that explains what number is written on each picture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will use TRAINING example data to train our NanoNeuron. Before our NanoNeuron will grow and be able to make decisions on its own, we need to teach it what is right and what is wrong using training examples.</p>
<p>We will use TEST examples to evaluate how well our NanoNeuron performs on the data that it didn't see during the training. This is the point where we could see that our "kid" has grown and can make decisions on its own.</p>

<h3 id="the-cost-the-error-of-prediction">The cost (the error) of prediction<a href="#the-cost-the-error-of-prediction" aria-label="the cost the error of prediction permalink"></a></h3>
<p>We need to have some metric that will show us how close our model's prediction is to correct values. The calculation of the cost (the mistake) between the correct output value of <code>y</code> and <code>prediction</code>, that our NanoNeuron created, will be made using the following formula:</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="Prediction Cost" title="Prediction Cost" src="https://trekhleb.dev/static/8d8e50ac12d03614e65975f7b5d36931/39d76/06.png" srcset="https://trekhleb.dev/static/8d8e50ac12d03614e65975f7b5d36931/63868/06.png 250w,

    </span></p>
<p>This is a simple difference between two values. The closer the values are to each other, the smaller the difference. We're using a power of <code>2</code> here just to get rid of negative numbers so that <code>(1 - 2) ^ 2</code> would be the same as <code>(2 - 1) ^ 2</code>. Division by <code>2</code> is happening just to simplify further the backward propagation formula (see below).</p>
<p>The cost function in this case will be as simple as:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>predictionCost</span><span>(</span><span>y<span>,</span> prediction</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>y <span>-</span> prediction<span>)</span> <span>**</span> <span>2</span> <span>/</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span> 
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="forward-propagation">Forward propagation<a href="#forward-propagation" aria-label="forward propagation permalink"></a></h3>
<p>To do forward propagation means to do a prediction for all training examples from <code>xTrain</code> and <code>yTrain</code> data-sets and to calculate the average cost of those predictions along the way.</p>
<p>We just let our NanoNeuron say its opinion, at this point, by just allowing it to guess how to convert the temperature. It might be stupidly wrong here. The average cost will show us how wrong our model is right now. This cost value is really important since changing the NanoNeuron parameters <code>w</code> and <code>b</code>, and by doing the forward propagation again; we will be able to evaluate if our NanoNeuron became smarter or not after these parameters change.</p>
<p>The average cost will be calculated using the following formula:</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="Average Cost" title="Average Cost" src="https://trekhleb.dev/static/575db3e0a0c872b29582147e41231344/39e45/07.png" srcset="https://trekhleb.dev/static/575db3e0a0c872b29582147e41231344/63868/07.png 250w,

    </span></p>
<p>Where <code>m</code> is a number of training examples (in our case: <code>100</code>).</p>
<p>Here is how we may implement it in code:</p>

<h3 id="backward-propagation">Backward propagation<a href="#backward-propagation" aria-label="backward propagation permalink"></a></h3>
<p>When we know how right or wrong our NanoNeuron's predictions are (based on average cost at this point) what should we do to make the predictions more precise?</p>
<p>The backward propagation gives us the answer to this question. Backward propagation is the process of evaluating the cost of prediction and adjusting the NanoNeuron's parameters <code>w</code> and <code>b</code> so that next and future predictions would be more precise.</p>
<p>This is the place where machine learning looks like magic 🧞‍♂️. The key concept here is the <strong>derivative</strong> which shows what step to take to get closer to the cost function minimum.</p>
<p>Remember, finding the minimum of a cost function is the ultimate goal of the training process. If we find such values for <code>w</code> and <code>b</code> such that our average cost function will be small, it would mean that the NanoNeuron model does really good and precise predictions.</p>
<p>Derivatives are a big and separate topic that we will not cover in this article. <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/calculus/derivatives-introduction.html">MathIsFun</a> is a good resource to get a basic understanding of it.</p>
<p>One thing about derivatives that will help you to understand how backward propagation works is that the derivative, by its meaning, is a tangent line to the function curve that points toward the direction of the function minimum.</p>
<p><img src="https://trekhleb.dev/posts-assets/bb9a55828c3188edf7d48ed286135117/2.svg" alt="Derivative slope"></p>
<p><em>Image source: <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/calculus/derivatives-introduction.html">MathIsFun</a></em></p>
<p>For example, on the plot above, you can see that if we're at the point of <code>(x=2, y=4)</code> then the slope tells us to go <code>left</code> and <code>down</code> to get to the function minimum. Also notice that the bigger the slope, the faster we should move to the minimum.</p>
<p>The derivatives of our <code>averageCost</code> function for parameters <code>w</code> and <code>b</code> looks like this:</p>

<p>Now we know how to evaluate the correctness of our model for all training set examples (<em>forward propagation</em>). We also know how to do small adjustments to parameters <code>w</code> and <code>b</code> of our NanoNeuron model (<em>backward propagation</em>). But the issue is that if we run forward propagation and then backward propagation only once, it won't be enough for our model to learn any laws/trends from the training data. You may compare it with attending a one day of elementary school for the kid. He/she should go to the school not once but day after day and year after year to learn something.</p>
<p>So we need to repeat forward and backward propagation for our model many times. That is exactly what the <code>trainModel()</code> function does. It is like a "teacher" for our NanoNeuron model:</p>
<ul>
<li>it will spend some time (<code>epochs</code>) with our slightly stupid NanoNeuron model and try to train/teach it,</li>
<li>it will use specific "books" (<code>xTrain</code> and <code>yTrain</code> data-sets) for training,</li>
<li>it will push our kid to learn harder (faster) by using a learning rate parameter <code>alpha</code></li>
</ul>
<p>A few words about the learning rate <code>alpha</code>. This is just a multiplier for <code>dW</code> and <code>dB</code> values we have calculated during the backward propagation. So, derivative pointed us toward the direction we need to take to find a minimum of the cost function (<code>dW</code> and <code>dB</code> sign) and it also showed us how fast we need to go in that direction (absolute values of <code>dW</code> and <code>dB</code>). Now we need to multiply those step sizes to <code>alpha</code> just to adjust our movement to the minimum faster or slower. Sometimes if we use big values for <code>alpha</code>, we might simply jump over the minimum and never find it.</p>
<p>The analogy with the teacher would be that the harder s/he pushes our "nano-kid" the faster our "nano-kid" will learn but if the teacher pushes too …</p></div></div>

<p>container-release — Container system identification</p>

<h3 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h3>
<p><strong>/etc/container-release</strong></p>

<p><strong>/usr/lib/container-release</strong></p>

<h3 id="description">Description</h3>

<p>The /etc/container-release and /usr/lib/container-release files contain container system identification data.</p>

<p>The basic file format of container-release is a newline-separated list of environment-like shell-compatible variable assignments. It is possible to source the configuration from shell scripts, however, beyond mere variable assignments, no shell features are supported (this means variable expansion is explicitly not supported), allowing applications to read the file without implementing a shell compatible execution engine. Variable assignment values must be enclosed in double or single quotes if they include spaces, semicolons or other special characters outside of A–Z, a–z, 0–9. Shell special characters (“$”, quotes, backslash, backtick) must be escaped with backslashes, following shell style. All strings should be in UTF-8 format, and non-printable characters should not be used. It is not supported to concatenate multiple individually quoted strings. Lines beginning with “#” shall be ignored as comments. Blank lines are permitted and ignored.</p>

<p>The file /etc/container-release takes precedence over /usr/lib/container-release. Applications should check for the former, and exclusively use its data if it exists, and only fall back to /usr/lib/container-release if it is missing. Applications should not read data from both files at the same time. /usr/lib/container-release is the recommended place to store Container release information as part of vendor trees. /etc/container-release should be a relative symlink to /usr/lib/container-release, to provide compatibility with applications only looking at /etc/. A relative symlink instead of an absolute symlink is necessary to avoid breaking the link in a chroot or initrd environment such as dracut.</p>

<p>container-release contains data that is defined by the container image system vendor and should generally not be changed by the administrator.</p>

<p>As this file only encodes names and identifiers it should not be localized.</p>

<p>The /etc/container-release and /usr/lib/container-release files might be symlinks to other files, but it is important that the file is available from earliest boot on, and hence must be located on the root file system.</p>

<h3 id="options">Options</h3>

<p>The following Container identifications parameters may be set using container-release:</p>

<p><strong>NAME</strong>=
A string identifying the container image, without a version component, and suitable for presentation to the user. If not set, defaults to “NAME=Application”. Example: “NAME=Nginx” or “NAME=”Nginx/PHP””.</p>

<p><strong>VERSION</strong>=
A string identifying the container image version, possibly including a release code name, and suitable for presentation to the user. This field is optional. Example: “VERSION=17” or “VERSION=”17 (snapshot)””.</p>

<p><strong>ID</strong>=
A lower-case string (no spaces or other characters outside of 0–9, a–z, “.”, “_” and “-“) identifying the operating system, excluding any version information and suitable for processing by scripts or usage in generated filenames. If not set, defaults to “ID=Container”. Example: “ID=nginx” or “ID=apache”.</p>

<p><strong>VERSION_CODENAME</strong>=
A lower-case string (no spaces or other characters outside of 0–9, a–z, “.”, “_” and “-“) identifying the container system release code name, and suitable for processing by scripts or usage in generated filenames. This field is optional and may not be implemented on all images. Examples: “VERSION_CODENAME=daydream”, “VERSION_CODENAME=xenial”</p>

<p><strong>VERSION_ID</strong>=
A lower-case string (mostly numeric, no spaces or other characters outside of 0–9, a–z, “.”, “_” and “-“) identifying the image version, and suitable for processing by scripts or usage in generated filenames. This field is optional. Example: “VERSION_ID=17” or “VERSION_ID=11.04”.</p>

<p><strong>PRETTY_NAME</strong>=
A pretty image system name in a format suitable for presentation to the user. May or may not contain a release code name or image version of some kind, as suitable. If not set, defaults to “PRETTY_NAME=”Nginx””. Example: “PRETTY_NAME=”Apache 17 (Daydream)””.</p>

<p><strong>HOME_URL</strong>=, <strong>DOCUMENTATION_URL</strong>=, <strong>SUPPORT_URL</strong>=, <strong>BUG_REPORT_URL</strong>=, <strong>PRIVACY_POLICY_URL</strong>=
Links to resources on the Internet related to the image. <strong>HOME_URL</strong>= should refer to the homepage of the image, or alternatively some homepage of the specific version of the image. <strong>DOCUMENTATION_URL</strong>= should refer to the main documentation page. SUPPORT_URL= should refer to the main support page for the image, if there is any. This is primarily intended for images which vendors provide support for. BUG_REPORT_URL= should refer to the main bug reporting page for the image system, if there is any. This is primarily intended for images that rely on community QA. <strong>PRIVACY_POLICY_URL</strong>= should refer to the main privacy policy page for the image, if there is any. These settings are optional, and providing only some of these settings is common. These URLs are intended to be exposed in “About this image” UIs behind links with captions such as “About this Image”, “Obtain Support”, “Report a Bug”, or “Privacy Policy”. The values should be in RFC3986 format, and should be “http:” or “https:” URLs, and possibly “mailto:” or “tel:”. Only one URL shall be listed in each setting. If multiple resources need to be referenced, it is recommended to provide an online landing page linking all available resources. Examples: “HOME_URL=”https://docker.com/”” and “BUG_REPORT_URL=”https://bugzilla.redhat.com/””</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>As part of our standard toolkit, we provide each developer at Skroutz
with a writable database snapshot against which she can develop. These
snapshots are updated daily through a pipeline that involves taking an
LVM snapshot of production data, anonymizing the dataset by stripping
all personal data, and transferring it via rsync to the development
database servers. The development servers in turn use ZFS snapshots to
expose a copy-on-write snapshot to each developer, with
self-service tools allowing rollback or upgrades to newer snapshots.</p>

<p>We use the same pipeline to expose MariaDB and MongoDB data, with a
full dataset size of 600GB and 200GB respectively, and a slightly
modified pipeline for Elasticsearch. While on-disk data changes
significantly for all data sources, rsync still saves significant time
by transferring roughly 1/3 of the full data set every night. This
setup has worked rather well for the better part of a decade and has
managed to scale from 15 developers to 150. However, as with most
systems, it has had its fair share of maintenance and has given us
some interesting moments.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting issues we encountered led to the discovery
of a fairly old bug in the Linux kernel TCP implementation: every now
and then, an rsync transfer from a source server would hang
indefinitely for no apparent reason, as — apart from the stuck transfer —
everything else seemed to be in order. What’s more, for reasons that became
apparent later, the issue could not be reproduced at will, although
some actions (e.g. adding an rsync-level rate limit) seemed to make
the issue less frequent, with frequency ranging from once or twice per
week to once every three months.</p>

<p>As is not unusual in these cases, we had more urgent systems and issues to
attend to, so we labeled this a “race condition in rsync” that we
should definitely look into at some point, and worked around it by
throttling the rsync transfers.</p>

<p>Until it started biting us every single day.</p>

<h2 id="rsync-as-a-pipeline">rsync as a pipeline</h2>

<p>While not strictly necessary, knowing how rsync works internally will help
understand the analysis that follows. The rsync site contains <a href="https://rsync.samba.org/how-rsync-works.html">a thorough
description</a> of rsync’s internal architecture, so I’ll try to
summarize the most important points here:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>rsync starts off as a single process on the client and a single
process on the server, communicating via a socket pair. When using
the rsync daemon, as in our case, communication is done over a
plain TCP connection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Based on the direction of sync, after the initial handshake is
over, each end assumes a <em>role</em>, either that of the <em>sender</em>, or
that of the <em>receiver</em>. In our case the client is the receiver,
and the server is the sender.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The receiver forks an additional process called the <em>generator</em>,
sharing the socket with the <em>receiver</em> process. The <em>generator</em>
figures out what it needs to ask from the <em>sender</em>, and the
<em>sender</em> subsequently sends the data to the <em>receiver</em>. What we
essentially have after this step is a pipeline, <em>generator</em> →
<em>sender</em> → <em>receiver</em>, where the arrows are the two directions of
<em>the same</em> TCP connection. While there is some signaling involved,
the pipeline operates in a <em>blocking</em> fashion and relies on OS
buffers and TCP receive windows to apply backpressure.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="a-ghost-in-the-network">A ghost in the network?</h2>

<p>Our first reaction when we encountered the issue was to suspect the
network for errors, which was a <em>reasonable</em> thing to do since we had
recently upgraded our servers and switches. After eliminating the
usual suspects (NIC firmware bugs involving TSO/GSO/GRO/VLAN
offloading, excessive packet drops or CRC errors at the switches etc),
we came to the conclusion that everything was normal and something
else had to be going on.</p>

<p>Attaching the hung processes using strace and gdb told us little: the
generator was hung on <code>send()</code> and the sender and receiver were hung
on <code>recv()</code>, yet no data was moving. However, turning to the kernel on
both systems revealed something interesting! On the client the rsync
socket shared between the <em>generator</em> and the <em>receiver</em> processes was
in the following state:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>$ </span>ss -mito dst :873

<p>while on the server, the socket state was the following:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>$ </span>ss -mito src :873
State      Recv-Q Send-Q                Local Address:Port                                 Peer Address:Port

<p>The interesting thing here is that there are 3.5MB of data on the
client, queued to be sent (❶ in the first output) by the
<em>generator</em> to the server; however, while the server has an empty <code>Recv-Q</code>
and can accept data, nothing seems to be moving forward. If <code>Recv-Q</code>
in the second output was non-zero, we would be looking at rsync on the
server being stuck and not reading from the network, however here it
is obvious that rsync has consumed all incoming data and is not to
blame.</p>

<p>So why is data queued up on one end of the connection, while the other end is
obviously able to accept it? The answer is conveniently hidden in the <code>timer</code>
fields of both <code>ss</code> outputs, especially in
<code>timer:(persist,1min56sec,0)</code>. Quoting <code>ss(8)</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="man">-o, --options
              Show timer information. For TCP protocol, the output format is:

              timer:(&lt;timer_name&gt;,&lt;expire_time&gt;,&lt;retrans&gt;)

              &lt;timer_name&gt;
                     the name of the timer, there are five kind of timer names:

                     on : means one of these  timers:  TCP  retrans  timer,  TCP
                     early retrans timer and tail loss probe timer

                     keepalive: tcp keep alive timer

                     timewait: timewait stage timer

                     persist: zero window probe timer

                     unknown: none of the above timers</code></pre></div>

<p><code>persist</code> means that the connection has received a zero window
advertisement and is waiting for the peer to advertise a non-zero
window.</p>

<h2 id="tcp-zero-windows-and-zero-window-probes">TCP Zero Windows and Zero Window Probes</h2>

<p>TCP implements flow control by limiting the data in flight using a sliding
window called the <em>receive window</em>. Wikipedia has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#Flow_control">good description</a>, but in short each end of a TCP connection advertises how much
data it is willing to buffer for the connection, i.e. how much data the other
end may send before waiting for an acknowledgment.</p>

<p>When one side’s receive buffer (<code>Recv-Q</code>) fills up (in this case
because the rsync process is doing disk I/O at a speed slower than the
network’s), it will send out a zero window advertisement, which will
put that direction of the connection on hold. When buffer space
eventually frees up, the kernel will send an unsolicited window update
with a non-zero window size, and the data transfer continues. To be
safe, just in case this unsolicited window update is lost, the other
end will regularly poll the connection state using the so-called Zero
Window Probes (the <code>persist</code> mode we are seeing here).</p>

<h2 id="the-window-is-stuck-closed">The window is stuck closed</h2>

<p>It’s now time to dive a couple of layers deeper and use <code>tcpdump</code> to
see what’s going on at the network level:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="text">[…]
09:34:34.165148 0c:c4:7a:f9:68:e4 &gt; 0c:c4:7a:f9:69:78, ethertype IPv6 (0x86dd), length 86: (flowlabel 0xcbf6f, hlim 64, next-header TCP (6) payload length: 32) 2001:db8:2a::3.38022 &gt; 2001:db8:2a::18.873: Flags [.], cksum 0x711b (incorrect -&gt; 0x4d39), seq 4212361595, ack 1253278418, win 16384, options [nop,nop,TS val 2864739840 ecr 2885730760], length 0

[… repeats every 2 mins]</code></pre></div>

<p>The first packet is the rsync client’s zero window probe, the second
packet is the server’s response. Surprisingly enough, the server is
advertising a non-zero window size of 13831 bytes¹ which the client
apparently ignores.</p>

<p>¹ actually multiplied by 128 because of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_window_scale_option">window scaling</a> factor
of 7</p>

<p>We are finally making some progress and have a case to work on! At
some point the client encountered a zero window advertisement from the
server as part of regular TCP flow control, but then the window failed
to re-open for some reason. The client seems to be still ignoring
the new window advertised by the server and this is why the transfer
is stuck.</p>

<h2 id="linux-tcp-input-processing">Linux TCP input processing</h2>

<p>By now it’s obvious that the TCP connection is in a weird state on the
rsync client. Since TCP flow control happens at the kernel level, to
get to the root of this we need to look at how the Linux kernel
handles incoming TCP acknowledgments and try to figure out why it
ignores the incoming window advertisement.</p>

<p>Incoming TCP packet processing happens in
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/net/ipv4/tcp_input.c"><code>net/ipv4/tcp_input.c</code></a>.Despite
the <code>ipv4</code> component in the path, this is …</p></div></div>

Because <a href="https://www.inc.com/molly-reynolds/how-to-spot-visual-auditory-and-kinesthetic-learni.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">65% of us are visual learners</a>! We like to see “the big picture” and can absorb information faster from images (vs. text).&nbsp; And, it helps us retain and recall those ideas better.</p><p>Visual storytelling is about using a <em>visual vocabulary</em> (with colors, fonts, icons, and graphical elements) to capture core information (e.g., by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchnoting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sketchnoting</a>) or communicate complex ideas (e.g., using <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/visual-metaphor-1692595" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">visual metaphors</a>).

It is accessible to businesses (aka cloud <em>tenants</em>) and business clients (aka cloud <em>customers</em>) over the internet, supplying global access to those resources.</p><p>I think of a “server” as having three parts: the physical hardware (<em>infrastructure)</em>, the business applications (<em>software)</em>, and the operations middleware (<em>platform</em>) between them.</p><ul><li>Infrastructure = processing, storage, networking</li><li>Platform = operating system, application runtime, and value-added support services</li><li>Sofware = business applications (user interfaces and experiences + interaction data)</li></ul><p>In a <em>physical machine,</em> the infrastructure and platform are tightly coupled. The resource can be under-utilized (when the load is light) or under-performant (when the load is heavy) — making it less cost-effective in the long run.</p><p>A <em>virtualization layer</em> abstracts the hardware (infrastructure) from the middleware (platform), creating a <em>virtual machine (VM)</em> “sandbox” that can run on different hardware “chassis” without the platform components necessarily being aware of underlying changes or differences. Now, the same physical hardware can host multiple VMs that optimize resource usage, and a VM can be spun up on different physical host machines on demand to support load or requirement changes.</p><p>Great! But how does this fit our transport analogy. Let’s see if this analogy works:</p><ul><li><em>A physical machine is like a single-body truck</em>. The cab (“tractor”) and the platform (“trailer”) can’t be used separately here — so our truck capacity may be under-utilized (in light load) and over-loaded (insufficient space) as customer demands rise.</li><li><em>A trailer hitch is like a virtualization layer. </em>By separating tractor from trailer, we can now support more flexible configurations to suit the demand. The business can scale up (add more trailers to the same tractor) or scale out (add more tractor-trailer instances) to suit demand changes or requirements. And, we have more flexibility in trailer types now.</li></ul><p>Chances are, if you think about it more, you might be able to explore other analogies in context.</p><h2>Why Move to the Cloud: “Cheap + Unlimited Tractors/Trailers – Worldwide!”</h2><p>Traditionally, businesses owned and ran their own servers “<em>on-premises,” </em>taking on all the costs and effort for server maintenance and upgrades. It’s analogous to owning a fleet of trucks so you can deliver your services. With virtualization, businesses can separate their infrastructure (truck) from their platform (trailer) options and gain the flexibility to <em>rent (vs. own)</em> either resource from third party providers. Services can still be delivered —but outsourcing maintenance reduces their operating costs and gains them the ability to scale usage as needed.</p><p>Here, cloud providers are like global transport companies with<em> nearly unlimited </em>tractors, trailers at their disposal, available in <em>locations worldwide. </em>Cloud tenants (businesses) can rent what they need (resources), when they need it (demand-driven, configuration-based), where they need it (geo-distribution), to supply the best delivery performance and experience to their customers.</p><p>Cloud providers are now also like <em>utility companies</em> who attach <em>meters</em> to all the resources they rent, so that you get charged only for what you use. The <em>economies of scale </em>(“the more you make of something, the less it costs to make it”) makes <em>renting cloud resources cheaper </em>in the long run when compared to overheads of buying, and maintaining, your own server resources.</p><h2>Cloud Computing Types: Understanding Deployment Models</h2><p>Armed with this analogy, let us tackle <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-fundamentals/what-is-cloud-computing?WT.mc_id=mobile-12359-ninarasi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cloud deployment models</a>! There are 3 cloud types:</p><ul><li><em>Private =</em> computing resources are used exclusively by users from one business or org.<em></em></li><li><em>Public</em> = services offered over public internet, to anyone who wants to rent them.<em></em></li><li><em>Hybrid =</em> environments combine both, sharing data and applications between them.<em></em></li></ul><p>Now let’s look at this through the lens of our tractors and trailers analogy.</p><ul><li>Private cloud = business owns and manages its own fleet of trucks. You have full control (data, security) and take on all responsibility (cost, maintenance).</li><li>Public cloud = you rent trucks from a global company that everyone else uses as well. Resources may be shared or reused, and SLAs help you set up cost-security tradeoffs.</li><li>Hybrid cloud = you own some trucks/trailers and rent others – so your products and customer data may be used with both. Gives you a good migration path from private to public cloud, where you transition your operational responsibilities incrementally.</li></ul><h3>Cloud Computing Service Models: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS</h3><p>The deployment models enable <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/business/what-is-cloud-migration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cloud migration</a> paths (from on-premises to public cloud) iteratively, helping you balance security-cost tradeoffs while evaluating impact on your business.</p><ul><li>Virtualize physical machines = replace <em>owned</em> single-body trucks with tractor-trailers</li><li>Move virtual machines to cloud = hitch <em>owned</em> trailers onto <em>rented</em> tractors (hardware)</li><li>Move to virtual cloud services = replace owned trailers with <em>rented</em> trailer services</li><li>Focus on innovating my software = focus on improving products, not managing infra</li></ul><p>Now, I <em>pay-as-I-go</em> for things I rent, and no longer have to pay for (or think about) maintenance of hardware or platform components. And I can effortlessly take advantage of the latest new hardware or platform enhancements for performance or innovation improvement.</p><p>This leads to our next topic: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-fundamentals/what-is-cloud-computing?WT.mc_id=mobile-12359-ninarasi">Cloud Computing Service Models</a>.

                        <p>As the global economy becomes increasingly technology-driven and less trade-driven, the most important demographic to understand is developers. These are not just underground hackers or hoodie-wearing code monkeys; they are creative problem solvers who use digital technology to build things. In my last deep-dive, <a href="https://interconnected.blog/what-does-agora-api-do/">I profiled Agora</a>, the API platform company for building apps with real-time audio and video capabilities. One of the reasons behind its current success is its product’s developer-friendliness.</p><p>So how many developers are there? How many will there be to power this global economy? And where will the next generation of developers come from?</p><p>There are currently 56 million developers on GitHub, the world’s dominant developer collaboration platform, according to its own “<a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">2020 State of the Octoverse</a>” report. GitLab is a fierce competitor of GitHub. BitBucket and SourceForge are both still around. Alternatives like Gitee are also being fostered. Thus, there are likely more than 56 million developers total at this moment.</p><p>GitHub predicts having 100 million developers on its platform by 2025, so we are looking at an almost <strong>doubling</strong> of the number of developers in the next five years. That’s why in my “Global by Nature” series -- my investment and opportunity set for the next 10 years -- <a href="https://interconnected.blog/global-by-nature-developers/">I placed understanding developers</a> at the very top of all considerations.</p><p>Digging deeper into GitHub’s report, there are some fascinating trends to illuminate where these next 50-million-plus developers will come from and what that means for the next phase of globalization.</p><h2 id="from-2015-to-2030">From 2015 to 2030</h2><p>The 2020 State of Octoverse report provides a nice visual of where open source contributors were coming from and where they may be from in the future -- from 2015 to 2020 and projecting into 2025 and 2030. Open source technologies are powering the world’s economy. Thus, open source contributor count is both an effective heuristic of developer growth (most developers use or contribute to open source) and overall economic growth.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/uZ5ZFGEadcpbUXWKQV3FL19XvkpN8NtWbcw7rJuIULZer0LSCgvtiDeLsb_rjPgmwIZNyCCKfKfSr9n3f_2SzSp5cVDS99zf5cuRX1YS6nu2iqM4LEwa7Cs3zbrNSmUwun1LwYsD" alt=""><figcaption>Source: https://octoverse.github.com/</figcaption></figure><p>In 2015, <strong>the US </strong>was the lone bright spot, accounting for <strong>30.4% </strong>of the world’s open source contributors. <strong>Germany</strong> and <strong>the UK </strong>were number 2 and 3 with <strong>7.3%</strong> and <strong>5.8%</strong> respectively.</p><p>However, in just five years, that distribution has shifted quite significantly. By 2020, <strong>the US</strong> is still number 1 but its proportion of contributors has fallen to <strong>22.7%</strong>, while <strong>China</strong> and <strong>India</strong> raced ahead to <strong>9.76%</strong> and <strong>5.2%</strong> respectively. Being the two largest developing countries, China and India’s growth shouldn’t come as a huge surprise. What may be surprising is the growth of other smaller countries and regions. Here’s the top five in terms of year-on-year growth rate in 2020:</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/emsaIgXNDs_JLXSW_Yr0T2VfAnca-avcXy9vsU2cAba2jyaboAoA8qf2hJBpJsgPWeFQ8BhuEvC8RmiCe5kl46WMln-2AjdQjrV2R3oUapBJVsW6nGmvyZfh1Dno54FerDR8bMHt" alt=""><figcaption>Source: https://octoverse.github.com/</figcaption></figure><p>Pakistan, Indonesia, Turkey, Colombia, and Peru round out the second half of the top 10. It’s also important to keep in mind that huge growth rates are usually the result of a small base number, so take that into account when you think about these rather large growth numbers. What’s more interesting to me is that the fastest growing developer clusters are coming from Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America.</p><p>Looking into GitHub’s “crystal ball,” by 2025, <strong>the US</strong>’s open source contribution is expected to decrease and stabilize to around <strong>16.4%</strong>. <strong>China</strong>’s share will continue to increase to <strong>13.3%</strong>, <strong>India</strong>’s to <strong>7.9%</strong>, while <strong>Brazil</strong> and <strong>Nigeria</strong> may register <strong>3%</strong> and <strong>1.5%</strong> respectively.</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Wi1jkKjwv40iKBLyCMRK2irELRF7_SOZeQkeSJPUwDrrNHwkv2jb6YDmBSuLyj5MEm0latqa3JfFDljRy4eEZpwUCOhCdRCwnn1drWAsTJHLENTH4vwXqyRtbXiBudA_SvHk-xwK" alt=""><figcaption>Source: https://octoverse.github.com/</figcaption></figure><p>GitHub did not provide a prediction for 2030, but its report did provide the same visual for what 10 years from now may look like. If you squint hard enough, <strong>China</strong> appears to be a brighter spot than <strong>the US</strong>, while <strong>India</strong>, <strong>Brazil</strong>, <strong>Russia</strong>, and <strong>Nigeria</strong> continue to get noticeably brighter. One other country that looks more visible is <strong>Indonesia</strong>.</p><p>With the exception of South Africa, this trend aligns well with the overall growth of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS">BRICS</a> countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa). It’s a short-hand of the major emerging economies, which became a loose international group that was first organized back in 2009. Its developed economies counterpart, the G7, appears to not be a part of this global developer growth wave; only the US and Germany look to maintain significant open source contributor shares.</p><h2 id="emerging-market-developers-impact">Emerging Market Developers’ Impact</h2><p>Of course, squinting is not real analysis. But it is clear that the distribution of developers will be more widespread around the world. What’s not so clear is where and how they will make economic impact.</p><p>I see the emerging market developers’ impact falling into three buckets in the next 10 years: <strong>outsourcing outposts, building domestic markets, founding global-scale startups.</strong></p><p><strong>Outsourcing outposts:</strong> this category is the easiest to understand, because it has been happening for a long time. Large, mature tech companies like IBM and Intel will continue to move low-end non-core technical jobs to cheaper locations with a large pool of technical workforce. India has been a big beneficiary of this trend. Other countries like Brazil and Nigeria may soon follow. Unless there are policy changes in the US that force these companies to onshore more jobs back to America to boost domestic employment, offshoring will continue, just to different locations depending on the price and size of the developer pool. The local economic impact of these “offshore developers” will be somewhat limited, as most of the savings and efficiency gains will be accrued to the multinationals doing the offshoring.</p><p><strong>Building domestic markets:</strong> more and more tech startups are being founded in emerging markets to serve those emerging markets. I briefly <a href="https://interconnected.blog/southeast-asia-pacific-light-cable-network/">profiled four tech giants in Southeast Asia</a> in a previous post -- Grab, Gojek, SEA Group, Tokopedia. SEA Group is already a publicly traded company in New York and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-25/grab-is-said-to-pick-morgan-stanley-jpmorgan-for-u-s-ipo">Grab may soon do the same</a>. India also has a strong corp of high-growth tech companies with 21 unicorns to date, which I wrote a deep dive on in July of last year in “<a href="https://interconnected.blog/unicorns-entanglement-india-china-america/">Unicorns Entanglement: India, China, America</a>”. Companies like Mercado (e-commerce), Rappi (delivery service), and Nubank (neobank) lead the way in the LATAM region. Jumia (e-commerce) is the current standout in Africa. While none of these markets are anywhere near the same level as the US, the EU or China when it comes to technological sophistication or output, they all have high-growth developer clusters, as we saw above. That means they will catch up fast, particularly as more of these emerging market developers learn, use, and contribute to best-in-class open source projects, which are a big equalizer of technology access. These developers will have plenty of great companies to work for to build their domestic markets.</p><p><strong>Founding global-scale startups: </strong>this last scenario will take the longest time to play out but, from an investor’s point of view, is also the most attractive to me. As a developer hub matures and levels-up, it will solve harder and harder problems -- first for the outsourcers, then its domestic emerging markets to bring them up-to-par with mature markets, then ultimately tackling problems that even the mature markets might need solutions to! These developers’ economic impact will be global.</p><p>It’s not unfathomable to imagine some cloud computing, enterprise tech, and AI products being built by developers in India or Brazil and selling well in the US and EU. (After all, most technology spending is still happening in developed countries.) Climate change technology is another sector where emerging market solutions can flow to developed markets. The Israeli developer ecosystem is already creating startups that are serving markets well-beyond its own border or Europe. Enterprise tech companies founded in Russia and China are also making progress in the US and EU, though they are facing unprecedented geopolitical headwinds.</p><p>This future creates both the exciting prospect of global companies being built outside of wealthy countries and the tough challenge of building, scaling, and operating global companies from places where there was no history of having done so. And much of how this future will play out will depend on how this next crop of developers use the technological superpower at their fingertips, now that we know where they will come from.</p><p><em><strong>If you like what you've read, please <a href="https://interconnected.blog/#subscribe">SUBSCRIBE</a> to the Interconnected email list.

<p>Let me say up front, I’m <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/07/09/a-word-on-anti-furry-sentiments-in-the-tech-community/">no stranger to negative or ridiculous feedback</a>. It’s incredibly hard to hurt my feelings, especially if you intend to. You don’t openly participate in <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/04/23/never-underestimate-the-furry-fandom/">the furry fandom</a> since 2010 without being accustomed to malevolence and trolling. If this were simply a story of someone being an asshole to me, I would have shrugged and moved on with my life.</p>



<p>It’s important that you understand this, because when you call it like you see it, sometimes people dismiss your criticism with <a href="https://www.takethis.org/2016/04/triggered-a-personal-response-to-a-popular-meme/">“triggered” memes</a>. This isn’t me being offended. I promise.</p>



<hr>



<p>My recent blog post about <a href="https://soatok.blog/2021/02/09/crackpot-cryptography-and-security-theater/">crackpot cryptography</a> received a fair bit of attention in the software community. At one point it was on the front page of Hacker News (which is something that pretty much never happens for anything I write).</p>



<p>Unfortunately, that also means I crossed paths with Zed A. Shaw, the author of <em>Learn Python the Hard Way</em> and other books often recommended to neophyte software developers.</p>



<p>As someone who spends a lot of time <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/06/08/furward-momentum-introduction/">trying to help newcomers acclimate to the technology industry</a>, there are some behaviors I’ve recognized in technologists over the years that makes it harder for newcomers to overcome anxiety, frustration, and Impostor Syndrome. (Especially if they’re LGBTQIA+, a person of color, or a woman.)</p>



<p>Normally, these are easily correctable behaviors exhibited by people who have good intentions but don’t realize the harm they’re causing–often not by what they’re saying, but by how they say it.</p>



<p>Sadly, I can’t be so generous about… whatever <em>this</em> is:</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Every time I read something by a cryptographer claiming to know when people are qualified to attempt cryptography software I go and see if they said *anything* about OpenSSL during the 20+ years it was obviously flawed:<a href="https://t.co/Iw9rtUm1rY">https://t.co/Iw9rtUm1rY</a></p><p>Nope.

</div><figcaption>What the fuck.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Having never before encountered a living example of a poorly-written villain towards the work I do to help disadvantaged people thrive in technology careers, I sought to clarify Shaw’s intent.</p>



<figure><div>

</div><figcaption>The shitshow is <a href="https://archive.md/ajsRy">archived</a> too.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is effectively a very <em>weird</em> hybrid of an oddly-specific purity test and a form of hazing ritual.</p>



<p>Let’s step back for a second. Can you even fathom the damage attitudes like this can cause? I can tell you firsthand, because it happened to me.</p>



<h2 id="interlude">Interlude: Amplified Impostor Syndrome</h2>



<p>In the beginning of my career, I was just a humble web programmer. Due to a long story I don’t want to get into now, I was acquainted with the culture of black-hat hacking that precipitates the DEF CON community.</p>



<p>In particular, I was exposed the writings of a malicious group called <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/ezines/kr5hou2zh4qtebqk.onion/ZF0/">Zero For 0wned</a>, which made sport of hunting “skiddiez” and preached a very “shut up and stay in your lane” attitude:</p>



<blockquote><p>Geeks don’t really come to HOPE to be lectured on the application of something simple, with very simple means, by a 15 year old. A combination of all the above could be why your room wasn’t full. Not only was it fairly empty, but it emptied at a rapid rate. I could barely take a seat through the masses pushing me to escape. Then when I thought no more people could possibly leave, they kept going. The room was almost empty when I gave in and left also. Heck, I was only there because we pwned the very resources you were talking about.</p><cite>Zero For 0wned</cite></blockquote>



<p>My first security conference was B-Sides Orlando in 2013. Before the conference, I had been hanging out in the #hackucf IRC channel and had known about the event well in advance (and got along with all the organizers and most of the would-be attendees), and considered applying to their CFP.</p>



<p>I ultimately didn’t, solely because I was worried about a ZF0-style reception. </p>



<p>I had no reference frame for other folks’ understanding of cryptography (which is my chosen area of discipline in infosec), and thought things like timing side-channels were “obvious”–even to software developers outside infosec. (Such is the danger of being self-taught!)</p>



<p>“Geeks don’t really come to B-Sides Orlando to be lectured on the application of something simple, with very simple means,” is roughly how I imagined the vitriol would be framed.</p>



<p>If it can happen to me, it can happen to <em>anyone</em> interested in tech. It’s the responsibility of experts and mentors to spare beginners from falling into the trappings of other peoples’ grand-standing.</p>



<h2 id="arrogance">Pride Before Destruction</h2>



<p>With this in mind, let’s return to Shaw. At this point, more clarifying questions came in, this time from Fredrick Brennan.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>OpenSSL had way more problems than only memory safety, but since you don't know about the various downgrade and SSL/TLS protocol issues you just outed yourself as knowing less about cryptography than me.</p><p>And, my whole point is you're no expert because you didn't see them.</p></div>— Zed A. Shaw, Writer (@lzsthw) <a href="https://twitter.com/lzsthw/status/1359712275666505734?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2021</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>What an arrogant and bombastic thing to say!</p>



<p>At this point, I concluded that <a href="https://twitter.com/SoatokDhole/status/1359703488998105090">I can never again, in good conscience, recommend any of Shaw’s books to a fledgling programmer</a>.</p>



<p>If you’ve ever published book recommendations before, I suggest auditing them to make sure you’re not inadvertently exposing beginners to his harmful attitude and problematic behavior.</p>



<p>But while we’re on the subject of Zed Shaw’s behavior…</p>



<figure><div>

</div><figcaption>This is actually the dude’s pinned tweet.</figcaption></figure>



<p>If Shaw thinks of himself as a superior cryptography expert, surely he’s published cryptography code online before.</p>



<p>And surely, it will withstand a five-minute code review from a gay furry blogger who never went through Shaw’s prescribed hazing ritual to rediscover specifically the known problems in OpenSSL circa Heartbleed and is therefore not as much of a cryptography expert?</p>







<h2 id="zero-day">May I Offer You a Zero-Day in This Trying Time?</h2>



<p>One of Zed A. Shaw’s Github projects is <a href="https://github.com/zedshaw/srpmin">an implementation of SRP</a> (Secure Remote Password)–an early Password-Authenticated Key Exchange algorithm often integrated with TLS (to form TLS-SRP).</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="2758" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/2021/02/11/on-the-toxicity-of-zed-a-shaw/srpmin/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/srpmin.png" data-orig-size="693,463" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="srpmin" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/srpmin.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/srpmin.png?w=580" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/srpmin.png?w=693" alt="" srcset="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/srpmin.png 693w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/srpmin.png?w=150 150w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/srpmin.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 693px) 100vw, 693px"><figcaption>Zed Shaw’s SRP implementation</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Without even looking past the directory structure, we can already see that it implements <a href="https://github.com/zedshaw/srpmin/blob/master/t_truerand.c">an algorithm called TrueRand</a>, which cryptographer Matt Blaze has this to say:</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/tqbf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@tqbf</a> Also: please nobody use truerand. It's 20 yrs old, from before we had /dev/urandom. In dog years, it's eligible for retirement.</p>— matt blaze (@mattblaze) <a href="https://twitter.com/mattblaze/status/438464425566412800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 26, 2014</a></blockquote></div>
</div><figcaption>You should be <a href="https://www.2uo.de/myths-about-urandom/">using /dev/urandom</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>As noted by the README, Shaw stripped out all of the “extraneous” things and doesn’t have all of the previous versions of SRP “since those are known to be vulnerable”.</p>



<p>So given Shaw’s previous behavior, and the removal of vulnerable versions of SRP from his fork of Tom Wu’s libsrp code, it stands to reason that Shaw believes the cryptography code he published would be secure. Otherwise, why would he behave with such arrogance?</p>



<h3>SRP in the Grass</h3>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="2723" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/2021/02/09/crackpot-cryptography-and-security-theater/soatok-by-scruffkerfluff-smol/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/soatok-by-scruffkerfluff-smol-1.png" data-orig-size="1200,960" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Soatok-by-ScruffKerfluff-Smol" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/soatok-by-scruffkerfluff-smol-1.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/soatok-by-scruffkerfluff-smol-1.png?w=580" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/soatok-by-scruffkerfluff-smol-1.png" alt=""><figcaption><strong>Head’s up!</strong> If you aren’t cryptographically or mathematically inclined, this section might be a bit dense for your tastes. (Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/ScruffKerfluff/">Scruff</a>.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>When I say SRP, I’m referring to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol">SRP-6a</a>. Earlier versions of the protocol are out of scope; as are proposed variants (e.g. ones that employ SHA-256 instead of SHA-1).</p>



<p>Professor Matthew D. Green of Johns Hopkins University (who incidentally used to proverbially shit on OpenSSL in the way that Shaw expects everyone to, except productively) <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/should-you-use-srp/">dislikes SRP but considered the protocol “not obviously broken”</a>.</p>



<p>However, a secure protocol doesn’t mean the implementations are always secure. (Anyone who’s looked at older versions of OpenSSL’s BigNum library after reading my <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/08/27/soatoks-guide-to-side-channel-attacks/">guide to side-channel attacks</a> knows better.)</p>



<p>There are a few ways to implement SRP insecurely:</p>



<ol><li>Use an insecure random number generator (e.g. TrueRand) for salts or private keys.</li><li>Fail to use a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5054#appendix-A">secure set of parameters</a> (q, N, g).<p>To expand on this, SRP requires q be a Sophie-Germain prime and N be its corresponding Safe Prime. The standard Diffie-Hellman primes (MODP) are not sufficient for SRP.</p><p>This security requirement exists because SRP requires an algebraic structure called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics)">ring</a>, rather than a cyclic group (as per Diffie-Hellman).</p></li><li>Fail to perform the critical validation steps <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5054#section-3.1">as outlined in RFC 5054</a>.</li></ol>



<p>In one way or another, Shaw’s SRP library fails at every step of the way. The first two are trivial:</p>



<ol><li>We’ve already seen the RNG used by srpmin. <a href="https://www.schneier.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/paper-prngs.pdf">TrueRand is not a cryptographically secure pseudo random number generator</a>.</li><li>Zed A. Shaw’s srpmin <a href="https://github.com/zedshaw/srpmin/blob/217ec0a968a551fe6452c9bef7b37b38e165c94f/t_conf.c#L39-L107">only supports unsafe primes</a> for SRP (i.e. the ones from RFC 3526, which is for Diffie-Hellman).</li></ol>



<p>The third is more interesting. Let’s talk about the RFC 5054 validation steps in more detail.</p>



<h4 id="srp6a-validation">Parameter Validation in SRP-6a</h4>



<p>From a client’s perspective, you must verify that <code>(B % N) != 0</code>. This is critical to the security of SRP. This check <a href="http://srp.stanford.edu/ndss.html#SECTION00043000000000000000">prevents dictionary attacks on the password from a man-in-the-middle</a>.</p>



<p>From the server’s (or a peer’s) perspective, you must also verify <code>(A % N) &gt; 0</code> to prevent the server’s session key from being forced to a known value (i.e. zero).</p>



<p>Additionally, the value <a href="http://srp.stanford.edu/ndss.html#SECTION00032400000000000000"><code>u</code> must not be revealed by the server until the client has sent <code>A</code></a>. It must also not be set to <code>0</code>. Failure to uphold these constraints can allow clients to impersonate their peers.</p>



<p>These are obvious and well-known SRP constraints first published in 1997 by Tom Wu.</p>

  </figure><p>Our team evaluated several options, and wound up pursuing a pragmatic approach which we were able to implement for our entire application in less than six weeks. We are excited to share some details for others who might be thinking through similar decisions.</p><h2>State of the Art</h2><p>There are two dominant approaches to multi-user collaboration today: <strong>Operational Transforms</strong> and <strong>Conflict-free Replicated Data Types</strong>. Both are powerful, although they come with trade-offs that make implementation challenging, particularly for smaller teams like ours. There is also a lesser-known hybrid approach—originally pioneered by Figma—geared towards ease of implementation.</p><h3>Operational Transforms</h3><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Operational Transforms</a> (OT) has been around for years. This technology is famously used to back Google Docs, and there are a number of reference implementations available on the web.</p><div><div><p><strong>The basic idea of OT</strong> is to decompose all state mutations to specific operations.</p><p>As an example, let's say we want two editors to simultaneously edit the string <code>ello</code>. Editor 1 sends an operation that inserts <code>!</code> at position 4 (or <code>[!, 4]</code> for short) and Editor 2 sends another operation that inserts <code>H</code> at position 0 (or <code>[H, 0]</code>).</p><p>If received in this order, a client can process these operations as they are and get the desired text <code>Hello!</code>. However, if a client were to receive <code>[H, 0]</code> first and <code>[!, 4]</code> second, the resulting string would be the incorrect <code>Hell!o</code>. OT implementations need to account for this, and implement a transformation to correct or "transform" the second operation to <code>[!, 5]</code> in order to preserve the user's intent and get <code>Hello!</code>.</p></div></div><p>In order to properly broker operations between clients, OT requires a centralized server, which may not be acceptable for all use cases.</p><p>OT offers a lot of control to the developer over how user actions are de-conflicted, making it easy to preserve user intent and context.</p><p>The "transform" part, however, can be quite tricky and error-prone since an implementor needs to account for each pair of operations. The number of possible combinations grows quadratically with the number of operations, meaning even with extensive testing it's possible to miss an edge case. This combinatorial complexity means an application gets harder and harder to reason about over time. <sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></p><h3>Conflict-free Replicated Data Types</h3><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Conflict-free Replicated Data Types</a> (CRDTs) are a newer alternative that sidesteps much of the complexity that burdens OT.</p><div><div><p><strong>The basic idea of CRDT</strong> is to use data structures that are inherently (you guessed it) conflict-free.</p><p>There are <a href="https://github.com/pfrazee/crdt_notes/tree/68c5fe81ade109446a9f4c24e03290ec5493031f#portfolio-of-basic-crdts" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">several different CRDTs</a>, each with their own implementation details. An example CRDT is a <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/java-conflict-free-replicated-data-types#grow-only-set" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Grow Only Set</a>, which can only have elements added to it, but never removed. Conflicts are avoided since it is impossible to add/remove an item at the same time.</p><p>A multiplayer application can compose different types of CRDTs to create more complex structures for modeling its state.</p></div></div><p>CRDTs avoid the combinatorial complexity that comes along with OT, and also enable direct client-to-client communication, removing the need for a central server. Despite these advantages, they still have major trade-offs.</p><p>While CRDTs are correct from a mathematical standpoint, they might not have the correct semantics for a specific application. For example, the result of a state mutation is always consistent, but it may not be exactly what was expected since it's possible to lose user intent. <sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup></p><p>CRDTs also trade off the complexity of resolving conflicts for a more challenging initial implementation, due to their reliance on algorithms like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_clock" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">vector clocks</a>. They also incur a fair amount of storage overhead—while there is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7drE24geUw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3198" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">progress being made</a>, avoiding this problem requires foresight and cleverness. And since CRDTs are newer, there are fewer reference implementations. <sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup></p><h3>Figma's Hybrid Approach</h3><p>While at first we considered OT and CRDTs as our two main options, we were intrigued by <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the pragmatic approach taken by Figma</a>. They borrowed some ideas from CRDTs, like a <a href="https://github.com/pfrazee/crdt_notes/tree/68c5fe81ade109446a9f4c24e03290ec5493031f#last-writer-wins-register-lww-register" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">last-writer-wins data register</a>. Instead of using vector clocks to provide an ordering guarantee, however, they used a central authority, similar to OT.</p><p>By using the best parts of both OT and CRDTs, Figma avoided challenges with de-conflicting operations and difficulty of implementation. The main trade-off is that certain functionality, such as multi-user editable text strings, is not easily supported.</p><p>Figma's hybrid technique resonated with us as being both practical and elegant, although it was surprising that we couldn't find examples of others pursuing a similar approach. <sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup></p><p>

<figcaption>From Figma's Blog Post</figcaption></p><h2>Choosing a Path</h2><p>As we assessed our options, we weighed a few key factors:</p><h3>Taking it step by step</h3><p>It was important to us that our solution was <a href="https://hex.tech/blog/incremental-shipping" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">shippable incrementally</a> and completable within a reasonable time frame. Any solution that required rewriting significant parts of our code base all at once, or a "big bang" cutover, would have not been acceptable.</p><h3>Our current stack</h3><p>Some existing multiplayer frameworks, such as <a href="https://github.com/share/sharedb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ShareDB</a>, require storing the model in a specific format and shape, or that the frontend connects to the model in a particular way.</p><p>We wanted to avoid major changes like this. An ideal solution would need to work well with our current tools, including:</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Apollo + GraphQL</a> to build an API schema shared by our frontend and backend services</li>
<li><a href="https://graphql-code-generator.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GraphQL Code Generator</a> and Typescript to ensure type safety across the entire stack</li>
<li><a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Apollo Client</a> on the frontend to store requested data in a normalized object cache that allows React to intelligently subscribe to changes</li>
<li>PostgreSQL and relational database patterns/features like normalization, constraints, and transactions to help guarantee data consistency and correctness</li>
</ul><p>This stack strikes a good balance between feature velocity and stability, and we wanted to build on top of it—not replace it.</p><h3>Controlling our destiny</h3><p>As we considered these approaches, we evaluated a number of open source libraries. We're generally enthusiastic about adopting and contributing to OSS, and originally thought to do so here.</p><p>While there are some great projects out there, like <a href="https://github.com/automerge/automerge" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Automerge</a> and <a href="https://github.com/yjs/yjs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Y.js</a>, it can be risky to outsource something as core as our application state. Even really promising projects can lose momentum: <a href="https://github.com/Operational-Transformation/ot.js/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ot.js</a>, for example, is an Operational Transform library with over 1.2k stars on Github, but is no longer under active development and is looking for a maintainer.</p><h2>Atomic Operations</h2><p>After considering our options, we pursued an approach inspired by Figma's hybrid solution. We call it <strong>Atomic Operations (AO),</strong> as all edits to application state are broken down to their smallest <em>atomic</em> parts.</p><p>For us, this technique struck the right balance between ease of implementation, compatibility with our stack, and control over the application foundations.</p><p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="splitting atom" title="splitting atom" src="https://hex.tech/static/6f23e527d113a4b225b481e26dff0926/b38af/splitting-atom.png" srcset="https://hex.tech/static/6f23e527d113a4b225b481e26dff0926/ccb66/splitting-atom.png 185w, https://hex.tech/static/6f23e527d113a4b225b481e26dff0926/3ac6e/splitting-atom.png 370w, https://hex.tech/static/6f23e527d113a4b225b481e26dff0926/b38af/splitting-atom.png 740w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p><h3>Splitting the Atom</h3><p>AO mutations exist at the single property update level, such that <strong>two operations of different types cannot conflict with each other.</strong></p><p>It is, however, still possible for two operations of the <em>same type</em> to conflict. This is determined by an operation's <code>conflictId</code>, which is a concatenation of its type and the ID of the object being edited. <sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup> Since we use last-writer-wins semantics, we don't merge conflicts, we just pick a winner.</p><p>For determining which operation is "last", the server keeps track of a monotonically increasing counter per object that increments with each write. Upon acknowledging an operation, the server includes the latest value of this counter. To determine which operation is a winner, the client simply chooses the operation with the higher value. A central authority is required to implement this monotonic counter, prohibiting any distributed implementations.</p><p>As an example, take a hypothetical object type "foobar":</p><div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>interface</span> <span>Foobar</span> <span>{</span>
  id<span>:</span> <span>string</span>
  name<span>:</span> <span>string</span>
  color<span>:</span> <span>string</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>Here are some examples of atomic operations for creating and editing a foobar:</p><div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>type</span><span>:</span> <span>"CREATE_FOOBAR"</span><span>,</span>
  conflictId<span>:</span> <span>"CREATE_FOOBAR-123ABC"</span><span>,</span>
  payload<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    id<span>:</span> <span>"123ABC"</span><span>,</span>
    name<span>:</span> <span>"My new foobar"</span><span>,</span>
    color<span>:</span> <span>"#DE1738"</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>{</span>
  <span>type</span><span>:</span> <span>"SET_FOOBAR_COLOR"</span><span>,</span>
  conflictId<span>:</span> <span>"SET_FOOBAR_COLOR-123ABC"</span><span>,</span>
  creationId<span>:</span> <span>"CREATE_FOOBAR-123ABC"</span><span>,</span>
  payload<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    id<span>:</span> <span>"123ABC"</span><span>,</span>
    newColor<span>:</span> <span>"#0B6623"</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>Again: by breaking down all edits to a foobar object to changing individual properties, we remove the need to worry about how different operations might merge—<strong>at this level of granularity, only one write <em>can</em> win.</strong></p><p>A nice benefit of this decomposition is that all mutations to state are described by plain objects. A keen eye might note some parallels with how <a href="https://redux.js.org/basics/actions" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Redux defines actions</a>, and indeed AO similarly benefits from making state mutations predictable, transparent, and easily testable.</p><p>Finally, we implemented undo / redo by requiring all atomic operation to include an additional operation that can undo the change. As an example:</p><div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>type</span><span>:</span> <span>"SET_FOOBAR_NAME"</span><span>,</span>
  conflictId<span>:</span> <span>"SET_FOOBAR_NAME-123ABC"</span><span>,</span>
  creationId<span>:</span> <span>"CREATE_FOOBAR-123ABC"</span><span>,</span>
  payload<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    id<span>:</span> <span>"123ABC"</span><span>,</span>
    newName<span>:</span> <span>"My slightly less new foobar"</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  undo<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>type</span><span>:</span> <span>"SET_FOOBAR_NAME"</span><span>,</span>
    conflictId<span>:</span> <span>"SET_FOOBAR_NAME-123ABC"</span><span>,</span>
    creationId<span>:</span> <span>"CREATE_FOOBAR-123ABC"</span><span>,</span>
    payload<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
      id<span>:</span> <span>"123ABC"</span><span>,</span>
      newName<span>:</span> <span>"My new foobar"</span> 
    <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><h3>Getting fractional</h3><p>A drawback of AO is that certain types of mutations can be difficult to express as simple last-writer-wins operations.</p><p>One such case is ordered collections. With classic integer indexing of a collection, …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

Whoever completes the challenge first wins 1 share of Roblox and eternal bragging rights. As someone who is very bullish on the social gaming company and enjoys gloating, I'm taking this seriously. I've stepped up my cadence and have come from behind to pull even with Packy. (He may have more minutes under his belt, but I'm all about that HIIT training).

The dating company is hitting the public markets this Thursday. It is expected to fetch a roughly $7 billion valuation, with $416.56 million in revenue recorded over the first nine months of 2020, an increase of 14.86%. <br></p><p>Though many will be familiar with the bold yellow stylings of the Bumble app, that product represents just half of the story. Badoo, a dating company popular in Europe and Latin America, is also part of the package investors are buying. Not only is that company inextricably linked with the Bumble story, but it also poses fascinating questions, hinting at future geographical expansion and alluding to weaknesses in the messaging that has made a "women-first" empire tick. <br></p><h2>Analysts</h2><p><a href="https://twitter.com/BSchech">Brian Schechter</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/lucymort_">Lucy Mort</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/austin_rief">Austin Rief</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/adam_keesling">Adam Keesling</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/venturetwins">Justine and Olivia Moore</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/rex_woodbury">Rex Woodbury</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/JordanBanaf">Jordan Banafsheha</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/cm_brown90">Chris Brown</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/austinhankwitz">Austin Hankwitz</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/eric_seufert">Eric Seufert</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ImChauncey">Chauncey TK Hamilton</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/mariodgabriele">Mario Gabriele</a></p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Have you seen the devil lately?<br></p><p>Perhaps he alighted on your shoulder as you contemplated a second slice of chocolate cake or poured poison in your ear that burned into a hard word you wish you hadn't said and didn't mean. Maybe he manifested in some bleaker moment, a dark night of the soul, proposing an easier, sweeter path — all that was needed was a little compromise, the scrapping of pesky integrity. <br></p><p>He has the best lines and, at first glance, the best terms. <em>Let's make a deal</em>, he sings, voice as avuncular as Monty Hall himself. <br></p><p>You take it. Don't feel bad. We all have made some concession we wish we hadn't, chosen the road of lesser morals at one time or another. We have all made a deal with the devil, his manifestation in ourselves or others (how fun it is to tempt each other); seen a wiser, truer choice and said, <em>to hell with it</em>. <br></p><p>History is teeming with stories of this kind — the meeting with Mephistopheles, the Faustian bargain. The violinist Paganini, the composer Musard, Robert Johnson down at the Mississippi crossroads: all of them did a samba with Satan in exchange for their prodigious gifts, or so it was rumored. <br></p><p>Whitney Herd's devil wore Prada. <br></p><p>In 2019, Andrey Andreev crowed that he had "the world's biggest collection of Prada white T-shirts." (Weird flex, but ok.) By that point, he was one of the biggest power-brokers in the dating game. Not only was he suzerain of Badoo, one of Europe's largest dating apps, but he was co-founder of Bumble. Though Herd was the more vivid, public embodiment of the app, Andreev was its actually biggest shareholder. That might not have mattered had there been a more copacetic match between Badoo and Bumble — but it would prove a liability. <br></p><p>We're getting ahead of ourselves, though. First, let's roll back the clock to 2014. <br></p><p>Whitney Herd left Tinder in inflammatory circumstances. As part of her departure, Herd filed a lawsuit against her old employer, alleging sexual harassment and discrimination. That claim generated significant attention, including from Andreev. He'd only met Herd in passing but he suggested a meeting. He had an idea. <br></p><p>While Herd had initially set her sights on building an Instagram competitor that only allowed for positive commentary (sounds nice, to be honest), Andreev countered with a proposal of his own. Herd, he thought, should capitalize on the recognition she was receiving to make a play in the dating space. And he had just the co-founder for her: him. In exchange for 79% of the new venture, Andreev would invest $10 million and offer Badoo's infrastructure. By agreeing to the deal, Herd effectively handed majority ownership of her future business to World Vision (WV), Andreev's parent organization. WV oversaw Badoo and several smaller dating apps Andreev had also founded. While Herd would be CEO of this new company, Andreev remained in charge of Badoo and the primary steward of WV.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f73bbd13fa8b95aedaf300b/6023e5d4d764abcaa685f536_2.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Business Insider</figcaption></figure><p>‍<br>Perhaps Herd felt it was a fair offer at the time. Maybe she saw Andreev's formidable expertise and thought it was worth giving up 80%&nbsp;of uncreated business, an idea, in truth. Perhaps she hadn't heard of the wild, bacchanalian, chauvinistic culture that defined Badoo, particularly in its early days. </p><p>Whatever calculus Herd made, in hindsight, it looks like a Faustian arrangement, a tempting trade of control and alignment for short-term gain.<br></p><p>Deals with the devil usually follow a predictable pattern: the beguiling offer, the binding pact, the unstoppable ascent, and the inevitable comeuppance. <br></p><p>In the years that followed, Bumble followed that narrative to a tee. With Herd at the helm and Andreev behind-the-scenes, the new dating app took the space by storm. Not only was its bold, buzzy aesthetic a hit with consumers, its focus on empowering women struck a chord. With savvy counter-positioning, Bumble cast itself as the responsible, feminist alternative to the sloppy, hookup-centric Tinder. It rode that wave of enthusiasm to a $1 billion valuation by 2017, less than three years after launch. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Then came the fallout. In 2019, in the same <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelauyeung/2019/07/08/exclusive-investigation-sex-drugs-misogyny-and-sleaze-at-the-hq-of-bumbles-owner/?sh=d002f8863080">blistering exposé</a> that revealed his penchant for custom Prada tees, Forbes alleged that Andreev had created a corrosive, misogynistic culture at Badoo's London headquarters. Company parties were drug-fuelled, occasionally nude, and frequented by sex workers. New engineering builds were named after porn stars; a video circulated of one employee being fellated by a prostitute. This is without mentioning the elaborate corporate structure Andreev had constructed, primarily to avoid taxes. <br></p><p>To be sure, Bumble's base in Austin was a world away, both literally and metaphorically, but it was nevertheless owned by a parent company with a very different moral alignment. It was a bad look, especially for such a brand-driven business. Few revelations elicit more gleeful schadenfreude than the idealistic executive unmasked as a charlatan. (See: WeWork, Theranos.) The potential for nuclear fallout was exacerbated by Andreev's comment that he and Herd spoke up to five times a day — farewell, plausible deniability — and Herd's defense of her co-founder, "He's become my family and one of my best friends." <br></p><p>It seemed as if Herd was entering the inevitable final chapter. The end of most devilish deals sees the (anti) hero condemned for their unholy affiliation, greed receiving its rightful recompense. <br></p><p>But that's not what happened. While many CEOs might have resigned (or been forced to) under the pressure of such a PR disaster, Herd and Bumble weathered the storm. In the aftermath, Herd found an elegant, permanent solution to the threat Andreev's cavalier, undisciplined management posed. In November of 2019, just months after the incendiary Forbes piece, Blackstone acquired a majority stake in Bumble's parent company, pushing out Andreev and installing Herd at the helm. The deal valued the combined businesses of Bumble and Badoo at $3 billion.<br></p><p>Looking at "Bumble Inc." today — the new name for WV, the parent organization that began with Andreev — what's remarkable is how the company has seemingly added another chapter to the traditional arc. Rather than a fall from grace with Beelzebub cackling in the background, Herd, with Blackstone's help, has shepherded the conglomerate toward more natural symbiosis. <br></p><p>All is not solved, of course. <br></p><p>Badoo still feels like Bumble's slightly grimy older brother, and yes, it raises an eyebrow to hear the filing discuss the importance of "building a platform...designed to be safe and empowering for women" when said platform's co-founder concocted the opposite environment. It's reasonable to still wonder: how have Badoo and Bumble stayed together so long? After all that has happened, after all their differences, how have they endured?<br></p><p>Yet, here they are. Just at the point where one would have expected more jitteriness to creep into the relationship — the onset of the seven-year itch — Bumble and Badoo seem stronger than ever. Ironically, the key to this new unity is the same one that has made Bumble what it is today: give power to the woman. With Andreev and Badoo leading the way, this felt like a toxic company lagging behind market trends; with Herd and Bumble at the fore, investing looks a considerably more tempting proposition. (Aside: the greatest trick Bumble's S-1 ever pulled? Convincing us Andreev never existed. He gets 0 …</p></div></div>

    <img src="https://neonmirrors.net/images/2021-02/kubernetes-policy-comparison-opa-gatekeeper-vs-kyverno/featured.png">
    
    <p>With the upcoming <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97171">deprecation and subsequent removal</a> of <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/">Pod Security Policies (PSPs)</a> in Kubernetes, the time is near to find suitable alternatives. Those alternatives, it seems clear at present anyway, will need to be sourced from outside the Kubernetes project itself as there will be no replacement provided. The two leading CNCF projects which are prime candidates for PSP replacement are <a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org/">Open Policy Agent (OPA)</a> via <a href="https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper">Gatekeeper</a> and <a href="https://kyverno.io/">Kyverno</a>, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. But it is confusing and daunting to compare and contrast them given that no comparisons presently exist. Not only are these projects viable replacements for PSPs, they are vastly more capable than simply acting on Pods alone--they are full Kubernetes policy engines. The goal of this article is to provide a neutral and impartial comparison between Gatekeeper and Kyverno so users may make the most informed selection decision for themselves. It will be an evaluation of each project's merits assuming only the Kubernetes angle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because this article is being written with Kubernetes in mind, the OPA/Gatekeeper project will simply be referred to as Gatekeeper henceforth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This comparison article is organized into two main sections bookended by an introduction and closing. The first is an objective comparison, in tabular format, of Gatekeeper and Kyverno focusing on three main categories of attributes and capabilities reflecting, as best as possible, only the facts. The second is my subjective analysis given the earlier comparison and will provide personal opinion and commentary as to use case and recommendations of the ideal user.</p>
<p>I'd like to openly state my own personal bias in the interest of transparency. I am a Kyverno contributor and not a Gatekeeper one. I have authored a few blogs on Kyverno at this point and none on Gatekeeper. I have also been somewhat critical of OPA/Rego in the past. However, my goal here is to put all that plus any personal feelings aside and attempt to approach both projects fresh, with no bias and no preference for one over another.</p>
<p>This article has been written by equally engaging both the Kyverno and Open Policy Agent communities, giving the maintainers and contributors a fair and equal opportunity to comment on the comparison criteria as well as the final results of this article. No preference has been given to either project in terms of engagement or consideration either in regards to the time to comment or the methods in which to engage.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-a-kubernetes-policy">What is a Kubernetes Policy</h3>
<p>While Pod Security Policy in Kubernetes is a set of mechanisms for ensuring validating controls over Pods and their attributes, as the name would imply, it only operates on Pods and nothing else. Further, PSP can only block their creation; it does not perform any remediation thereof. Contrast that with policy engines such as Gatekeeper and Kyverno, and the capabilities are far more broad (i.e., applicable to more than just Pods) and deep (i.e., more than just simple validation). Having a policy engine for Kubernetes can be thought of as a way to more holistically control the Kubernetes environment and not just a single domain.</p>
<h3 id="gatekeeper-introduction">Gatekeeper Introduction</h3>
<p>Gatekeeper is an open-source project and collaboration between a number of companies including Google and Microsoft, later donated to the CNCF. Now in its third iteration, Gatekeeper is the Kubernetes-specific implementation of Open Policy Agent (OPA), a general-purpose policy engine. Because of the relationship between Open Policy Agent with Gatekeeper, the project is often written "OPA/Gatekeeper" to acknowledge these ties. Gatekeeper enables request validation and, most recently, mutation.  A major defining characteristic of Open Policy Agent is its reliance upon the use of a specialized programming language called Rego in order to implement the logic necessary for policy decisions. Through Rego, OPA is designed to be broadly applicable to disparate software and not Kubernetes exclusively, as well as achieve a high level of logic execution.</p>
<h3 id="kyverno-introduction">Kyverno Introduction</h3>
<p>Kyverno is an open-source project originally from Nirmata and later donated to the CNCF. Like Gatekeeper, Kyverno is a Kubernetes policy engine with validation and mutation abilities, however it adds resource generation in addition to, most recently, API object lookups. Unlike Gatekeeper, Kyverno was written from the start solely for use in Kubernetes. A major defining characteristic of Kyverno is its generation ability and the architecture which does not require specialized knowledge of a programming language to render policy decisions. Primarily as a reaction to this requirement of a specialized language, Kyverno differentiates itself from Gatekeeper through its model of simplicity.</p>

<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>Based upon the earlier table of feature comparisons between Gatekeeper and Kyverno, I have put together a concise list of the main advantages and disadvantages of each project. This is not an exhaustive list, only the large topics.</p>
<p><strong>Gatekeeper Advantages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Capable of expressing very complex policy</li>
<li>More establishment in the community</li>
<li>Supports multiple replicas for availability and scale</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gatekeeper Disadvantages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Requiring a programming language is a serious learning curve which generates large amounts of technical debt and increases time to value</li>
<li>Mutation ability is in nascent stage</li>
<li>No generation ability means its usefulness is limited to predominantly validation use cases</li>
<li>Policy is complex, often lengthy, and requires multiple documents to implement</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Kyverno Advantages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dramatic simplicity of policy expression allowing Kubernetes-style composition</li>
<li>Solid mutation abilities</li>
<li>Generation and syncing ability is unique and allows new use cases</li>
<li>Quick time to value and high degree of flexibility</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Kyverno Disadvantages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Highly complex policy generally not possible since no programming language exposed</li>
<li>Young, still largely unproven due to lower establishment</li>
<li>API lookup ability is in nascent stage</li>
<li>Not HA capable presently (road map)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Warning</strong>: The following is my opinionated analysis synthesized of the previous comparison table and advantages/disadvantages list in addition to my own experiences with both tools and time spent in the cloud-native community. If you are not interested in reading my opinion, this is the end of the article for you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kubernetes is a declarative system in which the user's desires are stated and Kubernetes, through its various controllers, goes to work reconciling the observed state in order to bring it into alignment with the desired state. This is the core value proposition of a cloud-native platform. In order to achieve this, the onus of the logic is shifted away from the user and into the platform itself. For each resource type, there exists some internal logic which houses the intelligence needed to remediate its state. With Gatekeeper, by far the largest weakness is its requirement of a purpose-built programming language called Rego, which can be used nowhere else, in order to implement this logic. This is a reality because OPA is a general purpose policy engine. Only through Gatekeeper is its ability harnessed by adapting it into a Kubernetes form factor. Effectively then, the user is responsible for describing the object (policy) they wish reconciled as well as providing the logic necessary (Rego) to reconcile it. Using an external DSL to manage Kubernetes policies can become cumbersome and complex in a number of respects and add technical debt to projects. As a tradeoff, the distinct advantage is that it enables very powerful policies. After all, when one is required to write a programming language, one is only limited by the capabilities of that language and its inputs. This cost can be reduced if OPA can be leveraged elsewhere, however.</p>
<p>Kyverno is seen as a direct reaction to the complex technical demands required by Gatekeeper. Because it was built specifically for Kubernetes and expresses policy declaratively, its mental model is identical to the way Kubernetes objects are described and reconciled. The logic needed to carry out the policy decision is removed from the burden of the user and becomes the domain of the tool itself. This model results in an overwhelming simplification of how policy is written, which in turn makes policy easier in a number of respects. By having mutation and generation abilities, Kyverno is transfigured away from a simple admission …</p></article></div></div></div>

Ruby's standard library has it wrong. Rails has it wrong.</p>
<p>Is it still wrong if everyone is doing it?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The Gang of Four book <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">Design Patterns</a> gives us common vocabulary to understand basic patterns in Object-oriented programming. It helps all of us use the same terms when discussing our software and prevents confusion.</p>
<p>Sadly, this book seems to cause a whole hell of a lot of confusion.</p>
<p>They say "prefer composition over inheritance." That's great, there's good reason for that.</p>
<p>They say to use "delegation." That's great. Although there's not a single example of delegation in their book.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/24897267.jpg" alt="I do not think it means what you think it means"> Delegation is a technique often cited as a way to create flexibility in your programs. That is to say, delegation is often given as the way to composition.</p>
<p>But delegation isn't what you think it is. The Gang of Four have lead you astray.</p>
<p>Worse still, almost every reference you'll find for "delegation" shows you examples of just object collaboration with message forwarding. They are examples of plain old method calls and not delegation.</p>
<p>Now imagine what your mentor would say about understanding basic programming concepts...</p>
<p>Don't have a mentor? That's ok. Imagine that you do. Now imagine what your mentor would say about understanding basic programming concepts...</p>
<p>You should probably understand them correctly, right?</p>
<h2 id="so-what-is-delegation-">So what is Delegation?</h2>
<p>Delegation is easy to understand but we're so used to hearing and reading it in reference to something else. Let's fix that.</p>
<p>Henry Lieberman coined the term "delegation" in <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=960112.28718">Using prototypical objects to implement shared behavior in object-oriented systems</a> released with the OOPLSA '86 Conference proceedings on Object-oriented programming systems, languages and applications. That content is behind a pay wall, but you can read similar and updated content on <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~lieber/Lieberary/OOP/Delegation/Delegation.html">his website</a></p>
<p>In there, you'll find exactly what delegation is, but I'm not sending you away to pore over another long article; I can simplify it for you. When you have time, however, go read Lieberman's own words.</p>
<p>Lieberman discussed this in terms of a GUI drawing tool. Here's the key idea behind delegation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a pen delegates a draw message to a prototypical pen, it is saying "I don't know how to handle the draw message. I'd like you to answer it for me if you can, but if you have any further questions, like what is the value of my x variable, or need anything done, you should come back to me and ask." If the message is delegated further, all questions about the values of variables or requests to reply to messages are all inferred to the object that delegated the message in the first place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, when you send a message to an object, it has a notion of "self" where it can find attributes and other methods. When that object delegates to another, then any reference to "self" <strong>always</strong> refers to the original message recipient. Always.</p>
<h2 id="the-other-inheritance">The other inheritance</h2>
<p>Class-based inheritance isn't the only game in town. Prototype-based inheritance is another way to structure your objects for behavior sharing. One approach sets behaviors in an abstract location (the class) and another sets it on instances (the objects).</p>
<p><a href="http://selflanguage.org/">Self</a> is a programming language which implements what Lieberman defines. Self has objects which contain <em>slots</em>. Each slot can contain a method, or a reference to a prototype object in a <em>parent</em> slot. If an object received a message it didn't understand, it could delegate to an object in its parent slot.</p>
<p>This is prototypical inheritance, not class inheritance. It is similar, although not the same, as saying that an object has a class (like Ruby objects) which contains additional behavior.</p>
<p>Self giving us objects with a parent slot is he equivalent of <a href="http://mozilla.org/js/">JS</a> giving us an object with a <em>prototype</em> reference.</p>
<p>JS is the most popular prototype-based language and is much easier for you to try, so rather than teach you Self, we'll look at JS. You can even open up your browser's console and try this out right now.</p>
<p>In JS we can assign a prototype: the equvalent of the parent slot in Self.</p>
<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">function Container(){};
Container.prototype = new Object();
Container.prototype.announce = function(){ alert("these are my things: " + this.things) };

function Bucket(things){this.things = things};
Bucket.prototype = new Container();

bucket = new Bucket("planes, trains, and automobiles")
bucket.announce() // alerts "these are my things: planes, trains, and automobiles"</code></pre>

<p>In delegation parlance the <code>bucket</code> object is the <em>client</em> which forwards a message to the <em>delegate</em>. </p>
<p>In the above example, you can see that the evaluation of <code>this.things</code> was done in the context of the client object. When we called the <code>announce</code> function, it was found on the delegate object. When the function was evaluated, <code>this</code> refered to the client.</p>
<p>When a JS object's prototype contains a functon, the function is evaluated as if the object has that method. The first example showed that <code>this</code> (which is just <code>self</code> in JS) always referred to the original message recipient.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-ruby-">What about Ruby?</h2>
<p>First, understand forwarding. Forwarding is passing a message from one object to another. The Ruby standard library <code>forwardable</code> is aptly named and allows you to forward messages from one object to another.</p>
<p>Now, let's take the poorly named <code>delegate</code> library from the Ruby standard library which also allows you to forward messages from one object to another.</p>
<pre data-preserve-html-node="true">require 'delegate'

# assuming we have a Person class with a name method
person = Person.new(:name =&gt; 'Jim')

class Greeter &lt; SimpleDelegator
  def hello
    "Hi! I'm #{name}."
  end
end

greeter = Greeter.new(person)

greeter.hello #=&gt; "Hi! I'm Jim."
</pre>

<p>What happens inside that <code>Greeter</code> is that when the <code>greeter</code> instance is initialized it contains a reference to the <code>person</code>. When an unknown method is called, it is <em>forwarded</em> to the target object (which is <code>person</code>). Remember, we're still looking at the <code>delegate</code> library, which helps us forward messages... Confused? Yeah, I was too. So, it seems, is the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Forwarding is just the passing of a message to an object: a method call.</p>
<p>The difference between this and <strong>delegation</strong> is that these libraries allow you to easily forward messages to additional objects, rather than executing the method of another object in the context of the first like we saw with prototype-based inheritance in JS.</p>
<p>We are often barely aware of this because Ruby's <code>method_missing</code> power does the trick in <code>SimpleDelegator</code>. We think about methods automagically going to the object we want. </p>
<p>Even though our <code>Greeter</code> method refers to <code>self</code>, the message is forwarded to the other object and handled there when, of course, the method is missing on the client.</p>
<p>If we want to share behavior without extending an object with additional methods, then <code>method_missing</code> and/or <code>SimpleDelegator</code> can do the trick nicely. This works well for simple uses. It does, however, break references to an object's class. </p>
<p>Suppose, for example, we want to reference the client object's class with some new kind of greeting. And instead of the normal greeting, let's make it say "Hi! I'm the esteemed Person, Jim." </p>
<p>We don't want to completely rewrite the method, so we'll rely on <code>super</code> to get whatever is implemented in the regular <code>Greeter</code>.</p>
<pre data-preserve-html-node="true">class ProperGreeter &lt; Greeter
  def name
    "the esteemed " + self.class.name + ", " + super
  end
end

proper_greeter = ProperGreeter.new(person)

proper_greeter.hello #=&gt; "Hi! I'm the esteemed ProperGreeter, Jim."
</pre>

<p>Hmmm. That's not what we expected. What we wanted to see was "the esteemed Person". </p>
<p>This is a simple illustration of the fact that we have <strong>two</strong> objects and is an example of <strong>self-schizophrenia</strong> in Object-oriented design. Each object has its own identity and notion of <code>self</code>. We can fix that by changing the reference to use <code>__getobj__</code> (the way SimpleDelegator expects) instead of <code>self</code>, but this is an illustration of how <code>self</code> does not refer to what we want. We must explicitly work with two objects and our mental model <strong>always</strong> requires that we think about two objects interacting when we only really care about altering the behavior of one.</p>
<p>This is not delegation. This is always two objects collaborating. Despite the numerous books, articles, and software libraries telling you otherwise. The Gang of Four got Delegation wrong, but that's OK because now you know better.</p>
<h2 id="whatever-i-ll-call-it-what-i-want">Whatever, I'll call it what I want</h2>
<p><em>Who cares. Let's not rock the boat. Everyone is doing it.</em></p>
<p>Yeah, Design Patterns showed examples in C++. And C++ can't do delegation. So is that a valid argument for rewriting the meaning of a term?</p>
<p>If the language you use can't provide it, don't just call what the language <em>can</em> do "delegation."</p>
<h2 id="get-the-concepts-right">Get the concepts right</h2>
<p>Developing an application requires that you understand not only your business domain concepts, but also understand many tools and approaches to your design. Software design patterns are common ways to solve common problems. Understanding what they are and when to use them is a key part of being an efficient developer.</p>
<p>The Design Patterns book is often lauded for giving names to commonly used software design patterns. This helps all of us use the same terms when discussing our software and prevents confusion.</p>
<p>Of course, as I began research for <a href="http://clean-ruby.com/">Clean Ruby</a> I picked up the Design Patterns book for some clarity. "Surely this book will help guide the discussion and understanding of how to approach different patterns," I thought. Sadly, it contains a glaring mistake that has been repeated and codified in numerous books, articles, and software libraries. Again and again I've read the same description of a behavior sharing and object composition pattern in software that is almost always given the wrong name.</p>
<p>The Design Patterns book is great for having pushed the idea of "composition over inheritance." In fact, so many …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></main></div></div>

is that we’re tool builders. I read a study that measured the efficiency of
locomotion for various species on the planet. The condor used the least
energy to move a kilometer. Humans came in with a rather unimpressive
showing about a third of the way down the list. It was not too proud a
showing for the crown of creation. So, that didn’t look so good.</p><p>But then, somebody at Scientific American had the insight to test the
efficiency of locomotion for a man on a bicycle. And, a man on a bicycle, a
human on a bicycle, blew the condor away, completely off the top of the
charts.</p><p>And that’s what a computer is to me. What a computer is to me is it’s the
most remarkable tool that we’ve ever come up with.</p><p>It’s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.</p><p>— <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lvMgMrNDlg&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=322">Steve Jobs (1980)</a></p></blockquote><p>* * *</p><p><a href="https://www.it-hiroshima.ac.jp/institution/library/pdf/research52%5F007-013.pdf">No one knows</a> when or how we, the human species, started talking to each
other. It is likely a natural progression from gesturing, but we can only
speculate about it.</p><p>Language allowed us to break out of our brains and reveal the inner
workings of our consciousness to others.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/language_speech.jpg" alt="Figure 2: Scott H. Young"><figcaption><p>Figure 2: <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2018/12/04/25-thinking-tools/">Scott H. Young</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>Language is the vessel that carried us from the stone age through the
agricultural revolution, the development of written language, the
scientific and industrial revolutions, and now, the digital age.</p><p>Writing allowed us to <em>offload</em> memories to the physical world—outside of
our brains. Through our collective and external memories, each generation
has a head start on the previous one. Little by little, standing on the
shoulders of taller and taller giants, we accumulate knowledge about
ourselves and everything around us.</p><p>We’ve been for long using tools to help us think: notebooks help us
calculate formulas, reason geometrically and preserve our ideas. With
computers, our <em>thinking</em> is now occurring outside of our brains.</p><p>Computers are extensions of our minds in that they allow us to store,
process, and retrieve information from them. With the advent of the
internet we now have immediate access to not only almost all of the
information ever produced by humankind but also to reproducible <em>thinking</em>
encoded into these machines: algorithms.</p><p>Our brain is still a much more impressive device than any of today's
computers. Computers learn
<a href="https://www.davidsilver.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/nfsp-1.pdf">mostly</a>
by finding patterns in massive
quantities of examples given by us. Teaching a young kid about cars—how
to recognize one, what they are, what their purpose is, and how they're
related to other things—requires little supervision. Noam Chomsky talks
about it in
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdUbIlwHRkY&amp;t=1462">this interview</a>.</p><p>Each of these processes—storing, processing and retrieving
information—have concrete effects on the physical world: if I’m in
Munich, saying “show route to Hamburg” to my phone will immediately show me
the distance, ETAs and paths for different types of transport to reach my
destination. Not only do I now suddenly know how to navigate across the
country to reach another city, I’m also able to follow through the exact
path via GPS—a sixth sense giving me perfect geolocation!</p><p>These <em>things</em> that we created—computers, and the internet—are literally
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6502424/">rewiring our brains</a>, right now, shaping how we think, and engage in social
relationships, changing not only our individual selves but the societies we
live in.</p><p>They started as mechanical machines that filled entire laboratories, turned
into beige boxes in our homes and places of work, and are now sleek slabs
of plastic, metal and glass in everyone’s pockets. Step by step they get
closer to our bodies, their interfaces more intuitive and natural.</p><p>The way we communicate with them is changing: before, we could only
interact with them by speaking their language. We have now taught them
ours. The torch of progress blazes on: it’s a matter of <em>time</em> until they’re
connected directly with our brains—which is equally terrifying and
awe-inspiring.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/neuralink.jpg" alt="Figure 3: Neuralink"><figcaption><p>Figure 3: <a href="https://neuralink.com/">Neuralink</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>Brain-computer interfaces present a monumental scientific and engineering
challenge, and brain-to-brain, a whole other category of difficulty.</p><p>First, we have no idea how information is encoded in the brain. That needs
to be understood. Second, even assuming we’re able to take a perfect
snapshot of a piece of information in someone’s brain—for example, how a
particular movie scene makes them feel—we still need to be able to encode
it in a way that includes the full context of their subjective experiences.
Maybe the scene evokes unique memories of their childhood or is somehow
entangled with the smell of a particular cinema’s leather seats. Third, we
need to figure out how to safely write this perfect snapshot into someone
else’s brain in a way that can be perceived identically.</p><p>Which is to say, it’s a difficult problem. But a worthwhile one: imagine
having the capability to suddenly become aware of answers for questions you
just thought about. To expertly control <a href="https://youtu.be/PLk8Pm%5FXBJE?t=13">truly integrated</a> prosthetics giving
you superhuman abilities. To give movement to the paralized, sound to the
deaf, and sight to the blind.</p><p>What would be the impacts on society if we were able to communicate an
order of magnitude more effectively? What if <em>everyone</em> was equipped with
the same undisputed basic knowledge of history and science?</p><p>There are internal thoughts that we can attempt to describe with a thousand
words, but ultimately fail to capture in a way that’s precise, much less
comprehensible by someone else. Words and sentences are an incomplete
representation of our internal thoughts. In the same way that 3D objects
cast 2D shadows (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0WjV6MmCyM">and 4D, 3D</a>) communicating through language doesn’t carry
all of our cultural and developmental context—transmitting all of that
along with every phrase would be impractical. Language is in this sense,
lossily compressed thought.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/tesseract_shadow.jpg"></figure><p>Inert strings of words of ink and paper take a life of their own inside our
heads. It’s why the exact same information can be interpreted completely
differently by different people.</p><p>Before language, fire and cooking technology allowed us to reallocate
energy usage from the digestive system to the brain by outsourcing
digestion to outside of our bodies, making macronutrients more efficiently
absorbable. Almost all of a cooked meal is metabolized by the body, whereas
raw foods yield less than half of their nutrients.</p><p>Cooking is an extension of our digestive system, and enabled us to develop
large, calorie-hungry brains. It also gave us time to think: our primate
cousins spend half of their days chewing raw food to consume enough
calories to stay alive.</p><p>Brains can be seen as <em>survival machines</em>, locked inside dark skulls,
constantly building a model of the outside world by predicting and learning
through senses and memory. The biological human brain evolved to have the
necessary sophistication to not only expertly navigate and understand the
brute physical reality but also to construct <em>social</em> reality. Democracy,
religion, money: all made up by us, for us.</p><p>We remember the past so that we can predict the future, and by doing so, we
thrive.</p><p>We create technology, which functions as a non-biological extra layer to
our brains and bodies, augmenting, complementing, and sometimes replacing
our natural capabilities.</p><blockquote><p>The wheel… is an extension of the foot.</p><p>The book… is an extension of the eye…</p><p>Clothing, an extension of the skin…</p><p>Electric circuitry, an extension of the central nervous system.</p><p>—
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding_Media">Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man (1964)</a></p></blockquote><p>Relatively speaking, we are done evolving <em>biologically</em>. Further adaptations
and enhancements to our bodies and minds will come through technology.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/brain_layers.jpg" alt="Figure 5: Check out &amp;ldquo;Neuralink and the Brain&amp;rsquo;s Magical Future&amp;rdquo; for a very entertaining primer on the brain."><figcaption><p>Figure 5: Check out “<a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html">Neuralink and the Brain’s Magical Future</a>” for a very entertaining primer on the brain.</p></figcaption></figure><p>To be human is to have the ability to change the world around us. The shift
from hunting and gathering to farming allowed us to spend less energy to
acquire food while giving us a predictable calorie supply.</p><p>The resulting food surplus made it possible for populations to settle down
and grow quickly while supporting people not being directly involved in the
production of food—before agriculture that was everyone’s job. For one,
it allowed some to specialize and focus on developing better farming tools
and more resistant crops, starting a vicious cycle of improvement and
consumption that continues until today.</p><p>The transition from active foraging to a more sedentary lifestyle resulted
in worse health for the general population. The average farmer worked
harder than the average forager and got a worse diet in return. Our teeth,
bones and joints became more fragile, and we became afflicted by novel
diseases coming from newly domesticated animals, carriers of pathogens that
incubated in our new densely populated cities.</p><p>Owning land suddenly became really important. Agriculture and the concept
of private property reinforced each other and grew together, allowing us to
create value and secure the fruits of our labor. It also created the
circumstances for slavery to arise, and wars to be waged.</p><p>The groups of people growing the first crops could not have anticipated all
of the collateral effects of their breakthrough. They just wanted more
food.</p><p>If the past has taught us anything is that we have to be mindful of the
consequences of our progress. In an increasingly connected world, change is
often <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/05/linear-thinking-in-a-nonlinear-world">nonlinear</a> and unpredictable. Cars didn’t just replace horses—they
forever changed the entire outlook of every city. Did Tim Berners-Lee
anticipate his invention adding to forces pulling whole countries apart?</p><p>Our progress will continue to bring us previously unimaginable challenges.
Against an unknowable future, it doesn’t hurt to keep improving our
capabilities to adapt and, more difficultly, to cooperate—especially at
scale.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/humanity.jpg" alt="Figure 6: &amp;ldquo;Humanity&amp;rdquo; by Pawel Kuczynski"><figcaption><p>Figure 6: “<a href="https://www.pictorem.com/24592/humanity.html">Humanity</a>” by Pawel Kuczynski</p></figcaption></figure><p>Computers are getting pretty good at driving cars—even in the most

              <h3>READ</h3>
              <p>Q: Do I need to know electronics? What skills are required for
                assembly? Can anyone build it?</p>
              <p> A: This was designed to be an easy-build kit. No soldering is
                required, nor glue, nor cutting. One should be able to put it
                together in a short afternoon with a screwdriver or two,
                tweezers, and a careful hand.</p>
              <p>Q: What comes with the kit?</p>
              <p>A: Everything you need to make a complete, working phone. Just
                supply a SIM card from your cell carrier.</p>
              <p>Q: Will a ready-built version be available in the future?</p>
              <p>A: Possibly. There are bureaucratic reasons that this is not
                straight-forward (i.e. FCC licensing). Besides, selling a
                ready-to-use cellphone would warrant a level of customer support
                which I'm not currently able to provide.</p>
              <p>Q: What size SIM card does it take?</p>
              <p>A: The standard/full-size one.</p>
              <p>Q: Who designed this?</p>
              <p>A: All design -- electrical, mechanical, and software -- was
                entirely by Justine Haupt (Sky's Edge is my creative outlet).</p>
              <p>Q: Can I order specific parts (not the whole kit), and make the
                rest myself? </p>
              <p>A: Sure! Or, if you love doing things from scratch, you can use
                the design files to make the entire thing on your own. It's open
                source.</p>
              <p>Q: What's the chipset? </p>
              <p>A: The microcontroller is an AtMega2560 running an Arduino
                bootloader. The cellular module is a uBlox TOBY-L2. The specific
                model depend on region.</p>
              <p>Q: In what ways is it a more functional telephone than a
                smartphone?</p>
              A:
              <ul>
                <li>Better reception because the antennas aren't packed against
                  the electronics. </li>
                <li>You don't have to navigate an operating system to get to the
                  phone "application". </li>
                <li>You can assign two buttons to be hard-coded for quick
                  dialing your favorite people. Your spouse, parent, or child
                  can be a single button-press away.</li>
                <li>The point of the phone isn't to use the rotary dial every
                  time you call someone, which would get tiresome fast. You can
                  store your contacts list and then dial up your friends with
                  just two spins of the dial. When the less frequent need to
                  dial a new number arises, the novelty of the satisfying-to-use
                  rotary dial is fun rather than annoying.</li>
                <li>Previously, phones with physical keys required a clamshell
                  (flip) form-factor to prevent unintended dialing. Rotary dials
                  are naturally resistant to butt dialing.</li>
                <li>Nearly instantaneous 10-segment display of signal strength
                  or battery level. Compare to typical 4-bar signal meters.</li>
                <li>The rear ePaper display (for displaying contacts) is
                  bistatic, meaning it doesn't take any energy to display a
                  fixed message.</li>
                <li>The power switch is an actual slide switch. No holding down
                  a stupid button to make it turn off and not being sure it
                  really is turning off or what.</li>
                <li>Physical cut-off switch for the microphone. Thank you Edward
                  Snowden.</li>
              </ul>

<p>In 2020 Laurent Bercot, the developer of the <a href="https://www.skarnet.org/software/s6-linux-init/">s6 init tools</a>, was contacted by a recruiter at Google. He wrote an answer which he made public. That answer deserves to be spread far and wide. I present the answer here as a direct copy from the original.</p>

<p>Source: <a href="https://skarnet.org/text/google.html">https://skarnet.org/text/google.html</a></p>

<p>
 Hi XXXXX,
</p>

<p>
 Thanks for reaching out. I am safe and healthy, and I hope the current
situation finds you safe as well. The timing is not insensitive at all,
I am lucky to be working in an industry that is not significantly
impacted by the sanitary crisis, because in most cases it is possible
for us tech people to work from home, and we have teleconference
software, Google Meet being one of the popular ones. :)
</p>

<p>
 You are asking me if I would be interested in chatting about options
for joining Google again, either in your growing Warsaw site or in
other Google locations.
</p>

<p>
 Since I left Google in 2014, I have undergone quite a bit of growth,
certainly in technical skills, but also in the way that I see and
understand the world, and how I can strive to make it better, and how
technology can make it better, and how powerful tech companies such as
Google can have an impact and use their power for good.
</p>

<p>
 As a result, I would certainly be interested in helping Google make
the world better. But I am not sure that what I have in mind is in line
with what Google has in mind. If I were to work for Google again, in
any capacity, I would first need the assurance that I am working in the
right direction, and that my work will actually bring positive change.
And so far, the direction that Google has taken in recent years does
not give me that assurance. Let me guide you through a few examples.
</p>

<ul>
 <li> I am a big proponent of diversity and inclusion in the workspace.
There was a time where Google was a major voice for progress in this
domain, and my SRE team in Dublin in 2013-2014 was pretty diverse and
inclusive (at least, if you consider that 0 women out of 9 people is
diverse enough). However, this claim for support for inclusion seems
to be changing: <br>
<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/current-ex-employees-allege-google-drastically-rolled-back-diversity-inclusion-n1206181">
https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/current-ex-employees-allege-google-drastically-rolled-back-diversity-inclusion-n1206181</a><br>
Why has Google rolled back the Sojourn project and cut back other
diversity initiatives? I've heard that it was due to the programs not
scaling, but why does scalability matter more than maintaining programs
that work? Isn't doing good at a small scale better than doing nothing
at a large scale? </li> 

 <li> If you know anything about me, you know that I am extremely
sensitive to user privacy issues. When I joined the Web SRE team in
2013, I was pleased to see the lengths that Google would go to in
order to strip personally identifiable information from the access logs
of the Google servers. But these last few years, the efforts have seemed
to diminish. For instance, this is what happened a few days ago: <br>
<a href="https://forbes.com/sites/barrycollins/2020/05/15/google-home-hub-shows-random--nest-cam-footage-on-familys-device">
https://forbes.com/sites/barrycollins/2020/05/15/google-home-hub-shows-random--nest-cam-footage-on-familys-device/</a><br>
Back in 2013, with the architecture that Google was using, leaking some
user's data to another user was simply inconceivable. I shiver to
think of the changes, not only at the tech level, but also at the policy
level, that have had to occur in order for such an accident to be
possible. </li>

 <li> In the same vein, in 2016, Google's commitment to user privacy with
respect to online advertising was silently dropped: <br>
<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/google-has-quietly-dropped-ban-on-personally-identifiable-web-tracking">
https://www.propublica.org/article/google-has-quietly-dropped-ban-on-personally-identifiable-web-tracking</a><br>
So, the very policy that was the pride and joy of every privacy-conscious
Google worker, the thing that made Google different from Facebook and
other mega tech corporations, not only was dropped, but was dropped
<em>silently</em>. Such a decision seems too important to be kept quiet; it is
a significant change. Could this be that Google did something they
<em>knew</em> was wrong? If both the commitment to user privacy and the
commitment to transparency were abandoned, what makes Google different
from Facebook today? </li>

 <li> Another recent example that shows Google is not the privacy-conscious
company it once was: <br>
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-13/google-faces-eu-privacy-complaint-for-tracking-users">
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-13/google-faces-eu-privacy-complaint-for-tracking-users</a><br>
Privacy is not only important to me, it is also important to the
EU jurisdictions. What assurance could I get that my work would not be
used for illegal purposes? </li>

 <li> A lot has been written about YouTube in these recent years, and in
particular its recommendation algorithm. YouTube has the manpower to
tweak its recommendation algorithm, as it has shown recently by
deprioritizing independent content in favor of "authoritative sources",
i.e. corporate sources. Still, back when it was crucial and could
impact the world for the better in a very real, very significant way,
YouTube refused to tweak the levers. For instance, this is what
happened: <br>
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/11/world/americas/youtube-brazil.html">
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/11/world/americas/youtube-brazil.html</a><br>
At the time, YouTube (and more generally, Google) spokespeople said
that they did not want to be censors, they did not want to have a hand
in what content was favored and what content was not. A principled
stance, which can be argued against but which can also be argued for,
and principles are generally a good thing. However, these principles
did not seem to hold any water, because YouTube is now happily tweaking
its algorithm, not to silence anti-science voices, but to silence
dissident voices in an increasingly authoritarian world. What happened,
and why is it looking so bad? </li>

 <li> Climate change is real. It is important that everyone understands
this. Yet, last year, Google sponsored a conference hosting climate
change denialists: <br>
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/23/18194432/facebook-google-microsoft-libertycon-climate-change">
https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/23/18194432/facebook-google-microsoft-libertycon-climate-change</a><br>
I can certainly think of other, better ways of using Google money to
make a positive change in the world. If I can, why can't the decision
makers at the top levels of Google? </li>

 <li> An important way for rich people, and rich companies, to be a part
of the collective effort to make the world a more just, more equitable
place, is to pay their fair share of taxes. Unfortunately, it seems
that Google does not do that, either: <br>
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/may/16/google-told-by-mp-you-do-do-evil">
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/may/16/google-told-by-mp-you-do-do-evil</a><br>
As per the article, it was <em>already</em> not doing that when I was hired in
2013. At the time there was a widely publicized claim among Googlers
that once you were hired, you could have access to <em>any</em> information
about the workings of Google. I did inquire a bit about the financing
models and the revenue flow, and I find it curious that I never heard
anything about tax avoidance. It may be that the clamored openness was
not as thorough as everyone pretended to believe it was. </li>
</ul>

 <p>
 All those items are pretty damning, if we are looking at how Google
impacts the world at large. But you could still have a chance at
appealing to the nerd in me, the person who loves technology and who
wants to make cool things. Because at least at Google we make
good tech, right? Well, about that...<br>
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/when-it-comes-to-gorillas-google-photos-remains-blind/">
https://www.wired.com/story/when-it-comes-to-gorillas-google-photos-remains-blind/</a><br>
How is it possible to be so short-sighted with regards to testing
software as to fail to include black people in the Photos AI training
set, with such an embarrassing result? How can I pretend to be one of
the top engineers in the world if I'm working at a company that makes
this kind of rookie mistake?
</p>

<p>
 Oh, and wouldn't an initiative such as the Sojourn project, the one
that was abandoned, have precisely prevented that fiasco, by making
sure that an appropriately diverse sample of subjects would be
submitted to the training set?
</p>

<p>
 And it is far from the only example. There are other fundamental,
elementary mistakes, some of which are much more related to my skill set and
that I am much more qualified to talk about in detail, but since I am
a systems engineer, these are not the things that get much publicity
and are widely available on the Web. I will still give the following
example:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2137r0.html#platforms">
http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2137r0.html#platforms</a><br>
This proposal, for the next standard of C++, which is a general-purpose
programming language, lists hardware architectures, OS platforms,
and environments that should be prioritized. <br>
From a technical point of view, this is absolute nonsense. It is not
the place of a programming language to prioritize hardware architectures
or OS platforms. It is the job of a compiler for this language to
implement the specification for various platforms and the implementation
may be more or less optimized depending on the backend, but the language
itself should be entirely agnostic. <br>
And even if you accept the premise that it makes sense to define a list
of priorities, let's take a look: none of the various BSD operating
systems have made the list, despite having significant, vibrant
communities and a long history of working, but Fuchsia, Google's own,
not-ready-yet operating system, has. Hmmm. Also, there is a curious
insistence on prioritizing little-endian hardware, which would be
detrimental to a certain number of embedded systems and other platforms,
but it so happens that Google uses none of them.
</p>

<p>
 And it just so happens that out of the 17 authors of that document,
8 of them are working at Google.

<p>
 So even in my narrow, restricted field, what I witness of Google's
influence in the world is an attempt to infiltrate and subvert
communities and standards committees, in order to influence them
towards goals that directly benefit Google, and without any care or
consideration for the rest of the community, or for the actual technical
quality of the results.

<p>
 So, after this long development, let me sum this up by saying that I
would be extremely glad to be offered a position at Google, if it was
in the executive committee, if I had direct control over a product that
I could actually make <em>good</em>, as in, …</p></article></div>

Popular air purifier brands are making a lot of promises about what they can do to keep your home safe, but a CBC <em>Marketplace</em> investigation found that a homemade DIY purifier can actually outperform some of the most well-known brands on the market.</p>  <p>There are plenty of claims for consumers to wade through: "the only air purifier, heater&nbsp;and fan to clean a whole room properly;" "UV-C light killing germs;" and "true HEPA filter" are just some of the promises <em>Marketplace </em>investigated.</p>  <p>University of Toronto engineering professor Jeffrey Siegel, a leading expert on ventilation, filtration and indoor air quality, calls it "a marketing jungle."</p>  <p>Working with Siegel and his team, <em>Marketplace</em> put five popular brands to the test: the Levoit LV-H132, GermGuardian AC5350B, Dyson Pure Hot + Cool, BlueAir Blue Pure 211+ and the Honeywell HPA 160, as well as a DIY box fan with an added filter.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Air purifier sales in Canada jumped nine per cent in 2020 compared to pre-pandemic 2019, totalling $136 million, according to statistics from market research firm Euromonitor.</p>  <h2>Clearing out COVID-19</h2>  <p>Siegel said a good air purifier can also help clear out coronavirus particles and reduce the air's viral load.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5900805.1612454054!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_300/jeffrey-siegel.jpeg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5900805.1612454054!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_460/jeffrey-siegel.jpeg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5900805.1612454054!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_620/jeffrey-siegel.jpeg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5900805.1612454054!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_780/jeffrey-siegel.jpeg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5900805.1612454054!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/jeffrey-siegel.jpeg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5900805.1612454054!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_780/jeffrey-siegel.jpeg"></p></div><figcaption>Jeffrey Siegel is a professor of civil engineering at the University of Toronto who has been studying indoor air quality for over 20 years.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Anu Singh/CBC)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>But air purifiers need to be efficient and sized appropriately for the space they are in. Air flow is also key. However Siegel warns all of those things are not enough on their own to protect your family from COVID-19. You still need masks, hand-washing and physical distancing to keep the virus at bay.</p>  <p>A HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filter is a key part of the equation, too. Viruses such as the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 often attach themselves to dust or droplets, and a good air purifier with a HEPA filter can help capture them.</p>  <p>All <a href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/what-hepa-filter-1"><u>HEPA filters</u></a> are supposed to remove at least 99.97 per cent of dust, pollen, mold, bacteria and airborne particles. All of the models we tested use pleated HEPA filters.</p>  <p><em>Marketplace</em> purchased 15 devices in total — three of the same models for each of the five brands used in our tests. Using incense smoke in 24.0 m³ chamber, Siegel and his team <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/marketplace/how-clean-is-the-air-in-your-home-1.5900697">tested each device to see how much air-cleaning power it delivers</a> — what's known as the Clean Air Delivery Rate&nbsp;(CADR).</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH | Marketplace test reveals the most effective air purifier:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="Why more expensive air purifiers aren't always the best" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1854941251682-metadata-" title="Why more expensive air purifiers aren't always the best"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/562/851/WEB_CleanAir.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>An $800 Dyson air purifier we tested doesn’t clean your air as well as some less-expensive products. Here’s what we found.<!-- --> <!-- -->3:09</span></span></span></p>  <p>The CADR measures how long an air-purifying device takes to remove pollen, smoke and dust; different CADR numbers correspond to each one. The benchmark allows consumers to compare the effectiveness of portable air purifiers. You'll find the CADR listed in either cubic feet per minute (cfm), or, in Canada, in cubic metres per hour (m3/hour).&nbsp;</p>  <p>Siegel recommends looking for a CADR rating for smoke of about 200-300 m3/hour (118-176 cfm) for cleaning small to medium-sized rooms. The smoke CADR is generally the lowest and most conservative number, said Siegel.&nbsp;</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH&nbsp;|&nbsp;Here's how our test worked:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="This is how the University of Toronto tested air purifiers for Marketplace's test" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1854855747661-metadata-" title="This is how the University of Toronto tested air purifiers for Marketplace's test"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/481/295/mp_amy_embedded_xcode_mix_320_frame_856.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>University of Toronto PhD student Amy Li explains how the lab calculates the clean air delivery rate.<!-- --> <!-- -->0:33</span></span></span></p>  <p>Siegel also threw another set of air purifiers into the mix — a do-it-yourself version that consists of a box fan and a filter, taped together with painter's tape. The filter he used was not a HEPA, but a MERV-11 filter, which is cheaper and easier to find. All of the materials were purchased at a hardware store for about $70.&nbsp;</p>  <h2>Results</h2>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902727.1612545406!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_300/air-purifiers-graph.png 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902727.1612545406!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_460/air-purifiers-graph.png 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902727.1612545406!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_620/air-purifiers-graph.png 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902727.1612545406!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_780/air-purifiers-graph.png 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902727.1612545406!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_1180/air-purifiers-graph.png 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902727.1612545406!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_780/air-purifiers-graph.png"></p></div></figure></span></p>  <p>The BlueAir Blue Pure 211+, priced at about $400, performed the best in our tests, with an average CADR of approximately 560 m3/hour.</p>  <p>The poorest performer was also the cheapest product — the $150 Levoit LV-H132, with an average CADR of approximately 60 m3/hour.</p>  <p>In its response to <em>Marketplace</em>, Levoit said this model is reviewed and rated positively by customers and is one of Canada's top-selling products; <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/marketplace/how-clean-is-the-air-in-your-home-1.5900697">it also noted that this is a desktop model</a> specifically designed for smaller spaces.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5900843.1612454977!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_300/dyson-pure-hot-cool-vs-box-fan.png 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5900843.1612454977!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_460/dyson-pure-hot-cool-vs-box-fan.png 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5900843.1612454977!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_620/dyson-pure-hot-cool-vs-box-fan.png 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5900843.1612454977!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_780/dyson-pure-hot-cool-vs-box-fan.png 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5900843.1612454977!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_1180/dyson-pure-hot-cool-vs-box-fan.png 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5900843.1612454977!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_780/dyson-pure-hot-cool-vs-box-fan.png"></p></div><figcaption>The Dyson Pure Hot + Cool is the most expensive purifier Marketplace tested, but it fared worse than a DIY box fan and filter in tests. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Chahat Desai/CBC)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>While a poorly performing cheaper model might fall into the category of "you get what you pay for," our $70 DIY box fan and filter outperformed the Levoit by a large margin, averaging just under 200 m3/hour in our tests.</p>  <p>It also outperformed the $800 Dyson Pure Hot+Cool.&nbsp;</p>  <p>At the pricier end of the scale, the Dyson Pure Hot+Cool did not perform as well as some of the less-expensive products.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The Dysons we tested averaged a CADR of about 140 m3/hour, lower than most of the other air purifiers we tested, and well below the approximately 200 m3/hr Siegel recommends for cleaning small to medium-sized rooms.</p>  <p>Dyson air purifiers consistently test lower than other air purifiers; Consumer Reports tested the&nbsp;Dyson TP04 Pure Cool Air Purifier and found it <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/products/air-purifiers-29549/room-air-purifier-29550/dyson-tp04-pure-cool-397877/#brands%3A158039%3B"><u>"one of the worst-rated air purifiers in CR's [CADR] tests, despite being one of the most expensive."</u></a>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The Dyson Pure Hot+Cool HP04 also has a heater.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
        <p>There've been a few instances recently where some luminary has espoused the value of working long hours, and has been roundly criticised for it.<sup id="fnref-luminary"><a href="#fn-luminary">1</a></sup> I think this issue embodies two interesting tensions, and in those two tensions are two knots of recursive thought that I've had little luck untangling.</p>
<h2>Precision advice and collateral damage</h2>
<p>Reflecting on the advice that's most frequently given these days, I notice that often the advice is typically good advice for some part of the audience, and bad advice for another.</p>
<p>It's sometimes remarked that <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/11/26/is-science-slowing-down-2/">progress in medicine is slowing down</a>. One explanation is that if you have a drug that works well, it's easy to notice it works well, and so it gets discovered early! A hundred years into modern medicine, the only drugs left to discover are the ones that offer marginal benefits.</p>
<p>One hoped-for fix for this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_medicine">precision medicine</a>. Maybe, precision medicine says, maybe there are lots of drugs left to discover that work very well on some people, but have no effect - or even harm! - other people. Then if you've been testing your drugs by giving them to a random sample of the population, maybe you haven't noticed their efficacy on some people because you were discouraged by some other people falling over dead.</p>
<p>I think advice is like medicine, and I think modern advice is akin to precision medicine.</p>
<p>In an age where information flows as easily as this one, all the advice that's useful to everyone - all the <em>general advice</em> - has been widely implemented. Most everyone looks both ways when crossing the street, most everyone has installed electricity in their home, and most everyone uses iodized salt and wraps up warm in winter.</p>
<p>'Work long hours' however is <em>precision advice</em>. There is some part of the audience with whom it'll resonate, whom it'll drive to accomplish more and live a more fulfilling life for those accomplishments. And there is part of the audience who will come away injured, having been driven to ignore their families and friends for little gain.</p>
<p>Symmetrically, 'don't work long hours' might be succor to part of your audience while simultaneously robbing another part of their potential.</p>
<p>So what advice should you offer, when you know any advice you offer will help one person but harm another? I am paralyzed here by recursion: even the mildest 'you should reflect on these issues and take a considered approach' is harmful to the person out there that has sole possession of the Last Piece of General Advice, and is discouraged by this argument into not sharing it.</p>
<p>I will note that all these considerations are just as important when <em>receiving</em> advice as giving it. Much as it pains me to say: when receiving advice, you should reflect on these issues and take a considered approach. Maybe that advice is your medicine; maybe it's your poison.</p>
<h2>Bright lines and balancing tests</h2>
<p>Can it ever make sense to deploy precision advice to the general population? These sorts of things are long discussed in law, in terms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bright-line_rule">bright lines and balancing tests</a>. There, coarse examples might be,</p>
<ul>
<li>Bright line test: if you steal, you <em>will</em> go to jail.</li>
<li>Balancing test: if you steal <em>and you don't have a good reason for it</em>, you will go to jail.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bright lines are easy to communicate, easy to apply, and in being intransigent they more heavily discourage the behaviour in question. Bright lines also run roughshod over nuance, and tend to carry <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Code">more unintended side-effects</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile balancing tests allow for nuance and consideration, but are harder to apply, prone to slippery-slopes, and allow the adjudicator more space in which to inflict their whims on the subject.</p>
<p>How does this relate to 'work long hours'? Because while I've made a pitch above for it being precision advice, there's arguably value in deploying it as a general cure-all, as a bright line. Symmetrically, there's arguably value in deploying the precision advice of 'don't work long hours' as a bright line too. In both cases, nuance is lost in favour of ease of communication and ease of application.</p>
<p>Here we hit on the second bit of recursion however, because to say 'bright lines versus balancing tests is nuanced topic requiring balancing tests' unavoidably takes a position.</p>
<h2>Are these discussions intractable?</h2>
<p>No. For all the talk of recursion, these questions don't consume their own tail; the advice is distinct from the advice <em>about</em> the advice, and it's reasonable to take one side on the first level and the other at the second. It's also reasonable to take different positions on different topics - we're not trying to resolve some mathematical dilemma here, we're trying to figure out what heuristic works 'best' in practice, both for the individual and for the society. But the solutions to the two levels of discussions <em>do</em> influence eachother in what feels like an important way, and figuring out how that influence impacts practice is what I'm stuck on.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				




<h2>Background</h2>



<p>I never really planned on writing this article. The original idea was to publish <a href="https://unstructed.tech/2021/02/04/art-of-starting-things/">Art of Starting Things</a> and move on.</p>



<p>“Man, why stop there?”, said my Aussie friend. “Starting is not enough. You have to write about Sustaining and Finishing things”.</p>



<p>And honestly, it got me thinking. It’s a fact really. <span>Starting anything new is hard enough, but sustaining at it … now, we’re talking pure art here</span>.</p>



<p>If you haven’t read the previous article (<a href="https://unstructed.tech/2021/02/04/art-of-starting-things/">Art of Starting Things</a>), you should probably check that one first. But if you’re having issues sustaining at whatever it is that you started – well, you’re on the right place.</p>



<h2>Real-life story</h2>



<p>“I’ll probably close my blog”, said a friend of mine.</p>



<p>This was way unexpected really. He recently published an article that, within an HOUR, ended up on the front page of HackerNews! This, in return, generated over 12k views in a single day! For comparison, I’ve been blogging since June and my most popular article generated around 100 views in total. What he achieved in a day I haven’t been able to do within 8 months. Not even close.</p>



<p>Naturally, I was perplexed at this. Why would he do something like that? He obviously has a gift for writing, he picked a perfect niche as well and some of the new articles that he announced will probably skyrocket over the first one.</p>



<p>“It’s just that I’m not feeling motivated about it. I don’t feel the same excitement and it feels more like a chore now.”</p>



<h2>Motivation is a spark, not a fuel</h2>



<p>This, in all honesty, was one of the biggest game changers for me. <span>I was always under the impression that you need to be motivated in order to keep doing things</span>. Be it a new diet, starting to exercise, or just – blogging. My impression was as simple as – I have to be motivated in order to keep doing it. Because, what’s the point if I’m not motivated and excited, right? Why keep doing it?</p>



<p>Now, I can’t really pinpoint the exact moment when or how I came to the realization that it might not be like that. I <em>think</em> it was due to a combination of podcasts and books that I happened to be listening to and reading at the time. But somehow it hit me. I had that “aha!” moment. The moment of infinite wisdom. The big revelation. <span>Motivation sucks; aim for discipline</span>.</p>



<p><span>Motivation is really good to get you started. It’s great as a spark, but it’s terrible as a fuel!</span> </p>



<p>Let me tell you something as raw as it gets – <strong><em>if I were to work out only when I felt like working out, I’d probably be working out once in every 3 months</em></strong>. I kid you not. Every single morning when I get up, the last thing that I feel like doing is putting my shoes on and going to a gym. Literally. I’d rather eat a bee. Doubly so when it’s damn cold outside!</p>



<p>Waking up at 6:45AM? The same. Blogging? Same. Eating that chicken breast day after day after day? Same. You get a gist, right?</p>



<p>So, one might ask, and righteously so – why the hell do I keep doing it if I’m not enjoying it? Turns out that the answer has a formal name: delayed gratification.</p>



<h2>Delayed gratification</h2>



<p>Here’s what Wikipedia has to say about it:</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>Delayed gratification</strong>, or <strong>deferred gratification</strong>, describes the process that the subject undergoes <span>when the subject resists the temptation of an immediate reward in preference for a later reward</span>. Generally, delayed gratification is associated with resisting a smaller but more immediate reward in order to receive a larger or more enduring reward later</p><cite>Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_gratification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wikipedia</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>That’s as simple as it gets. It’s all about making a smaller effort now (e.g. deciding to work out or blog even if not feeling like doing it) in order to collect a greater reward in the future (e.g. health benefits or excitement from publishing a new article). </p>



<p>There’s really no magic here. And yet, one might wonder – but how do you keep making those small efforts if your whole body is screaming at you, trying to prevent you from doing it? Again, the answer is really simple – discipline.</p>



<h2>Aim for discipline</h2>



<p><span>Look, the bad news is that your brain will ALWAYS win over you</span>. It just has an advantage that you will never be able to beat with a willpower. ALWAYS. Yeah, motivation might come as a superman and beat it temporarily, but your brain will always get you over time. It plays a long-term game and you are not destined to win here. </p>



<p>So, what do you do if you can’t win? Well, either you give up, which is what pretty much everybody will do. Or, you cheat!</p>



<p><span>Discipline is the best way to cheat your brain</span>. Not even the best, but, probably THE ONLY WAY to win that game. Yep. Seriously. </p>



<p>How do you do that? Well, it’s actually really simple. You keep doing whatever it is that you wanted to do. In my case, when I wake up, even though my whole body is screaming at me, I just have my routine where I take a shower, wash my teeth, pick my bag and … go to the gym. I don’t really “think” whether I want to do it or not. I just do it. Automatically. Day after day after day.</p>



<p>Same is true for blogging. I don’t wait to feel hyped about blogging. I just pick a day or time when I’ll be able to blog and … I just do it. I ignore whatever my brain wants and I just start hitting those keys.</p>



<p>And here’s the best part — <span>once you get over the initial “scream”, it becomes easier</span>. You don’t even remember that you didn’t feel like doing it in the first place. And the outcome? You just worked out, wrote an article or went by with another day of eating clean. Congrats! The delay has passed and the gratification will kick in. And you know what? That gratification is way better then the one you would have felt if you opted for an “instant” instead of “delayed” one 😉</p>



<h2><span>You don’t have to FEEL like doing it. Just do it.</span></h2>



<p>I just want you to remember this really. It’s one of the biggest misconceptions that we have.</p>



<p><span>Whenever you feel like NOT doing something, just stop thinking and do it</span>. You can thank me later!</p>



<h2>Some useful advice</h2>



<h3>Keep it at 85%</h3>



<p>There was a study that they run on professional sprinters. First, they were instructed to run 30 meters but very loosely, without any tension, but at 85% effort. They weren’t told their time. Then, they were instructed to run the same 30 meters but this time giving their 100%. Suffice to say that, in almost every single case, the first number was way better than second. </p>



<p>Point being — unless you are doing a once-in-a-while performance, you should keep your effort at 85%. This is the only way to sustain long-term at anything.</p>



<h3>Keep it simple</h3>



<p>There is a principle in programming called KISS, which stands for Keep It Simple Stupid.</p>



<p><span>We tend to believe that overcomplicating stuff is the only way to do it properly</span>. For example, if we’re talking diet – we believe that making ultra-complex food plan is the way to go. If we’re talking exercise – the only way to advance is to go with super complex plans. You get the gist, right?</p>



<p>This achieves only ONE thing — we either never start or we give up rather soonish.</p>



<p>As the saying goes – <span>don’t let perfect be the enemy of good. Keep it simple stupid</span>.</p>



<h3>Discipline equals freedom</h3>



<p>This is a saying used by Jocko Willink extensively and, frankly, I’ve heard of people having it tattooed as well.</p>



<p>Sounds like rubbish but there’s a truth behind it. <span>By being disciplined and knowing WHEN you do things, you actually get MORE free time to play with</span>. Give it a thought 😉</p>



<h3>If you’re not feeling like doing it today, do it now and rest tomorrow</h3>



<p>Another one by aforementioned Jocko and, frankly, another game changer for me. I’ll paraphrase his words: “If I’m not feeling like exercising today, I’ll go and exercise and, if I feel restless tomorrow, I’ll skip it then”. </p>



<p>This is really nothing more than a brain hack. The truth is – 9/10 times you won’t be feeling restless tomorrow and you’ll keep doing it.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Main problem is that we often confuse motivation with discipline. If we’re not motivated to keep doing it, we’ll just not do it. This is wrong. Motivation is a spark to get you started, but discipline is a fuel that keeps you going.</p>



<p>Don’t overcomplicate stuff. Keeping it simple is the only way to keep doing anything long-term. <span>It’s usually a marathon, not a sprint</span>.</p>

February 11, 2021 | https://www.tweag.io/blog/2021-02-10-linear-base/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.tweag.io/blog/2021-02-10-linear-base/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>We’re announcing <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/linear-base"><code>linear-base</code></a>,
a standard library for <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base#learning-about--xlineartypes">Linear Haskell</a> programs.
Our release accompanies the release of <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/status/ghc-9.0.1">GHC
9.0</a> which supports <code>-XLinearTypes</code>. Linear base has been
written by Bhavik Mehta, a former Tweag intern, Arnaud Spiwack, and ourselves.</p>
<p>In the spirit of a standard library, <code>linear-base</code> is not a strict replica of
<code>base</code> with linearly-typed variants of all the facilities in <code>base</code>. Instead,
<code>linear-base</code> focuses on the abstractions one naturally <em>needs</em> and <em>desires</em>
when programming with linear types.</p>
<p>It does include some linear variants from <code>base</code>, but the library
ranges from mutable data structures with a pure API to a resource-safe I/O
monad, to linear-streams. It’s a “base” library, a helpful
prelude to programming using <code>-XLinearTypes</code>.</p>
<p>Of course this raises the question, what does a linear Haskell program look like?
And, how does <code>linear-base</code> provide what we <em>need</em> and what we <em>want</em> to write one?</p>
<h2>Envisioning Linear Haskell Programs</h2>
<p>If you’re unfamiliar with <code>-XLinearTypes</code>, you can learn more by
browsing our
<a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/tree/master/examples">examples</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base#learning-about--xlineartypes">README</a>.
At a bare-bones level, linear types simply
provide some further properties that a function declared with a signature like <code>f :: A %1-&gt; B</code> must satisfy. Namely, to type-check the body of <code>f</code>,
the <code>A</code> must be consumed exactly once. We are then able to leverage this
type-checking power to write functions that would have been unsafe to write
before (e.g., a pure interface to mutable data structures) or provide
alternative APIs to existing ones that place an obligation on the programmer to
ensure they avoid certain errors (such as reading from a closed file handle).
For more information about how <code>-XLinearTypes</code> works see our <a href="https://www.tweag.io/blog/tags/linear-types/">earlier
posts</a>.</p>
<p>There are two main families of motivations for this additional type-checking discussed
in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09756">Linear Haskell paper</a>. First, we can write pure
APIs for mutable data structures such as arrays. As discussed in the paper,
this approach is sometimes more convenient to work with than using the
<code>ST</code> monad, and even makes <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/array-0.5.4.0/docs/Data-Array-Unsafe.html#v:unsafeFreeze"><code>unsafeFreeze</code></a> safe.</p>
<p>Second, <code>-XLinearTypes</code> enables us to type-check usage protocols.
An example discussed in the paper is the protocol of file handles, namely, that
file handles must be closed and then cannot be written to or read from<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Thus, a typical linear program would likely be one that</p>
<ul>
<li>is mostly pure, but has a piece of state to use throughout. Using
linear types avoids that an <code>ST</code> monad invades
the larger, pure, part of the program</li>
<li>is resource-heavy and requires a non-trivial amount of reasoning on the part
of the programmer to ensure resource protocols are upheld.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this in mind, we can envision a standard library as one that has the
<strong>linear gadgets we <em>want</em></strong>, like pure-interfaced mutable data structures and
resource-safe APIs, and the <strong>utilities we <em>need</em></strong>, like a linear <code>($)</code>, to
write a typical linear program.</p>
<h2>What we want: linear abstractions or use-cases!</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>linear-base</code> comes equipped with a pure API for mutable <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Data/Array/Mutable/Linear.hs">arrays</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Data/Vector/Mutable/Linear.hs">vectors</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Data/HashMap/Linear.hs">hashmaps</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Data/Set/Mutable/Linear.hs">sets</a>.
These enable us to write a mutable implementation of

<p>This code reads rather like an imperative
program, where <code>arr</code> is updated through <code>arr</code>, <code>arr1</code>, <code>arr2</code> and so on.
Compared to using the <code>ST</code> monad, we lose the ability to share the
effect of mutations, in exchange we gain a pure interface, which can
be less invasive.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>linear-base</code> has a resource-safe <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/System/IO/Resource.hs">File I/O API</a> that ensures that file
handles, for instance, are closed and then no longer used.</li>
<li><code>linear-base</code> includes a <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/tree/master/src/Streaming">linear variant</a> of the
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming">streaming</a> library, which is compatible with the
resource-safe I/O monad, to ensure that resources accessed in the
monadic layers of streams have their protocols obeyed and that the protocols
of streams themselves are enforced. If the effects in streams can be repeated
more than once, we could, say, repeat the effect of reading from a file handle
after that handle is closed. Hence, we use control monads inside linear streams
to ensure monadic effects are performed exactly once. This is based
on
<a href="https://www.tweag.io/blog/2018-06-21-linear-streams/">the work</a> of Edvard Hübinette, for the Haskell Summer
of Code of 2018.</li>
<li>In order to define such resource-safe protocols, <code>linear-base</code> provides
<a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Control/Monad/Linear.hs">control monads</a> and related monadic functions like <code>foldM</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What we need: linear utilities!</h2>
<p>Of course, <code>linear-base</code> includes various abstractions that many
linear programs will end up using, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Variants of <code>base</code> abstractions like a linear <code>Num</code>, linear <code>Functor</code>s (in <a href="https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-01-16-data-vs-control/">two
flavors</a>), a linear <code>Data.List</code> API, and linear versions of
standard <code>Prelude</code> functions like <code>($)</code>.</p>
<p>We need these because functions as simple as</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div data-language="hs"><pre><code>  <span>f</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>%</span><span>1</span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>%</span><span>1</span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
  <span>f</span> <span>a</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>*</span> <span>4</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>will only type-check if <code>(*)</code> and <code>(+)</code> have linear arrows. Similarly, using
standard abstractions from <code>base</code>, like functors, <code>($)</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>foldl</code>, will
not work inside many functions that have linear arguments.</p>
<p>As a special note, we use a linear <code>(&amp;)</code> for a workaround to the
current limitation that all case statements consume the scrutinee (the <code>x</code> in
<code>case x of</code>) unrestrictedly. See the <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/docs/USER_GUIDE.md">user guide</a> for more.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mechanisms to interface linear and non-linear code: <code>linear-base</code> comes with
<code>Ur</code>, which stands for unrestricted and lets you manipulate a
non-linear value in a linear context.
Hence, a function <code>f :: Ur a %1-&gt; b</code> can use the <code>a</code>
unrestrictedly after pattern matching on <code>(Ur x)</code>. Alongside this,
<code>linear-base</code> comes with the <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Data/Unrestricted/Linear.hs">classes</a> <code>Consumable</code>, <code>Dupable</code> and
<code>Movable</code> which allow non-linear use of linearly-bound values; one can
<code>consume</code>, duplicate (possibly with <code>dup2 :: a %1-&gt; (a,a)</code>) or, <code>move</code> a
linearly bound value.</li>
</ul>
<div data-language="hs"><pre><code>  <span>consume</span> <span>::</span> <span>Consumable</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>%</span><span>1</span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span>
  <span>dup2</span> <span>::</span> <span>Dupable</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>%</span><span>1</span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span>a</span><span>)</span>
  <span>move</span> <span>::</span> <span>Movable</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>%</span><span>1</span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>Ur</span> <span>a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>These are used throughout <code>linear-base</code> itself and are likely to
show up in linearly types programs. For instance,
the linearly-typed streaming function <code>chain</code> has
the following type</p>
<div data-language="hs"><pre><code>  <span>chain</span> <span>::</span> <span>forall</span> <span>a</span> <span>m</span> <span>r</span> <span>y</span><span> . </span><span>(</span><span>Control.Monad</span> <span>m</span><span>,</span> <span>Consumable</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
    <span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>m</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Stream</span> <span>(</span><span>Of</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>m</span> <span>r</span> <span>%</span><span>1</span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>Stream</span> <span>(</span><span>Of</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>m</span> <span>r</span></code></pre></div>
<p>because the <code>y</code> must be discarded as the monadic effect is chained
after each <code>a</code> in the stream.</p>
<h2>Advanced abstractions &amp; sneak peeks</h2>
<p>Finally, <code>linear-base</code> has several features still in the works. Please note
that some of these features like non-GC memory allocation, destination arrays
and push-pull arrays are still very experimental and likely to change.</p>
<ul>
<li>Linear <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Control/Optics/Linear/Internal.hs">optics</a> are optics re-designed to work in linear contexts.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Foreign/Marshal/Pure.hs">Non-GC memory allocation</a>. We can use linear types to enforce the protocols for
using memory outside of GHC’s garbage collector and on the system heap, i.e., that
we allocate before use, necessarily free and do not use after that. Hence, the GC has
less work to do and we as programmers have the control over some allocation which
could impact the performance of our program.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Data/Array/Destination.hs">Destination arrays</a>. Destination arrays, provide a way to write code in
destination-passing-style. This lets us decide when we allocate space
for a write-only array that’s threaded throughout our program. If we instead
had just used a vector, we might not have had all the fusion we’d like and might
have had extra allocations which impact memory use and performance.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Data/Array/Polarized.hs">Push-pull arrays</a>. We can use linear-types to represent
<a href="https://jyp.github.io/posts/controlled-fusion.html">polarized arrays</a>. This enables us to provide a <code>vector</code>-like
API but explicitly control when allocation occurs. With the existing
<code>vector</code> library, one is often relying on array fusion to avoid
unnecessary allocations, but it can be hard to predict when array
fusion occurs. Polarized arrays can be either
output-friendly (a push array) or input-friendly (a pull
array) and neither form allocates. Only when a regular array is needed does
one <em>explicitly</em> allocate. So, controlling allocation is done by
the programmer, not the compiler.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Community first</h2>
<p>Our goal with <code>linear-base</code> is to make it easy and fun for the community to
write Linear Haskell programs. The first release is available on
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/linear-base">Hackage</a> and comes with <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/tree/master/examples">examples</a> from
the repository, and, in addition to the haddock, a short <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/docs/USER_GUIDE.md">user
guide</a>. Please feel welcome to <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/issues">point out bugs or request
features</a>. To check out the latest update, see <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base">our GitHub

<p>This article briefly describes the difference between mathematical <em>permutations</em> and <em>combinations</em>, explains the main idea behind permutations and combinations algorithms and contains links to algorithms implementation in JavaScript.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>JavaScript code examples may be found in <a href="https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms">JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures repository</a>. Read more for further details.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-combinations-and-permutations">What are Combinations and Permutations<a href="#what-are-combinations-and-permutations" aria-label="what are combinations and permutations permalink"></a></h2>
<p>Let’s say we have a <strong>collection</strong> or <strong>set</strong> of something (collection of numbers, letters, fruits, coins etc.), and we need to <strong>pick items</strong> from a collection to form another collection. For example imagine that you’re picking lottery numbers from the collection of available numbers (<code>{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} → {4, 5, 9}</code>). Or you’re picking the fruits from collections of available fruits to make a fruit salad (<code>{orange, apple, banana, grape} → {apple, banana}</code>). Or you’re trying to guess the lock password, and you’re choosing 3 numbers out of <code>{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}</code> set to guess the correct password (<code>{1, 1, 2}, {1, 1, 3}, {1, 1, 4}</code>, ...). In all these cases you’re creating one collection out from the other one by following some rules. These rules define whether your new collection is a <strong>permutation</strong> or a <strong>combination</strong>.</p>
<p>If the <strong>order</strong> of the elements in your new collection <strong>matters</strong> then you’re dealing with <strong>permutations</strong> (for example in case of lock password the set of <code>{1, 1, 2}</code> is not the same as set of <code>{2, 1, 1}</code>). Otherwise, if the <strong>order doesn’t matter</strong> then you’re making a combination (combination of fruits <code>{apple, banana}</code> to make a salad — it doesn’t matter if you’ll pick apple or banana first).</p>
<p>Your new collection <strong>may or may not contain duplicates (or repetitions)</strong>. For example in lock password you’re allowed to use duplicate numbers but when you’re dealing with collection of race winners (<code>{Black, Smith, Brown}</code>) you’re not allowed to make duplicates because it doesn’t make sense to have the same person to be on two winning positions.</p>
<p>To illustrate all these differences I’ve created small cheat sheets to make it more easy to remember them.</p>

Events are standard iCal files, and can be imported or exported to other calendar apps. You can even share entire calendars! You can create multiple calendars, and events can be one-off or repeating. </p>
<p>Interestingly, as the calendar is written on top of Peergos, the app itself doesn't include any encryption or sharing code, because the underlying Peergos layer handles that.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>I’ve been using vim pretty much exclusively as my editor for about 8 years now and I like to think I’ve amassed a few tricks along the way. Instead of the standard entry-level advice, here are some, as far as I can tell, lesser-known vim tips.</p>
<h2 id="editing">Editing</h2>
<h4 id="navigate-backforward-like-a-browser">Navigate back/forward like a browser</h4>
<pre><code>:help jumplist
</code></pre><p>Vim’s jump lists allow you to jump backwards/forwards through previously visited locations. Jumps are recorded for edits, searches, marks etc. Scrolling through a file does not record a jump.</p>
<p>Move to an older location with <code>Ctrl-O</code> and to a newer location with <code>Ctrl-I</code>.</p>
<h4 id="visual-blocks-and-multiple-cursors">Visual Blocks and “multiple cursors”</h4>
<p>This one seems to surprise people - you can (kinda) get multiple cursors in vim without any plugins! Select a visual block with <code>Ctrl-v</code>, then either <code>I</code> to insert on all lines or <code>c</code> to replace the whole visual block with whatever you then type. Press <code>Esc</code> to stop and your text will appear on all lines.</p>
<p><img src="https://tomjwatson.com/images/blog/vim-tips/multiple-cursors.gif" alt="Multiple cursors in action"></p>
<h4 id="relative-line-numbers">Relative line numbers</h4>
<pre><code>:help relativenumber
</code></pre><p>You may have noticed the weird line numbers on the previous gif. I use relative line numbers which makes all line numbers relative to the current line. This is particularly useful when wanting to move to a particular line. Instead of typing, for example, <code>:1056</code> to go the line 10 lines above you, you can simply <code>10j</code> instead.</p>
<h4 id="using-vims-undo-tree">Using vim’s undo tree</h4>
<p>Type something, undo, type something else. With other editors, the first thing you typed is now lost to the sands of time. Not with vim!</p>
<p>The easiest way to navigate the tree is to use the <code>g-</code> and <code>g+</code> commands to step backwards and forwards through the tree in chronological order. You’ll always get back to a previous state if you <code>g-</code> enough times.</p>
<p>You can even time travel with vim. Yes, seriously.</p>
<p>Return to the saved state from 10 minutes ago:</p>
<pre><code>:earlier 10m
</code></pre><p>Overshot your destination? Move forwards in time:</p>
<pre><code>:later 40s
</code></pre><p>If you find this useful, maybe check out the <a href="https://github.com/mbbill/undotree">https://github.com/mbbill/undotree</a> plugin.</p>
<h4 id="the-normal-command">The <code>normal</code> command</h4>
<pre><code>:help normal
:norm[al][!] {commands}
</code></pre><p>This command makes it possible to run a bunch of regular normal mode commands together, but its real use is when combined with a range.</p>
<p>For example, to uppercase the second word of every line in this file:</p>
<pre><code>Tom Jones
Frank Chester
Alice Ronald
</code></pre><p>We can run</p>
<pre><code>:% norm wvwU
</code></pre><p>Which will, on every line (%), move forward a word (w), select the next word (vw) and then uppercase it (U)</p>
<p>Or, to add a comma to the end of all lines in the following list:</p>
<pre><code>[
  foo
  bar
  baz
]
</code></pre><p>Just:</p>
<pre><code>vi]              select everything within the brackets
:norm $a,        move to end of line and append a comma
</code></pre><h4 id="the-global-command">The <code>global</code> command</h4>
<pre><code>:help global
:[range]g[lobal]/{pattern}/[cmd]
</code></pre><p>I only learnt about this super powerful command recently. It lets you repeat a command against all lines matching a pattern</p>
<p>Delete all blank lines:</p>
<pre><code>:g/^\s*$/d
</code></pre><p>Move all lines containing foo to the end of the file:</p>
<pre><code>:g/foo/m$
</code></pre><p>However, <code>:g</code> is most powerful when paired with <code>:norm</code>. For example, to add a missing colon to all if statements:</p>
<pre><code>if test1
   thing1()

if test2
   thing2()
</code></pre><p>We can run:</p>
<pre><code>:g/if/norm $a:
</code></pre><p>Which will, for all lines containing ‘if’, execute the normal command to append a ‘:’ to the end of a line.</p>
<h4 id="making-tabs-useful">Making tabs useful</h4>
<p>I use a tab-heavy workflow with vim and I think tabs are generally easier for newbies to get their heads round than buffers. This is just a simple change, but adding shortcuts to switch between tabs with <code>Ctrl-left</code> and <code>Ctrl-right</code> makes them far easier to work with.</p>
<pre><code>" switch tabs with Ctrl left and right
nnoremap &lt;C-right&gt; :tabnext&lt;CR&gt;
nnoremap &lt;C-left&gt; :tabprevious&lt;CR&gt;
" and whilst in insert mode
inoremap &lt;C-right&gt; &lt;Esc&gt;:tabnext&lt;CR&gt;
inoremap &lt;C-left&gt; &lt;Esc&gt;:tabprevious&lt;CR&gt;
</code></pre><h4 id="centralised-swapfiles">Centralised swapfiles</h4>
<p>Make swapfiles be kept in a central location to avoid polluting file system:</p>
<pre><code>set directory^=$HOME/.vim/swapfiles//
</code></pre><h4 id="persistent-undo">Persistent undo</h4>
<p>It’s possible to make your edit history persistent across file closure. This lets you make a bunch of edits to a file, <code>:wq</code> it, realise you made a mistake, reopen the file and then undo your edits from your last session with the regular <code>u</code> command.</p>
<p>Simply create an undo directory, e.g. <code>~/.vim/undodir</code> and the following to your <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>
<pre><code>set undodir=~/.vim/undodir
set undofile
</code></pre><h4 id="use-system-clipboard-as-default-clipboard">Use system clipboard as default clipboard</h4>
<p>Pasting into and copying out of vim needn’t be difficult.</p>
<pre><code>:set clipboard=unnamed
</code></pre><p>This also means that you can now <code>cmd+c</code> in one application and <code>p</code> it in vim, or <code>dd</code> in one vim instance and <code>p</code> the line in another.</p>
<h2 id="my-favourite-plugins">My favourite plugins</h2>
<p>I use a <a href="https://github.com/tom-james-watson/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc#L6-L28">whole bunch of plugins</a>, but here are the ones I find most indispensable.</p>
<h4 id="ctrlpvim">ctrlp.vim</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim">https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim</a></p>
<p>This simple plugin lets you fuzzy find files for opening. Press <code>Ctrl-p</code> and type parts of the file path and name to shorten the list of files down. Press <code>Enter</code> to open the selected file, or <code>Ctrl-t</code> to open the file in a new tab.</p>
<p><img src="https://tomjwatson.com/images/blog/vim-tips/ctrl-p.png" alt="ctrlp in action"></p>
<h4 id="ale">ALE</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/w0rp/ale">https://github.com/w0rp/ale</a></p>
<p>Ale is THE best linter available for vim. Not much to explain here - if you’re not using it, go check it out.</p>
<p><img src="https://tomjwatson.com/images/blog/vim-tips/ale.png" alt="ale linting"></p>
<h4 id="git-gutter">git-gutter</h4>
<p>This is the only git-related plugin that I need. Lots seem to use vim-fugitive but I never found it useful. It show the ongoing git diff in the left hand side gutter.</p>
<p><img src="https://tomjwatson.com/images/blog/vim-tips/git-gutter.png" alt="git-gutter hunk usage"></p>
<p>You can also use git-gutter to jump between hunks with <code>c[</code> and <code>c]</code>. You can then stage hunks with <code>\hs</code> or revert them with <code>\hr</code>.</p>
<h4 id="vim-airline">vim-airline</h4>
<p>This plugin simply renders a nice status line at the bottom of each window. Vim looks wrong without it.</p>
<p><img src="https://tomjwatson.com/images/blog/vim-tips/airline.gif" alt="showing off airline"></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Vim never ceases to amaze me - I feel like I’m still learning as much after nearly a decade of use as I was in the first year. I’m sure there are some mistakes in the examples I’ve posted, or even better ways of doing some of them. If so - leave a comment and let me know!</p>
<p>If you’re interested in my setup or looking for a few more useful snippets, you can find my full .vimrc in my dotfiles - <a href="https://github.com/tom-james-watson/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc">https://github.com/tom-james-watson/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc</a></p>

            <div>
              
              <article><p>Welcome to the <a href="https://jmmv.dev/series.html#Rust%20review"><strong>Rust Review</strong></a>’s bonus post, which I had promised from <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2018/05/rust-review-introduction.html">the very beginning</a>. I’m here to cover the big elephant in the room: Rust vs. Go. Which one is better?</p>
<p>There is no good answer to this question because <em>this comparison is unfounded</em>. I think people tend to bundle the two languages together because they were released at about the same time and the release of Rust felt like a response to the release of Go. Moreover, both languages are supposed to focus on systems software. But they are vastly different, and even as they both target systems software, they target different kinds of such software.</p>
<p>Go can be thought of as “C done right” or “a replacement for Python”. Go excels at the development of network servers and automation tools. Rust focuses on correctness and safety and is somewhere between C++ and Haskell, and as I previously mentioned, can be thought of as “a pragmatic Haskell”. Despite Rust’s high-level abstractions, its promise of making them zero-cost also means that it should excel at writing any kind of systems project.</p>
<p>This personal review is based on my experience writing the exact same project, <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/sandboxfs/">sandboxfs</a>, in the two languages. The original implementation of this project was done in Go and I have an experimental rewrite (not yet checked in) in Rust. Both pass the same test suite. I did this rewrite to learn the language, but also because profiling the Go variant always identified the hotspots as living in the Go runtime. I wanted to see if a trivial rewrite in Rust would deliver better performance, and that seemed to be the case. Along the way, I’ve been surprised by how many potential concurrency bugs I encountered in the <em>original</em> Go code because Rust didn’t allow me to implement the same design in the rewrite.</p>
<p>Before we start, you may want to also read <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2016/03/golang-review.html">my review of Go from two years ago</a>. Done? Let’s go.</p>

<p>The first thing that stands out as different between Go and Rust is the way they manage memory.</p>
<p>Go transparently allocates objects on the stack or heap depending on their lifetime and uses garbage collection to manage the latter. Rust uses explicit stack and heap allocations and manages the latter via scopes (aka RAII in C++ parlance) and ownership/move semantics.</p>
<p>In this area, the typical trade-offs between garbage collection and explicit memory management apply. This means that Go suffers from garbage collection overhead while Rust doesn’t, but this is a non-issue for the vast majority of software. Think about the last time you had to write a performance-critical, latency-critical, CPU-bound application.</p>
<p>Effectively using Rust requires understanding how a computer’s memory works. Go is more forgiving in this area, but as I’ll cover in the next section, that’s not necessarily a good thing: knowing how memory works is something you really ought to master as a programmer.</p>
<p><strong>Winner:</strong> cannot call. Both Go and Rust provide mechanisms to make memory leaks unlikely and both have good ergonomics.</p>

<p>Go is a very simple language and in <em>that</em> lies its beauty. Go is extremely easy to pick up and to churn lots of code with after only a few hours of practice. But as we saw in the <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2018/06/rust-review-learning-curve.html">learning curve post</a>, this is a fallacy: any code you write right after learning a language will be non-idiomatic. You need a lot more time to really write code worthy of the language’s best practices.</p>
<p>In the Rust case, there is no denying that it is a complex language. Maybe not as complex as C++, but it has a lot of things going on. Writing code in Rust, therefore, requires more effort. The payoff is that, once the code is written and compiles successfully, there are high chances that it will run just fine. The same cannot be said of Go, in which I’ve experienced plenty of runtime crashes.</p>
<p>You have to pick your battle: either you write Go code quickly and then spend extra time writing trivial tests and debugging runtime problems; or you spend that time writing robust Rust from the ground up and avoiding post-build problems.</p>
<p><strong>Winner:</strong> hard to call. It’s easy to say that Go wins, but I don’t want to say so because of what I mentioned. I personally prefer spending extra time crafting code that will stand the test of time instead of having to track down complex memory and threading issues down the road.</p>

<p>Go doesn’t support generic types. The Go authors are not inherently opposed to having them, but they claim that they cannot be cleanly implemented or supported—and that a perfect solution should be found before anything is implemented. As a result, people abuse <code>interface {}</code> to represent generic types and primitives like <code>append</code> are implemented using features that no other Go code can benefit from.</p>
<p>Rust just has generic types and they work as you expect. Generics work both for plain types as for traits, and in the case of traits, you get to control how the machine code Rust generates looks like via the <code>impl</code> and <code>dyn</code> duality (starting from Rust 2018).</p>
<p><strong>Winner:</strong> Rust. ‘nuff said.</p>

<p>The thing I dislike the most about Go is that, in its lack of features, it provides zero mechanisms to encode the characteristics of robust code in the code itself. Yes, automated code formatting and strong recommendations on how the code should be written are great, but these are insufficient to enforce logical properties of the code. I’ve found myself writing long comments explaining why some conditions are never possible, why a particular parameter works the way it does, or how variables and mutexes are related… and these are all symptoms of code that will break in the future: <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2013/06/readability-avoid-comments.html">comments cannot be sanity-checked by the compiler and I can guarantee you that they go stale</a>. Everything should be expressed in code if at all possible.</p>
<p>So what features do we find in Rust to make code more robust and future-proof that we don’t find in Go?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Assertions.</strong> These are invaluable in letting the programmer communicate their intent about state that may be not obvious. Rust has assertions. Go, on the other hand, doesn’t. Well… Go does have <code>panic</code> which can be used to simulate assertions, but this is strongly frowned upon so you should never do that.</p>
<p>Why does Go not have assertions? My blind guess: because programmers routinely misuse assertions to validate user input, which later causes runtime crashes on bad or malicious input. Therefore, in its pragmatism, Go requires reporting all problems as controlled errors to avoid this kind of mistake. (Hmm… this is something I’ve been meaning to cover as a separate post for a while…)</p>
<p>By the way, a note I’ve heard several times from others: you can judge the experience of a programmer by how many assertions their code has, where more means better. Do whatever you want with that thought.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Annotations.</strong> Sometimes there are input parameters that go unused when they should be used, or return values that must be checked but aren’t. Other times, you know a particular function will never return and want to communicate this fact to the caller so that the compiler doesn’t complain about, for example, missing return statements. Go doesn’t have any of these, which makes it hard to express programmer intent. Rust does have such annotations.</p>
<p>What’s worse in the Go case is that some of these behaviors exist for specific internal functions such as <code>panic</code>, which the compiler understands cannot return, but it’s impossible to express this for any Go code you write. Quite unfair, considering that this same drawback applies to what I said about generics above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Docstrings.</strong> Yes, Go has docstrings, but they are incredibly rudimentary. They work just fine for the most part though, but having written a lot of Java, there is a ton of value in having docstrings with a predefined structure. This allows tools to verify the sanity of the documentation. For example, IntelliJ is able to validate that parameter names match the actual function parameters and that cross-references to other classes are valid.</p>
<p>Rust’s docstrings are better than Go’s in the sense that they support Markdown, but they are still a underspecified: there doesn’t seem to be a standard way of structuring them, and they don’t support documenting individual items. The tooling cannot cross-check that those docstrings are valid according to the code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Error checking.</strong> I am one of the few (?) people that likes Go’s explicit error propagation. Yes, it’s annoying to write many error checks, but doing so forces you to think about errors in a way that many other languages do not.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the chosen idiom has a problem: a function always returns a value <em>and</em> an error, and it’s up to the caller to <em>first</em> check the error and <em>then</em> check the value. The language won’t enforce doing the right thing, and I’ve seen people make mistakes by unpacking the result of a function before checking for an error. Rust, on the other hand, comes with higher-level types to wrap values <em>or</em> errors. Combined with the lack of null, this means that the caller can never access a value when an error is present and viceversa. See the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/"><code>Result</code></a> type and what I wrote about <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2018/06/rust-review-match-keyword.html">the <code>match</code> keyword</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To conclude this section, a positive note about both languages: <strong>none of them promote types automatically</strong>. For example, both Rust and Go force the programmer to cast integers across different sizes so that any possible overflows or underflows become apparent. Mind you: Go is a bit better than Rust in this area because Go’s type aliases are treated as semantically different by the compiler—requiring explicit casts between them—while Rust just treats them as syntactical aliases (like C’s <code>typedef</code>s).</p>
<p><strong>Winner:</strong> Rust hands down. You can claim that these are just complaints about Go’s lack of features and that I should just take Go the way it is… but no: these are complains about the inability to write future-proof, crystal-clear code in Go <em>because of</em> these missing features.</p>

<p>Go’s simplicity transpires everywhere, including the tooling required to improve a program once written. One specific aspect of this is …</p></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p>If you’re a really great coder, do you need a resume at all? Relying on your reputation, your circle of friends, and your prodigious output seems like it’s enough. And at Leet Resumes, where we <a href="https://www.leetresumes.com/">write experienced engineers’ resumes for free</a>, it’s a frequently asked question.</p><p>In fact, the better you are, the more you want a great resume. There are five reasons why it makes sense. A well-written resume attracts better interest, increases your pay offers, plays well in our data-driven world, doesn’t leave hard-earned money on the table, and forces your current employer to pay you what you’re worth. Let’s walk through these reasons one by one.</p><p>The goal of a technical resume is to attract interview requests. And the goal of a great technical resume is to attract better interview requests from better companies that are more interesting to you. A great resume helps you attract better attention by making it more obvious what your contribution to your current and past teams has been. And it does this by detailing your key <a href="https://leetresumes.com/blog/how-to-write-bullet-points-for-a-technical-resume">accomplishments</a> and <a href="https://leetresumes.com/blog/how-do-i-find-numbers-to-put-on-my-technical-resume">numbers</a>.</p><p>A better resume helps to increase your pay offers. If you’ve ever sold a house or a car or a domain name, you know that the more buyers you have at an auction, the higher the final price of the item will be. Well, it’s the same idea when you’re selling the most valuable thing you own — your own time. Getting multiple companies interested in you at the same time creates a competitive bidding dynamic, so that when one hiring manager tells you she’ll pay you $x and a 34-inch monitor, the next hiring manager has to offer you $x + 10^4 dollars and a 49-inch curved monitor. Plus, it makes negotiating easier on you when all you’re doing is repeating what the other company said — it doesn’t take much skill or sales ability to get a better deal this way.</p><p>The world is getting much more data-driven. One of the better outcomes of the internet revolution has been the rise in importance of data, and the reduction of hand-wavey logic from the marketing department or upper management. With data so readily available, people won’t rely on someone’s title or past company name to decide if what they say is true — they want to see the data themselves. </p><p>But that same skepticism that applies to claims from others also applies to claims from you, including your resume. Simply copy-pasta-ing your job description isn’t good enough anymore. Hiring managers and companies want to <a href="https://leetresumes.com/blog/why-you-should-include-numbers-on-your-technical-resume">know the details</a> of what you’ve done and why you think you’ve been successful. A great resume helps to tell your great story.</p><p>A great resume also helps to make sure you’re not leaving money on the table. Sure, it’s great when your friend from college asks you to join the startup he signed up for, or it’s flattering when an old boss slides into your DMs to recruit you for his new gig. But in a lot of these cases, your old boss or your old friend might want to pay you your old value — and not what you’re worth today. And that can mean missing out on cash, vacation time, and equity. Having a great resume means that you can make sure that old friends are paying the right money for your work at your new employer.</p><p>And finally, a great resume ensures that your current employer is paying you what you’re worth. One of the reasons we started Leet Resumes to write experienced engineers’ resumes for free, was this ridiculous practice of companies trying to short-change talented engineers on annual pay raises. It’s silly that companies such as <a href="https://leetresumes.com/blog/what-google-recruiters-look-for-in-a-technical-resume">Google</a> won’t increase pay, or offer higher equity packages, to loyal, dedicated employee engineers just for their excellent work. No, they’ll offer the minimum they can get away with. Unless you bring a job offer to them. Only then will they match it or beat it. So even for engineers who want to stay at their current job, having a great resume is important for getting paid what you’re worth.</p><p>At Leet Resumes, we’re resume experts who have seen the power of a great resume to help engineers tell their story and get better job offers and better pay as a result. We write <a href="https://www.leetresumes.com/">experienced engineers’ resumes for free</a>, (with additional paid services coming later this year.)

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><img src="https://www.artofchording.com/assets/img/georgi.30388742.jpeg" alt="Georgi split steno machine on a table"></p> <p>I'm a programmer who uses stenography in my everyday work. Coworkers often come to my desk to chat or ask questions, not knowing that I use a steno machine to program and type. As I start typing in front of them, they'll watch as words and symbols appear in bursts, faster than they've ever seen anyone type before. Then, confused, they'll look down at my hands to see how I can possibly move that fast and see the reduced keyboard layout that I'm typing on, which always leads to more questions.</p> <p>A steno machine only needs twenty-three keys, while normal keyboards have about a hundred. I wish I could capture everyone's face the first time they see a steno machine in action—that expression of shock and bewilderment.</p> <p>When I first heard about stenography, I was amazed: stories of court reporters keeping up with multiple speakers in a courtroom, typing at a certified speed of 225 words per minute, faster than most people talk at 180 words per minute. Was that even possible? Did their school just teach them to type more quickly? Well, not quite.</p> <p>Stenography is one of those things that's hard to understand just by watching, and even if I tell you the basics, it's a skill that takes months or years to learn. Just as someone can show you how hitting keys on a piano makes sounds, it will take a while before you understand the notes enough to play music or compose pieces of your own.</p> <p>I'm going to break down, as best I can, the biggest differences between a keyboard and a stenography machine and try to demonstrate how steno can be so much faster.</p> <h2 id="in-a-nutshell"><a href="#in-a-nutshell">#</a> In a Nutshell</h2> <p>On a normal keyboard, a typist hits <strong>individual keys to express individual letters</strong> as fast as possible to spell words. A stenographer, on the other hand, uses a steno machine to make "chords" by hitting multiple keys. Chords, much like the ones played on a piano, express sounds instead of letters and allow the stenographer to type at a slower rate to achieve the same word count, because those <strong>chords can express entire words and phrases.</strong> The result is about <strong>three times faster</strong> than traditional typing.</p> <p>A stenography setup consists of a steno machine and steno software running on a computer.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> The machine can either be specially made for steno, or just an ordinary keyboard that supports n-key rollover (hitting all the keys at once.) The software that is most commonly used by amateurs is <a href="https://www.openstenoproject.org/plover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plover</a>, which listens to what you do on the steno machine and then outputs keystrokes to whatever program you're using.</p> <h2 id="key-concepts"><a href="#key-concepts">#</a> Key Concepts</h2> <p>Steno is completely different from traditional typing. Ordinary keyboards are very simple to use: you learn where the letters are, how to make things uppercase, and how to type symbols. Getting faster is a matter of hand positioning and practice.</p> <p>Stenography takes months to learn and years to master. Let's look at some of the key concepts that make stenography special.</p> <h3 id="chords"><a href="#chords">#</a> Chords</h3> <p>The steno machine's compressed layout is used to form <em>chords</em>, which loosely correspond to <em>syllables</em>.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> Steno feels a lot like playing a piano, and stenographers map between "steno speak" and "the English language."</p> <div><p>TIP</p> <p>When I say the word <em>chord</em>, you can imagine <em>syllable.</em></p></div> <p>Take a look at the steno layout in all its glory:</p> <p data-v-740d7010=""><svg viewBox="0 0 555 238" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" style="stroke:currentColor;stroke-width:2px;fill-opacity:0;height:auto;" data-v-740d7010=""><g data-v-740d7010=""><path fill="currentColor" d="M 5 5 h 545 v 33 h -545 Z " data-v-740d7010=""></path></g><g data-v-740d7010=""><path fill="currentColor" d="M 5 43 h 50 v 100 a 25 25 0 0 1 -50 0 Z " data-v-740d7010=""></path></g><g data-v-740d7010=""><path fill="currentColor" d="M 60 43 h 50 v 60 h -50 Z " data-v-740d7010=""></path></g><g data-v-740d7010=""><path fill="currentColor" d="M 60 108 h 50 v 35 a 25 25 0 0 1 -50 0 Z " data-v-740d7010=""></path></g><g data-v-740d7010=""><path fill="currentColor" d="M 115 43 h 50 v 60 h -50 Z " data-v-740d7010=""></path></g><g data-v-740d7010=""><path fill="currentColor" d="M 115 108 h 50 v 35 a 25 25 0 0 1 -50 0 Z " data-v-740d7010=""></path></g><g data-v-740d7010=""><path fill="currentColor" d="M 170 43 h 50 v 60 h -50 Z " data-v-740d7010=""></path></g><g data-v-740d7010=""><path fill="currentColor" d="M 170 108 h 50 v 35 a 25 25 0 0 1 -50 0 Z " data-v-740d7010=""></path></g><g data-v-740d7010=""><path fill="currentColor" d="M 132.5 172.99999999999997 h 50 v 35 a 25 25 0 0 1 -50 0 Z " data-v-740d7010=""></path></g><g data-v-740d7010=""><path fill="currentColor" d="M 187.5 172.99999999999997 h 50 v 35 a 25 25 0 0 1 -50 0 Z " data-v-740d7010=""></path></g><g data-v-740d7010=""><path fill="currentColor" d="M 225 43 h 50 v 100 a 25 25 0 0 1 -50 0 Z " data-v-740d7010=""></path></g><g data-v-740d7010=""><path fill="currentColor" d="M 262.5 172.99999999999997 h 50 v 35 a 25 25 0 0 1 -50 0 Z " data-v-740d7010=""></path></g><g data-v-740d7010=""><path fill="currentColor" d="M 317.5 172.99999999999997 h 50 v 35 a 25 25 0 0 1 -50 0 Z " data-v-740d7010=""></path></g><g data-v-740d7010=""><path fill="currentColor" d="M 280 43 h 50 v 60 h -50 Z " data-v-740d7010=""></path></g><g data-v-740d7010=""><path fill="currentColor" d="M 280 108 h 50 v 35 a 25 25 0 0 1 -50 0 Z " data-v-740d7010=""></path></g><g data-v-740d7010=""><path fill="currentColor" d="M 335 43 h 50 v 60 h -50 Z " data-v-740d7010=""></path></g><g data-v-740d7010=""><path fill="currentColor" d="M 335 108 h 50 v 35 a 25 25 0 0 1 -50 0 Z " data-v-740d7010=""></path></g><g data-v-740d7010=""><path fill="currentColor" d="M 390 43 h 50 v 60 h -50 Z " data-v-740d7010=""></path></g><g data-v-740d7010=""><path fill="currentColor" d="M 390 108 h 50 v 35 a 25 25 0 0 1 -50 0 Z " data-v-740d7010=""></path></g><g data-v-740d7010=""><path fill="currentColor" d="M 445 43 h 50 v 60 h -50 Z " data-v-740d7010=""></path></g><g data-v-740d7010=""><path fill="currentColor" d="M 445 108 h 50 v 35 a 25 25 0 0 1 -50 0 Z " data-v-740d7010=""></path></g><g data-v-740d7010=""><path fill="currentColor" d="M 500 43 h 50 v 60 h -50 Z " data-v-740d7010=""></path></g><g data-v-740d7010=""><path fill="currentColor" d="M 500 108 h 50 v 35 a 25 25 0 0 1 -50 0 Z " data-v-740d7010=""></path></g> <!----> <g data-v-740d7010=""><text text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="central" x="255" y="21.5" style="stroke-width:0;fill:currentColor;fill-opacity:1;font-size:25px;" data-v-740d7010="">

The left R represents the R at the beginning of a syllable (like in "rough" or "trap") and the right R represents the R at the end of a syllable (like "car" or "tarp.")</p> <h3 id="spelling"><a href="#spelling">#</a> Spelling</h3> <p>Because chords are roughly syllables, writing in stenography feels more like speaking than spelling.</p> <p>In steno, all these words with <strong>different spellings</strong> are chorded with the <strong>same right-side keys</strong> because they all end with a similar sound:</p> <ul><li><code>OSHN</code> →  → ocean</li> <li><code>MOSHN</code> →  → motion</li> <li><code>FASHN</code> →  → fashion</li> <li><code>VISHN</code> →  → vision</li> <li><code>MISHN</code> →  → mission</li> <li><code>RUSHN</code> →  → Russian</li></ul> <p><strong>Multisyllable words</strong> are chorded by stringing together <strong>multiple chords</strong>: <code>RE</code> plus <code>WARD</code> becomes "reward".</p> <p>Spelling is less of a problem because words just get sounded out:</p> <ul><li><code>LA MA</code> → llama</li> <li><code>FA SIL TAIT</code> → facilitate</li> <li><code>WENS DAI</code> → Wednesday</li> <li><code>BA RA KU DA</code> → barracuda</li></ul> <p>To distinguish between homophones, the stenographer uses different vowel keys or adds in the "asterisk" key, <code>*</code>, which is kind of like a wildcard:</p> <ul><li><code>BAIR</code> → bare</li> <li><code>BAER</code> → bear</li> <li><code>MAIN</code> → main</li> <li><code>MA*IN</code> → Maine</li></ul> <h3 id="briefs"><a href="#briefs">#</a> Briefs</h3> <p>Ever watched a professor save time by writing "w" instead of "with"? Have you ever written "brb" in a text chat instead of "be right back"? This concept is used extensively in stenography: a <strong>brief (short for abbreviation)</strong> is a shortcut to save time.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup></p> <p>Single-key chords like <code>W</code> and <code>U</code> map to "with" and "you", respectively. There are also briefs for very long words, so the chord for "particular" is a syllable that sounds like <code>PLAR</code>; "remember" is <code>RER</code>; "government" is <code>GOFMT</code>.</p> <h3 id="customizable-dictionary"><a href="#customizable-dictionary">#</a> Customizable Dictionary</h3> <p>In the steno software, there's a giant "dictionary" that maps between chords like <code>LA MA</code> and words like "llama." To write the entire English language, a stenographer's dictionary is often made up of over 100,000 entries. Don't worry, the stenographer doesn't need to memorize every single entry! Once they know how to sound-out words from syllables, they should be able to write any word they encounter.</p> <p><strong>The dictionary is customizable</strong>. As the English language develops and new words are created, the stenographer can add them to their dictionary. This is critical for anyone writing jargon, complex terminology, or programming languages.</p> <p>Every stenographer has their own personal dictionary where they can add their own entries. If one stenographer were to try another stenographer's machine, the words would probably come out wrong because every dictionary is unique.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup></p> <h3 id="prefixes-suffixes-and-root-words"><a href="#prefixes-suffixes-and-root-words">#</a> Prefixes, suffixes, and root words</h3> <p>Compound words can be strung together thanks to a phonetic system of prefixes and suffixes. "Uncomfortable" could be written as "un" (prefix <code>UN</code>) + "comfort" (root word <code>KOFRT</code>) + "able" (suffix <code>-BL</code>). "Antidisestablishmentarianism" could be composed from the prefixes "anti" and "dis"; the root word "establish"; and the suffixes "ment", "arian", and "ism".<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup></p> <p>Finally, if a word isn't composable from prefixes, suffixes, and root words and the stenographer doesn't have that word in their dictionary, they can fall back to one-letter-per-chord, which is called <em>fingerspelling</em>.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup></p> <h3 id="automatic-capitalization-and-spacing"><a href="#automatic-capitalization-and-spacing">#</a> Automatic capitalization and spacing</h3> <p>Another way that stenographers save time is by not needing to capitalize and space apart words themselves. For the most part, the steno software knows that if you end a sentence with a period, the next word will be capitalized. It knows that "Los Angeles" and "Tom" always have capital letters. Of course, there are ways to get around this behavior. For example, there is a chord that forces the next word to come out lowercase, regardless of whether it's a proper noun or not.</p> <h3 id="typos"><a href="#typos">#</a> Typos</h3> <p>When someone makes a typo in stenography, it's not a misplaced letter, it's a misplaced sound.</p> <p>It can make for some pretty comical mistakes.</p> <p>When typing "ground" on a normal keyboard, you might accidentally type "gronud" (swapping u and n), but a stenographer might accidentally write "frowned"! The only difference is the stenographer accidentally used an "f" sound instead of a "g" sound.</p> <p>Another mistake is an accidental key in a chord. This could turn "remember" (<code>RER</code>) into "rear" (<code>RAER</code>.)</p> <p>Using the wrong sound can have devastating consequences: <a href="https://twitter.com/morinted/status/1232396116962029576" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one time</a>, I tried to chord <code>HER TAJ</code> for "heritage" but I hit <code>HER TIJ</code> and got "her to the best of my knowledge."</p> <p>If the stenographer types a chord that isn't in their dictionary, say <code>ST-RB</code>, then the output will be "ST-RB" so that they can see their mistake.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup></p> <p>Luckily, fixing a typo is as simple as tapping the <code>*</code> key to erase the last chord.</p> <h3 id="symbols"><a href="#symbols">#</a> Symbols</h3> <p>You might think that it's hard to input symbols if everything is sound-based. But the opposite is true! Stenographers can create complex sequences of symbols, keyboard shortcuts, movement keys, and emoji through chords.</p> <p>There is a plugin for Plover where it converts the last word you wrote into an emoji. My "convert-to-emoji" stroke is <code>MOEJ</code>. So <code>KAT MOEJ</code> → 🐈</p> <p>One strategy that is used for symbols is to omit vowels from the root word. When there are no vowels and no asterisk in a steno chord, that's shown with a dash (<code>-</code>).</p> <ul><li><code>BRAIS</code> → brace</li> <li><code>BR-S</code> → {</li> <li><code>BR*S</code> → }</li></ul> <p>It's possible to create briefs for multiple symbols at once. For example, <code>SHR*UG</code> maps to <code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code> …</p></div></div>

            <p>Learn how to get a self-hosted HTTPS tunnel secure with Let’s Encrypt in 5-10 minutes for development, testing or self-hosting.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>In this tutorial I want to show you how quick and easy it can be to get a secure HTTPS tunnel up and running.</p>

<p><img src="https://letsencrypt.org/images/le-logo-wide.svg" alt="Let's Encrypt logo"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let’s Encrypt offers free TLS certificates for a duration of 90 days, which can be renewed when they expire.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tunnels are traditionally used to give you incoming network access to a service running on a private network. For application developers, many platforms require you to accept inbound webhooks, and there are very few solutions to fix this that can be used on a corporate VPN. The SaaS-based tunnels are often blocked, and have very restrictive rate limits, so get in the way of you doing your job.</p>

<p>When using a self-hosted tunnel, things just tend to work, and you won’t be rate-limited on the number of connections you can establish, or what DNS provider you can use.</p>

<p>In this post I’ll show you how to use the new Let’s Encrypt integration which ships with inlets PRO 0.8.0.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You’ll create a small VM on public cloud with a public IP address</li>
  <li>You’ll run the inlets server on the VM and get a free TLS certificate from Let’s Encrypt</li>
  <li>Then you’ll run a HTTP server on your local network, and if you don’t have anything to hand, we provide a practical example</li>
  <li>You’ll then connect the client to the server and access your private service from a custom domain</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/71af284e891c19085a6fae4933b859c7f52d18d00f4a940d2802062c2028de8a/68747470733a2f2f7062732e7477696d672e636f6d2f6d656469612f457469366a5a47584941416e6b77463f666f726d61743d6a7067266e616d653d6c61726765" alt="Conceptual architecture"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Conceptual architecture: public users will be able to access a HTTP server on our local and private network over an encrypted websocket.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="start-with-the-exit-server">Start with the exit-server</h3>

<p>Since we are not relying on a third-party to host a container or VM for us with a public IP, we will create our own. It needn’t be expensive, you can generally pick the lowest price available, and sometimes even use the free-tier of your cloud provider.</p>

<p>Provision a virtual machine and enable SSH access.</p>

<p>You will need the following ports open if you’re using security groups:</p>
<ul>
  <li>8123 - for the websocket that runs the inlets control-plane</li>
  <li>80 - to serve Let’s Encrypt HTTP01 challenges</li>
  <li>443 - to serve your website or local application to users</li>
</ul>

<p>Note down the IP address of your exit-server and create a DNS A record in your DNS management tool</p>

<p><img src="https://inlets.dev/images/2021-letsencrypt/adns.png" alt="DNS record"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Above: Creating the alexellis.inlets.dev subdomain in <a href="https://domains.google.com/">Google Domains</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now download inlets 0.8.0 onto the server using <code>wget</code> or <code>curl</code> from the <a href="https://github.com/inlets/inlets-pro/releases">releases page</a>.</p>

<p>Your command will be slightly different to mine, but here’s an example you can adapt:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Get an auth token for the inlets tunnel</span>
<span>export </span><span>TOKEN</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span><span>head</span> <span>-c</span> 16 /dev/urandom | shasum | <span>cut</span> <span>-d</span><span>" "</span> <span>-f1</span><span>)</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>$TOKEN</span> <span>&gt;</span> token.txt

<span># Populate from previous step</span>
<span>export </span><span>SERVER_IP</span><span>=</span><span>""</span>
<span>export </span><span>DOMAIN</span><span>=</span><span>"alexellis.inlets.dev"</span>

inlets-pro http server <span>\</span>
  <span>--letsencrypt-domain</span> <span>$DOMAIN</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--letsencrypt-email</span> webmaster@<span>$DOMAIN</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--letsencrypt-issuer</span> prod <span>\</span>
  <span>--token</span> <span>$TOKEN</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--auto-tls</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--auto-tls-san</span> <span>$SERVER_IP</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s what each flag does:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>--letsencrypt-domain</code> - gets a TLS cert for each domain given, you can provide this flag multiple times</li>
  <li><code>--letsencrypt-email</code> - required for renewal notifications and for accepting the Let’s Encrypt Terms of Service</li>
  <li><code>--letsencrypt-issuer</code> - use the value <code>prod</code> or <code>staging</code> to switch between the two options</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>--token</code> is used by the inlets client to authenticate to the server.</p>

<p>Then the <code>--auto-tls</code> flags enable TLS for the control-plane of inlets running on port <code>8123</code>. This ensures that the tunnel will be able to connect, even if there is an issue with Let’s Encrypt such as rate-limiting.</p>

<p>You can keep the inlets server process running by generating a systemd unit file. Just run the same command as before, but add <code>--generate=systemd</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code>inlets-pro http server <span>\</span>
  <span>--generate</span><span>=</span>systemd <span>\</span>
  <span>--letsencrypt-domain</span> <span>$DOMAIN</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--letsencrypt-email</span> webmaster@<span>$DOMAIN</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--letsencrypt-issuer</span> prod <span>\</span>
  <span>--token</span> <span>$TOKEN</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--auto-tls</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--auto-tls-san</span> <span>$SERVER_IP</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>&gt;</span> inlets-pro.service
<span>sudo cp </span>inlets-pro.service /etc/systemd/system

<span>sudo </span>systemctl <span>enable </span>inlets-pro
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then check it started as expected with <code>sudo journalctl -u inlets-pro</code> or <code>sudo systemctl status inlets-pro</code>. The process will now restart upon reboot, or if for some reason the process crashes.</p>

<h3 id="run-a-local-http-server">Run a local HTTP server</h3>

<p>I’m going to run a HTTP server using Node.js on port 8080. I want to share it with my friends, but I also want to get some webhooks from a third-party like GitHub and this tunnel will help me with building the functionality and testing it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/alexellis/expressjs-k8s
<span>cd </span>expressjs-k8s
npm <span>install

</span>npm start

Express.js listening on port: 8080
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you don’t want to install Node.js on your computer, you can also use <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/expressjs-k8s">the README</a> to run the process using Docker.</p>

<p>If you don’t know what to expose, try inlets’ own HTTP fileserver extension, set it up: <a href="https://inlets.dev/blog/2021/02/09/simple-filesharing.html">here</a></p>

<p>This local HTTP server will be called the “upstream”, it’s where the inlets-client will direct traffic. It doesn’t have to be on the same computer as the client, it could be running on your Raspberry Pi, or your NAS for instance.</p>

<p>If running on your own computer, the upstream may be: <code>http://127.0.0.1:8080</code>, and when running on a NAS, the upstream may be: <code>http://192.168.0.101:8080</code> for instance.</p>

<h3 id="start-the-client">Start the client</h3>

<p>For Linux:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl <span>-SLsf</span> https://github.com/inlets/inlets-pro/releases/download/0.8.1/inlets-pro <span>&gt;</span> inlets-pro
<span>chmod</span> +x ./inlets-pro
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For Raspberry Pi, add the suffix <code>-armhf</code> to the download URL.</p>

<p>For MacOS:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl <span>-SLsf</span> https://github.com/inlets/inlets-pro/releases/download/0.8.1/inlets-pro-darwin <span>&gt;</span> inlets-pro
<span>chmod</span> +x ./inlets-pro
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For Windows, see the <a href="https://github.com/inlets/inlets-pro/releases">Releases page</a>.</p>

<p>Now connect your inlets client to the inlets server:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Populate from server</span>
<span>export </span><span>SERVER_IP</span><span>=</span><span>""</span>
<span>export </span><span>TOKEN</span><span>=</span><span>""</span>

<span># Populate from previous step</span>
<span>export </span><span>UPSTREAM</span><span>=</span><span>"http://127.0.0.1:8080"</span>

<span># Save your inlets-pro license to ~/LICENSE.txt </span>

inlets-pro http client <span>\</span>
  <span>--url</span> wss://<span>$SERVER_IP</span>:8123 <span>\</span>
  <span>--token</span> <span>$TOKEN</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--license-file</span> <span>$HOME</span>/LICENSE.txt  <span>\</span>
  <span>--upstream</span> <span>$UPSTREAM</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The four things you need to do are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Set the <code>SERVER_IP</code></li>
  <li>Set the <code>TOKEN</code></li>
  <li>Set the <code>UPSTREAM</code> i.e.”http://127.0.0.1:8080”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="test-out-your-tunnel">Test out your tunnel</h3>

<p>Within a few moments you’ll have a tunnel established, and the inlets server will provision a certificate for your domain using Let’s Encrypt.</p>

<p>Visit your domain such as https://alexellis.inlets.dev/</p>

<p><img src="https://docs.inlets.dev/images/operator-pro-webpage.png" alt="Working tunnel"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here an Express.js tunnel that I set up a few weeks prior to this tutorial.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was <a href="https://twitter.com/alexellisuk/status/1358367796455948288?s=20">a small challenge I ran on Twitter</a>, where eight different community users set up their own HTTPS tunnels using these instructions.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/techknowlogick/status/1358482311369666561/">Matti Ranta</a> from the Gitea project prepares for his live stream on OpenFaaS, by getting webhooks from Gitea to his functions</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<h3 id="what-next">What next?</h3>

<p>Now that you have a tunnel server, you can keep it running at a very minimal cost and reconnect to it whenever you need.</p>

<p>You can connect several inlets clients to your exit-server, either for redundancy (connections will be load-balanced), or for separate sites.</p>

<p>If you’re an OpenFaaS user, then you may setup two separate subdomains for Grafana and the OpenFaaS UI.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>grafana.example.com</code> - upstream <code>http://127.0.0.1:3000</code></li>
  <li><code>faas.example.com</code> - upstream <code>http://127.0.0.1:8080</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Then it’s up to you whether you want to connect one client or two.</p>

<p>inlets also supports tunnelling TCP traffic and can be used with Kubernetes as a LoadBalancer through the <a href="https://docs.inlets.dev/#/tools/inlets-operator?id=inlets-operator-reference-documentation">inlets-operator project</a>.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>

<p>We’ve now set up a self-hosted tunnel server and can use it whenever we like. inlets also supports TCP tunnels for services like RDP, VNC, SSH and databases. I’ve included a few more blog posts to help you understand use-cases.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What did you expose? Tweet to <a href="https://twitter.com/inletsdev">@inletsdev</a> and we’ll give the first 5 people 10% off a personal license.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did you know that the personal license can now be used at work? inlets PRO has two options for licensing - either a personal license or a commercial license. You can learn more or take out a free trial on <a href="https://inlets.dev/">the homepage</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-w-id="a81ba003-9805-a73c-c604-68b50f014274"><h2>Background</h2><div><p>Ever since our <a href="https://twitter.com/aaroisosaari/status/1314160985679319040" target="_blank">first launch</a> in October, we've collected email signups on our landing page from people excited about our product. A potential user would join our waitlist by submitting their email address and we would follow-up with a confirmation.</p><p>Throughout the fall, we iterated our confirmation email numerous times, trying to encourage the recipients to share about us on social media. We tested different wordings and provided share links for social media, which got us a decent amount of <a href="https://www.flowrite.com/love" target="_blank">word-of-mouth</a>. In the end, what was missing was a real incentive to spread the word.</p><p>In January, we started looking into off-the-shelf referral marketing solutions like <a href="https://viral-loops.com/" target="_blank">Viral Loops</a>, <a href="https://kickofflabs.com/" target="_blank">KickoffLabs</a>, and <a href="https://www.prefinery.com/" target="_blank">Prefinery</a>, but none of them really gave us the flexibility that we were looking for. We wanted to own the entire process – signup, onboarding, referrals, emails, and rewards.</p><p><strong>So, we started building our own referral system using no-code tools.</strong> Just days later, we launched a new version of the signup process consisting of a beautifully integrated onboarding survey and a referral program – giving people the possibility to earn rewards by inviting their friends to join the waitlist.</p><p>The new system caused an immense spike in our signups – over 8x increase on W4/2021 compared to the average of the preceding 6 weeks.<strong>‍</strong></p></div><p>‍</p><blockquote><strong>This is a practical step-by-step instruction on how to implement the same referral program in your business 🎯</strong></blockquote><p>‍</p><h3>What does Flowrite's referral program include?</h3><ul role="list"><li>Email signup on <a href="http://flowrite.com/" target="_blank">flowrite.com</a></li><li>Unique referral link assigned to every user</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/flowritecom/status/1356546139768705024" target="_blank">Rewards</a> for # of people referred</li><li>Integrated Typeform survey to collect further information about each user</li><li>Possibility for the user to refer a friend during the survey</li><li>Internal spreadsheet to track signups and referrals</li><li>Public <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RPpQzwwsoAOET4MV3sy46CKw-93OPbZ6k4dtvnTrDAc/" target="_blank">leaderboard</a> for users to track how many referrals they have<br>‍</li></ul><h3>What's required to build a similar program?</h3><ul role="list"><li>Website that you can customize with your own HTML &amp; JavaScript (i.e. a Webflow site or just a pure HTML website)</li><li>Typeform survey (optional)</li><li>Google Sheets or Airtable</li><li>Gmail or something else that sends emails</li><li>Automation platform (e.g. Zapier or Integromat) to glue things together</li></ul><p>Also, having some level of understanding of JavaScript may become handy but is not essential 🙌<br>‍</p><blockquote>Before getting into it, I'd recommend going through our signup process yourself to understand how the entire thing works from a user perspective. Just hit the button in the navbar, enter your email, go through our Typeform survey and check your email for a confirmation.</blockquote><p>‍</p><h2>1. Creating a referral code</h2><div><p>Each person that signs up to our waitlist is assigned a random 6-character code consisting of numbers and letters. At the end of the signup process, we use this code to create referral links that a user can share on social media.</p><p>To create a referral code, insert the snippet below at the end of your &lt;body&gt; tag (or before &lt;/body&gt; tag) on each page where a user can sign up. If you're using Webflow, you can also insert it globally to every page from your site settings.</p></div><p><code>
const referralCode = Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 8)
</code></p><p><br>Secondly, create another variable called referralUrl – composed of the URL of your homepage and the code we just generated. Insert it below the referralCode variable.</p><p><code>
const referralUrl = 'https://www.flowrite.com/?ref=' + referralCode
</code></p><p>‍</p><h2>2. Storing the user's URL</h2><p>You also want to store the user's current URL in a variable. It's essential to know from which URL every signup is coming in order to count the # of referrals by each user.</p><p><code>const siteUrl = window.location.href</code></p><p>‍</p><p>Your code should now look like this:</p><p>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/aaroi/10cc7ce4d328455cb489ecc05b55dd79.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>‍</p><h2>3. The signup form</h2><h4><br>Creating hidden input fields</h4><p>In addition to an email input field, your signup form should also contain two hidden inputs to which we'll soon assign the referralUrl and siteUrl values from the previous steps.</p><p>To add the input fields, insert the following code inside your form element – right next to the email field.</p><p>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/aaroi/ec2198220ac33ad3d49f452b85c18a63.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f6fde4c74a4afd8fb269414/6024e0e6f804dc56ad43db9a_Frame%20444%20(1).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>If you're using Webflow, you can do this with a hidden HTML Embed element.</em></figcaption></figure><h4><br><strong>Populating the input fields</strong></h4><p>The inputs are still empty, though. You need to assign the variables from steps 1 and 2 into your inputs so that they get included in the submission. <br></p><p>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/aaroi/fa2813935c7e24996c5cb3b02c03bd6f.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>‍</p><blockquote>If you're using e.g. Webflow's symbols and have multiple instances of the same signup form on a single page of your website, you need to make sure that variables get assigned to the correct inputs. Check our <a href="https://www.notion.so/flowrite/Flowrite-s-referral-program-Multiple-instances-of-the-same-signup-form-2a766628526145bcbbcc627d48934ea3" target="_blank">Notion memo</a> for instructions on this.</blockquote><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f6fde4c74a4afd8fb269414/60244bc59fcacdc13e6fe788_Screenshot%202021-02-05%20at%2017.00.21.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h4><strong>Testing it out</strong>‍</h4><p>Now, when a user signs up on the website, both the referral URL and the site's URL should be hiddenly included in the submission. If you're using Webflow, you can verify this from the confirmation email.<br>‍</p><h2>4. Customizing your Typeform survey</h2><div><p>As part of the signup &amp; referral system, we are using Typeform to learn more about each user. Completing the Typeform survey is not required to join the waitlist because we collect the email addresses already during the initial signup. The percentage of users who proceed to complete the survey is currently roughly 75%.</p><p>In practice, we want to deliver the referralCode (step 1) and the user's email into Typeform and "carry" them throughout the submission. We do this in order to:</p></div><ol role="list"><li>Use the referralCode in share links on your confirmation page (step 7)</li><li>Match the initial waitlist signups with the corresponding Typeform answers. By bringing the email from the signup form to Typeform, we don't need to ask the user to submit it twice.<br>‍</li></ol><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f6fde4c74a4afd8fb269414/602488dea0b3569783c128d5_Screenshot%202021-02-05%20at%2018.44.21.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h4>Hidden fields</h4><p>To make this happen, you need to use Typeform's <a href="https://help.typeform.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052676612-How-to-use-Hidden-Fields" target="_blank">Hidden Fields</a> feature. You can find the settings under Logic → Advanced.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f6fde4c74a4afd8fb269414/602489dacabb602c169b737e_Screenshot%202021-02-05%20at%2018.44.52.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>You need to set two Hidden Fields: @email and @code. Once that's done, you are able to insert those values at the end of your Typeform link and have them submitted along with the other answers of your Typeform:</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f6fde4c74a4afd8fb269414/602481634e7e9eecea2478dc_Screenshot%202021-02-11%20at%202.57.32.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><h2>5. Integrating the Typeform to your site</h2><p>Typeform gives you several alternatives on how to embed a survey on your page. If you don't want to use an embed, you can just redirect your users to the Typeform.com link.</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f6fde4c74a4afd8fb269414/60244c54f12cba5034627101_Screenshot%202021-02-05%20at%2019.19.32.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>We use the "Popup" alternative with Popup size set as "Large"</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f6fde4c74a4afd8fb269414/602486ba156aa267ba51f36d_Screenshot%202021-02-08%20at%2011.38.40%20(1).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>If you choose to go with any of the embeds, you need to grab Typeform's embed code and place it in your page's HTML.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f6fde4c74a4afd8fb269414/60244c83342317cd8c00a453_Screenshot%202021-02-09%20at%2010.47.43.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>With a popup, it doesn't really matter where you place the Typeform code. We have ours on top of the page hierarchy.</p><p><br>The popup also includes an &lt;a&gt; element, which is essentially a "Launch me" button. Its function is to open the survey popup when clicked. However, since you want the popup to automatically open when a user submits the signup form, you need a piece of code that does that for you.</p><p>You also want that code to take the email that was submitted (from an input element with id set to "email"), assign it to a variable, and insert it at the end of your Typeform link together with the referralCode. These will be the Hidden Fields we set up earlier 😉</p><p>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/aaroi/b7cad587e42ada765e36a497f16b022a.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>‍<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f6fde4c74a4afd8fb269414/60244d2760e83d025adfcade_Screenshot%202021-02-09%20at%2010.47.09.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Lastly, set the visibility of the &lt;a&gt; element to "none" in order to hide the "Launch me" button. </p><p>If you're using Webflow, you can just hide the entire HTML Embed.<br>‍<br>‍</p><h2>6. Typeform redirect</h2><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f6fde4c74a4afd8fb269414/60248571e3eb83af74193693_Screenshot%202021-02-09%20at%2010.51.47.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Typeform allows you to redirect users to custom URLs after completing the survey. The URLs can be customized with both the survey data as well as Hidden Fields.</p><div><p>Our redirect links contain both the referral code (a Hidden Field) and the user's first name from the survey.</p><p>For example, if the "code" was set to <strong>123456</strong> and the first name of the user was <strong>Aaro</strong>, the redirect URL would be:</p></div><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f6fde4c74a4afd8fb269414/6024811b2c9ab334616d67b3_Screenshot%202021-02-11%20at%202.57.13.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><h2>7. Confirmation page</h2><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f6fde4c74a4afd8fb269414/60244e1197258f49e8082af6_Screenshot%202021-02-10%20at%2014.26.40.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>On our <a href="https://www.flowrite.com/thanks#code=123456&amp;firstname=Aaro">confirmation page</a>, we wanted to give users simple options to share their personal referral link and inform them about the rewards they can earn.<br></figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><h4>Incentivization</h4><p>Our way of incentivizing the users is to offer Flowrite-branded merch and free access to the product. With merch, we'd recommend choosing items that you can fit in a letter. We recently realized that shipping packages across the world can get a little expensive.. 🤭<br>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f6fde4c74a4afd8fb269414/60244e5060e83d1384dfcf51_Frame%20401%20(2).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><blockquote>If you want to dig deeper on how to choose rewards and incentives for referral programs check out Referral Rock's <a href="https://referralrock.com/blog/referral-rewards-incentives/#getting-started" target="_blank">guide</a> on the topic.</blockquote><p>‍</p><h4><strong>Customizing the confirmation page</strong></h4><p>Having that custom redirect URL from Typeform allows you to customize your confirmation page for every user. For example, Flowrite's confirmation page uses the "firstname" value of the URL to make the page just slightly more personal:</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f6fde4c74a4afd8fb269414/60244ed6d8d979c9f8b395ff_Screenshot%202021-02-09%20at%2011.11.02.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p><br>To do the same, start by wrapping the part of the paragraph you want to customize in a span. Then, set the id of the span to "firstname".</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f6fde4c74a4afd8fb269414/60246b9483283e1b30c25233_Frame%20445%20(1).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p><br>Lastly, insert the following snippet at the end of the &lt;body&gt; tag of your confirmation page.</p><p>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/aaroi/887807c921e840cd5d013d8a31ac8781.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>‍</p><p>In addition to the first name, you can also use the "code" value of the URL to customize share links for social media.

    <p><strong>April, 2020</strong></p>
<p>Technology companies love to talk about their values. Unfortunately, values are highly abstract and ambivalent constructs that mean different things to different people.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the reason why certain companies (or their leadership teams) love to talk about their values is because of a fundamental lack of inspiring visions. When your company's purpose is to make people click on useless ads, you've got to come up with something else to inspire your employees. Luckily, humans are built with descent bullshit detectors and in practice this form of corporate jargon rarely works as a motivator.</p>
<p>Recognizing the above, I believe that organizations that have a meaningful reason to exist (ie something people can stand behind) should start the other way around. They should define their purpose, spend quality time describing and documenting the world they adhere to, and then reverse engineer from that.</p>
<p>An organization that strives to be <em>fully aligned</em> with its purpose, <em>highly aligned</em> with its day to day practices and <em>loosely aligned</em> in terms of beliefs and principles is more likely to create an inspiring environment for existing and potential contributors.</p>

          <h2>Why this tool?</h2>
          <p>
            TL;DR; to help reduce the environmental footprint of the digital
            world
          </p>
        </header>
        <p>
          This tool aim to humbly participate in stopping the race for ever more
          quality and bandwidth (8K resolution, 5G network, etc.) by offering a
          simple way to radically reduce the size of a video.
        </p>
        <p>
          The digital world’s contribution to the footprint of humanity is
          currently around 4% (see
          <a href="https://www.greenit.fr/environmental-footprint-of-the-digital-world/" target="_blank">this report from GreenIT.fr</a>
          and
          <a href="https://theshiftproject.org/en/article/lean-ict-our-new-report/" target="_blank">this another report from The Shift Project</a>). This is more than
          <a href="https://theshiftproject.org/en/article/lean-ict-our-new-report/" target="_blank">the aviation</a>, and it is predicted to grow in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Online video does <b>NOT</b> represent the main impact of the digital
          world, <b>manufacturing is a much bigger deal</b>. But reducing the
          size of a video can help <b>keeping our old devices</b> that have
          limited bandwidth and limited computing power, instead of buying new
          ones.

      <article id="what">
        <header>
          <h2>What does it do?</h2>
        </header>
        <h3>
          Apply settings from The Shift Project (720p, CRF 28, 160 kbits/s)
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Shift Project has published a guide for reducing the size of a
          video while maintaining a good quality
        </p>
        <p>
          You can download it
          <a href="https://theshiftproject.org/en/guide-reduce-weight-video-5-minutes/" target="_blank">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Basically, it reduces the video resolution to 720p and the audio
          bitrate to 160 kbits/s. The Constant Rate Factor (CRF) is set to 22.
        </p>
        <h3>Lower video resolution (480p)</h3>
        <p>
          It reduces the video resolution to 480p. Don't watch it on your 4K TV,
          otherwise it is OK.
        </p>
        <h3>Lower video quality (CRF 28)</h3>
        <p>
          It reduces the Constant Rate Factor (CRF) to 28. You won't see tiny
          details but the essential is there.
        </p>
        <h3>Lower audio bitrate (56 kbits/s)</h3>
        <p>
          It reduces the audio bitrate to 160 kbits/s. If the audio is mainly
          speeches, it should remain audible.
        </p>
        <h3>One image every 5 seconds (!)</h3>
        <p>
          For some videos, like conferences, there is not much action and you
          can easily understand what happens even with one image every 5 seconds
        </p>
        <h3>Black and white</h3>
        <p>Aesthetic and lightweight</p>

          <h2>How it works?</h2>
          <p>Let's get into the technical details</p>
        </header>
        <p>
          This tool uses
          <a href="https://ffmpegwasm.github.io/" target="_blank">FFMPEG.WASM</a>
          to edit the video directly in the browser!
        </p>
        <p>
          You can dowload
          <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/" target="_blank">FFMPEG</a>
          to try these settings directly on your computer
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Apply settings from The Shift Project (720p, CRF 28, 160
            kbits/s)</b>
        </p>
        <pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -s hd720 -c:v libx264 -crf 22 -vf "scale=iw*sar:ih,setsar=1" -c:a aac -b:a 160k output.mp4</code></pre>
        <p><b>Lower video resolution (480p)</b></p>
        <pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -s hd480 -c:v libx264 -crf 22 -vf "scale=iw*sar:ih,setsar=1" output.mp4</code></pre>
        <p><b>Lower video quality (CRF 28)</b></p>
        <pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -crf 28 -vf "scale=iw*sar:ih,setsar=1" output.mp4</code></pre>
        <p><b>Lower audio bitrate (56 kbits/s)</b></p>
        <pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:a aac -b:a 56k output.mp4</code></pre>
        <p><b>One image every 5 seconds</b></p>
        <pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "fps=fps=1/5" output.mp4</code></pre>
        <p><b>Black and white</b></p>
        <pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "hue=s=0" output.mp4</code></pre>
        <p>
          This whole approach is inspired by image dithering (see
          <a href="https://ditherit.com/" target="_blank">here</a> for an
          example), which removes a lot of data in the image while preserving
          its essential meaning

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As you may have heard, JCenter is shutting down in May 2021.</p><blockquote><p>Into the Sunset on May 1st: Bintray, JCenter, GoCenter, and ChartCenter<br><a href="https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/">https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/</a></p></blockquote><p>So, if you are using JCenter as the repository for your libraries (as me), it’s time to migrate.</p><p>In this article, I will not go through the publishing process of a library to MavenCentral, because there are already plenty of resources available. For example, I followed the one written by Márton Braun.</p><blockquote><p>Publishing Android libraries to MavenCentral in 2021
<a href="https://getstream.io/blog/publishing-libraries-to-mavencentral-2021/">https://getstream.io/blog/publishing-libraries-to-mavencentral-2021/</a></p></blockquote><p>Instead, the topic of this article is to show how to manually migrate the old artifacts of a library without recompiling them.</p><p>It’s important to migrate also the old artifacts because not all the users of your library are using the latest version. But if the library is old, it’s difficult to recompile it from scratch. For example, I’ve tried to manually rebuild the first version of <a href="https://github.com/prof18/YoutubeParser">YoutubeParser</a>, but I quickly failed because it was using a version of the Android Gradle Plugin of 5 years ago that is now incompatible with Android Studio 4.</p><h2>Download old artifacts from Bintray</h2><p>The first thing to do is downloading the old library’s artifacts from Bintray. It is possible to download them, directly from the Bintray directory page:</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://bintray.com/package/files/%7Byour-bintray-username%7D/maven/%7Byour-library-name%7D">https://bintray.com/package/files/{your-bintray-username}/maven/{your-library-name}</a></p></blockquote><p>For example, this is the URL for my other library, <a href="https://github.com/prof18/RSS-Parser">RSS-Parser</a>: <a href="https://bintray.com/package/files/prof18/maven/RSS-Parser">https://bintray.com/package/files/prof18/maven/RSS-Parser</a></p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/bintray-dir.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/bintray-dir.png"></a></figure><p>Here, it is possible to download the artifacts by simply clicking on them.</p><h2>Sign artifacts</h2><p>The next step is signing the artifacts, with a GPG key (to generate one, you can follow the instruction on <a href="https://getstream.io/blog/publishing-libraries-to-mavencentral-2021/">Márton‘s article</a>). The command to perform the signing is the following:</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="bash"> gpg -ab rssparser-1.0.pom
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/sign-terminal.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/sign-terminal.png"></a></figure><p>Remember that all the files uploaded to MavenCentral must be signed. In my case, I have to sign the <em>.aar</em> file, the <em>.pom</em> and the <em>jar</em> that contains the sources and the <em>JavaDoc</em> of the library.</p><p>The signing command produces a <em>.asc</em> file, that must be uploaded as well on MavenCentral.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/signed-files.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/signed-files.png"></a></figure><h2>Manual upload artifacts</h2><p>Now, it’s time to upload the artifacts. Login on <a href="https://oss.sonatype.org/">Sonatype</a> and from the menu on the left, select <em>Staging Upload</em></p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/manual-upload.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/manual-upload.png"></a></figure><p>First of all, in the <em>Staging Upload</em> section, it is necessary to upload the <em>pom</em> file.</p><p>Switch the upload mode to <em>Artifact(s) with a pom</em> in the dropdown window and then select to <em>pom</em> to upload.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/add-pom.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/add-pom.png"></a></figure><p>Then, in the section below, it is possible to upload the other artifacts. To do that, it is necessary to select them from the file system with the <em>Select Artifact(s) to Upload…</em> button and then add them to the list with the <em>Add Artifact</em> button.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/artifacts-to-upload.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/artifacts-to-upload.png"></a></figure><p>Don’t forget to upload also the signatures (the <em>.asc</em> files)!</p><p>After adding all the artifacts, upload them with the <em>Upload Artifact(s)</em> button. It is also necessary to provide a brief description, for example <code>1.1 manual upload</code></p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/add-artifacts.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/add-artifacts.png"></a></figure><p>It could happen the the upload is stuck and the progress bar never goes away. If it happens, reload the page and redo the process (I’ve noticed that it can happen when the browser tab is open for a while).</p><p>After the upload is successful, select <em>Staging Repositories</em> from the left menu.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/staging-repo.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/staging-repo.png"></a></figure><p>Now, the process is the same as when the artifacts are upload from Android Studio (or from the CI). The only exception is that the close task is started automatically (if it not starts, you can start it manually from the top bar).</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/wait-close.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/wait-close.png"></a></figure><p>The close task takes a few moments to perform, and after that, it’s time to release the library with the button in the toolbar.</p><p>And that’s it! After the processing time (usually between 10 to 15 minutes) your library will be available to <a href="https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/">MavenCentral</a>.</p><p>If you have any suggestion or any kind of doubt, feel free to reach me out on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoGomier">@marcoGomier</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>I promised I’ll post stuff about low level hardware issues, and here is my second post on the subject, the first part in a series about the Intel graphics stack.</p>

<p>This post series will be a summary of about a decade of unpublished research I am trying to organize and share.
Not all of it is current, as newer hardware is harder to inspect and reverse, but I think much of the research is relevant.</p>

<p>The first post below is a quick introduction to the different components on the hardware and software side we’ll need to dive into security issues in the next post.</p>


<ul>
  <li>Processor graphics - The graphics unit that is part of the processor itself. Has had many codenames over the years, HD Graphics, UHD Graphics, Iris, Gen9, Gen11, Intel Xe and so on. Even the ‘Gen’ name has double meaning - both generation and ‘Graphics ENgine’. In UEFI code it is sometimes referet to at the IGD - Integrated Graphics Device.</li>
  <li>
    <p>The GuC - an embedded i486 core that supports graphics sechduling, power managment and firmware attestation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>UEFI and OS Drivers</li>
</ul>


<p>As discussed in the introduction to the SecureBoot post, the Intel CPU has four major component groups - the CPU cores, the L3 (or LLC) cache slices, the ‘Uncore’ or ‘System Agent’ parts, all connected through a ring bus inside the die.</p>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/gen9.png" alt="Gen9 Architecture"></p>

<p>The graphics process is made up from several <em>slices</em> and an <em>unslice</em> (like <em>uncore</em>) area that includes common components.
Each slice is divided into subblices and a slice common area. The subslices are made up of several Execution Units (EUs), and Texture unit and a L1 Cache/Memory. The common area includes the L3 cache and the dataport.
The limit to the number of slices is the interconnect between them and the unslice. 
There is always only a single <em>unslice</em>. In the unslice we can find the connection to the ring bus, aptly named the GT interface (GTI), the <em>Command Streamer</em> is reads commands from the system memory and into the graphics processor, the <em>fixed function pipline</em> (FF pipeline), and the thread dispatcher \&amp; spawner that lunch shader programs and GPGPU (General Purpose Comuting) programs onto the EUs. The FF pipeline deals with fixed functions such as vertice operations (called the Geometry Pipe), and other dedicated hardware such as video transcoding.</p>

<p>Different SKUs have different combinations of these. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Skylake GT2: 1 slice of 3 subslices of 8 EUs (1x3x8)</li>
  <li>Skylake GT3: 2x3x8</li>
  <li>Skylake GT4: 3x3x8</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/gen9slice.png" alt="Gen9 Architecture"></p>

<p>The graphics engine is also connect streight to the the IOSF (Intel On Chip Fabric internal bus, see the <a href="https://igor-blue.github.io/2021/02/04/secure-boot.html">secureboot post</a> bus, through a controller called Gunit.  Gunit is connect to both the primary and secondary IOSF and exports functions for communicating with the graphics engine and implementing IOMMU support for graphics memory and unified memory.</p>

<p>All of this is connected to the the display IO interconnect and output to DisplayPort and HDMI outputs.</p>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/gunit.png" alt="Gen9 Architecture"></p>

<h2 id="2d-graphics-pipeline">2D Graphics Pipeline</h2>
<p>The 2D graphics gengine is a standonle IP block in the <em>unslice</em> area, and has its own command streamer, registers and cache. It has 256 different operation codes, for example:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/2dops.png" alt="2D BitBlt Operations"></p>

<h2 id="3d-graphics-pipeline">3D Graphics Pipeline</h2>
<p>The fixed function pipeline in the <em>unslice</em> implements the DirectX 11 redndering pipeline stages: 
Vertex Fetch -&gt; Vertex Shader -&gt; Hull Shader -&gt; Tessellator -&gt; Domain Shader -&gt; Geometry Shader -&gt; Clipper -&gt; Windower -&gt; Z Ordering, -&gt; Pixel Shader - &gt;Pixel Output. Some of these functions are self contained, but many are implemented using by running shader programs on the EUs in the slices. EUs can send certain operations back into dedicated hardware units.</p>

<h2 id="the-execution-units-eus">The Execution Units (EUs)</h2>
<p>The EUs are in-order mulithreaded SIMD processing core. Each execution thread is dispatched has its own 128 register space and executed programs called “kernels”. All instructions are 8 channels wide, e.g. operate on 8 registers at a time (or 16 half registers). Its supports arithmetic, logical and control flow instructions on floats and ints. Registers are addressed by address.
The EU thread dispatcher implements priorities based on age, i.e. oldest is hight priority, and whether the trhead is blocked waiting on instruction fetches, register dependencies etc’. C</p>


<p>The GuC is a small embedded core that supports graphics sechduling, power managment and firmware attestation.
It is implemented in an i486DX4 CPU (also called P24C and Minute IA), altough it seems that since broadwell it has been extended to the Pentium (i586) ISA. It runs a small microkernel call μOS. 
The GuC μOS runs only kernel level tasks (even though μOS supports μApps). The firmware is written in C with not stdlib.
In the GuC we can find supporting blocks: ROM memory, 8KB L1 on core cache, 64KB/128KB/256KB (Broadwell/Skylake/CannonLake) of SRAM  memory which is used for code+data+cache and a 8KB stack. It also has power managment, DMA engine, etc’. 
Communication to the GuC is done through memory-mapped IO and bidirectional interrupts.</p>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/guc.png" alt="GuC architecture"></p>

<p>The GuC offers a light-weight mechanism for dispatch work the host submits to the GPU. This means the GPU driver does not need to handle dispatch and job queuing, making it much faster. The <em>user mode driver (UMD)</em> can communicate with the GuC directly when required and bypass the need to context switch the main CPU into kernel mode. The <em>kernel mode driver (KMD)</em> uses the GuC as a gateway for job submission as well. This simplifies the Kernel and provides a single point where all jobs are submitted.
Communication between the UMD and the GuC is done through shared memory queues.</p>

<p><em>Why is the GuC interesting? Because I think it can communicate with the CSME, CPU and GPU and everything over the IOSF, and if it has bugs it can be used to gain very privileged access to the system and memory</em>.</p>

<h2 id="boot-rom-and-guc-firmware">Boot ROM and GuC firmware</h2>
<p>At system startup GuC is held at reset state until the UEFI firmware initializes the shared memory regtion for the GPU. Inside the shared region a special subregion call WOPCM is set aside fur GuC (and HuC) firmware. It then releases the GuC from reset and it in turn starts executing a small non-modifiable Boot ROM (16/32KB in size) that initializes the basic GuC hardware, and waits for an interupt signalling the firmware has been copied to the WOPCM region.
The GuC firmware is an opaque blob supplied by Intel as part of the GPU KMD, which copies it to the shared memory region (GGTT) and signals the Boot ROM with an interrupt. The bootrom verifies the firmware with a digital signature using a SHA256 hash + PKCSv2.1 RSA signature, and if the test passes copies it to SRAM and starts executing.</p>

<p>The GUC firmware can be extracted from the graphics driver and reversed. Screenshot of IDA open on the kabylake GuC:
<img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/gucfirmware.png" alt="GUC firmware"></p>

<p>The GuC also attest the firmware for the video decoder unit, called <em>HuC</em>. The HuC is an HEVC/H.265 decoded implement in hardware.</p>

<h2 id="the-μos-kernel">The μOS kernel</h2>
<p>The μOS kernel runs in 32-bit protected mode, with no paging and old-style segments model (CS, DS, etc’). All code run in ring0. The OS handles HW/SW exceptions and crashes, and supplies debugging and logging services.</p>

<p>Interrupts are handled through the local APIC - I found interrupts coming from the IOMMU, power managment, display interfaces, the GPU and the CPU.</p>

<p>It runs a single process - which initializes the system and then waits for interrupts/events in a loop.</p>

<h2 id="communication-with-the-os">Communication with the OS</h2>
<p>Commands are dispatched through a ring buffer work queue. Each work item has a header followed by a command. Once a command is posted the CPU notifies the GuC using a “doorbell” interrupt.</p>

<p>The Windows kernel mode driver supports GuC debugging by setting a registry key:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>\\REGISTRY\MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Intel\KMD\GuC\\
	GuCEnableUkLogging=1
    
\\REGISTRY\MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Intel\KMD\GuC\\
    GuCLoggingVerbositySelect=0/1/2/3 (low, medium, high, max)
</code></pre></div></div>


<p>So far we only discussed hardware. The software part of the graphics stack is divided into three levels: UEFI DXE, kernel mode and user mode.</p>

<h2 id="uefi">UEFI</h2>
<p>Traditionally VGA support was implemented with a legacy Video VBIOS as an PCI option ROM. In UEFI VBIOS was modified into a DXE driver call the <em>Graphics Output Protocol</em> (<em>GOP</em>), which support basic display for the UEFI setup menu and for the OS bootloader. The GOP is supplied by Intel to the UEFI vendor. 
The GOP supplies two basic functions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Changing the graphics mode - resultion, pixel depth, etc’</li>
  <li>Getting the physical address of the framebuffer</li>
</ul>

<p>The Windows boot-loader uses the GOP to setup a memory mapped video framebuffer before entering VBS, and after the hypervisor and SK are loaded the access by winload is only through the framebuffer without invoking the GOP. Windows also uses the GOP for disablig blue screens.</p>

<h2 id="windows">Windows</h2>

<p>On Windows, Intel supplies a fairly large graphics driver that implements both the user mode driver (UMD) and kernel mode driver (UMD). Applications using Direct3D communicate through the D3D runtime to the DXGI abstraction interface (in dxgkrnl.sys), which in turn communicated with the KMD. The KMD treats 2D Blt and 3D operations through different pipelines and dispatches the operations to the GPU.</p>

<p>The GPU driver is riddled with telemetry, but I haven’t figured out yet how much of it is sent automatically to Intel, altough crashes are sent through OCA - Online Crash Analysis.</p>

<h2 id="basic-memory-managment">Basic Memory Managment</h2>
<p>A very important job of the graphics drivers (both KMD and UMD) is memory managment (GMM). The Graphics Memory space is the virtual memory allocated to the GPU, and is translated using the system pages tables to the physical RAM. The memory contains stuff lime geometry data, textures, etc’. The GPU hardware used Graphics Page Tables (GTTs) to decode virtual addresses supplied by the software graphics memory space into …</p></section></div>

		<h3>Deep learning is revolutionizing text-to-speech and speech synthesis technologies.</h3>
<p><strong>By Yishay Carmiel and Ben Lorica.</strong></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Recent progress in natural language processing (NLP) and speech models have made voice applications accessible to companies across industries. From smartphone applications and personal assistants to sales and customer support to smart home speakers and appliances, voice applications have become part of daily life. Advancements in deep learning and artificial intelligence technologies—natural language understanding (NLU) in particular—have brought voice technologies to a broader developer audience and greatly expanded practical use case scenarios.</p>
<p>While much of the recent media coverage and attention-grabbing applications have focused on automatic speech recognition (ASR), in this post, we’ll focus on text to speech (TTS) and speech synthesis—technologies that create artificial human speech.</p>
<p>As consumers integrate speech technology into their daily lives with such products as smart speakers and smart home systems, they increasingly will demand higher quality and more <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/25/960299623/voice-author-explores-accents-language-and-what-makes-a-tone-sexy">realistic speech synthesis</a>. We expect TTS and speech synthesis to drive the next wave of innovative voice applications. In 2018, <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/05/duplex-ai-system-for-natural-conversation.html">Google Duplex</a> introduced a system that previewed capabilities that speech synthesis and NLU technologies might be able to achieve. The system demonstrated personal assistants capable of booking appointments by interacting with humans through phone conversations. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis#Applications">Assistive technology</a> use cases in healthcare will also drive innovation in speech synthesis, bringing maturity to impaired communication aids and novel solutions for a wide range of disabilities. We expect to see highly advanced applications that can, for example, serve as the voice for a patient with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jan/19/vocal-polyps-injury-singing-john-colapinto-steven-zeitels">damaged vocal chords</a>, using their own voice.</p>
<p>At a high level, voice applications have three main components: speech recognition, speech profiling, and speech synthesis.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition">Speech recognition</a> is the translation of spoken language into text. It is also called automatic speech recognition, computer speech recognition, and speech to text. A major application of ASR is transcribing conversations. Other examples include “Hey, Siri” commands, such as “call home,” and voice interfaces requiring simple data entry (e.g., entering credit card numbers or call routing—”press or say ‘1’ for customer service”).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-0263-3_4">Speech profiling</a> is the process of audio mining information from speech beyond recognition, including age, gender, emotion, the language spoken, speaker verification, etc. Applications include biometrics, sentiment analysis, and metadata extraction to improve customer intelligence initiatives.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis">Speech synthesis</a> is the artificial creation of human speech. In this post we’ll occasionally use the term “speech synthesis” to refer to technologies that cut across TTS and speech synthesis. The more familiar term is “text-to-speech” but we’re opting for “speech synthesis” because we expect input sources in the future to include a range of formats including text and audio. An example of a system that can take audio input is <a href="https://tencent-ailab.github.io/pitch-net/">Tencent’s PitchNet</a>: a model that takes audio of one singing voice and converts it into audio of another voice singing the same content.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>An Overview of Speech Synthesis Systems</h2>
<p>Voice applications are complex. A close look at voice-enabled AI conversation applications, for instance, reveals the complexity of components on which such applications rely. Each of the components in Figure 1, for example, might require multiple machine learning (ML) models.</p>

<p>The fact that speech technologies mainly interact with humans increases their complexity. Most machine learning systems use quantitative metrics to measure the effectiveness or accuracy of their outputs. If an ML system is designed to catalogue species of birds, for example, it’s straightforward to score the accuracy. The output of voice applications is meant for human listening and requires qualitative metrics evaluated by a panel of humans. A common metric is the Mean Opinion Score (MOS), where a panel of listeners rates the output of a speech synthesis system using a range of 1 (lowest perceived quality) to 5 (highest perceived quality).</p>
<h3>Classical Text-to-Speech and Speech Synthesis systems</h3>
<p>Until the mid-2010’s when voice applications began integrating deep learning technologies, systems for producing artificial voices had two main components: natural language understanding and signal generation.</p>
<h4>Natural language understanding</h4>
<p>Natural language understanding is the process of a machine learning the peculiarities of language and understanding language components in context. In English, consider “1939.” The proper rendering of 1939 into speech depends on the context. NLU’s job is to understand the context and properly parse “1939.”</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>My father was born in 1939 (“nineteen thirty-nine”)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please press 1939 (“one-nine-three-nine”)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This computer costs $1939 (“one thousand nine hundred thirty-nine”)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Classical NLU systems first pass text through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_normalization">normalization system</a> which converts text into a canonical, standard form that can more easily be rendered into speech. Next, the system passes the converted text through additional systems that turn it into linguistic units of sound called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme">phonemes</a>. These units get assembled together using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosody_(linguistics)">prosody</a> model that ensures words and sentences sound correct.</p>
<h4>Signal generation</h4>
<p>Signal generation is the process of taking the text output from the NLU component and turning it into a realistic sounding voice. Early signal generation systems used a voice concatenation approach that recorded uttered parts of speech, such as phonemes or combinations of phonemes, and concatenated them while maintaining prosody and intonation. In principle, this system could generate speech from any text presented to it. Concatenation systems are complex and produce outputs that aren’t as realistic as modern deep learning-based systems.</p>

<h3>The rise of deep learning for speech synthesis</h3>
<p>Deep learning has revolutionized systems for producing artificial voices. Two main components, in particular, have seen significant innovation: the process of converting text to a <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/dali/user-guide/docs/examples/audio_processing/spectrogram.html">high-level audio representation</a>, and the process of converting those representations into speech. Two deep learning models, WaveNet in 2016 and Tacotron in 2017, provided such significant improvements over existing systems that deep learning has now become central to modern speech platforms.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WaveNet">WaveNet</a>, a neural <a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/vocoder">vocoder</a> system from DeepMind, is a deep learning model trained on speech recordings. It is used to produce human-like voices. You can hear it in action on the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech">Google Cloud Text-to-Speech</a> service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10135">Tacotron</a> is a deep learning-based text-to-speech model that synthesizes speech directly from text characters.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the introduction of WaveNet and Tacotron, major components of speech synthesis systems have come to rely on deep learning. Neither system, however, is an end-to-end (e2e) solution. Speech synthesis systems are composed of several components that are built and trained separately (see Figure 3). This means each component has to be trained individually, with its own training data. The speech synthesis system then relies on sequentially training each component in the pipeline. WaveNet and Tacotron each address one component of the end-to-end pipeline.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03575">2020 paper from DeepMind</a> introduced an end-to-end (e2e) speech synthesis model that takes an input (text, phonemes) and outputs raw speech waveforms. e2e systems are also being investigated <a href="https://twitter.com/bigdata/status/1314615419156586496">in automatic speech recognition</a>. While end-to-end speech synthesis systems have attracted the attention of many researchers, it’s important to note that we are in the earliest stages of realizing an e2e system that can take an input and fully process a reasonable human-like output in real time.</p>
<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>There are several active areas of research in speech synthesis. Each offers a myriad of applications and use cases, along with risk/reward trade-offs.</p>
<h3>Adaptable speech synthesis</h3>
<p>In today’s applications, it takes hours of recording and tuning for a speech synthesis system to output a specific person’s voice. What if we could take an existing, realistic sounding speech synthesis system and imbue it with specific voices with only minutes, or even seconds, of a person’s voice recording? A highly personalized, realistic speech synthesis system could revolutionize an unlimited number of applications. The reality of such a system isn’t as far off as it sounds: open source cloning systems that require only a few minutes of recorded audio of a speaker’s voice are <a href="https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning">already available</a>, and are bound to improve over time. <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-ai/build-a-natural-custom-voice-for-your-brand/ba-p/2112777">Microsoft recently announced an offering</a> that allows companies to create custom synthetic voices.</p>
<p>Looking further ahead, we expect to see mainstream speech synthesis systems advanced enough to generate <a href="https://google.github.io/tacotron/publications/multilingual/index.html">multilingual audio using the same voice</a>. This would drive interesting applications for travel, media and movies, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiiSAvKJIHo&amp;feature=youtu.be">public service initiatives</a>, to name just a few use cases.</p>
<p>There are obvious risks of adaptable speech synthesis systems. Fraudulently impersonating someone—using <a href="https://www.nisos.com/blog/synthetic-audio-deepfake/">audio deepfakes</a>—is becoming trivial and opens up many potential nefarious applications. A <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fraudsters-use-ai-to-mimic-ceos-voice-in-unusual-cybercrime-case-11567157402">Wall Street Journal article</a> described how fraudsters were able to impersonate the voice of an executive and demand a wire transfer. As the technology becomes more sophisticated, blackhat users likely will become more sophisticated as well.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div itemprop="articleBody"> <p>This series is about me learning something in my spare time. More specifically, it’s about me learning quantum mechanics, as a way of getting back into physics, and as a way of making good science.</p> <p>I’ll explain: I have recently started a PhD in machine learning at the University of Geneva. The main project I’ll be working on is about applying machine learning and statistical methods to physics, mainly high energy physics (HEP) and solar astronomy. I am part of a very strong multidisciplinary team of physicists and AI people, so I could probably do without a strong physics background. Still, I feel like that can’t hurt, right?</p> <p>So there you have it: I want to study and understand physics in order to do better research.</p> <p>But that’s not the whole story. I also love physics, and I have tortured myself over and over as to whether I should have majored in physics rather that CS during my university career. This is not to say that I am any good at it. I only had one big physics exam during my bachelor (topics were kinematics, some classical mechanics, electromagnetism), and all the rest of my knowledge is made of bits and pieces coming from random youtube lectures and non-technical books I have read over the years. So yeah, it’s finally time to get serious.</p> <h3 id="why-start-with-quantum-mechanics"> <a href="#why-start-with-quantum-mechanics"></a> Why start with Quantum Mechanics? </h3> <p>Because I find it exciting, and that’s probably enough. Starting with classical mechanics would likely bore me to death. I know QM is not easy or intuitive, and that math can get hard. However, I don’t feel completely ill-equipped. Thanks to my engineering and ML background, I know one thing or two about probabilities, linear algebra, Fourier series and complex numbers, which I have been told are a substantial part of the required background.</p> <h3 id="what-is-your-study-method"> <a href="#what-is-your-study-method"></a> What is your study method? </h3> <p>I usually try to be extremely deliberate about my study method. I won’t go into the details here, but I use active recall and spatial repetition tools such as Anki so that remembering what I study is no longer a random event but a purposeful act. There are many interesting resources about such techniques, such as <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">this</a>, and <a href="https://aliabdaal.com/spacedrepetition/">this</a>. Michael Nielsen has even developed an <a href="https://quantum.country/qcvc">introduction to quantum computing</a> delivered in a “new mnemonic medium which makes it almost effortless to remember what you read” (hint: it’s active recall and spaced repetition).</p> <p>As for the learning resources, I have chosen two introductory books: one is from the theoretical minimum series from the great Leonard Susskind. This is supposed to be a very simple introduction, starting from first principles. I have already flipped through the pages, and there actually seems to be quite a lot of content, or at least more than you would expect from a book of this kind.</p> <p>The second book it more technical, and it comes up over and over as a suggestion for learning QM: Griffiths’ Introduction to Quantum Mechanics. Honestly, here I have no idea what to expect.</p> <p>So here’t the plan: I’ll go through both books simultaneously and try to solve most exercises. I’ll also create flashcards and diagrams of the concepts, and let Anki do the rest. Additionally, I’ll write this blog series, which hopefully helps me understand things better. So if you are here to learn, don’t just count on my writing.</p> <h3 id="requirements"> <a href="#requirements"></a> Requirements </h3> <p>The requirements are basic linear algebra and basic probability. And complex numbers. Some notions of classical physics can also help.</p> <hr> <h2 id="spins-and-qubits"> <a href="#spins-and-qubits"></a> Spins and Qubits </h2> <p>The fact that we cannot fully grasp some things about the inner workings of our universe should come at no surprise. After all, we evolved to survive, not to understand. Ok yes, we have a strong intuition for many classical-mechanical things, but the reason is that things that behave classically are closer to our experience than things that behave relativistically or in a quantum mechanical way. So what we can do here is simple: let’s just go with the math and with the experiment. I don’t expect any of the concepts I encounter to be “relatable”. I am going to trust the result of the experiments, and link that to the math which hopefully explains them. And I’ll start with the <strong>spin</strong>.</p> <p>Sooo, the spin is an extra degree of freedom that some particle have (all of them? I don’t know).</p> <p>This spin is a very quantum mechanical concept, which is why trying to visualize it classically would miss the point.</p> <p>Now, the spin of a particle is a quantum systems on its own right. In fact, it’s the “simplest and the most quantum of systems”, according to Susskind. Just by going through a very simple experiment involving the spin, we can already start to notice some important differences between classical physics and quantum mechanics.</p> <p>The experiment involves a measuring system, which we call $\mathcal{A}$, that records the state of the spin of our system (we’ll call it $\sigma$). We can orient the measuring apparatus in order to measure this “something” along a specified axis. As a test, we rotate the apparatus along the $z$-axis, and notice that our measurement has the value of $1$ or $-1$.</p> <p>Now, if we reset the apparatus to measure again the spin along the $z$-axis, and assume the simple evolution law</p><p> \[\sigma(n+1) = \sigma(n)\] </p><p>which tells us that the state of the system remains unchanged through time, then the previous measurement should be confirmed, again and again. We say that the measurement of a state <strong>prepares the system.</strong></p> <p>In quantum experiments, performing the same measurement repeatedly gives the same answer until the system is prepared differently. We will see this in more detail now.</p> <p>After we have prepared the system in the state $\sigma_z = 1$, let’s now rotate the apparatus of, say, 90 degrees, and measure the spin along the $x$-axis. Something weird happens. Sometimes we get +1, sometimes we get -1. It looks like the result is no longer deterministic, but in some peculiar way. In fact, if we repeat the experiment multiple times, we find that the average value of the measurement along the $x$-axis is $0$.</p> <p>In fact, this is generalizable to any direction. We can pick any direction $\hat{m}$ and prepare a spin so that the apparatus measures a $+1$ in that direction. Then, we rotate the apparatus to any other direction $\hat{n}$. Again, the result of the measurement will still be either $+1$ or $-1$, but the expected value will be equal to the projection of $\hat{m}$ over $\hat{n}$ , that is, $\cos{\theta}$, with $\theta$ being the angle between the vectors.</p> <p>In <em>bra-ket notation</em> (we’ll talk about this more in detail)<em>:</em></p><p> \[\langle{\sigma}\rangle = \hat{m} \cdot\hat{n} = \cos{\theta}\] </p><p>Notice that this is the same result that we would expect in classical physics for some vector quantity that we measure. However, in the classical sense, the result would be deterministic. In QM, the result is statistically random, but the average converges to the classical result.</p> <h2 id="vector-spaces-inner-products-bases"> <a href="#vector-spaces-inner-products-bases"></a> Vector spaces, inner products, bases. </h2> <p>In quantum mechanics the space of the states is a vector space. We call vectors <em>ket.</em> This is a <em>ket:</em> $\vert a\rangle$. Some simple axioms are defined in this space: the sum of two kets is a ket, ket addition is commutative and associative, and some other things like the existence of a 0 vector, an additive inverse, and linearity. Up to this point, everything looks normal, and the vector space we have defined is practically the same as the space of 3-vectors in Euclidean space. However, the space of our <em>kets</em> is a complex vector space, made of complex numbers, and where the multiplication by a scalar value also extends to complex numbers! This is a very abstract concept, but it’s absolutely needed to make the theory work mathematically.</p> <p>Now, if you know something about complex vector, you will likely remember about the complex conjugate. Briefly, given a complex number $z$, there exists a complex conjugate $z^*$ that we obtain by reversing the sign of the imaginary part. So if $z=x+iy = re^{i\theta}$, then $z^*=x-iy = re^{-i\theta}$. Note that the product of a complex number and its complex conjugate is always positive, yielding $r^2$ in our case.</p> <p>In the same way, a complex vector space has a <em>dual</em> space that is its complex conjugate vector space. In our case, for every <em>ket</em> $\vert A\rangle$, we can define a <em>bra</em> vector in that dual space: $\langle A \vert$, which is essentially its complex conjugate.</p> <p>Now, if you got up to this point, I am pretty sure you remember about dot-products in Euclidean space, right? Well, that dot-product is a specific instance of so-called <em>inner products,</em> which we can also define in our complex space. In out quantum-mechanical magical world, the inner product is defined between a <em>bra</em> and a <em>ket</em>, and the notation is</p><p> \[\langle B|A \rangle\] </p><p>and, of course, the result is a complex number. These products are linear, and interchanging bras and kets corresponds to complex conjugation</p><p> \[\langle B|A \rangle = \langle A|B \rangle ^*\] </p><p>Concretely, the product is performed in the exact same way as for the dot-product: sum of the products of the components.</p> <p>We can also bring with us some familiar concepts from Euclidean spaces:</p> <ul> <li>A vector is <em>normalized</em> if its inner products with itself is 1.</li> <li>Two vectors are <em>orthogonal</em> if their inner products is 0.</li> </ul> <p>In our vector space, we can also define a <em>basis</em>, which is simply a set of vector that can be used to derive any other vector in the space through linear combinations. It’s often useful, and it is especially in QM, to talk about <em>orthonormal bases</em>, which are <em>bases</em> where the vectors are normalized and orthogonal between each other. Note that the number of vectors in a <em>basis</em> is equivalent to the dimension of the space.</p> <h3 id="quantum-states"> <a href="#quantum-states"></a> Quantum States </h3> <p>With some math tools under our belt, let’s try to formalize the notion of a <em>spin state</em> from earlier. For this task, we will use vectors, and create a representation that captures what we know about how spins behave.</p> <p>Let’s start but labelling all the possible spin states along the three axes. When the apparatus $\mathcal{A}$ is oriented along the $z$-axis, the two possible states are $\sigma_z = …</p></div></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I write a lot of bash scripts for both my day job and my personal projects, and while they are functional, bash scripts always seem to lack that structure that I want, especially when compared to writing something in Go or C#. The main problem I have with bash scripts is that when I use functions, I lose the ability to log things.</p>

<p>For example the <code>get_config_path</code> function will print the path to the configuration file, which will get consumed by the <code>do_work</code> function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>get_config_path<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>echo</span> <span>"Finding Machine Configurtaion"</span>

  <span>if</span> <span>[</span> <span>-n</span> <span>"</span><span>$CONFIG_PATH</span><span>"</span> <span>]</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>[</span> <span>-e</span> <span>"</span><span>$CONFIG_PATH</span><span>"</span> <span>]</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span>
    <span># echo "Using Configuration from environment"</span>
    <span>echo</span> <span>"</span><span>$CONFIG_PATH</span><span>"</span>
    <span>return
  fi

  if</span> <span>[</span> <span>-e</span> <span>"~/.config/demo/config.toml"</span> <span>]</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span>
    <span># echo "Using Configuration directory file"</span>
    <span>echo</span> <span>"~/.config/demo/config.toml"</span>
    <span>return
  fi</span>

  <span># echo "Unable to find configuration"</span>
  <span>exit </span>1
<span>}</span>

do_work<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>local</span> <span>-r</span> <span>config</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>get_config_path<span>)</span>

  <span># actual work...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The problem is, if I include the <code>echo</code> statements which are log lines, the <code>config</code> variable in the <code>do_work</code> function will contain them too.</p>

<p>In the past, this has caused me to use functions in bash very sparingly; usually with things that are short that I don’t need to add much logging to.  However, I was recently building some AMIs, and happened to be browsing the <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-consul">Consul</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-vault">Vault</a> terraform module source, which uses several bash scripts which are written in a different style, which makes them vastly more maintainable.</p>

<p>So let’s have a look at the new structure I use, which is heavily based off these scripts.</p>

<h2 id="better-bash-scripts">Better Bash Scripts</h2>

<p>Before we get to the implementation, make sure you are using <a href="https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/">ShellCheck</a> it provides static analysis of your scripts, pointing out many things like missing quotes, or incorrectly handling arrays.  It has plugins for all your favourite editors too.</p>

<h3 id="0-general-styles-and-constructs">0. General Styles and Constructs</h3>

<p>All variables should be declared <code>readonly</code>, and <code>local</code> if possible, to help prevent surprise values from being present if other functions forget to do the same.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#top level</span>
<span>readonly </span><span>SCRIPT_NAME</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>basename</span> <span>"</span><span>$0</span><span>"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span>

some_method<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span># within a method</span>
  <span>local</span> <span>-r</span> <span>config_path</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Functions should assign their passed arguments to named variables as the first thing they do, preferably matching the variable name they are passed, which helps later when you are searching through a script for usages of “config_file” and not having to find other names/aliases for the same value.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>read_config<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>local</span> <span>-r</span> <span>config_file</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span>
  <span>local</span> <span>-r</span> <span>skip_validation</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$2</span><span>"</span>

  <span># ...</span>
<span>}</span>

invoke<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span># ...</span>

  read_config <span>"</span><span>$config_file</span><span>"</span> <span>"</span><span>$skip_validation</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="1-error-handling">1. Error Handling</h3>

<p>It should go without saying, but you really need to start your scripts with the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#!/bin/bash

set -euo pipefail;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are <a href="https://vaneyckt.io/posts/safer_bash_scripts_with_set_euxo_pipefail/">many better articles</a> on what these specifically do, but suffice to say:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>e</code> causes the script to stop on errors</li>
  <li><code>u</code> causes it to error on undefined variables being used</li>
  <li><code>o pipefail</code> causes a non-zero exit code from any command in a pipeline to fail the script too (rather than just the last command.)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-logging">2. Logging</h3>

<p>The real advantage of this structure is we get to have log statements! This is achieved by doing all logging to <code>stderr</code> instead of <code>stdout</code>.  We use a standardised <code>log</code> function across all the scripts, which also includes the script’s name so when calling other scripts you can see which one wrote the log line:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>readonly </span><span>SCRIPT_NAME</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>basename</span> <span>"</span><span>$0</span><span>"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span>

log<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>local</span> <span>-r</span> <span>level</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span>
  <span>local</span> <span>-r</span> <span>message</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$2</span><span>"</span>
  <span>local</span> <span>-r</span> <span>timestamp</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span><span>date</span> +<span>"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"</span><span>)</span>

  <span>&gt;</span>&amp;2 <span>echo</span> <span>-e</span> <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>timestamp</span><span>}</span><span> [</span><span>${</span><span>level</span><span>}</span><span>] [</span><span>$SCRIPT_NAME</span><span>] </span><span>${</span><span>message</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Invoking the function is <code>log "INFO" "Some status"</code> or <code>log "WARN" "Something concerning"</code> etc.</p>

<h3 id="3-error-checking">3. Error Checking</h3>

<p>We have some standard assertion functions which are used by the script when starting up to validate arguments:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>assert_not_empty<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>local</span> <span>-r</span> <span>arg_name</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span>
  <span>local</span> <span>-r</span> <span>arg_value</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$2</span><span>"</span>

  <span>if</span> <span>[[</span> <span>-z</span> <span>"</span><span>$arg_value</span><span>"</span> <span>]]</span><span>;</span> <span>then
    </span>log <span>"ERROR"</span> <span>"The value for '</span><span>$arg_name</span><span>' cannot be empty"</span>
    <span>exit </span>1
  <span>fi</span>
<span>}</span>

assert_is_installed<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>local</span> <span>-r</span> <span>name</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span>

  <span>if</span> <span>[[</span> <span>!</span> <span>$(</span><span>command</span> <span>-v</span> <span>"</span><span>$name</span><span>"</span><span>)</span> <span>]]</span><span>;</span> <span>then
    </span>log <span>"ERROR"</span> <span>"The binary '</span><span>$name</span><span>' is required by this script but is not installed or in the system's PATH."</span>
    <span>exit </span>1
  <span>fi</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="4-argument-parsing">4. Argument parsing</h3>

<p>When scripts need to take parameters in, I prefer to use long-flag style, as they are little more readable for people checking invocations again in the future.  This function is usually always called <code>run</code>, and is the last function defined, and is invoked immediately after definition, passing in all script arguments (<code>run "<a href="https://andydote.co.uk/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="153155">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>"</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>run<span>()</span> <span>{</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The validation uses the <code>assert_not_empty</code> function defined above, which is used in two ways: after the <code>while</code> loop to check mandatory values have been filled in, and within the <code>case</code> statement for optional flags values.</p>

<p>We also use <code>assert_is_installed</code> to validate that utilities we need are installed, such as <code>vault</code>, <code>openssl</code> and <code>jq</code></p>

<p>The <code>print_usage</code> function is just a set of <code>echo</code> statements giving all the flags, and an example of invokation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>print_usage<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>echo
  echo</span> <span>"Usage: </span><span>$SCRIPT_NAME</span><span> [OPTIONS]"</span>
  <span>echo
  echo</span> <span>"This script creates a new certiticate, and it installs it into the right namespace"</span>
  <span>echo
  echo</span> <span>"Options:"</span>
  <span>echo
  echo</span> <span>-e</span> <span>"  --namespace</span><span>\t</span><span>The namespace to install the certificate in"</span>
  <span>echo</span> <span>-e</span> <span>"  --suffix</span><span>\t</span><span>An optional suffix for the hostname"</span>
  <span>echo</span> <span>-e</span> <span>"  --dry-run</span><span>\t</span><span>Don't install the certificate"</span>
  <span>echo
  echo</span> <span>"Example:"</span>
  <span>echo
  echo</span> <span>"  </span><span>$SCRIPT_NAME</span><span> --namespace test --dry-run"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>I keep a single template file which has all of this written into it, and new scripts start off with a copy-paste of the template.  Could it be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>er? Sure, but then I have to deal with dependency management, and it’s just not worth the hassle and overhead.</p>

        <p>Continuing from <a href="https://adrian-salajan.github.io/blog/2021/01/25/images-functor">image editing with Functors</a>, we will now understand Applicative by editing images with it.</p>

<h3 id="applicative">Applicative</h3>
<p>An applicative is composed of 2 things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A function which can wrap any value <code>A</code> with the context <code>F</code>. <code>pure(a: A): F[A]</code>. So it must be that <code>pure</code> knows what the <code>F</code> context means.</li>
  <li>One of the two functions which are equivalent to each other (can rewrite one in terms of the other + <code>pure</code>):
    <ul>
      <li><code>map2(a: F[A], b: F[B], f: (A, B) =&gt; C): F[C]</code></li>
      <li><code>app(f: F[A =&gt; B], a: F[A]): F[B]</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Below <code>app</code> is used with the enhanced syntax:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>fab</span><span>.</span><span>app</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>A</span><span>])</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>B</span><span>]</span>
<span>//where fab is of type F[A =&gt; B]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This structure must obey the laws:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identity</li>
</ul>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>F</span><span>.</span><span>pure</span><span>((</span><span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>A</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span><span>).</span><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>fa</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>fa</span></code></pre></figure>

<ul>
  <li>Homomorphism</li>
</ul>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>F</span><span>.</span><span>pure</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>).</span><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>F</span><span>.</span><span>pure</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>))</span> <span>==</span> <span>F</span><span>.</span><span>pure</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>))</span></code></pre></figure>

<ul>
  <li>Interchange</li>
</ul>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>ff</span><span>.</span><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>F</span><span>.</span><span>pure</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>))</span> <span>==</span> <span>F</span><span>.</span><span>pure</span><span>((</span><span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>A</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>B</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)).</span><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>ff</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<ul>
  <li>Composition</li>
</ul>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>val</span> <span>compose</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>B</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>C</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>A</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>B</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>A</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>C</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>_</span><span>.</span><span>compose</span>
<span>F</span><span>.</span><span>pure</span><span>(</span><span>compose</span><span>).</span><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>fbc</span><span>).</span><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>fab</span><span>).</span><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>fa</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>fbc</span><span>.</span><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>fab</span><span>.</span><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>fa</span><span>))</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>These laws are a bit complicated, so again like Functors we will check them with Cats laws. The tests are more fine 
grained than only these 4 laws so if some fail we will get a better idea what and where to fix.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>checkAll</span><span>(</span><span>"Applicative laws"</span><span>,</span> <span>ApplicativeTests</span><span>(</span><span>Image</span><span>.</span><span>imApplicative</span><span>).</span><span>applicative</span><span>[</span><span>Int</span>, <span>Int</span>, <span>String</span><span>])</span></code></pre></figure>

<h4 id="map2">Map2</h4>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>map2</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>A</span><span>],</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>B</span><span>],</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>C</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>C</span><span>]`</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This says it can merge two contexts. The <code>f</code> function knows how to merge A and B into a new value C,
but <code>map2</code> knows (just like <code>pure</code>) about what the <code>F</code> context means, so it actually knows to merge both contexts together.
We can replace the word “context” with “effect”:  map2 knows how to merge two effects.</p>

<h4 id="apply">Apply</h4>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>app</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>A</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>B</span><span>],</span> <span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>A</span><span>])</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>B</span><span>]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This is more tricky to understand intuitively but given a function/program wrapped in the context/effect <code>F</code>,
we can run the program with the value in <code>a: F[A]</code>.
Not to be confused with the functor’s <code>map(a: F[A], f: A =&gt; B): F[B]</code> - there is an extra <code>F</code> over <code>f</code> in apply.</p>

<p>Because <code>apply</code> also gets as input two <code>F</code>s and returns only one it means that it also knows how to merge these <code>F</code>s (just like <code>map2</code>)</p>

<h4 id="map2-vs-apply">Map2 vs Apply</h4>
<p>So what is the difference? Formally none because we can write one in terms of the other + pure</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>def</span> <span>map2</span><span>[</span><span>F</span><span>[</span><span>_</span><span>]</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>B</span>, <span>C</span><span>](</span><span>fa</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>A</span><span>],</span> <span>fb</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>B</span><span>],</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>C</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>C</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>val</span> <span>one</span> <span>=</span> <span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>pure</span><span>(</span><span>f</span> <span>curried</span><span>))(</span><span>fa</span><span>)</span>
  <span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>one</span><span>)(</span><span>fb</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>def</span> <span>apply</span><span>[</span><span>A</span>, <span>B</span><span>](</span><span>ff</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>A</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>B</span><span>])(</span><span>fa</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>A</span><span>])</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>B</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>map2</span><span>(</span><span>ff</span><span>,</span> <span>fa</span><span>)((</span><span>f</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>))</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>So it’s clear that both <code>map2</code> and <code>apply</code> know how to merge F contexts/effects, but what about the difference in signatures?</p>

<p><code>ff: F[A =&gt; B]</code> from <code>apply</code> is the partial application of <code>f: (A, B) =&gt; C</code> from <code>map2</code> with <code>a: F[A]</code>.
It kinda holds a <code>F[A]</code> inside. More precisely it’s a program which ran with input A will produce a F[B].
We’ll see this below on images.</p>

<h4 id="applicative-is-also-a-functor">Applicative is also a Functor</h4>
<p>The complete name is: <a href="http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/Applicative.pdf">applicative functor</a>.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>def</span> <span>map</span><span>[</span><span>A</span>, <span>B</span><span>](</span><span>fa</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>A</span><span>])(</span><span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>A</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>B</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>[</span><span>B</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>pure</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>))(</span><span>fa</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>But functor is not an applicative, functor does not have <code>pure</code> so it does not know as much about what <code>F</code> means.</p>

<h4 id="applicative-on-images">Applicative on images</h4>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>implicit</span> <span>val</span> <span>imApplicative</span><span>:</span> <span>Applicative</span><span>[</span><span>Image</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Applicative</span><span>[</span><span>Image</span><span>]</span> <span>{</span>

      <span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Given F is an Image it means we can combine any 2 images, pixel by pixel. Of course, if we can combine 2 images we can also combine any N images.</p>

<h3 id="getting-more-intuition-on-map2-and-apply">Getting more intuition on Map2 and Apply</h3>

<p>We define a program in our F (Image), which will generate a checkers-like pattern.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala">    <span>def</span> <span>checkerPattern</span><span>:</span> <span>Image</span><span>[</span><span>Color</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Color</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>

            <span>else</span> <span>c</span>
        <span>}</span>
      <span>)</span>
    <span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We will run this program giving it as input the original bird image, and we get</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>checkerPattern</span><span>)(</span><span>bird</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><img src="https://adrian-salajan.github.io/assets/posts/applicative-image/colorifyBird3.png" alt="checkers-bird"></p>

<p>Now let’s create the same result with map2.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>map2</span><span>(</span><span>bird</span><span>,</span> <span>checkerPattern</span><span>)((</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>b</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>))</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><img src="https://adrian-salajan.github.io/assets/posts/applicative-image/colorifyBirdPlusNoBird3.png" alt="checkers-bird"></p>

<p>I’m going to repeat myself because this is awesome:<br>
<code>ff: F[A =&gt; B]</code> from <code>apply</code> is the partial application of <code>f: (A, B) =&gt; C</code> from <code>map2</code> with <code>a: F[A]</code>,
<strong>it kinda holds a <code>F[A]</code> inside</strong>. We can even extract this core image from our checkerPattern program in order to see it by giving it the transparent color:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>checkerPattern</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>c</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>c</span><span>(</span><span>Color</span><span>.</span><span>Clear</span><span>))</span>
<span>//OR</span>
<span>ap</span><span>(</span><span>checkerPattern</span><span>)(</span><span>pure</span><span>(</span><span>Color</span><span>.</span><span>Clear</span><span>))</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><img src="https://adrian-salajan.github.io/assets/posts/applicative-image/checker.png" alt="checkers"></p>

<p>And one more fun example, combined with the bird image:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala">    <span>def</span> <span>psychedelics</span><span>:</span> <span>Image</span><span>[</span><span>Color</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Color</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>

<p><img src="https://adrian-salajan.github.io/assets/posts/applicative-image/psychedelicsBird.png" alt="checkers"></p>

<p>And the core image embedded in the <code>F[A =&gt; B]</code></p>

<p><img src="https://adrian-salajan.github.io/assets/posts/applicative-image/psychedelics.png" alt="checkers"></p>

<p>In the next post of this series we will see new effects done with the help of other structures from category theory, maybe monad or contravariant functor.</p>

      <p>I don’t think any little girl grows up with the goal of “I want to be an OSS Android browser developer” and to be totally honest, even as an adult I just kind of fell into it. I first joined Mozilla as an intern during my change-career journey mainly because I had taken one Android class, knew some Java, and applied on a whim at the right time to hit the recruiter’s inbox. Despite not actively seeking Mozilla or Android out, I immediately fell in love with the project and team and knew I had stumbled into a very special place. The problems were interesting, I had opportunities for leadership and growth from the start, and the people were kind, smart, and supportive.</p>

<p>At Mozilla you’ll meet the smartest and most passionate people who could be tech leaders at any other major company (and almost certainly make more money) but are choosing to work specifically on Firefox because they believe in the product and the mission. It’s definitely intimidating to come in as an intern to one of the original “software companies” but everyone I’ve met is truly wonderful and welcoming. It was (mostly) fun to be the underdog and celebrate our wins, large and small alike. I felt connected to the mission and the products we were creating. I felt like I had a large impact in my team after only a short amount of time (most teams are quite small and tight-knit). The fans and the community were passionate and many times I had the cool experience of wearing a Firefox t-shirt in public and people thanking me for my work (now that I’m writing this, it feels a bit odd. I guess you had to be there).</p>

<p>So if it’s so great then why am I leaving? I know it’s not a satisfying answer, verging on cliche, but I’m just looking to do something new. That and.. I am also extremely burnt out. The very small mobile team has been through a gauntlet in order to ship a full rewrite of the flagship Firefox for Android browser (partly during the pandemic no less). Working too much during the week for the last 2 years was normal for me and while never asked for from my team, I cared deeply about the product and the success and it would have been impossible to hit our deadlines and ship something I was proud of without it. And when we finally did ship, I WAS proud of our team and what we had accomplished, but the release just felt like a blip in our planned schedule before jumping into more sprints and fires and thinking about the next iteration.</p>

<p>I did take one week of PTO right after our release! … which just so happened to be the week that the large layoffs happened. I was safe from layoffs, but morale plummeted, and I was definitely not refreshed. The cherry on top was being specifically targeted for harassment that same week after the release by unhappy users of Firefox looking for someone to direct their frustrations at<sup><a href="#myfootnote1">1</a></sup>. There’s nothing that Mozilla really could have done in this scenario, but it left a terrible taste in my mouth after all of the blood, sweat, and tears I had put into this project. For someone who thought of themselves as an empathetic dev overworking myself FOR the end users and product, this hurt and I’m not sure I ever really recovered. While the pace is slowing down now and there’s a promise of no more deadline crunches, I just feel that I haven’t been able to catch my breath no matter how much time I take off. Whether that’s the project, pandemic fatigue, or all of the above, I’m very ready for a break, a fresh start, and a change of pace.</p>

<p>Working in open source full-time has been an incredible experience that has had its extreme ups and downs. On the positive side, I’ve loved mentoring new contributors to get their first open source PR merged. I’ve enjoyed all the positive interactions with the lovely community volunteers who care as much about making the product better as I do. On the negative side, it has become increasingly hard for me to separate work from not work. I found myself “contributing” (read - working) at all hours of the day. Replying to issues, emails, and public chats when I was in bed at midnight, when I just woke up at 7am, in the car on the way to go hiking on the weekend, and then while ON the hike. This might be a me problem, but boundary setting when there’s a public repo always getting new issues, comments, emails, and chatroom messages was difficult for me. And of course not all of those messages are nice; the constant stream of negative comments from unhappy and rude users during the work week and outside of it was extremely draining. Besides politicians, this might be one of the only jobs where you can wake up to an inbox full of emails and messages about how much everyone thinks you suck at your job. You definitely grow a thick skin quickly, but it’s still exhausting.</p>

<p>I think a lot of people tend to forget that Mozilla was also my very first job in tech. I learned so much there and there’s always more I could learn, but it’s good to try new experiences and face new problems, especially early in my career. I will be forever grateful for the experiences I’ve had at Mozilla and the people I’ve met. It was my “big break” into tech and I will never forget that! I will keep using and supporting Firefox and take a lot of the Mozilla ideals with me wherever I go. My experience was super formative for how I view ethics, privacy, and other important issues inside the tech space.</p>

<p>I am excited about my break and my next adventure but I’m definitely very sad to be leaving Mozilla and the wonderful people. The (good) problem with working with people who are true friends is it’s painful when people leave, including yourself. I will miss everyone dearly, especially all of my mobile team peers. I hope you all stay in touch and our paths cross again once conferences are a thing again (or maybe I’ll just crash the next All Hands, I’m not above it). If you’re at Mozilla and want to say goodbye, please ping me in the next 2 weeks! I’ve also heard I’m quite easy to find online! 😉</p>

<p>Love you all ❤️ XOXO</p>

<p><a name="myfootnote1">1</a>: EDIT: Saw this made it onto Hacker News and people in the comments were doubting this harassment happened. Classic. I documented it well on my Twitter at the time, but I’m happy to give more context. I tweeted around the time of release that I was proud of the team for all our hard work and I’m not “worrying about the haters” with a photo of me drinking a beer and flipping off the camera. I never referenced users. “Haters” is just a saying that the youngins say that isn’t specific but according to the internet, <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hater-4589594">“a hater is a slang term used in everyday language and especially online to describe an individual who talks and behaves negatively in response to other people’s success and goal achievement.”</a> It was a light-hearted joke for my Twitter friends after a year of hard work and constant negativity. In response this tweet was posted all over Reddit and 4chan and then there were coordinated doxxing attacks, multiple 4chan threads full of violent sexual and death threats, troll PRs opened in our repo, all of my photos pulled off of my Instagram and posted into these threads with disgusting commentary, and actual calls to my work from fake “journalists” to try to get me fired. I’m not going to post the comments here because they make me sick but feel free to search the archives to see for yourself. If you think this is ever an appropriate response to a dev on the team telling a joke online, I can’t help you.</p>

<p><span><span>Important News!&nbsp; February 4, 2021</span></span></p>

<p justify="" text-align:=""><span><span>First the good news. The repairing/rebuilding of Aurora Clocks will likely continue for many years.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Now some&nbsp;bad news.&nbsp; We just sold the last of the new cases we used for&nbsp;new Auroras.&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>The availability of new Auroras are becoming&nbsp;problematic. Here's the story.&nbsp; For 60 years one&nbsp;company, Hansen motors,&nbsp; has been manufacturing the motor and&nbsp;"special"&nbsp;movements for the Aurora.&nbsp; Hansen was bought&nbsp;a couple of years ago and the new owners have decided to discontinue production of all&nbsp;clock&nbsp;movements.&nbsp; The movement is a&nbsp;gear-train that moves&nbsp;the hour and minute hands.&nbsp; They will continue making the motors which will allow us to keep doing repairs for a long time.&nbsp; And more good news, &nbsp;95% of the&nbsp;movements never fail even after 40 years.&nbsp; They just need a little oil every 25 years.&nbsp; So that's the "movement news, but there is more....</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Other partially good news, I have about 140 of new Aurora movements, but now&nbsp;another problem,&nbsp;I &nbsp;don't feel like&nbsp;investing another $16,000 in a batch of new Aurora cases to go with those movements without some encouragement.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Last time this happened was 10 years ago.&nbsp;Here is a similar plan to what I did then.&nbsp; If enough customers send&nbsp;in $100 deposits/clock we will&nbsp;put them back in production. And I would not cash the checks until I had decided to go ahead. And they would only be charged $459 more for each Aurora + shipping.&nbsp; Last time, about 25 customers sent in checks for about 30 Auroras so I went ahead.&nbsp; It takes about 4 months from ordering new Aurora cases to shipping your clocks to you.  And it way take 2-4 months to get enought deposit checks.</span></span></span></span></p>
			<p><span><span><span><span>For your reference, since new Auroras were becoming scarce I was raising the price during the last month of production.  The last ones were sold for $699 plus shipping.  So the customer sending in deposit checks will be saving between $100 to $140/clock. </span></span></span></span></p>
			<p><span><span><span><span>The world keeps changing.&nbsp; But I am Mr. Persistent, a.k.a. Barry Gamble.&nbsp; Take care my friends.  Hey, I just get my 1st COVID vaccine shot yesterday.  Yea!</span></span></span></span></p>

</h2>

				<p>So, on my desk I often have a desktop computer and a laptop. I've got a decent HDMI/USB <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVM_switch">KVM switch</a> so I can flip my big monitor, keyboard and mouse between the two, and that's great.</p>

<p>However, I also have a hi-fi amplifier and speakers for audio output. This is hooked up to the desktop PC, and has selectable inputs, one of which is connected to a lead for the laptop - but I rarely plug the laptop in. This is because I can only select one input on the amplifier; and although I'm usually only listening to media from one device, I want to be able to hear notification pings from either. So I tend to leave the laptop on its own nasty little speakers and only have nice audio from the desktop PC.</p>

<p>Clearly, this sucks. Many years ago I had a cheapo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixing_console">mixing console</a> that sat on my desk, with my CD player, minidisc player, and PC connected to the inputs, outputting into my amplifier; it was cool to be able to just hit play on anything and hear the result through my good speakers, and having all those knobs and sliders to play with was definitely gratifying. However, it was bulky, full of useless-to-me features like phono inputs and cross faders, and eventually died a death from being left switched on all the time.</p>

<p>Plus, I'd recently <a href="https://www.snell-pym.org.uk/archives/2020/11/09/electronics-projects/">resolved to do more electronics</a>, so there was only one thing to do: Make a mixer.</p>

<p><a href="https://snell-pym.org.uk/photos2/2021-02-09%20The_Polyp_Mixer.html"><img src="https://snell-pym.org.uk/photos2/2021-02-09%20The_Polyp_Mixer-medium.jpeg" alt="The Polyp Mixer"></a></p>



<p>My requirements are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Physically small; desk space is precious. In the long run I will probably mount it underneath a shelf when I build my custom desk so it takes up zero footprint, which means it needs to have controls on the front and sockets on the back, and ideally have the bare minimum of cross-sectional area required to fit those controls and sockets.</li>
<li>Sound good. I'm no audiophile, but I don't want it to be the weak link in the audio chain. I am very much a beginner at analogue electronic design, but I wanted to do a good job of this rather than blindly following some design off the Internet and risking it sounding bad.</li>
<li>Four line level inputs, so I have room for growth. I mainly have two inputs on the desk, but I plan to add a radio transceiver in the near future which would make it three, and adding one more for experiments makes it a nice round number.</li>
<li>12v DC power, as I'm standardising on that for a number of upcoming infrastructure projects.</li>
<li>Adjustable volume for each channel, so I can fiddle with knobs.</li>
</ol>

<p>There's no need for cross-faders, tone controls, phono inputs, a separate headphone mixer for DJs to cue up the next track, VU meters, or even a master volume knob (I can just use the one on the actual amplifier).</p>

<p>So, I set out searching the Internet and scouring my books, and came up with a design.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>I had to learn a whole bunch of stuff to design this, so I'm going to share what I learned. I'm assuming that, like me, you know electronics basics such as what components basically do, the kind of DC digital/power electronics required to light up LEDs and all that, but are new to analogue stuff.</p>

<h3>Op Amps</h3>

<p>I'll defer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_amplifier">Wikipedia</a> for deeper details, but the TL;DR version is that the op-amp has two inputs (+ and -) and an output, and the output voltage is some large number (the "open loop gain", typically a hundred thousand or so) times the voltage at + minus the voltage at -. Subject to loads of caveats about the + and - voltages being between the power supply voltages minus some headroom, and the output can't go beyond the power supply voltages minus some headroom, and so on. But if the input voltages are both well between the power supply voltages, and the difference between them times the open loop gain is also well between the power supply voltages, and nothing is changing too fast, then the simple rule holds.</p>

<p>But a gain of one hundred thousand is excessive for many applications, not to mention that the gain varies with temperature and frequency and all sorts of other random stuff we don't want our circuit sensitive to, so these are used as building blocks to make actual useful amplifiers.</p>

<p>The simplest way of doing this is to observe that if we connect the output back to the - input and feed a voltage into the + input, the op amp will try its hardest to make the output voltage almost equal the input voltage on the + input. If the output voltage is at all below the + input, then because that lower voltage is fed into the - input, there will be a positive difference, the output voltage will be pushed up. If the output voltage is below the + input, then the difference will be negative, and the output voltage will be pushed down. If they are exactly equal then the difference will be zero, which also pushes the output voltage down - but if the output voltage is just a tiny fraction (the output voltage divided by that large open-loop gain) below the + input voltage it'll just balance out. This is called a "unit-gain buffer" or "voltage follower" because it basically copies a voltage.</p>

<p>Why's that useful?</p>

<p>Well, another important trait of op amps is their impedance. The input looks like a very large (megaohms) resistor to ground, so when it's connected to a circuit, it doesn't draw much current and doesn't affect the circuit much; it just quietly samples its voltage, like a multimeter. However, the output can provide a reasonable amount of current when it tries to produce the desired output voltage, so it can drive loads that consume actual power. This means a unit-gain buffer can be used to measure the voltage in a circuit without influencing it, driving something that needs that voltage but will consume some power. This is why amplifiers are used in audio to drive speakers!</p>

<h3>Inverting Amplifier</h3>

<p>After the unit-gain buffer, the next simplest op amp circuit is the inverting amplifier, and it's perhaps the most useful.</p>

<p>So, imagine you have two inputs, A and B. If you feed B straight into the + input of an op amp, just like with the unit-gain buffer, but then make a potential divider out of two identical R-ohm resistors; connect A to one end; connect the op amp output to the other end; and connect the - input to the middle. Because the - input has that high impedance, so doesn't draw current from the circuit and just looks at the voltage, the - input will always be at a voltage exactly halfway between the output voltage and voltage A.</p>

<p>As before, if this midpoint voltage is below B it will be pushed up by the op-amp increasing the output voltage and if it's above B it will be pushed down by the op-amp decreasing the output voltage, and the output voltage will only be steady when the midpoint voltage is just a tiny fraction below the voltage at +, which is voltage B. Because that voltage is always the midpoint between A and the output, it means that if A is at 5v and B is at 4v, so the midpoint voltage is 4v, then the output voltage must be 3v.</p>

<p>And if A is at 6v while B is at 4v, the output voltage must be 2v.</p>

<p>So, the output voltage is equal to (2*B)-A.</p>

<p>And because the feedback is through a potential divider, you can vary the resistances to create different effects. If the voltage at the - input, rather than being the exact midpoint because the two resistors are the same, is actually one third of the voltage difference from A to the output because you use 1k ohms between A and the - input and 2k ohms between the - input and the output, then the output voltage will have to swing twice as far to make the - input nearly the same as the + input; the output voltage will be B plus twice B-A. If you swap the resistors around, it'll be B plus half B-A. You can set the gain to whatever you want - the output voltage will be B plus (R2/R1)*(B-A).</p>

<p>Another way of looking at it is with current flows. Remembering that almost zero current flows into the inputs of an op amp, and that the op amp set up with feedback from its output to its - input will try to make its - and + inputs be at the same voltage, we can assume that the - input is at around the same voltage as the + input, voltage B. So the first resistor R1 between A and - has a voltage difference of (A-B) across it, and so some current will flow, (A-B)/R1 (from I=V/R). But that current can't flow into the op-amp so it <em>has</em> to flow into the second resistor R2 and out of the output. If that current is flowing through resistor R2, then the voltage across R2 must be R2<em>(A-B)/R1 (from V=IR). Since the "top" of that resistor is at about voltage B, then the voltage at the "bottom" of that resistor where the output is connected must be at voltage B-R2</em>(A-B)/R1, and if you simplify that, you get B+(R2/R1)*(B-A) volts at the output, as we had before.</p>

<p>However, this also highlights a downside of the inverting amplifier: it draws current from the input, while a bare op-amp input like the unit-gain buffer only draws negligible current. But the good news is, that current is (A-B)/R1 and we get to choose R1; we can choose any input impedance we want by just setting R1, and then choose R2 based on R1 and the gain we want!</p>

<h3>Audio line levels</h3>

<p>So, what exactly comes out of that line-out or headphone-out socket on a computer?</p>

<p>The standard plug is a "3.5mm TRS jack"; TRS because it has three conductors - the Tip, a Ring, and the Sleeve. The Tip is the left channel audio, the Ring is the right channel audio, and the sleeve is the ground reference. We cannot assume that the audio source can provide much current (if it's a headphone jack it probably can, but if it's just a line output it probably can't; and a lot of equipment these days conflates headphone and line outputs), so we need a high impedance input. The voltage on the audio channels will be an AC signal, going above and below the ground reference in voltage, no more than 2 volts peak to peak (so +/- 1v), ranging from about 20Hz to 20kHz for good music reproduction.</p>

<h3>Starting the Mixer Design: Input Amplifiers</h3>

<p>So, the first stage of my mixer needs to be to buffer each input so we present a controlled high load impedance to all the connected audio sources, and then have a …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div>

<p><strong>Update 1:58 AM PT:</strong> <em>Updated the post to clear confusion about how Google’s Safe Browsing feature works.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Apple’s privacy push is much more widespread than it seems at the surface. A perfect example is the new privacy feature in <a href="https://the8-bit.com/ios-14-5-changes/">iOS 14.5 Beta 1 (V2)</a> which redirects Google Safe Browsing traffic through Apple’s own proxy servers to enhance users’ privacy and to not let Google see your IP address. </p>
<p>Google Safe Browsing is a security service created by Google that checks whether a website is malicious. When you access a website on the desktop version of Chrome on your Mac or PC, for instance, Google Safe Browsing checks if a website is safe to browse and displays a warning accordingly. The user ultimately has the choice, however.</p>
<p>As Reddit user u/jaydenkieran explains, Apple uses Google Safe Browsing when you enable “Fraudulent Website Warning” within the Safari settings in the Settings app on iPhone or iPad.</p>
<p><a aria-label="According to Google (opens in a new tab)" href="https://support.google.com/transparencyreport/answer/7380435?hl=en#zippy=%2Chow-do-you-determine-that-a-site-is-unsafe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Google</a>, its Safe Browsing system works by scanning sections of Google’s web index and “identifying potentially compromised websites.” Then, Google tests those websites by using a virtual machine to check if the website compromises the system. If it does, it’s added to Google’s online database. Google also identifies phishing websites by using statistical models. </p>
<p><a aria-label="According to Apple (opens in a new tab)" href="https://support.apple.com/en-ae/HT210675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Apple</a>, before visiting a website, Safari may send hashed prefixes of the URL (Apple terms it “information calculated from the website address”) to Google Safe Browsing to check if there’s a match. </p>
<p>Since Apple uses a hashed prefix, Google cannot learn which website the user is trying to visit. Up until iOS 14.5, Google could also see the IP address of where that request is coming from. However, since Apple now proxies Google Safe Browsing traffic, it further safeguards users’ privacy while browsing using Safari.</p>
<p>Apple has been intensifying its push for privacy with iOS 14 what with the <a href="https://the8-bit.com/app-tracking-transparency-guide/">App Tracking Transparency update and the inclusion of App Privacy Reports in the App Store</a>. </p><div><p>See also</p><div id="block-wrap-39225" data-id="39225" data-base="0"><div><div><div><article><div><p><a href="https://the8-bit.com/siri-now-allows-setting-a-default-music-streaming-service-on-ios-14-5/" title="Siri_Default_Music_App"><img width="100" height="100" src="https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Siri_Default_Music_App-100x100.jpg" alt="Siri Default Music App" srcset="https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Siri_Default_Music_App-100x100.jpg 100w, https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Siri_Default_Music_App-80x80.jpg 80w, https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Siri_Default_Music_App-293x293.jpg 293w" sizes="(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px"></a></p></div></article></div></div></div></div></div>
<p>At the same time, companies like Facebook are actively opposing the Cupertino giant, accusing it of negatively affecting the advertising industry. Apple’s response has been simple: </p>
<p>“We believe that this is a simple matter of standing up for our users. Users should know when their data is being collected and shared across other apps and websites — and they should have the choice to allow that or not. App Tracking Transparency in iOS 14 does not require Facebook to change its approach to tracking users and creating targeted advertising, it simply requires they give users a choice.” </p>
<p>Google itself <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/02/04/google-still-hasnt-updated-its-ios-apps-while-pondering-android-privacy-controls" target="_blank" aria-label="had been holding off (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">had been holding off</a> on updating its host of apps on the App Store due to the App Privacy Health Reports in the App Store that lets users view how an app tracks them. However, Google later disclosed that it will update its apps to include as little tracking as possible.</p>
<p>Having said that, it’s interesting to see Apple focus on enhancing user privacy as much as they can. And setting up a proxy server to filter Google Safe Browsing traffic just so Google cannot see users’ browsing activity will be a welcome move for a lot of users.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What’s the most successful rebranding of the past 10 years? Airbnb? Google? Burger King? Nope. The award goes to….🥁🥁🥁….skipping breakfast! What was once best known as an excuse for lazy teenagers who didn’t feel like making a bowl of cereal is now being shouted from the rooftops from health enthusiasts and experts. Its new name: intermittent fasting.</p><p>For those that aren’t aware, there is an unwritten rule of intermittent fasting: you must unabashedly tell all your friends and family about how amazing it is. After a couple months of trying it out, it’s time for me to follow orders.</p><h2 id="fasting-101">Fasting 101</h2><p>When we think of nutrition, we often focus on how much we eat (calories) and what we eat (fats carbs, proteins, etc.) However, there is an important and often underemphasized third dimension: when we eat. As described on a popular fasting app’s <a href="https://www.zerofasting.com/why-fasting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">website</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Three meals a day is a modern accident. Our metabolisms are programmed for periods of feast and famine. Unlike constantly-grazing cows with four stomachs, we aren’t built to maintain a constant drip of food.</p></blockquote><p>The gist of intermittent fasting is to reduce your eating window. There are a variety of styles. The 13:11 Circadian Rhythm style consists of a 13 hour fast followed by an 11 hour eating window. It tries to replicate the body’s natural clock by fasting roughly after sunset until morning. The 16:8 is the most popular. To reach the 16 hour fasting goal, it’s common to fast from dinner to lunch the next day. Aka skipping breakfast.</p><h2 id="the-benefits-of-fasting">The Benefits of Fasting</h2><p>People are excited about intermittent fasting for good reason. Numerous studies show promising physical and mental benefits. For example, it can help you:</p><ul><li>⚡️ Boost energy</li><li>💪 Lose weight</li><li>✨ Reduce inflammation</li><li>🩸 Reduce insulin resistance (driver of Type 2 diabetes)</li><li>🧠 Increase mental clarity</li></ul><p>You can read about these benefits and others in more detail <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/intermittent-fasting-guide#benefits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a> and <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-health-benefits-of-intermittent-fasting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.</p><h2 id="my-experience">My Experience</h2><p>Today is my 65th day in a row fasting and I plan to stick with it for the foreseeable future. I’m impressed with its ease and effectiveness.</p><p>I started with a 13:11 style and quickly moved to a 16:8 structure. I skip breakfast and have my first meal around 12-2pm. During the first week I was a little hungry and tired in the morning, but now I feel great right up until my first meal of the day. In fact, I now frequently extend the fast to 16-20 hours.</p><p>I’ve noticed a number of physical and mental benefits. And unlike other dietary changes I actually enjoy it. I can harness my inner teenager and be lazy about breakfast. If I feel like ice cream I can have some damn ice cream and not feel guilty about it. In return, I have more energy and mental clarity. I’m also at my lowest weight level and % body fat since the prime of my collegiate soccer days. Below is how its impacted my weight so far:</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>As I learned in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24945404-the-obesity-code" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Obesity Code</a>, we have a natural weight set point. Kinda like a body weight thermostat. While traditional diets that focus on calorie reduction can help you lost weight in the short term, they rarely work long term because we naturally gravitate back to our set point. In contrast, fasting can actually change your set point, enabling long term weight change. While it’s still early, my initial results are promising.</p><p>While my experience has been positive, it’s important to mention that <strong>fasting is NOT for everyone</strong>. Everybody’s body responds differently. Accordingly, it’s important to consult a doctor before trying it. This is especially true if you have diabetes, have problems with blood sugar regulation, take medications, are underweight, have a history of eating disorders, or are pregnant.</p><h2 id="fasting-tips">Fasting Tips</h2><p>The Obesity Code contains a bunch of great intermittent fasting tips. I wouldn’t have been able to beat the initial hunger and fatigue without them. Straight from the book:</p><ul><li>💧 <strong>Drink water</strong>: Start each morning with a full eight-ounce glass of water.</li><li>🤹‍♂️ <strong>Stay busy</strong>: It’ll keep your mind off food.</li><li>☕️ <strong>Drink coffee</strong>: Coffee is a mild appetite suppressant. Green tea, black tea and bone broth may also help.</li><li>🏄‍♂️ <strong>Ride the waves</strong>: Hunger comes in waves; it is not continuous. When it hits, slowly drink a glass of water or a hot cup of coffee. Often by the time you’ve finished, your hunger will have passed.</li><li>🤫 <strong>Don’t tell everybody you are fasting</strong>: Most people will try to discourage you, as they do not understand the benefits. A close-knit support group is beneficial, but telling everybody you know is not a good idea.</li><li>📅 <strong>Give yourself one month</strong>: It takes time for your body to get used to fasting. The first few times you fast may be difficult, so be prepared. Don’t be discouraged. It will get easier.</li><li>🥑 <strong>Follow a nutritious diet on non-fast days</strong>: Intermittent fasting is not an excuse to eat whatever you like. During non-fasting days, stick to a nutritious diet low in sugars and refined carbohydrates.</li><li>🍽 <strong>Don’t binge</strong>: After fasting, pretend it never happened. Eat normally, as if you had never fasted</li></ul><p>Interested in learning more?

<p>Sennett Devermont is a police accountability activist whose streams police encounters to his Instagram followers. When he visited the Beverly Hills Police Department last Fri to obtain a form, BHPD Sergeant Billy Fair recognized him and began blasting music from of his phone.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CLCpHBQjX8r/">https://www.instagram.com/p/CLCpHBQjX8r/</a></p>
<p>Fair was following the example of other BHPD officers who have made a habit of playing copyrighted music during encounters with the public, apparently to trigger automated copyright takedowns on the major social media platforms.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvxb94/is-this-beverly-hills-cop-playing-sublimes-santeria-to-avoid-being-livestreamed">https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvxb94/is-this-beverly-hills-cop-playing-sublimes-santeria-to-avoid-being-livestreamed</a></p>
<p>As Dexter Thomas writes for Vice, this form of copyfraud has a failsafe: if the filter doesn't block the livestream, the archived footage might be easily removed through copyright complaints.</p>
<p>Instagram's copyright policy suggests that videos with incidental music are permitted, but the company's filters are incapable of distinguishing "incidental" and "non-incidental" use, while its appeals process is a long-running production of Kafka's Trial.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/17/cheap-truthers/#robot-sez-no">https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/17/cheap-truthers/#robot-sez-no</a></p>
<p>Moreover, the platforms use a "copystrike" system, which means that cops who successfully deploy this tactic can chip away at activists' presence on the system – three strikes and their accounts are permanently removed.</p>
<p>Thomas: "…[P]laying copyrighted music as a deterrent to the First Amendment-guaranteed right to openly film police is, if not BHPD official protocol, at least a technique that has been deployed by more than one officer."</p>
<p>Back in 2019, anti-racist activists experimented with playing copyrighted music at Nazi rallies to make them unpostable on social media. At the time, I warned that this would end badly.</p>
<p><a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2019/07/23/clever-hack-that-will-end-badly-playing-copyrighted-music-during-nazis-rallies-so-they-cant-be-posted-to-youtube/">https://memex.craphound.com/2019/07/23/clever-hack-that-will-end-badly-playing-copyrighted-music-during-nazis-rallies-so-they-cant-be-posted-to-youtube/</a></p>
<p>Exactly a year later, BLM protest videos started disappearing from the internet thanks to copyfraud and overactive copyright filters.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/23/circuit-split/#dolphins-in-tuna-nets">https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/23/circuit-split/#dolphins-in-tuna-nets</a></p>
<p>Copyright filters are a terrible idea, not just because they have all but eliminated the ability of musicians to perform classical music online:</p>

<p>Two of the most astute IP scholars I know also happen to be two of the best legal writers I know, and also happen to work at one of the worst IP abusers in the country: Jennifer Jenkins and James Boyle, of Duke University, the nation's leading academic trademark abuser.</p>
<p>Duke has a universal reputation for being a serious trademark abuser, but Jenkins and Boyle wanted to empirically investigate that reputation. The result is "Mark of the Devil: The University as Brand Bully," forthcoming in Fordham IPLJ.</p>
<p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3780381">https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3780381</a></p>
<p>To do empirical work, you have to find stuff to count. The problem is that questions like "who is the biggest bully?" are stubbornly qualitative, and quantizing Duke's conduct risks incinerating the most important elements in the quest for some kind of quantitative residue.</p>
<p>But the authors hit on a very good quantitative/qualitative methodology: they would count trademark oppositions, which are legal filings sent after a trademark has received preliminary approval. That way, they'd be counting oppositions to trademarks that had some merit.</p>
<p>Even better: trademark oppositions have to be accompanied by legal arguments explaining why the university thinks the trademark should be blocked, and that produces a qualitative account of how Duke thinks about its trademark.</p>
<p>Then Jenkins and Boyle used their considerable legal knowledge to characterize each opposition's argument on the basis of how plausible or stupid it was, quantizing the qualitative question of whether Duke's lawyers were fucking around.</p>
<p>Some background: universities have reinvented themselves as brand-factories and oriented their activities around slapping their logos on random shit and selling it. That's why Ohio State applied for a trademark on, I shit you not, the word "the."</p>
<p>Boise State asked for a trademark on all non-green football fields. U Texas wants the trademark over making devil horns with your fingers ("I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of metalheads suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced").</p>
<p>The trademark and licensing business is a squalid affair. The (grossly overstated, rarely realized) risk of a mark lapsing into the public domain ("genericide") justifies endless bullying of people who say and do normal things that glance off your trademarks.</p>
<p>Trademark was established to protect buyers, by allowing the makers of well-known goods to punish rivals who sought to deceive their customers. Over the years, trademark has been distorted into just another grift, a way to make the rich, richer.</p>
<p>As the authors point out, citing Mark Lemley et al, there's no good trademark justification for allowing a university to snuff out "counterfeit" tees  – the buyers of these items haven't been tricked into getting a bargain on a way to advertise their team allegiance.</p>
<p>But the expansion of trademark into an economic right for mark-makers (and away from a way of protecting the public from deceptive sellers), combined with the bogeyman of genericide add up to a perfect business for the greedy and unscrupulous. For bullies.</p>
<p>So, is Duke a bully?</p>
<p>Oh shit yes.</p>
<p>Let's look at some graphs. Here's how Duke stacks up against comparable US institutions in terms of how often it challenges a trademark.</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/dukecancels.png?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/dukecancels.png?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>They slice this data many ways but it always looks like this: Duke is a huge outlier.</p>
<p>But wait! Maybe those trademark cancellations are good, actually. So let's go to the quantized, hand-coded qualitative assessments of Duke's arguments.</p>
<p>They're garbage.</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/dukemerit.png?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/dukemerit.png?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>"85% of Duke’s oppositions were coded either clearly erroneous or far-fetched"</p>
<p>But wait! Maybe the authors are being mean to Duke. What's "erroneous or far-fetched?" Well, it seems that Duke challenges any trademark application containing "Duke," the letter "D," a devil, the world blue, or any word that sounds like "duke."</p>
<p>All of this is laid out with beautiful clarity in the paper, and the back third of the paper moves on to ask What It All Means – why is Duke such a godawful bully. The authors entertain several possibilities, like perverse incentives in trademark, etc.</p>
<p>But they don't draw conclusions. I have one, and it may be uncomfortable for my honorable and good lawyer friends, which is that law has a bullying problem. There are many fields where esoteric knowledge gives you the power to coerce others, but the law is especially bad.</p>
<p>Luckily, most of my experience of lawyers has been with people who fight for the underdog, but honestly, I think they're the exception. I had a very eye-opening experience about 15 years ago, when a friend asked me to come speak to some co-workers.</p>
<p>My friend worked at a giant company in a creative unit, and he asked me if I'd come speak to his group. It was close by home and I told him of course I'd do it. A day before I was meant to come by, he emailed apologetically to say that legal had sent him a contract for me.</p>
<p>Now, I wasn't charging this massive, profitable company a dime. It was a favor for a pal. But I looked at the contract and it was bonkers – like, I promised I'd never mention the name of the company in print, ever, without written permission.</p>
<p>I told my friend I couldn't sign that clause and he told me he understood, but the legal department wouldn't let me in the building unless I signed it. I canceled the talk. A couple months later, I met a lawyer from the company at a signing and I told him this story.</p>
<p>He grimaced and said he knew whose doing that was, another lawyer in the department who counted their successes by how badly they could humiliate the people who contracted with the company. He listed several of these, each more outrageous than the last.</p>
<p>This wasn't just a power-trip, it was sadism. And it's not limited to that lawyer or that company. I sent back two minor, small-dollar publishing contracts today that had abominable language in them – blanket indemnities, binding arbitration, huge rights grabs.</p>
<p>These aren't (or weren't) standard. There's no business reason for them. I mean, I <em>can't</em> indemnify a multinational corporation against all claims for the simple reason that I couldn't afford to hire lawyers to argue their case. I'd just go bust.</p>
<p>There is a toxic strain of competitive sadism in the law, an ethic of victory through someone else's humiliating defeat. If I had to guess why Duke smashes all those trademark applicants' dreams, I'd say that sadism is playing a major role.</p>

<p><em>Stephen Brennan • 09 February 2021</em></p><p>INTERNET – Stack Overflow users today rejoiced at the prospect of Python’s
upcoming 3.10 release including the controversial new pattern matching feature
described in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0634/">PEP 634</a>.</p>

<p>“Python 3 has been out for a while, and the goldmine of Python 2 to 3 migration
questions has started to run dry since January 2020,” said one user, referring
to the end of life for the Python 2.x release series. “We were starting to
worry that we would run out of major language changes to confuse new developers.
But thanks to pattern matching, we should be set for another 5-7 years!”</p>

<p>The question answerers on the popular site, <a href="https://www.stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, were commenting
on the upcoming Python 3.10 language feature of pattern matching, which allows
syntax such as the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>match</span> <span>status_code</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>200</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"OK!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>404</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"HTTP Not Found"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>_</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Some other shit, sorry!"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Stack Overflow users gushed over its similarity to C’s <code>switch</code> statement. “New
users will see the <code>case</code> keyword and instantly feel comfortable based on their
knowledge of C,” one SO answerer remarked. “But that’s when we get them! <code>match</code>
is about subverting expectations, by assigning to variables when the programmer
expects a comparison. We’re going to earn so many Stack Overflow reputation
points this way.”</p>

<p>This user’s comments referred to the unexpected behavior of the match statement
when used with identifiers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>NOT_FOUND</span> <span>=</span> <span>404</span>
<span>match</span> <span>status_code</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>200</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"OK!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>NOT_FOUND</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"HTTP Not Found"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this case, rather than matching <code>status_code</code> against the value of
<code>NOT_FOUND</code> (404), Python’s new <del>SO reputation machine</del> match syntax would
assign the value of <code>status_code</code> to the variable <code>NOT_FOUND</code>. Another Stack
Overflow user explained:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think the core developers finally looked at the numbers, and saw how few
questions Python 3.x was getting on Stack Overflow. Here’s a language that has
finally matured, and it really strikes a balance between usability and
predictability. When we reached out to the core development team about the
dire situation, the developers knew they had to step in and add an
unpredictable feature to rectify things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The last time the Python language conspired so strongly to confuse new users was
the controversial “mutable default argument” feature:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>def</span> <span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>l</span><span>=</span><span>[]):</span>
<span>...</span>     <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"myfunc({})"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>))</span>
<span>...</span>     <span>l</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>...</span>     <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>" l={}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>l</span><span>))</span>
<span>...</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
 <span>l</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>3</span><span>]</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
<span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
 <span>l</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, some Stack Overflow users were not so rosy about the future of Python 3
questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sure, Python 3.10 is going to trigger a massive influx of questions. But that
doesn’t mean we’ll get more reputation points! Most mods are just going to
mark all the questions as duplicates, even if they don’t have good answers
yet. Pattern matching may be a beautifully booby-trapped new feature, but it’s
not going to save us from bad moderation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, the Perl community rallied in support of the latest developments in
the Python language. Said one Perl developer: “Honestly, I’m just glad Python
has finally given in to gratuitous new features, and Perl 7 is now the language
of reason and moderation. I can’t wait until they realize how many operators
they can overload.  Maybe Python 2.7 can make a comeback after all?”</p>

Now, they have conducted a clinical trial to study its efficacy. Trial participants who spent a total of four hours training with the app at home showed an improvement in their ability to handle real height situations.</p><p>Fear of heights is a widespread phenomenon. Approximately 5% of the general population experiences a debilitating level of discomfort in height situations. However, the people affected rarely take advantage of the available treatment options, such as exposure therapy, which involves putting the person in the anxiety-causing situation under the guidance of a professional. On the one hand, people are reluctant to confront their fear of heights. On the other hand, it can be difficult to reproduce the right kinds of height situations in a therapy setting.</p><p>This motivated the interdisciplinary research team led by Professor Dominique de Quervain of the University of Basel to develop a smartphone-based virtual reality exposure therapy app called Easyheights. The app uses 360° images of real locations, which the researchers captured using a drone. People can use the app on their own smartphones together with a special virtual reality headset.</p><h2><b>Gradually increasing the height</b></h2><p>During the virtual experience, the user stands on a platform that is initially one meter above the ground. After allowing acclimatization to the situation for a certain interval, the platform automatically rises. In this way, the perceived distance above the ground increases slowly but steadily without an increase in the person’s level of fear.</p><p>The research team studied the efficacy of this approach in a randomized, controlled trial and published the results in the journal <i><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41746-021-00387-7&amp;t=YTA2Y2UyNjQxZjE4ZjY3ZmZkY2IxMzVjYzI3OTRhNjgyZjg4YTNjOSxjTkoyZTgxNQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F642786101323579392%2Fvr-fear-of-heights-treatment&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1613321407">NPJ Digital Medicine</a></i>. Fifty trial participants with a fear of heights either completed a four-hour height training program (one 60-minute session and six 30-minute sessions over the course of two weeks) using virtual reality, or were assigned to the control group, which did not complete these training sessions.</p><p>Before and after the training phase – or the same period of time without training – the trial participants ascended the Uetliberg lookout tower near Zurich as far as their fear of heights allowed them. The researchers recorded the height level reached by the participants along with their subjective fear level at each level of the tower. At the end of the trial, the researchers evaluated the results from 22 subjects who completed the Easyheights training and 25 from the control group.</p><figure data-orig-height="750" data-orig-width="1000"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/a7d2ab9c5b854b35199b6c548b829d0e/bbcffefc0ed2b483-20/s1280x1920/7474345b9acfd469b9bf2042fe648c90b3c3accc.jpg" data-orig-height="750" data-orig-width="1000" width="1000" height="750" alt="image"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;Advanced level of the virtual reality app. Credit: <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.unibas.ch/en/News-Events/News/Uni-Research/Virtual-reality-helping-to-treat-fear-of-heights.html">Bentz et al., NPJ Digital Medicine 2021</a>.</i></p><p>The group that completed the training with the app exhibited less fear on the tower and was able to ascend further towards the top than they could before completing the training. The control group exhibited no positive changes. The efficacy of the Easyheights training proved comparable to that of conventional exposure therapy.</p><h2><b>Therapy in your own living room</b></h2><p>Researchers have already been studying the use of virtual reality for treating fear of heights for more than two decades. “What is new, however, is that smartphones can be used to produce the virtual scenarios that previously required a technically complicated type of treatment, and this makes it much more accessible,” explains Dr. Dorothée Bentz, lead author of the study.</p><p>The results from the study suggest that the repeated use of a smartphone-based virtual reality exposure therapy can greatly improve the behavior and subjective state of well-being in height situations. People who suffer from a mild fear of heights will soon be able to download the free app from major app stores and complete training sessions on their own. However, the researchers recommend that people who suffer from a serious fear of heights only use the app with the supervision of a professional.</p><p>The current study is one of several projects in progress at the Transfaculty Research Platform for Molecular and Cognitive Neurosciences, led by Professor Andreas Papassotiropoulos and Professor Dominique de Quervain. Their goal is to improve the treatment of mental disorders through the use of new technologies and to make these treatments widely available.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source: <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.unibas.ch/en/News-Events/News/Uni-Research/Virtual-reality-helping-to-treat-fear-of-heights.html">University of Basel</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“Effectiveness of a stand-alone, smartphone-based virtual reality exposure app to reduce fear of heights in real-life: a randomized trial”,&nbsp;<i>NPJ Digital Medicine</i>.</p><p><a href="https://href.li/?https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-021-00387-7">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-021-00387-7</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/627900402450497536/personalized-ocd-treatment">New brain study could lead to more personalized OCD treatment</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			<p>If I’m repeatedly drawn to a thought, feeling, or belief, I write it out. I believe writing is the most practical tool we possess to think <em>far</em> more effectively.</p>
<p>For those of us with woefully average gray matter, our minds have a limited reach. Like an erratic compass needle, our minds cling to the most provocative fragments of ideas without helping us map the territory. <strong>Writing forces us to articulate things with a level of context and coherence we can’t achieve in the mind alone.</strong> Writing lets us expand our working memory. It also exposes the gaps — blind spots, falsity, bias, prejudice, ambiguity — in what we write.</p>
<p>At its best, writing (and reading) can help us confront the ugly and uncomfortable aspects of our nature. It can uproot ideas burrowed so deeply that they’ve imperceptibly shaped our feelings and beliefs. Sometimes this uprooting will reveal that the lustrous potential of a new idea was a mirage, or that your understanding about someone’s motives were incomplete, maybe even projected. <strong>Writing can be therapeutic.</strong>&nbsp;Sculpting the clay of your thoughts can bring clarity, spark ideas, and tidy mental clutter.</p>
<p>I also believe that <strong><a href="https://jsomers.net/blog/more-people-should-write" target="_blank" rel="noopener">making writing a habit can encourage us to be more playful and attentive</a> as we walk this earth.</strong> Writing is a perfect excuse to do something off-kilter, to experience and document something new.</p>
<p>But writing is daunting. Chaotic and awkward. It’s so off-putting that I rarely encounter people in everyday life who enjoy, or at least don’t loathe, writing.</p>
<p>Our words expose us. Maybe the process of writing even shapes us over time. Even when we’re not writing something personal, our style pervades in the way we choose and arrange words. And this style certainly evolves.</p>
<p>This makes writing difficult, especially in the beginning. It forces us to fall short of our own expectations. <strong>Like the amateur chef trying again and again to emulate a great meal, we can recognize and appreciate good writing while not being able to create it.</strong> That’s frustrating. But that’s how skill development works. To improve, our taste for things must outstrip our ability to create them.</p>
<p>This imbalance between taste and ability also means you’ll encounter people who are eager to find flaws in your writing. Don’t receive negative feedback as an attack. A reader may be able to sense that something could be better, but they may not have the ability to explain it. Embrace scrutiny. Learn to convert critical feedback — and even cynical feedback — into better writing.</p>
<p>I don’t think writing is an isolated skill. Rather, I see it as a non-linear and gangly process of gathering, curating, organizing, creating, and refining ideas and information. It’s easy to overestimate (and romanticize) the role of creativity in the writing process. Creativity is often a byproduct of the other steps listed above. Reading is often the cleanest-burning fuel for this process.</p>
<h2>Writing at Work</h2>
<p>My career path compelled me to become a better writer, and I’m grateful for it. <strong>Writing well is a skill that complements nearly every professional role.</strong></p>
<p>When I cross paths with a skilled writer, I’m delighted, particularly when they can write or edit in ways I cannot. Their ability is easy to recognize. An email, or even a short conversation with no writing involved, can give them away. <strong>Good writers strive for relevance, brevity, and style, in that order.</strong></p>
<p>Writing well is not essential to becoming a leader or high earner. But if you have a white collar job, writing can almost certainly be a force multiplier. And it can be an asset as part of a company’s culture. By knowing how to parse and convey the right information, the good writer can relieve a myriad of headaches. Good writing can connect disjointed perspectives, give direction to a project, sell a service, solidify a shared purpose, document a process, and foster an evergreen knowledge-base.</p>
<p>In my unqualified opinion, good writer are also more likely to be effective generalists. Many of the best writers I’ve worked with were not writers. Several were designers, two were lawyers, one was a pharmacist, and one was a salesperson. These people often worked beyond their job titles and were called in to help untangle sensitive projects.</p>
<p><strong>You should write because it’s a way to help yourself and others.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p><img src="https://esoteric.codes/uploads/e75196b9-42f8-4808-8b8b-9157f238b570/xor.png" alt="" width="" height=""></p>
<p>Assembly code can appear mysterious to the uninitiated. Aspects of the physical machine abstracted away in higher-level languages are referred to directly in its terse commands.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1502958082" target="">This chapbook</a> of minimal assembly code poems (its author refers to them as "snippets") offers no solutions, context, or explanations to ease this gap, leaving the work of deciphering to the reader. For xorpd, its pseudonymous author, this is exactly the point: to immerse the reader in the machine level of code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When working inside a computer, everything is eventually made of assembly, so this is where you go if you really want to understand how things work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no extraneous word of text in the book to break that context. The title, <code>xchg rax, rax</code>, is a NOP instruction (pronounced no-op, for no operation): xchg exchanges the data of two operands, in this case of rax with itself. The author's name, xorpd, is a bitwise logical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XOR (exclusive or)</a> of packed double-precision floating-point values. <span><br></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The xor logical operation is one of my favorites. It is the foundation for most of our modern cryptography.</p>
<p>The "xorpd" instruction allows xoring 128 bits at a time. It is really the kind of instruction you want to be when you grow up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://www.xorpd.net/pages/xchg_rax/snip_00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full book can be found here</a> but is also available as a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1502958082" target="">lovely printed book</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Initially I wanted to publish the book through a publisher, but no publisher wanted to go with the "minimalistic" design. One publisher said he could publish the book if I added explanations for every code snippet, but I wasn't willing to do so.</p>
<p>Another friend recommended adding QR codes to the pages, linking to explanations, but I wasn't willing to do this either. I remember trying to decipher each of those code snippets myself, and I felt that I could not let my readers down by handing them an easy solution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://esoteric.codes/uploads/e6b10eed-c3cc-4f59-afb6-580c6508c5f7/xorpd3.jpg" alt="" width="" height=""></p>
<p>That lack of explanation, along with the monospaced font, gives the book the feel of conceptual poetry, perhaps an early Vito Acconci piece.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My father opened one of the books and looked at it in amazement. He said something like "There is nothing inside the book, it's all strange short English words, who would want to buy something like this?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, much of the joy of the book comes from discovering the nuances of these tiny programs; many rely on assembly-specific tricks that do not really translate "up" into the virtual machines defined by higher-level programming languages.</p>
<p>Those who have trouble deciphering can view xorpd's video series <a href="https://www.xorpd.net/pages/x86_adventures.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assembly Language Adventures</a>, which teaches assembly programming beginning with the very basics, reaching a level of expertise through 29 hours of instruction. Xorpd created the book as a companion piece while working on the video, pulling his favorite assembly snippets together.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of my favorites is:</p>

<div>
<pre>cmp &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;al,0x0a
sbb &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;al,0x69
das</pre>
<p>This snippet converts a nibble (4 bits) into a hex digit with only three instructions. It always takes me a few mintues to understand how it works. From what I know the <code>das</code>​ instruction doesn't work anymore on the x86_64 architecture, but it is a nice reminder of what life used to be.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>How is this accomplished in three assembly instructions? Where is the conversion happening, and how is the 0x0a value used? The author has provided a complete explanation of the code below. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The code converts a hex number (0x0 ... 0xf) into a hex character<br>('0','1','2',...'9','a',...'f').</p>
<p>How it works<br>============</p>
<p>introduction:</p>
<p>This is the relevant part of the ASCII table:</p>
<pre>0x30 0
0x31 1
0x32 2
0x33 3
0x34 4
0x35 5
0x36 6
0x37 7
0x38 8
0x39 9
0x3a :
0x3b ;
0x3c &lt;
0x3d =
0x3e &gt;
0x3f ?
0x40 @
0x41 A
0x42 B
0x43 C
0x44 D ...</pre>
<p>There is an unfortunate gap between the numeric digits and the caps English<br>letters. The code above is meant to overcome that gap.</p>
<p>We want to map a number x to its relevant ASCII number, in the following<br>fashion: If 0 &lt;= x &lt;= 9, then map x to x + 0x30 If 0xa &lt;= x &lt;= 0xf, then map<br>x to x + 0x37</p>
<p>Note that the difference is 0x7. The idea for the code comes from the fact<br>that 7 = (16 - 10) + 1 We get the (16 - 10) difference from the DAS<br>instruction, and the 1 difference from the SBB and CMP instructions.</p>
<p>Intro to binary coded arithmetic<br>-------------------------------------</p>
<p>Most of the magic of this snippet comes from the `das` instruction, so we<br>better start by exploring what it does.</p>
<p>`das` means decimal adjust (al) after subtraction. Together with the rest of<br>the binary coded decimals instructions family, it allows us to perform binary<br>coded decimals arithemtic.</p>
<p>Binary coded decimals are decimal numbers represented in base 16. For<br>example, 0x16 would mean the decimal number 16.</p>
<p>Internally, the `das` instruction observes the flag register, and alters `al`<br>to represent the correct binary coded decimal.</p>
<p>Subtraction example:</p>
<pre>mov al, 0x31
sub al, 0x08
das</pre>
<p>Will result in al = 0x23. Interpreted in the world of decimals, 31 - 8 = 23.<br>Overflow will also happen in the world of decimals (Modulo 100).</p>
<p>Overflow example:</p>
<pre>mov al, 0x15
sub al, 0x16
das</pre>
<p>Will result in al = 0x99, because 15 - 16 = -1, which equals to 99 modulo<br>100.</p>
<p>And finally, an example equivalent to the first subtraction example:</p>
<pre>mov al, 0x31
add al, 0x92
daa</pre>
<p>Which will also result in al = 0x23. This time we add instead of subtract.<br>and we use the instruction `daa`, decimal adjust after addition, instead of<br>`das`.</p>
<p>There is one more delicate point about `das` and `daa` that we will need for<br>our solution. Take a look at this example:</p>
<pre>mov al, 0x31
add al, 0x0a
daa</pre>
<p>The result is al = 0x41. This means that from the point of view of `daa`,<br>0x0a and 0x10 are the same. It also means that 0x0f behaves just like 0x15.</p>
<p>Converting to hex<br>------------------------</p>
<p>We want to use the 16 - 10 difference to our advantage, somehow bridging the <br>gap between the '9' and 'A' characters.</p>
<p>Here is a first attempt that is close to what we want to achieve:</p>
<pre>add al, 0x30
daa</pre>
<p>For every digit between '0' and '9', we will get the correct result.<br>As an example, assigning al = 0x5 will give us the result of al = 0x35, which<br>is the digit '5'. Assigning al = 0x9 will give us the result of al = 0x39.</p>
<p>What about hex digits? When we try to assign al = 0xa, we will get al = 0x40,<br>which means that we missed our target by 1. The character 'A' has the ASCII<br>code 0x41. But we did achieve something interesting here. We managed to take<br>a jump from 0x9 -&gt; 0x39 to 0xa -&gt; 0x40. Our input increased by 1, but our<br>output increased by 7!</p>
<p>We need to somehow add 1 in the case hex digits 'a' - 'f', but not in the<br>case of '0' - '9'. A classic way to achieve this is using the carry flag.<br>Here is a fixed solution:</p>
<pre>cmp al, 0xa ; Check if al is an 'a' - 'f' digit
cmc ; Complement the carry
adc al, 0x30
daa</pre>
<p>So, if we have a numeric digit ('0' - '9') in al, the first two <br>instructions will have no effect. But if our digit is in the 'a' - 'f' range,<br>we will get a carry flag equals 1, and so `adc al, 0x30` is equivalent to<br>`add al, 0x31`. Hence for example, an input of al = 0xa will give an al =<br>0x41 output, as we wanted.</p>
<p>But we could make our code shorter if we could somehow avoid using `cmc`.<br>In order to do this, we could turn to the dual side, knowing that given<br>wraparound, subtraction is equivalent to addition. In other words, <br>`add al, 0x30 // daa` is equivalent to `sub al, 0x70 // das`.</p>
<p>Combining this with the carry flag trick, we finally get:</p>
<pre>cmp al, 0xa
sbb al, 0x69
das</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This gives an idea of how much is packed into these short programs, but don't count on explanations for the other pieces. While the code may have seemed daunting early on, it has been intriguing enough for the book to build an audience slowly over the years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When "xchg rax, rax" was released in 2014, there was no real interest in the book. I hate marketing work, so I never really did anything to attempt to market the book. It is only recently, 6 years later, that people started paying attention.</p>
