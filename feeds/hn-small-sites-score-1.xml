			<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> Stories and takeaways from growing ProveSource from 0 to $700k ARR as a 2-person team in less than 3 years and with no funding.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-year-story-cover.png" alt="3 year story provesource" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-year-story-cover.png 1920w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-year-story-cover-300x169.png 300w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-year-story-cover-1024x576.png 1024w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-year-story-cover-768x432.png 768w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-year-story-cover-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px"></p>
<h2><strong>Our false start</strong></h2>
<p>We started the company in June 2015 with no real idea.</p>
<p>Most people we know fail to ever get started because they’re looking for the perfect idea.</p>
<p>As the founder of Instagram famously said:</p>
<p>“It’s about going through false starts. The best companies in the world have all had predecessors. YouTube was a dating site. You always have to evolve into something else.”</p>
<p>We brainstormed for several days and because both myself and Natan (my co-founder) are very good with mobile app development (iOS &amp; Android) we decided to build a personalization platform for mobile apps and sell it to enterprises.</p>
<p>Around 2.5 years later, having invested almost $100k out of our own pockets, having done hundreds of calls and demos with huge enterprises and dozens of Proof of Concepts, we decided it’s time to move on…</p>
<p>It felt awful – like you’re killing something you love, but it had to be done.</p>
<p>That was our “false start”. But more on that another time.</p>
<p><strong>🧠 Lesson learned:</strong></p>
<p>The sooner you kill an idea that is getting no traction, even if it’s super hard because it’s your baby, the less painful it is. The more time and resources you devote, the harder it becomes to pull out in case things don’t work out.</p>
<h2><strong>Starting over – The lean way</strong></h2>
<p>In January 2018 we decided to start working on a new SaaS product.</p>
<p>The idea was to “steal” the social proof hack that Booking.com was using (e.g. 5 people booked this hotel, etc.) and create a platform from it – a social proof marketing platform.</p>
<p>This time, because we were running on fumes, both in terms of cash and motivation, we decided to validate the idea first.</p>
<p>We had a single purpose in mind – getting 100 leads interested in our product.</p>
<p>We created a landing page that showcased our new idea as a real product, including pricing, a signup button, and all – a social proof marketing platform for mobile apps.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing-page-for-product-validation-ps.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing-page-for-product-validation-ps.png 1920w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing-page-for-product-validation-ps-300x169.png 300w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing-page-for-product-validation-ps-1024x576.png 1024w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing-page-for-product-validation-ps-768x432.png 768w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing-page-for-product-validation-ps-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px"></p>
<p>The fastest way to get targeted traffic to your website is to use Google Ads targeting the brand names of the biggest players in your niche.</p>
<p>So we did that.</p>
<p>We also posted the landing page anywhere we could think of: Reddit, ProductHunt, BetaList, social media, wherever…</p>
<p>About one month and – $300 later, we had around 200 leads that wanted to try out ProveSource.</p>
<p>We were finally making progress!</p>
<p>We figured that even if only 1% of them converted, we would already have 2 paying customers.</p>
<p><strong>🧠 Lesson learned:</strong></p>
<p>You can easily get traction without having a product.</p>
<p>Just buy a domain, build a landing page, and go validate your business idea.</p>
<p>We usually create landing pages to validate products using plain HTML and Airtable, to send the leads we collect from the forms. No fancy designs, no expensive CRM.</p>
<h2><strong>Making our first dollar $</strong></h2>
<p>Next goal – how do we make a dollar?</p>
<p>That is, unlike our previous product which made practically $0 in 2.5 years.</p>
<p>We created a rule that whenever we launch a new product, all our efforts will be towards making our first dollar, so we can have real-life validation.</p>
<p>So we have 200 people interested in ProveSource.</p>
<p>Now we needed to give them a product and get them to pay.</p>
<p>We built the leanest MVP possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>A product just for website owners (mobile was too small of a niche).</li>
<li>You could only show how many page visitors you had on your website.</li>
<li>The whole UI and UX should be super simple. No menus and extra buttons, don’t give users a reason to abandon your product.</li>
</ul>
<p>Did you forget your password and need to reset it? Sorry, no can do.</p>
<p>Did we accidentally change your password when you logged in? Oops, we’re on it.</p>
<p>What are onboarding and email automation? Dunno, don’t care.</p>
<p>April 2018 – we are approached by a Facebook Group admin that is interested in promoting our product to his group as a “lifetime deal” (LTD).</p>
<p>This means selling a lifetime subscription to your product for a one-off payment ranging from $39-$99.</p>
<p>We’ve never heard of this before so we thought long and hard about the consequences of selling a lifetime deal and how it would position the product and our company…</p>
<p>We decided to go with the deal and ran it with the group for 1 week.</p>
<p>We generated over $7k revenue, got tons of feedback, ideas for product improvements, tons of bugs were discovered in the process, which taught us the value of having live chat support.</p>
<p><strong>🧠 Lesson learned:</strong></p>
<p>In hindsight, there were no real consequences, only advantages to running a lifetime deal.</p>
<p>Sure, you have a few dozens of customers that are not paying you on a recurring basis – but they help a lot in the beginning when you need the cash and the validation.</p>
<p>Once we were done with the LTD we started pushing the product in all marketing channels and to our 200 user waiting list. None of them converted by the way.</p>
<p>A couple of days later we got our first monthly subscription customer ($19/month).</p>
<p>It was an amazing moment, validating that you indeed have a real business opportunity in your hands.</p>
<h2><strong>Our “wow moment”</strong></h2>
<p>During the next months, we focused on spreading the word, squashing bugs, and doing tons of support for our existing customers.</p>
<p>How did we decide what to build next?</p>
<ul>
<li>We learned to ask questions about our product’s value. Why do people buy our product? Is it because they want to increase conversions? How do we help them achieve that?</li>
<li>We brainstormed about what it means to be a social proof platform.</li>
<li>We heard our customers’ feedback</li>
<li>We learned from competitors; but not too much. We found that those who only copy will always lag behind.</li>
</ul>
<p>This whole process has to be accompanied by analytics and metrics.</p>
<p>You don’t have to measure each and every step or A/B test you do, though.</p>
<p>We don’t really do it, to this day.</p>
<p>A lot of product leaders talk about the “wow effect” or “wow moment” – if you want to retain users, make them say “wow”.</p>
<p>For Facebook, for example, their “wow moment” is logging into their platform and seeing familiar faces. That’s why they make sure that during sign up, you connect with as many people you know on Facebook as possible.</p>
<p>In our case, we focused on improving our user onboarding.</p>
<p>Since the product requires users to install a javascript snippet on their website, we put a big emphasis on making that process as easy as possible.</p>
<p>Our thought was – if users can see a social proof notification on their website, they’ll get to that “wow moment”.</p>
<p>We can see a very close correlation between successful onboarding and someone becoming a paying customer.</p>
<p>The funnel looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>8-10% of visitors will signup.</li>
<li>70% of those signups will complete the onboarding.</li>
<li>7-10% of those users who are onboarded will eventually become paying customers.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ProveSource-Signups-Funnel.png" alt="ProveSource Signups Funnel" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ProveSource-Signups-Funnel.png 1920w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ProveSource-Signups-Funnel-300x169.png 300w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ProveSource-Signups-Funnel-1024x576.png 1024w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ProveSource-Signups-Funnel-768x432.png 768w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ProveSource-Signups-Funnel-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px"></p>
<p><strong>🧠 Lesson learned:</strong></p>
<p>Find what your “wow moment” is in your users’ experience, and make sure you get users to experience it as early in the onboarding process as possible. That way you can spend a lot on User Acquisition activities because the users you bring in end up becoming paying customers and sticking with you.</p>
<h2><strong>Our First Growth “Hack”</strong></h2>
<p>After we added some “necessary” features like showing recent sales and polishing the product to have fewer bugs – we wanted to grow bigger, we wanted to scale up, we wanted to get more exposure.</p>
<p>How do you scale a notifications product that is essentially an add-on for websites?</p>
<p>You build integrations for all website builders.</p>
<p>So we worked hard on adding more and more integrations: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/provesource/">WordPress plugin</a>, <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/provesource">Shopify app</a>, Magento plugin, Wix app, <a href="https://zapier.com/apps/provesource/integrations">Zapier</a>, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/provesource-social-proof/">BigCommerce</a>, and more.</p>
<p>All of these marketplaces and app stores proved to be really good traffic sources and traction channels for us, each with its own audience and unique requirements.</p>
<p>Today, around 20% of our customers and revenue comes from Shopify alone.</p>
<h2><strong>Scaling past 2 people</strong></h2>
<p>Being a two-person team that does development, marketing, support, accounting, and more is tough. But it also teaches you a lot, you learn so much about your business, your audience, and your customers.</p>
<p>And that gives you the experience you need on what to look for when hiring someone to take over some of your responsibilities.</p>
<p>In September 2019 we decided it’s time to scale the team.</p>
<p>After all, a great company can’t be just 2 people, right?</p>
<p>Naturally, a software company’s first hire would be a developer.</p>
<p>Bringing Dima to the team, allowed us to build more integrations faster, and scale the company beyond its initial stage.</p>
<p>So we now have tons of integrations, pretty much with any large marketing or website platform out there.</p>
<p>We also scaled and optimized our Google and Facebook ads as much as we could.</p>
<p>We optimized our product onboarding rate, increased prices, added great features, and made it even easier to use the product, by adding tooltips, auto-suggestions, wizards, and more.</p>
<p>We were growing at a steady rate, so what could possibly be bothering us?</p>
<p>Well, we didn’t know how to grow faster, or what to do next.</p>
<p>We came up with a few ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bring a Growth team member to scale our marketing efforts and bring new ideas to the table.</li>
<li>Since our product offering is strong and we couldn’t think about any impactful feature we could develop – we thought about zooming out of our product’s initial market.</li>
<li>Build a new product – we have no investors so we are free to make any decision we want about the company’s direction. Investors often block the founders from doing whatever is best for the company and push for a point where they can exit.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Building a new product</strong></h2>
<p>At this point, we decided to build another product to scale the company further.</p>
<p>We had these questions in mind before picking what to work on:</p>
<ul>
<li>How big is the market, is it potentially bigger than our current product?</li>
<li>Would our existing customers be customers of this new product too?</li>
<li>What do our existing customers need and are willing to pay for?</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding ProveSource to your website is great, but, there is a critical prerequisite to making it work for you and your website: traffic. If your website has no traffic, you won’t be able to generate social proof.</p>

October 29, 2020 | https://blog.cfelde.com/2020/10/flash-loans/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.cfelde.com/2020/10/flash-loans/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div>

<p>What would you do if you could borrow a near unlimited amount of money, only need to pay the interest, and not need to provide any collateral?</p>
<p>Sure, we have something like that with credit cards, at an outrageous interest rate, and with fairly small credit limits. But what if I’d give you this non-collateralized loan for just 0.09%?</p>
<p>Sure, you’d think, I’m happy to rip you off. But here’s the thing, you can’t rip me off, and I’m not scamming you.</p>
<p>The above is possible with something called flash loans, a new type of financial instrument, only possible on blockchains like Ethereum.</p>
<p>In short, it’s a DeFi protocol where you obtain the loan at the start of your transaction, do whatever you want to do with it, and then return it back with interest at the end of the same transaction. If you’re unable to return it, the flash loan protocol fails, failing the transaction, rolling back the whole set of actions as if nothing happened.</p>
<p>This only works because everything that happens within one transaction is atomic. It either all happens as described or nothing is saved to the blockchain state.</p>
<p>Having access to liquidity this cheaply opens a huge amount of opportunity, but also headaches. An example of a flash loan provider is <a href="https://aave.com/flash-loans">Aave</a>, with their, as of writing this, 0.09% fee.</p>
<p>There’s been a few examples of this causing issues. Offering anyone access to this much liquidity enables smart people to explore and exploit insecure protocols. Examples include <a href="https://medium.com/dragonfly-research/flash-loans-why-flash-attacks-will-be-the-new-normal-5144e23ac75a">a couple of attacks on the margin trading protocol bZx</a>, and more recently <a href="https://forum.makerdao.com/t/urgent-flash-loans-and-securing-the-maker-protocol/4901">an attack on the governance voting system used by MakerDAO</a>, the system behind the 2 billion dollar <a href="https://makerdao.com/">DAI</a> stablecoin.</p>
<p>Taking a step back, its not like flash loans themselves are causing these issues. Anyone could with similar liquidity, without using flash loans, trigger the same set of conditions. Instead, what flash loans enable, is firstly a very efficient tool to enable a lot of great things, and secondly an opportunity to highlight issues that need fixing in insecure or inefficient blockchain protocols. No hacks needed, they’re just pointing out the obvious.</p>
<p>A typical use case of where flash loans add much benefit to everyone involved is when you’d like to change the collateral used for minting DAI. With a flash loan you can cheaply get access to the liquidity needed to make this swap in one transaction, rather than the usual multi transaction setup. This brings more stability to the DAI ecosystem, and removes price movement risks you’d otherwise expose yourself to if you had to perform this swap over multiple transactions.</p>
<p>So flash loans are here to stay, and they’ll help shore up bad protocols, and enable more efficient financial transactions. Another example of where DeFi delivers tools not available in <a href="https://www.ledger.com/defi-vs-cefi-how-defi-measures-up">the old CeFi world</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><h2>Large range of annotation tools</h2><p>Add helpful informations to your screenshots that help guide your audience, using our online annotation tool. You can choose to use our simple point and click label creation tool that automatically creates an annotation label where ever you click on the screenshot, or you can choose from a number of professionally designed callout elements within the text tool. We've created sticky notes, annotations markups and even a great element for showing your audience what to do and what not to do. Our Draw Tool lets you draw arrows to direct your annotations and you can draw rectangles and circles that highlight important sections of your screenshot!</p><h2>Use text based annotations to provide context</h2><p>When you've picked your favourite set of annotation elements, the next thing that you need to do is add text to provide a context to the annotation you are making. We've made this super simple and easy to do in our online tool, all you need to do do is add the annotation element you like the look of, then double click to enter text editing and you just start typing away. Our elements either resize to fit the text you type or are elements like sticky notes that are kept limited on purpose to help you keep to the point and reduce the amount users have to read to understand whats going on.</p><h2>Customize your annotations for your brand</h2><p>Our annotation elements already look great and are designed to look professionbal and fit any situation you might use them for. However if keping to a brand design guideline is important to you then we've built in customization that allows you to make the changes you need to keep your brand on point. Use our easy to use and simple customization tools by clicking the element you want to update and play with the style options in the options pane that will appear. Update colours, text formatting and much more! Now you can place your screenshots on your branded website or email campaigns so that your customers recognise where the screenshot is from instantly!</p><h2>All our annotation tools are online</h2><p>Whatever device you are working from, there is no need for you to install any apps or software with Good Annotations. All our Annotation Tools are online and can be accessed by a browser like Chrome. This means our app works on your mac, windows, linux or even chromebook device. We also built our tools so that they are simple, no need for you to be a graphic designer to be able to use them. We tried to make our UI resemble applications you might youse on a daily basis like Microsoft Word or Google Docs. </p></div></div></div></div>]]>

    <p><a href="https://sketch.nono.ma/updates-are-available">Software, as fruit, rots.</a> If you leave it there for long enough it will go bad, and programs stop working. When the dependencies of a program and the environment in which it runs get updated, different pieces of code break. You need to re-write parts of it to make it compatible with the latest "breaking changes."</p>
<p>Code maintenance is a labor of love—and even more when your software is open source as other programs might rely on it.</p>
<p>The biggest platform to share and find open-source software is GitHub. The "stars" of a project are the code-equivalent to Instagram or Facebook likes, usually indicative of how likely a repository of code is to withstand the test of time, as they often represent not only the size of a project's community but how quickly code gets fixed when it breaks.</p>

    <span>“T</span>he Democratic Party,” wrote the late Walter Laqueur, was “liberal and slightly left-of-centre in outlook, progressive but not too much so, in favour of reform but afraid of going too far. . . . They had quite a few professors among their leading supporters and also some bankers and industrialists, but for the majority of academics . . . [it] was quite unacceptable.” Bourgeois parties “are never militant, almost by definition”—and the “Democratic Party was perhaps the least militant of all.”</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Central to its impotence, Laqueur believed, was “the mood of an activist younger generation.” An “unthinking, aimless radicalism,” which “preferred drums to speeches and parades to long and inconclusive discussions,” could “turn left or right or lead nowhere at all.” Not just on college campuses: “Contempt for ‘the system,’” its “vested interests, cliques, and party caucuses,” permeated the middle class. Leftists “attacked the Republic and all it stood for as something that was rotten through and through,” while conservatives thought “‘the system’ so corrupt that any political order that succeeded it would be an improvement”—even as they complained (correctly) that “the left was anti-patriotic.” Both sides “were unhappy, though for different reasons, with . . . the existing state of affairs.” “There was not the slightest willingness to take each other’s point of view seriously, let alone to compromise.” </p><p>That, at any rate, is how Laqueur saw Weimar Germany with the benefit of hindsight.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>
    <span>A</span>merica is not Weimar. We have not lost a World War or been forced to pay war debt; we’ve had 250 years of democracy, not 25; Trump isn’t Hitler, and Biden, whatever his faults, isn’t calling for communism. There is street violence, but a lot less of it—for unlike Weimar, we do not generally let paramilitary groups supplant the police, Seattle’s “autonomous zone” being the exception that proves the rule.
</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>But the exceptions are mounting. In Portland, protestors <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/protesters-attempt-create-autonomous-zone-portland-graffiti-smoke-pigs-precinct-1513743">attempted to create</a> an autonomous zone of their own by barricading the area with stolen property and blocking the exits of a nearby police precinct; “going to burn the building down,” one man threatened. In Minneapolis, a precinct actually did burn down after it was <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/protests-looting-erupt-again-minneapolis-area-following-death-george-floyd-n1216881">set ablaze</a> by “demonstrators,” two of whom (<a href="https://www.startribune.com/charges-minneapolis-brothers-destroyed-property-inside-third-precinct/571450752/">both white</a>) were subsequently charged. In Kenosha, riots claimed two lives and several more city blocks, which <a href="https://twitter.com/joshglancy/status/1299734436792197120">were</a> “indistinguishable from a war zone” by the time the dust settled. </p><p>And throughout the country, from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/nyregion/nyc-shootings-surge.html">New York City</a> to <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/criminal-justice/ct-chicago-police-six-month-crime-stats-20200626-wqsf3rebavaldex7v54ozqsnxe-story.html">Chicago</a> to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/davon-mcneal-shot/2020/07/05/16390c1a-bec6-11ea-b178-bb7b05b94af1_story.html">Washington, DC</a>, shootings have surged alongside looting—in some places, <a href="https://www.newsday.com/long-island/nypd-shootings-increase-1.46044819">by over 400 percent</a>—destroying lives and livelihoods in their wake.</p><p>On its own, this would hardly warrant comparison with Weimar. Crime and violence are as American as apple pie, and street fighting, though aesthetically German, has plenty of precedent in the U.S. What recalls interwar Germany is not the chaos itself, but the way it has been excused, even encouraged, by those notionally in a position to stop it—many of whom seem ambivalent about whether the republic it threatens deserves defense. Examples of this excuse-making include, but are not limited to:</p><ol><li>The true <a href="https://unherd.com/2020/07/the-ugly-truth-about-the-blm-protests/">but trivial claim</a> that the protests have been “mostly” peaceful.</li><li>The argument, made by a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/06/03/of-course-destruction-of-property-is-violence-299759">Pulitzer-winning <em>New York Times</em> journalist</a>, that “destroying property, which can be replaced, is not violence.”</li><li>A <a href="https://thenewinquiry.com/in-defense-of-looting/">widely-circulated essay</a>, written during the Ferguson protests of 2014, that defends looting as a “righteous,” attention-grabbing tactic in the fight against white supremacy. (The author subsequently elaborated her arguments in a <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2020/08/27/906642178/one-authors-argument-in-defense-of-looting">controversial interview</a> with NPR.)</li></ol><p>It is telling that, despite reaching the same conclusion, these excuses all contradict one another. If violence were extraordinarily rare (1), there would be no reason to deny its status <em>as</em> violence (2), or to defend its tactical value (3)—whereas if looting <em>weren’t</em> violent, if it didn’t disrupt or endanger life, its attention-grabbing power would be extraordinarily diminished. The contradictions suggest that elite alegality isn’t rooted in any specific principle, but rather a kind of inchoate radicalism: a vague, burn-it-down impulse increasingly common across the political spectrum, whose ends are drifting farther and farther apart. If the 2016 election <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/7/18/12210500/diagnosed-dysfunction-republican-party">seemed to confirm</a> the existence of “asymmetric” polarization, the 2020 tumult suggests that polarization can only remain asymmetric for so long. </p><p>And as the symmetries grow more apparent, the shadow of Weimar grows longer still. Much has been made—<a href="https://www.the-american-interest.com/2018/11/12/resilient-democracies/">too much</a>—of what are ultimately very weak parallels between Donald Trump and Adolf Hitler. But though<strong> </strong>Trump’s America looks nothing like Nazi Germany, it <em>has </em>developed echoes of the Republic from which Nazism arose—echoes that implicate the left no less than the right. Weimar was not, as is sometimes suggested, a good society beset by bigots and bad luck. It was a febrile, dysfunctional culture in which few voters, and even fewer elites, believed in the Republic they eventually dissolved. We often hear about the perils of “<a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/trump-impeachment-journalism/">bothsidesism</a>,” of treating “fascists” and “anti-fascists” as equivalent threats. Yet in the collapse of Weimar Germany, both sides played an important role.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>
    <span>T</span>o be fair, Weimar didn’t have a whole lot to work with. One of the things it did not have—or rather had stolen—was a well-defined founding. Officially, it began outside the German Reichstag on November 9, 1918, where the Social Democratic minister Philipp Scheidemann proclaimed the birth of the Republic. But unofficially, it began at Hohenzollern Palace two hours later, when the communist leader Karl Liebknecht proclaimed a Republic of his own—the first of many such putsches by Germany’s leftmost wing. The repeated attempts to overthrow the government, and the fact that the Social Democrats, like the communists, claimed to be committed Marxists, made it easy for the right to blame instability on the left, and for the masses to associate that instability with Weimar's socialist architects.
</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>But many republics, including ours, had violent foundings. What made Weimar special, as the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Weimar-Republic-Crisis-Classical-Modernity/dp/0809015560">historian Detlev Peukert put it</a>, was that it “was not marked by an event that served as an old-fashioned but politically unifying . . . moment in national history, along the lines of the American Declaration of Independence.” It had two competing proclamations, two rival origin stories, which meant that there was “no legitimizing founding ritual” to sustain “active commitment to the new order.” Germans did, of course, debate which story was the true one. That it was debated at all both signaled and intensified a profound lack of legitimacy, an open wound ripe for infection. </p><p>These disagreements—less about facts than about symbolism—did not mean collapse was inevitable. (Weimar survived the 1920s, after all.) But they did mean that there were few common reference points to rein in polarization, and more chances for insurgent ideologies—never mind actual insurgents—to gain steam. </p><p>Weimar had no shortage of radicals; centrists, on the other hand, were a dying breed. The intelligentsia fell roughly into one of two camps: leftists who hated everything about Germany, from its culture to its constitution; and rightists who hated the constitution because it was insufficiently German—which is to say, insufficiently authoritarian. The last group dominated the universities, whose reliance on public funds did not dampen their rancor toward the Republic. In fairness, those funds hadn’t stopped the academic job market from cratering after WWI, which meant that even the best-credentialed thinkers were often precariously employed. With few prospects in the existing system, the intellectual class saw little reason to defend it, and had an easy time rationalizing its destruction. The upshot was that college-educated civil servants typically hated the Republic they were serving, as did judges, policymakers, and educators. Ditto artists, journalists, and playwrights, though these professions skewed left. </p><p>Beyond their shared anti-Republicanism, all that the two sides had in common was their contempt for one another. The left derided the right as backwards-looking and chauvinistic, while the right derided the left as self-hating and unpatriotic—all of which, it must be said, was true. Kurt Tucholsky, Weimar’s leading leftwing satirist, complained that “the German spirit was poisoned almost beyond recovery,” and that “German democracy [was] a facade and a lie.” “There is no secret of the Germany army I would not hand over readily to a foreign power,” he bragged in 1931, a boast that did not exactly endear him to the people who took power in ‘33. Those people, of course, were just as Tucholsky described them: irredeemable, backwards bigots whose deaths could not come soon enough.</p><p>But the Nazis never won more than a plurality of the vote—and most conservative elites were not Nazis. (Indeed, several became their victims.) What united the right was not a particular political program, but a general sense of grievance against the far left and republican center, distinct groups it would often synonymize. Marxism, modernism, liberalism—these were all shades of the same thing, corruptions of the old order. An equal but opposite elision occured on the left, with the communists calling everyone to their right—including the Social Democrats—fascists, an unfair charge that many leftwing intellectuals nonetheless echoed. The result of these stereo-stereotypes was threefold.</p><p>First, they exacerbated Weimar’s crisis of legitimacy. If the Republic lacked a founding ritual, the elites were in no hurry to invent one; rather, the “center” was so widely anathematized that it effectively didn’t exist. In one case, <a href="https://www.warhistoryonline.com/instant-articles/communists-allied-with-nazis.html">the communists even endorsed a Nazi referendum</a> to overthrow the Social Democratic government in Prussia, on the theory that social democracy was a greater threat than National Socialism.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Learn more about data quality, its importance for your business, and how to improve it. </p><div><p>We’ve all heard the war stories born out of wrong data:</p><ol role="list"><li>Important packages are sent to the wrong customer.</li><li>Double payments are made to suppliers due to corrupted invoicing records.</li><li>Sales opportunities are missed because of incomplete product records.<br></li></ol><p>These stories don’t just make you and your company look like fools, they also cause great economic damages. And the more your enterprise relies on data, the greater the potential for harm.<br></p><p>Here, we take a look at what data quality is and how the entire data quality management process can be improved.</p><h2>What is data quality?&nbsp;</h2><p>Defining data quality is an elusive task. Even though we have an intuitive feeling that it relates to data of high standards, the exact definition is tough to pin down.&nbsp;Various institutions, academics, and industry experts have tried to specify the characteristics of data integrity in their definitions of data quality.&nbsp;<br>‍</p><p>For example, Fleckenstein and Fellows (2018) refer to high-quality data as data that<br></p><blockquote><em>"are fit for their intended uses in operations, decision making and planning</em>"</blockquote><p>In a similar vein, the National Institute of Standards and Technology defines data quality as:</p><blockquote>"<em>the usefulness, accuracy, and correctness of data for its application</em>"&nbsp;</blockquote><p>So, unless we are a student trying to pass an exam in data management processes, why do we care about these definitions?<br></p><p>It’s clear from the definitions above that both are oriented towards the pragmatic aspects of data quality. <strong>Having high-quality data allows us to plan, make decisions, and use data in various applications.</strong><br></p><p>But why does <em>this </em>matter?<br></p><p>Data quality has huge ramifications on the business’s bottom line. Having a clear understanding (definition) of what constitutes data quality allows us to measure and fix it.<br></p><p>Let’s dive deeper into why data quality is so important.<br></p><h2>Why is data quality important?</h2><p>The war stories mentioned in the introduction speak volumes about the importance of data. But the quality of data is important for a multitude of other reasons:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Data quality affects the bottom line</strong>. Low-quality or corrupted data will affect your business operations from a financial standpoint. From increased expenses when making mistakes (returns of goods sold, double invoicing, etc.) to loss of financial opportunities (negotiating lower supply costs, missing out on sales due to incomplete data or lack of customer trust, etc.), low-quality data costs more than it first might seem.</li><li><strong>Data quality affects trust in data</strong>. When issues with data quality are discovered, you lose trust. Customers may not trust you because you’ve made mistakes, while business leaders might not find the data reliable for decision-making. Whatever the case, low data quality has long-term damaging effects on the reputation of data and the people who take care of it.</li><li><strong>High-quality data is necessary for data products</strong>. We’re running businesses in an age when more and more products depend on data. Whether it’s applications that use customer data to provide services (financial investment apps, sports apps, etc.) to machine learning products that base their entire performance on data, having high-quality data for your product is the same as having high-quality fuel for your rocket ship. Unless the fuel is of a superior standard, the rocket is not going to fly. Or as machine learning engineers say: “Garbage in, garbage out.” Bad data is just not going to cut it. Ensuring that data is as good as it possibly can be is a prerequisite for a high-performing product line.<br></li></ol><h2>What are the common data quality issues?	</h2><p>There are as many issues with data quality as there are data experts with war stories.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Ask any data engineer or architect and they will gladly share how a database design or analytics implementation led to a massive business debacle.&nbsp;<br>To understand the recurrent issues surrounding data quality, we have to group these issues around common themes, which are known as the dimensions of data quality.<br></p><p>There are multiple dimensions of data quality which matter:&nbsp;</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Data accessibility or availability</strong>. Access to data is necessary if we want to analyze it and draw conclusions that lead to profitable business insights. Issues regarding data accessibility can happen at any stage along the <a href="https://www.keboola.com/blog/etl-process-overview" target="_blank">ETL pipeline</a>. Our data collection could be broken, skipping the import of some datasets into our database, or we could encounter a problem with sharing permissions, which prevents analysts from accessing the data required for their analysis. This also hinders the collaboration between different analysts because they lack access to the data that is needed to work together.</li><li><strong>Data accuracy or correctness</strong>. Accuracy refers to how well the data reflects the real world that it’s trying to describe. This characteristic of data quality is hard to specify in data-quality standards because accuracy issues take on many forms, from changing addresses that are not updated within customer records to misspellings and wrongful insertions. Data accuracy is usually asserted by applying business rules within the <a href="https://www.keboola.com/blog/etl-process-overview" target="_blank">data cleansing</a> process, which checks the data for correctness.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Data completeness or comprehensiveness</strong>. Missing data values always present an issue within data operations. Ensuring that the records are complete is one of the characteristics of high-quality data. During the <a href="https://www.keboola.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-data-cleaning" target="_blank">data cleaning</a> process, the data assets with missing values are either removed or they are imputed with the best estimates as replacements.</li><li><strong>Data consistency, coherence, or clarity</strong>. When two records about the same unit hold conflicting information, they are not just inconsistent - they also dampen your ability to make data-driven decisions. And let’s not even think about the regulatory compliance issues you can get into if your financial reports show inconsistent data...</li><li><strong>Data relevance, pertinence, or usefulness</strong>. You might have collected all of the data in the world, but it’s completely useless if it’s not relevant to your analysis and your business. Collecting relevant or useful data (and discarding the rest) is part of data quality assurance.</li><li><strong>Data timeliness or latency</strong>. How quickly is the data available to us? If there is a delay between collecting data from its data sources and analyzing it, we could lose out on the potential of real-time analytics. If the delays are even longer, we might produce reports before all of the data is available, thus painting an incorrect picture between what is reported (with missing data) and what is actually true (with delayed data).&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Data uniqueness</strong>. Some data is unique by design, such as the UUID number of your product, or the identity of your customers. The common issue in data quality is record duplication, whereby the same information is inserted multiple times. This issue usually arises during data entry, especially if it’s done manually.</li><li><strong>Data validity or reasonableness</strong>. Valid data are those that are in line with the business or technical constraints. For example, your customer is probably not 140 years old, so it’s likely that there’s a validity issue here. But validity does not just refer to semantic constraints (such as age). It also includes the distribution of data and its aggregated metrics. Looking at the mean, median, mode, standard deviations, outliers, and other statistical characteristics allows you to discern the validity of your data.<br></li></ol><h2>Who is responsible for data quality?</h2><p>Data quality is everyone’s business because good data quality allows everyone to trust the process and do their best work. However, depending on the type of operations you run, different people might be responsible for asserting high-quality data.<br></p><p>In enterprises and cross-organizational deployments, there is usually a data management team in charge of asserting data quality. The team comprises a data manager, who oversees the entire data quality assurance operation, as well as practitioners who resolve technical conflicts and data stewards. The latter are responsible for communicating data quality issues and problem resolutions across the silos within the business.<br></p><p>In smaller organizations, startups, and home-businesses, the responsibility often falls on the shoulders of the ‘data person’ (data scientist, business analyst, or data engineer) or someone from the IT department.&nbsp;<br></p><p>How do these teams and individuals achieve high-quality data? They go through the cycle of data quality management and improve it.<br></p><h2>How to improve data quality</h2><p>There is a process of best practices when improving the quality of your data:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Start by setting up a data governance framework</strong>. The data governance framework specifies which standards you will follow and what business requirements and rules need to be applied to achieve high-quality data. This also includes regulatory compliance, i.e. how your data quality practices fulfill the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and/or California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) regulations.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Set up KPIs or goals for data quality</strong>. Identify the data quality dimensions that need fixing and specify them as KPIs. A common way to assess how much ‘data accuracy’ has been improved is to measure the number of data assets (tables, databases, ETL pipelines, etc.) that you have checked for accuracy issues. Make sure that you also set up a logging system for data quality reporting.</li><li><strong>Profile data and establish a list of issues</strong>. Data profiling refers to the analysis of data which produces a report on data distribution, frequencies, central tendencies, and deviations. This can then be used in understanding the structural level of data. Use this and other analyses to compile a list of issues which need fixing.</li><li><strong>Fix the issues</strong>. It’s as simple as that - fix them. This is usually done by data practitioners (hands-on data managers, data engineers, and data scientists) by cleaning the data (we have written a long guide on the <a href="https://www.keboola.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-data-cleaning" target="_blank">best practices for cleaning data - check it out here</a>). Be sure to log every fix so that you can generate a report of …</li></ol></div></div>

<div id="abstract"><p>In this multi-part tutorial I'm going to show you how you can use cheap and "low end" hardware to build an amazing router with firewalling capabilities, DNS, DHCP and much much more, using the fantastic OpenBSD operating system. I am going to use a setup in which the router segments the local area network (LAN) into separate networks, one for the grown-ups in the house, one for the children, and one for public facing servers, such as a private web server or mail server. I'll also show you how you can use DNS to effectively block out most ads, porn, and many harmful websites on the Internet. Last, but not least, I'll show you how you can use the firewall to block outgoing telemetric data from computers running Microsoft Windows, NVIDIA graphics drivers, etc. The router can also be used on small to mid-size offices.</p><p>If you don't need a segmented network, but simply need a solid firewall and/or DNS server, you can still use the tutorial as I am going to guide you step by step introducing and setting up one solution at a time.</p></div>

</ul>

<h2 id="why-a-firewall">Why a firewall?</h2>
<p>Almost no matter how you connect to the Internet from your home or office you need a real firewall between you and the modem or router that your ISP has provided you with.</p>
<p>I have worked for quite some time in the ISP business and if there is one thing I can tell you for sure, it is that not only do they rarely keep your modem or router firmware up to date, they almost always use some of the most miserable products on the market.</p>
<p>One of the sources for most of the SPAM email on the Internet originates from consumer market modems and routers that has been compromised.</p>
<p>With a firewall between you and the Internet, meaning the modem or router from your ISP, you can not only protect your computers much better, but you can also monitor the traffic that comes and goes to and from your house, and you can react to situations that might call for an alarm.</p>
<p>Without a firewall between your local network and the ISP modem or router you could basically consider this an open door policy, like leaving the door to your house wide open, because you cannot trust the equipment from your ISP.</p>
<p>At one particular ISP I have even witnessed how some employees used to hack into customers computers using the services that the ISP provided. Of course the ISP didn't know that at the time, but this illustrates my point very well.</p>
<p>It is always a really good idea to put a real firewall between your local network and your ISP and with OpenBSD you get a very solid solution.</p>

<h2 id="the-hardware">The hardware</h2>
<p>You don't have to buy expensive hardware to get an effective router and firewall for your house or office. Even with cheap and "low end" hardware you can get a very solid solution.</p>
<p>I have build multiple setups using the <a href="https://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/Q1900DC-ITX/">ASRock Q1900DC-ITX</a> motherboard that comes with an Intel Quad-Core Celeron processor.</p>
<p><img src="https://unixsheikh.com/includes/img/asrock-q1900dc-itx.png" alt="ASRock Q1900DC-ITX motherboard"></p>
<p>I'll admit, it's a pretty "crappy" motherboard, but it gets the job done and I have several builds that have run very solid for many years on gigabit networks with full saturation and the firewall, DNS, etc. working "overtime" and the CPU hardly breaks a sweat. This is contrary to the extremely expensive Soekris, which people used to recommend, that typically ran less powerful Intel Atom processors not capable of saturating a gigabit network.</p>
<p>The ASRock Q1900DC-ITX motherboard has the advantage that it comes with a DC-In Jack that is compatible with a 9~19V power adapter, making it very power saving.</p>
<p>The ASRock Q1900DC-ITX motherboard is no longer sold, but I'm just using it as an example because I have used several of these boards in the past.</p>
<p>I have also used the ASRock Q1900-ITX (it doesn't come with the DC-In Jack) combined with a PicoPSU.</p>
<p><img src="https://unixsheikh.com/includes/img/picopsu.png" alt="PicoPSU power supply"></p>
<p>You can find different brands and versions of the PicoPSU, some are better quality than others. I have two different brands, the original and a cheaper knockoff, both performing very well and they save quite a bit of power contrary to running with a normal power supply that typically requires at least 10 watts more.</p>
<p>Lastly, I am using a cheap Intel knockoff quad port NIC found on Ebay like this one:</p>
<p><img src="https://unixsheikh.com/includes/img/intel-quad-nic.png" alt="Intel Quad NIC"></p>
<p>Now before you start condemning me for using low end hardware, I know it is better to use quality hardware, especially on a network that you care about, but this tutorial is about how you can get away with using fairly cheep hardware and still get an extremely useful product that will continue to serve you well for many years - at least that is my experience.</p>
<p>I recommend that you look for a low power mini ITX board with hardware <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/amd64.html">supported by OpenBSD</a> such as an Intel Celeron or Intel i3 processor. These boards are typically cheap, less power hungry, and they don't take up very much space. I don't recommend using the Intel Atom CPU if you have a gigabit network as they usually choke because they can't handle the amount of traffic, but your milage may vary. Also, I have never had any luck finding any useful AMD boards because the CPU usually would require much more power than the Intel counterpart - however my experience with AMD is mostly outdated and I haven't used AMD for many years. I also don't recommend older dual core Intel CPU's, they will work perfectly, but they also require more power.</p>
<p>Oh, and then you need a couple of cheap gigabit switches too for the segmented LANs, at least if you have more than one computer you want to connect to the same LAN :)</p>

<h2 id="the-network">The network</h2>
<p>A router is basically a device that regulate network traffic between two or more separate networks. The router will ensure that network traffic intended for the local network doesn't run out into the wild on the Internet and traffic on the Internet, that is not intended for your local network, stays on the Internet.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Just for information, a router is sometimes also referred to as a gateway, which generally is alright in layman's terms, but in truth a real gateway joins dissimilar systems. An example of a gateway would be a device that joins a PC network with a  telecommunications network.</p>
<p>In this tutorial we're building a router and we have 4 different but similar networks to work with. One is the Internet and the other three are the internally segmented LANs. Some people prefer to work with virtual LANs, but in this tutorial I'm going to use the quad port NIC from above. You can achieve the same result by using multiple one port NICs if you prefer that, you just have to make sure that you have enough room and free PCI slots on the motherboard. You can also use the Ethernet port on the motherboard itself, but it depends on the driver and support for the device. I have had no problems using the typical Realtek PCI gigabit Ethernet controller that normally comes with many motherboards even though I recommend Intel over Realtek.</p>
<p>Of course you don't need to segment the network into several parts if you don't need that, and it will be very easy to change the things I setup in this tutorial, but I have decided to use this approach in order to show you how you can protect your children by segmenting their network into a separate LAN that not only gets ad and porn blocking using DNS (all the segments gets that), but you can even whitelist the parts of the Internet you want them to have access to. The last part about whitelisting is difficult and generally not recommended unless your children are very small and only requires very limited access, but it is doable with some work.</p>
<p>This is an illustration of the network we're going to setup:</p>

<p>The IP addresses that begins with 10 are whatever IP addresses your ISP router gives you, in my case it looks similar to the above. The IP addresses beginning with 192 are IP addresses that we're going to use in our local network.</p>
<p>I have not dealt with any kind of wireless connectivity in this setup. Wireless chip firmware is notoriously buggy and exploitable and I recommend you don't use any kind of wireless connections if you can do without. If you do require wireless connections I strongly recommend that you disable wireless access completely from the ISP modem or router (if possible), and then buy the best wireless router you can find and put it behind the firewall in an isolated segment instead. That way should your wireless device ever be compromised you can better control the outcome and limit the damage. You can further setup the wireless router such that any devices connected to it have their own IPs that pass directly through the wireless router, but at the same time block traffic directly originating from the router itself. That way you can prevent the wireless router from "phoning home". You can also get a wireless adapter supported by OpenBSD and have your OpenBSD machine run as the actual access point, however I much prefer to segment the wireless part to either a separate wireless router or another OpenBSD machine serving as a wireless access point behind the firewall itself. Also, as of writing (as far as I know) none of the OpenBSD wireless drivers are fully without problems.</p>

<p>Many applications can be updated automatically and without any user interaction. This is commonly considered a good practice from the security point of view, since it allows for quick distribution of patches for critical vulnerabilities. However, automatic updates also carry an additional risk because they allow the software developers to push arbitrary code to users’ machines. Unfortunately, users often have no choice but to trust the developers that they will only use the update channel for its intended purpose and that they will protect it from malicious third parties.</p>



<p>In this blog post, we’ll show that this trust might sometimes be misplaced. Specifically, we’ll show how one torrent client and three adblockers surreptitiously installed the FakeMBAM backdoor through automatic updates. We reverse engineered this backdoor and describe its inner workings in the second part of this post.</p>



<h2>An unexpected infection vector</h2>



<p>We recently <a href="https://blog.avast.com/fake-malwarebytes-installation-files-distributing-coinminer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported on a fake Malwarebytes installer</a> that we detected on over 100,000 machines protected by Avast. This installer attempted to pass itself off as the legitimate Malwarebytes installer, mimicking it to a great extent – it was distributed under the same filename, it used the same icon and it created a Malwarebytes installation directory containing legitimate PE files digitally signed by Malwarebytes. However, that was all just a pretense, because the installer did not actually install Malwarebytes. In fact, the installer’s main purpose was to open a backdoor to attacker-controlled servers in order to give its operators the ability to push additional malicious payloads to the infected machines.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="829" height="509" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/map_logo.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/map_logo.png 829w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/map_logo-300x184.png 300w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/map_logo-768x472.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 829px) 100vw, 829px"><figcaption>A map illustrating the distribution of Avast users protected from the FakeMBAM backdoor. The backdoor is most active in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>In our first report, we stated that we did not know how this fake installer was being distributed. Since then, we spent some time reverse engineering the malware and investigating its infection vector. We found that the fake installer was pushed to the victims’ machines through automatic updates of one torrent client (<code>download[.]studio</code>) and three adblockers (<code>netshieldkit[.]com</code>, <code>myadblock[.]com</code> and <code>netadblock[.]com</code>). Listed on the websites of these applications are three different companies that are supposedly behind these applications, “Sigma Software”, “GRAND MEDIA, TOV” and “Birmon Software”. However, based on high code similarities and shared infrastructure (and on the fact that they all distributed the very same piece of malware), we consider it very likely that there is one actor behind all four applications.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Download Studio</h3>



<p>To investigate the infection vector used to distribute the fake installer, we first turned to the metadata that was submitted to us when we detected the installer in the wild. This provided us with two important clues: The installers were supposed to be executed with the command line arguments <code>/SP- /VERYSILENT /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES /NORESTART /NOCANCEL /NOICONS</code>, by a process named <code>dstudio-gui.exe</code>. The first clue suggested that the installer was not supposed to be spread through social engineering, because the above arguments instruct Inno Setup to install software silently in the background. The second clue hinted at the possible suspect: Download Studio.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="699" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_website-1024x699.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_website-1024x699.png 1024w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_website-300x205.png 300w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_website-768x524.png 768w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_website.png 1163w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>A screenshot of the Download Studio product page.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Download Studio is a free torrent client popular in Russia and Ukraine. It features an embedded library of torrent files, offering a wide selection of movies, software, video games, music and more. As is usually the case with torrent downloaders, there is a lot of copyrighted material that can be easily downloaded for free using this software, which seems to be the main reason why it is so widespread. Download Studio is detected by some anti-malware software as a potentially unwanted program (PUP) or as riskware, because it encourages illegal behavior and puts its users at risk through downloading torrents of unknown origin.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="639" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_screenshot-1024x639.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_screenshot-1024x639.png 1024w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_screenshot-300x187.png 300w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_screenshot-768x479.png 768w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_screenshot.png 1234w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>A screenshot of Download Studio’s movie library.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>To clear up some potential confusion, let us state that there is also another piece of software named Download Studio: <a href="http://www.conceiva.com/products/downloadstudio/default.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a download manager developed by Conceiva</a>. Apart from the name, this software has nothing in common with the torrent client described in this blog post and there is therefore no reason to doubt its legitimacy. In the rest of this blog post, the name Download Studio will denote the torrent client described in the previous paragraph.</p>



<p>Since Download Studio can be used to download various software, it would make sense to think that the fake Malwarebytes installer was distributed through it as a regular torrent file (after all there were 609 results when we searched for “Malwarebytes” inside Download Studio). However, that would not explain the command line arguments that we observed in the wild. They simply indicated that running the installer was not a user-initiated action and that the user might not have been aware of the installer at all. Furthermore, the number of users that we protected from the fake installer matched our estimates of the number of Avast users running Download Studio, which made it look like Download Studio itself was somehow responsible. Therefore, we decided to reverse engineer it to see if it contained hidden malicious code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We immediately found some evident code similarities with the FakeMBAM backdoor. Both Download Studio and the backdoor were developed using the Qt framework and they both used the very same string obfuscation methods. One of the obfuscation methods was particularly interesting, because it was not very effective at, well, obfuscation. It consisted of XORing the obfuscated string twice with the same mask, so the plaintext was clearly visible in the disassembly.</p>

<p>Other code similarities were found in a piece of code that computed HMAC of custom HTTP headers or in a piece of code that created scheduled tasks using the <code>ITaskService </code>COM interface. We also found that Download Studio contained a string with the exact command line arguments that we mentioned earlier. These arguments were used to execute application updates silently in the background. By reverse engineering Download Studio, we also found that the application updates are supposed to be executed from a temporary directory the name of which can be described by the regular expression <code>ds-\d{7}\.tmp</code>, which further matched our metadata from detections of the fake installer.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/EYMmgDsZBnHuIzdKo7GQt5DdYt6l7syDb4q3c1qFhXzhW4qMCp8SuY2yl0csbOzTBRbt-0p5zDqgY5X8BM4SdnQN1b1nSG7neF4-80rOm2-x9HK7ci-S7XagvX8tXUcUJQjwcmb-" alt=""><figcaption>Disassembled snippet of Download Studio, showing the code responsible for execution of automatic updates.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At this point, it seemed almost certain that the backdoor was distributed through the automatic updates of Download Studio. However, we wanted to be absolutely sure that this was the case, so we monitored the updates and logged the filename and hash of each observed update. This gave us the following list:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>SHA-256</td><td>filename</td></tr><tr><td><code>16d0559067f3cc0ab19e22b935ac90d44897f09f3426f858498dfd7e667c4bda</code></td><td><code>updater.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>1d77fdc7f1b1efc8bdb0938cacc713baa70a2549412ce0be18adf2ebd133cb70</code></td><td><code>updater-full.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>333dd34d3efc4ded71b36f5fc38bce67de71f80b7fab43358a36e8ba7d4df0f0</code></td><td><code>updater.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>5822d2b9717cc2a87ba54173587a3808e17f5961f42f5b1702c4a75950ecd4f6</code></td><td><code>updater.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>6754c5e7d3c03f4e2bf29b013b1a0d532b7f4e8e145da82e6973376785938f65</code></td><td><code>DS-updater-1.8.0.0-full.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>9c112b452ce839536a5cd4a3d8f4999adcb03dc3af5cbd86ca3a477c5b75127b</code></td><td><code>updater.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>b1acc87c7b010f4aafbe03cd70a6452679de07ef31bc2d5701de63d573654615</code></td><td><code>updater.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>b3359c92cd87bd39ecbf8159666f2c7e123903751654bb8aefd714e23f8e7f7f</code></td><td><code>updater.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>b4039b6a15af681d7c02d1ff798f41023a378668b32132761c8cdffd648a5a5d</code></td><td><code>DS-updater-1.8.0.0.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>c759c6fffe3d32424f8b29b58ee5cb11d68be5f27e50ba1d1a4755fb56602f7d</code></td><td><code>updater.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>dfb1a78be311216cd0aa5cb78759875cd7a2eeb5cc04a8abc38ba340145f72b9</code></td><td><code>MBSetup.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>f2caa14fd11685ba28068ea79e58bf0b140379b65921896e227a0c7db30a0f2c</code></td><td><code>MBSetup.exe</code></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Just based on the filenames alone, the last two entries immediately stand out. Indeed, while all the previous entries correspond to legitimate updates of Download Studio, the last two hashes are the fake Malwarebytes installers that we have been investigating. They were executed in the same way as all the other automatic updates, silently in the background and without the users’ awareness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This means that someone tried to infect all users of Download Studio with the FakeMBAM backdoor. While we do not know precisely what happened behind the scenes, there are three possible scenarios that come to mind. The first one would be that the developers of Download Studio wished to “monetize” their large install base in a very unethical way. Code reuse between Download Studio and the FakeMBAM backdoor would suggest that this could be the case. Another explanation is that the backdoor was spread by a group of rogue employees who acted without the knowledge of the rest of the company. Finally, it is also possible that some unknown attacker hacked Download Studio and carried out a successful supply chain attack.</p>



<p>We were looking for some answers and so we reached out to the developers of Download Studio, asking about the backdoor. They claimed that they detected a security incident on their continuous integration server in August 2020 and that they have since thoroughly investigated this incident and put additional security measures in place. They did not respond to our additional inquiries about how many of their users could be impacted by this incident and if they notified the impacted users.</p>



<h3>Adblockers</h3>



<p>Download Studio was not the only software that distributed the FakeMBAM backdoor. We also found three adblockers whose automatic updates were abused in the same fashion. These adblockers are NetShield Kit (<code>netshieldkit[.]com</code>), My AdBlock (<code>myadblock[.]com</code>) and …</p></div></article></div>

Adding often accrues more debt than subtracting, that’s the price we pay. Adding doesn’t save time, it lends time.</p></div></section></article></div>]]>

At once both darker and more hopeful than its predecessor, it is ruthlessly clear-eyed about the precise threats it identifies, and yet equally clear-eyed about the ways in which ordinary Christians ought to respond to them. Perhaps most significantly, the book feels uncommonly personal, thanks to its heavy reliance on the stories of Eastern European Christians who lived through the Soviet Unionâ€™s totalitarianismâ€”an analogy to the status quo that, as Dreher repeatedly points out, is admittedly imperfect, but that nevertheless provides a foundation for important reflections.</span></p><p><span>Much of </span><i><span>The Benedict Option</span></i><span> outlined an extended genealogy of the Western predicament (in the style of Brad Gregoryâ€™s </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Unintended-Reformation-Religious-Revolution-Secularized/dp/0674088050"><i><span>The Unintended Reformation</span></i></a><span>, Richard Weaverâ€™s </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Richard-M-Weaver/dp/022609006X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1YWMGX6DZ0I5U&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=idea+have+consequences&amp;qid=1596043224&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=ideas+have+%2Cstripbooks%2C268&amp;sr=1-1"><i><span>Ideas Have Consequences</span></i></a><span>, and Patrick Deneenâ€™s </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-Liberalism-Failed-Politics-Culture/dp/0300240023/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=3994184DHHDAN&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=why+liberalism+failed&amp;qid=1596043235&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=why+li%2Cstripbooks%2C270&amp;sr=1-1-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyQUhQMThJWEU4U0o5JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMDAzNzE1MVJaMlJCQ01LU09HQyZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNTY1NDA3MTg4M1E5MkI5STQ4USZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU="><i><span>Why Liberalism Failed</span></i></a><span>), but </span><i><span>Live Not By Lies </span></i><span>takes a different tack. This time around, Dreher sees danger ahead as a result of the confluence of three specific intersecting elements: cultural decadence and stagnation, a neo-religious progressive ideology, and the rise of â€œsurveillance capitalism.â€�</span></p><p><b>The Age of Decay</b></p><p><span>The American public, Dreher argues, is ripe for unrest. As a long line of social scientistsâ€”from </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bowling-Alone-Collapse-American-Community/dp/0743203046"><span>Robert Putnam</span></a><span> to </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coming-Apart-State-America-1960-2010/dp/030745343X/ref=pd_lpo_14_t_2/131-4027336-5851305?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=030745343X&amp;pd_rd_r=e9c8da75-0443-4cda-b566-2704261e1249&amp;pd_rd_w=vwR1j&amp;pd_rd_wg=FicQv&amp;pf_rd_p=7b36d496-f366-4631-94d3-61b87b52511b&amp;pf_rd_r=NH2ATV9JB56AGKC40PHQ&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=NH2ATV9JB56AGKC40PHQ"><span>Charles Murray</span></a><span>â€”has argued for years, American civil society has grown thin and deracinated. Rates of church attendance and community participation are down, fewer and fewer Americans have close real-life friends or host in-person gatherings, and an ever-increasing number of human interactions are channeled through a handful of powerful online platforms. (The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, of course, has only accelerated these trends.)Â&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Worse, faith in institutionsâ€”with the exception of the militaryâ€”has cratered. There is widespread cynicism, particularly among younger Americans, about the self-dealing of governmental branches, corporations, religious organizations, and countless other entities. It is increasingly difficult to see how a flourishing society can be built on foundations that are rottenâ€”or at least believed to be rotten by a large majority. Unless one accepts Ross Douthatâ€™s recent </span><a href="https://www.patheos.com/blogs/betweentwokingdoms/2020/03/the-decadent-society-misses-the-mark/"><span>argument</span></a><span> that the current state of â€œdecadenceâ€� can go on indefinitely, it certainly seems like something has to change.</span></p><p><b>The Great Awokening</b></p><p><span>Â&nbsp;</span><span>Nature, of course, abhors a vacuumâ€”and under conditions of socioeconomic stagnation and widespread disillusionment, itâ€™s only natural that nontraditional manifestations of human beingsâ€™ innate religious impulses have emerged.</span></p><p><span>To that end, Dreher discusses at length the emergence, within the last 5-6 years, of what a number of writers have called the â€œsocial justice movementâ€� (Dreher tends to use the pejorative â€œsocial justice warrior,â€� or â€œSJWâ€�) and what Wesley Yang </span><a href="https://twitter.com/wesyang/status/1130852792929677312"><span>describes</span></a><span> as the â€œsuccessor ideologyâ€�â€”the successor, that is, to liberal democracy. Philosophically, Dreher argues, this movement is loosely structured around five central tenets: (1) the central fact of human existence is power and how it is used; (2) there is no such thing as objective truth; there is only power; (3) identity politics sorts oppressed from oppressor; (4) intersectionality is social justice ecumenism; (5) language creates human realities.</span><span>Â&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This movement largely rejects what is seen as the â€œclass reductionismâ€� of orthodox Marxism (that is, its failure to emphasize other axes of oppression, such as race and gender), but nevertheless shares classical Marxismâ€™s commitment to a broad narrative of inevitable historical progress. Just as traditional Marxism represented itself as an â€œobjectiveâ€� science, the successor ideology frames itself as supra-ideological by generating reams of peer-reviewed material within academic disciplines that are </span><i><span>a priori</span></i><span> committed to its governing premises. And so, on this view, right-thinking and science-minded people have an absolute duty to help society move from a benighted history of oppression into a more just and equitable future, even if that future can only be vaguely conceived. (No slogan better exemplifies this than the ubiquitous demand that one stand on the â€œright side of history.â€�) For the committed activist, </span><i><span>everyone</span></i><span>â€”not merely isolated idealistsâ€”needs to be a part of that process.Â&nbsp;</span><span>Â&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>The Invisible Hand</b></p><p><span>As Dreher explains, the last few years have witnessed a rapid and (for those of a conservative temperament) alarming transformation of American capitalism. While for decades, companies adopted a fairly apolitical attitude toward public lifeâ€”as Michael Jordan put it, â€œRepublicans buy sneakers tooâ€�â€”recent years have taught that thereâ€™s good money to be made in adopting aggressive stances on political and cultural issues.</span></p><p><span>Nowhere, Dreher notes, has this tendency been more pronounced than in the world of â€œbig tech.â€� Not only are the largest tech companies accumulating unheard-of amounts of data on their users (a point Dreher draws from Shoshana Zuboffâ€™s </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Age-Surveillance-Capitalism-Future-Frontier/dp/1541758005/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2XPALZ08A8IAB&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=the+age+of+surveillance+capitalism&amp;qid=1596043284&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=the+age+of+sur%2Cstripbooks%2C179&amp;sr=1-1"><span>work</span></a><span>), but virtually every day brings another example of technology giants deploying their platform rules unevenly or in a discriminatory manner. Conservative opinion websites (well above Breitbart quality level) </span><a href="https://nypost.com/2020/07/22/ex-google-worker-says-bug-may-have-exposed-conservative-blacklist/"><span>mysteriously disappear</span></a><span> from Google search results. Amazon gives the Southern Poverty Law Centerâ€”which </span><a href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2020/05/21/conservatives-ask-amazon-to-end-splcs-role-as-hate-group-sheriff/"><span>labels</span></a><span> Christian organizations like the Family Research Council and Alliance Defending Freedom as â€œhate groupsâ€� due to their stance on LGBT rights issuesâ€”veto power over eligibility for its AmazonSmile charitable giving program. Twitter </span><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/unplanned-movie-twitter-account-briefly-suspended-1198343"><span>censors</span></a><span> pro-life accounts while </span><a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/as-twitter-checks-trump-khamenei-account-left-alone-despite-pleas-from-israel/"><span>permitting</span></a><span> Iranâ€™s Ayatollah Khameini to threaten the total destruction of Israel. On and on it goes, with no real end in sight.</span></p><p><span>In part, it seems to me, this patchwork pattern of enforcement is likely a product of the ungrounded approach to regulating free speech many tech platforms have adopted. The prevailing approach, it appears, is inclined to credit almost any claim asserted by enough people under the banner of â€œhuman rightsâ€�â€”an approach which tends to rule out any questioning or invalidation of a group-based identity one happens to claim. Conservatives, many of whom would hold that not all identity-based claims reflect legitimate human rights issues, are generally loath to expand the category of what counts as â€œhuman rights.â€� But arguments to that effect are easily framed as impediments to â€œprogressâ€� and expressions of â€œhateâ€�: who wants to stand in the way of â€œhuman rightsâ€� or be on the â€œwrong side of historyâ€� after all? And so, deprived of any real metaphysical underpinnings, the discourse ends up </span><a href="https://www.patheos.com/blogs/betweentwokingdoms/2019/11/is-human-rights-too-inflated-an-ideal/"><span>rigged</span></a><span> in favor of ever-more-expansive rights-claims, and ever-narrower boundaries of permitted expression.</span></p><p><span>Violation of those boundaries, of course, comes at a heavy price. Itâ€™s no wonder that, following a </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/stop-firing-innocent/613615/"><span>handful</span></a><span> of high-profile denunciations of ordinary people, â€œcancel cultureâ€� is in the </span><a href="https://harpers.org/a-letter-on-justice-and-open-debate/"><span>news</span></a><span> right now, Those not inclined to see the current Twitter-mob culture as a problem tend to treat these cases as isolated instances that do not reflect a greater trend. Perhaps. But it is not at all difficult to conceive of what a truly </span><i><span>totalizing</span></i><span> â€œcancel cultureâ€� might look like, or how close we are to that reality.</span></p><p><span>Imagine a world in which you are simultaneously fired from your job, cut off by banks and credit-card companies no longer wishing to transact with you, and denied access to any prominent technology platforms like Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Uber, DoorDashâ€”with the reasons for your â€œcancellationâ€� preserved in perpetuity. (Do you really think any of these companies would hold the line in the face of a social media activist avalanche?) Worse, the power of surveillance capitalism obliterates the possibility of simply moving to a new town, finding a new job, and reinventing oneself. You are abandoned into permanent nonperson status (unless …</span></p></div></div>

On October 27, 2020, Hashnode achieves <strong>Product of the day</strong> on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/hashnode-platform">Producthunt</a>.</p>
<p>Hashnode gaining popularity because of its unique features and easy to use. It has lots of built-in features that every technical blogger needs. Let's find out what makes hashnode different.</p>
<h2 id="free">Free</h2>
<p>Traditional blog websites require a custom domain and hosting. And it's not cheap. Setting up those and make it fully functional requires a lot of time and technical knowledge. As a beginner, you might not own a custom domain or any of those skills which require setup. To solve this problem, Hashnode offers you a unique subdomain, which allows you to publish your content totally free.</p>
<h2 id="custom-domain">Custom Domain</h2>
<p>Haahnode offers you to add your custom domain to your existing blog. You can set up a custom domain with a CNAME record. </p>
<h2 id="customization">Customization</h2>
<p>You can personalize and customize your blog as you need. You can make your blog look different by adding custom CSS. Not only custom CSS, but you can also add third-party widgets.</p>

<p>Hashnode has an amazing community. You can meet new people every day. You can get help from others or sharing your thought with others. Hashnode also offers you an exclusive <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/9KVywS">Discord Channel</a>, where you can directly talk with the founding members of Hashnode.</p>
<h2 id="learn-from-others">Learn from others</h2>
<p>On Hashnode, you can follow other developers. You can read their content and follow them so that your favorite writer publishes a post you get notified immodestly. </p>
<h2 id="draft-sharing">Draft Sharing</h2>
<p>I personally like this feature. If you are new to writing, you always feel that is it enough or lack something or fully explain what I wanted to. To answer all of those content, you can share your draft with others. They can read your draft and give you a lot of feedback.</p>
<h2 id="other-features">Other features</h2>
<p>Some of the other features are</p>
<ul>
<li>Get automated backups of your articles on your private GitHub repo</li>
<li>Use GitHub as a source for your articles</li>
<li>Automatic HTTPS</li>
<li>Fast CDN</li>
<li>Built-in newsletter service</li>
</ul>
<p>The good thing is that you can always request new features, which are implemented depending on usefulness. </p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you want to start publishing your own articles without worries and want an amazing community, Hashnode is for you.</p>

<div data-type-cleanup="true">
<p><a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a> is a cross-platform framework for building desktop apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. </p>
<p>In agricultural, industrial, and logistics integrated facilities, such desktop apps often need to read information from barcodes and QR codes printed on real-life physical objects. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images.postach.io/09bd0397-0710-42f1-8919-9b1de0319ead/ce07e1db-ca22-6788-0271-799da9a1db81/6c2930d7-e6bf-3f81-e9a3-c442058c2d6d.png"></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images.postach.io/09bd0397-0710-42f1-8919-9b1de0319ead/ce07e1db-ca22-6788-0271-799da9a1db81/82db0290-1e17-6945-cfda-5209bf26c0a6.png"></p>
<p>Such barcodes and QR codes are scanned with a barcode scanner such as <a href="http://www.zebra.com/DS4308">Zebra DS4305 Digital Scanner</a> connected to the computer with a USB connector.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images.postach.io/09bd0397-0710-42f1-8919-9b1de0319ead/ce07e1db-ca22-6788-0271-799da9a1db81/bc21ecf7-8096-0a7f-3769-7f7f85f0a99e.png"></p>
<p>Receiving the code into the Electron app turns up to be very simple. The scanner is viewed as a keyboard. </p>
<p>So if you have in the HTML an <code>input</code> element,</p>
<pre><code>&lt;input id="codeInput"/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>And we focus the program on the input field, using JavaScript,</p>
<pre><code>document.getElementById("codeInput").focus();
</code></pre>
<p>The scanner reads the code into the input field like it was typed in by the keyboard.</p>

So </span><a href="https://www.agorapulse.com/"><span>Agorapulse</span></a><span>, I know you told me you’ve got around $14 million in revenue, subject to exchange rate, because I know you calculate everything in euros, and you’ve got 7,000 customers and most of the customers are coming through your inbound efforts. So before we get there let’s talk about who you are and what you were doing before </span><a href="https://www.agorapulse.com/"><span>Agorapulse</span></a><span> and why did you start the company?</span></p><p><b>Emeric:</b></p><p><span>Thanks for having me.

So I also have the US passport which makes me a funny beast because I’m both American and French, which is a weird mix. I started my career as a business lawyer in 1995. So that’s my background. It didn’t last for long because I did that for five years and started my first company in 2000 with my co-founder Ben, who is still my co-founder today. So basically Ben and I started this company, the company behind </span><a href="https://www.agorapulse.com/"><span>Agorapulse</span></a><span> in July of 2000, 20 years ago. And, we’ve tried to be successful many many times, pivoting many different times as well, and eventually started the Agorapulse in November of 2011.</span></p><p><b>Hammad:</b></p><p><span>So Emeric, I am cutting you there. When you say that you are pivoting, what was the company you started in 2000. And what did you pivot to?&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Emeric:</b></p><p><span>It was a b2b SaaS already. It was called communities at the time. It did sound a lot like Facebook, but it was in 2000, it was in France, it was in French. So it was not a success. A lot of my friends keep telling me you invented Facebook for Facebook and I keep replying to them, the hundreds of people have invented Facebook before Facebook like Friendster, six degrees and </span><a href="https://myspace.com/"><span>Myspace</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>So a lot of people had this idea that social networking should be a thing before it was a thing and I always wanted them, but it didn’t work. And I was too early, we had debates with my co-founder at the time about the word social network, he didn’t like it. We launched that at a time when social networking was not a thing and people didn’t agree on what it meant so that it tells you something.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We did that until 2009, approximately. And, what we did in the meantime is we created a b2b Saas that was white labeled for brands. And that’s what we’ve lived with in terms of making revenue and money between 2001 to 2012. So basically we were customizing the affinities. That was the named solution, putting CSS, HTML, CSS, and different codes and SSO and that kind of stuff.</span></p><p><span>So a brand could create its own community of passionate people about anything or bloggers or stuff like that. An American company did the same thing. It was creating your own social network. That’s what we were doing. But we started that year before them.</span></p><p><span>And, I like to say that, Marc Andreessen was behind inc. And I like to say that I was as smart as Marc Andreessen as we both failed at creating a b2b Saas software that allows all people to create their own social networks and yeah in 2011, we were trying to sell this, build your own social network to brands.</span></p><p><span>And every brand I was talking to were like, nah, nah we go on Facebook and do something there. It was like an introductory 10 meetings like that. I told my co-founder that’s it, you know, we can’t fight Facebook. This thing is going to take over the world.</span></p><p><span>We heard do something on Facebook or we give up. I’m fed up of making little money. Just to give you perspective in 2011, our ARR was </span><span>€</span><span>140,000. That’s what I make in three days or four days right now. So that was my ARR back then. So it gives you an idea of, you know, how far we have come.</span></p><p><b>Hammad:</b></p><p><span>How much were you taking home at that time?</span></p><p><b>Emeric:</b></p><p><span>Nothing. I was not taking home anything. You can’t take home anything when you’re making so little money? My co-founder was getting a little because he was single and he had to. My wife was making some money and I had unemployment allowance for a while and I did other jobs on the side. So I always struggled for a long time.</span></p><p><span>It was years and years of being minimum wage, unemployment, side gigs. I did run companies for clients as a manager for several years where I was basically running their company from Monday through Thursday and doing mine on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So that’s kind of that kind of like until we got somewhere, we have </span><a href="https://www.agorapulse.com/"><span>Agorapulse</span></a><span> which broke even in 2015. And finally I was free.</span></p><p><b>Hammad:</b></p><p><span>Let’s talk about how you transitioned from your previous Saas company to this one. What was the product development strategy? How long did that take and how long before you actually achieve product market fit?</span></p><p><b>Emeric:</b></p><p><span>Well, you know, you have to realize that when you’re bootstrapped your product is always very limited, somewhat not great for a long time. so what the product looked like in the very early days, it was a Facebook contest and promotion. That’s what it was. And then, you know, we added a couple of components to reply to fake comments on the wall.</span></p><p><span>So basically it was only Facebook. It was mostly contest and promotion, because that was a big thing at the time. And we started making some money with that and we had some level of growth when we had some level of product market fit with that alone.</span></p><p><span>But then we realized that the customer churn was very high. Okay. What do we do? So the churn should not be too high because that was a point solution. Funny, you mentioned that in the conversation earlier we had. This book contest and promotion was not a system of record. It was a point solution and that’s not good.</span></p><p><span>So we said, how do we do, how do we become a system of record? We have to be the b2b Saas software that a job in the company is using on a daily basis, or at least on a weekly basis. What is this? It’s a social media management tool. It’s a tool where they go every day to reply to posts who do all that stuff.</span></p><p><span>Let’s do that. Who does that? Whose tweet was doing that at the time? </span><a href="https://sproutsocial.com/"><span>SproutSocial</span></a><span> was not even doing that because they were on Twitter only in 2012. Well it started as a Twitter only and then expanded to the other stuff. And we said, okay, we need to do that. So if we need to do that and stick to people, can they do that only on Facebook?</span></p><p><span>No, they’re not interested. We need to have at least Twitter. That was 2012. Again Instagram was not a thing, LinkedIn barely. And so we started to add Twitter to the mix and then it was okay, now we have Facebook, Twitter, what do you want? And then, they also want this and they also want that. And so in the early days when you bootstrapped, let’s say you’re 15% of where you should be to be a good decent legitimate player in the field of social media management tools, which is a system of record for social media managers or community managers and then because you’re bootstrapped your dev team is very very small. The dev team has been three people for a long time with three people between 2012 and 2013 for the beginning of 2014. So you move slowly because you have very little resources and your product is not perfect.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So I would tell you we had product market fit for a full blown social media management tool, it probably was the end of 2016. That means that before that growth is slow it’s there, but it’s slow and you lose a lot of business to big players who have raised money and stuff like that.</span></p><p><span>So you have to be ready to be very patient.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Hammad:</b></p><p><span>Emeric, a couple of questions. I mean, first of all, it’s amazing, you stuck with it for five years until you actually brought real traction, but it takes a lot of patience and you just have to stick with it. So from 2011 until 2012, you figured out that what you have in the Facebook contest is not going to be the sustainable business. My question is if it was customer feedback or you just figured out that, look, this is not gonna work.</span></p><p><b>Emeric:</b></p><p><span>We looked at the churn rate. We saw the churn number and we said, there’s no way this is a sustainable business 20% mrr churn every month. Ask …</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>In 2020, we were happy to have talked to <strong>94</strong> (!) remote tool companies about what they are up to. With more than a dozen we talked a little closer and many of them we've shown you. However, amongst the sea of amazing new innovations in the remote work space, we still found gaps.</p>
<p>Struggles we've heard from remote teams that don't have a solution yet. Solutions that are missing that little something to make them amazing. These are our wishes for the next year.</p>

<h2>Operations</h2>
<p>Running an internationally distributed team has a lot of challenges to overcome, but the most rigid of them all are international regulations and specializations when it comes to running a multi-national organization.</p>
<p>The operations side of remote work is usually deemed pretty unsexy. It's all about working with regulators, shaking hands and most likely an expensive journey to expand in a lot of countries. Hard work, but one that wouldn't go unappreciated.</p>

<h3>1. Better payment gateways for remote teams</h3>
<p>For how far we've come with remote work, we really haven't made a ton of strides with cross-continental payments. In my first-ever remote job, I used to get paid from a regular US corporate bank account directly to my swiss bank account. Payments got routed wrongly here and there, the fees were sky-high and the payments often took a week to get to me.</p>
<p>Since then, we've made a stride or two. With something like <a href="https://bit.ly/3kzvDyo">TransferWise,</a> you can make the whole process a little bit speedier and cheaper. Transfers now only take 1-2 working days and are fairly transparent. Even better: Fees and availability aren't confined to one nation, TransferWise is almost available anywhere.</p>
<p>Then, there are online wallets like Venmo and PayPal. They are really handy to guarantee instant transfers at a cheap price and are very handy for folks that are unbanked. Skipping the dusty banking infrastructure? All for it!</p>
<p>And then, of course, there's cryptocurrency. Now, Bitcoin &amp; co. were never meant to become investment instruments. In the past year, I asked to get paid for something through crypto twice. The payments were instant, extremely cheap (<em>I paid around $0.001 in fees</em>) and my bank didn't ask me about that weird big-money-transfer from the US. Now, if it only was easier to access.</p>

<p><img src="https://nohq.co/media/undraw_online_payments_luau.png" alt="" width="600" height="370"></p>

<p>So, how does the payment gateway of the future look like? Well, first of all, it should be accessible. Too many financial services are confined to the US, Canada and the UK. It should also be internationally receivable. While a bank transfer almost goes anywhere, I've heard multiple times now that people would prefer not getting foreign direct-to-bank payments to accounts in India, for example. The remote payment stack accounts for that.</p>
<p>Finally, waiting for your pay stub and then the money a couple of days later really doesn't fit in the internet age anymore. <strong>Maybe you can leverage cryptocurrency and existing infrastructure to create something instant, simple and internationally accessible?</strong></p>

<h3>2. Making 401k international</h3>
<p>When it comes to retirement benefits, many remote companies don't take it 100% seriously just yet and according to the latest surveys, employees don't mind either. With work-life balance as a commonly cited benefit, being remote in itself is an amazing perk. People are happy to take a pay cut or even let go of their retirement benefits.</p>
<p>Even if a company is <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/#general-and-entity-benefits">open to having a 401k</a>, doing it the "right" away is almost impossible with every country having its own system. From the <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pensionskasse">Pensionskasse</a> in Germany to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pensions_in_Japan">EPS</a> in Japan, countries run their own systems that are usually not accessible to foreign entities.</p>
<p>This might not seem important at first, but according to <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~vchern/papers/ch_401k.pdf">researchers at MIT</a> and multiple financial advisories, taking part in and maxing out 401k accounts (and subsequent alternatives in other countries) is a cornerstone to building life-changing wealth. For all personal finance lovers out there, not having that option may be a dealbreaker. Offering 401k and other retirement benefits is about to get a lot more important.</p>
<p>Our idea: <strong>What can a private company build within the regulations that allows for true, employer-matched and internationally available retirement accounts?</strong> Piggy-back off existing infrastructure and regulations? Sell gold bars and store them in a few storage units? Some sort of e-insurance? Again, cryptocurrency? We'd love to hear ideas.</p>

<h3>3. Benefits that are not only show</h3>
<p>For most remote companies, "perks" and "benefits" under the hood only mean a bit more money. In all remote jobs I've had so far, I've claimed my perk payouts as part of my regular salary payout. That means additional taxable income, not what perks are about.</p>
<p>Let me explain. A few years ago, my friend got hired at a very generous company local to us. He got a generous salary but was additionally able to lease a car through the company, set up a subscription for lunch delivery and for a while was even able to rent a room out of the company's real estate arm. The costs of that were deducted directly from his salary. As a result of that, he paid a few $1,000 less in taxes than in the previous years.</p>
<p>Many of those perks – from a company car to new Macbook – are much easier to reimburse in cash for remote companies, so no pre-tax perks at all. <strong>As a potential new service, what can you do to make this happen?</strong></p>
<p>One option is to hire through one of the many <a href="https://nohq.co/hire/">EOR services</a> that specialize in providing a full-service. For many companies that already have their payroll in order, that's not interesting though. You could save people multiple $1,000s in taxes here, so it's a service you don't have to sell for cheap.</p>

<h2>Communication</h2>
<p>Communication is still the king of all remote tools. Out of the many tools we've seen this year, probably 2/3 were in the communication and collaboration space of some sort. So, what gaps are supposed to still be there? Let's walk through it.</p>

<h3>4. All-hands meetings that work</h3>
<p>I believe meetings are largely figured out. This year, we've seen some iterations on the traditional meeting experience, but most of them are a minor improvement for teams that have an amazing product-fit. One thing that isn't solved yet is large, moderated all-hands meetings.</p>
<p>All-hands meetings are meetings that include all, or at least most of the company in the same meeting. The meeting experience is fundamentally different from your standard small group meeting: The speaker is in focus and other participants rarely speak.</p>
<p>The relationship between speaker and listener is quite clear – one speaker, many participants (often over 100) that should be able to speak when called to do so but not otherwise. The experience of such meetings has improved with new meeting software, compared to teams that had to make-do with Skype &amp; co., but it's still not seamless.</p>

<p><em>"At some point, to have everyone on a Skype call for an all-hands meeting, we would have two laptops set up next to each other and have one laptop call half the company and the other laptop call the other half of the company. That was nonsense ðŸ˜„"</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://nohq.co/blog/michael-fey-of-1password/">Michael Frey, VP Engineering at 1Password</a></strong></p>

<p>The last time I had an all-hands meeting on Zoom, things didn't go great. Some people called in and were unable to mute themselves. People tried to ask questions but got interrupted by either the speaker or another person in the audience.</p>
<p>With over 100 participants, latency was all over the place and the worst part – the meeting host had a disconnect at some point in the meeting and while the room was able to continue, the recording stopped there. A third of the team was not able to re-play the meeting.</p>
<p>I believe all-hands meetings warrant a new piece of tech that is rarely used – probably only for larger talks and announcements once a month – but works for that type of meeting every single time, including server-side recording, low latency, speaking requests and a larger range of moderation features.</p>

<h3>5. Communication &amp; Writing Training</h3>
<p>Communication and writing skills have been essential requirements for modern remote teams that largely rely on sparse and long-form communication. Many talented people struggle with that, are either not used or accommodated to typing a lot of simply prefer the face-to-face way of doing things.</p>
<p>Just like we build our knowledge worker's skills using education stipends, conferences, courses and books, we should also start looking into active communication training.</p>
<p>In the past, I have benefitted from coaching a lot in my career. Coaches have helped me push through some tough professional issues and have helped me build a small successful business. In the future, coaching will not only be interesting for hard skills but possibly even more soft skills. Getting continuous training in communication and writing will be popular with goal-getters and teams alike.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not necessarily advocating for plain and simple writing training. <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/">Grammarly</a> has put an automated writing coach in many author's pockets, but what if you could push that further? Remind you that you didn't give a status update in a while? Notifying you if your text lacks some context or reads passive-aggressive. Grammarly works great, even as I am writing this post, but it's not an end-to-end communication coach, just an integral part of it. <strong>We'd love to see something new in that space.</strong></p>

<h3>6. Asynchronous Brainstorm</h3>
<p>A consistent piece of feedback we've gotten this year is that teams struggle to find a good way to brainstorm new innovations. Remote work is amazing to get into a deep state, collect some thoughts and find new ideas, but when it comes to collaboration and getting those thoughts out, it gets more difficult.</p>
<p>The way we've learned to brainstorm in the professional world is using visualizations. We like to draw mind maps or sketch graphs on a whiteboard. Filling out the blank space can indeed yield new ideas and has helped really innovative teams come up with amazing ideas.</p>

<p><img src="https://nohq.co/media/undraw_miro_qvwm.png" alt="" width="600" height="407"></p>

<p>The options we have to do so across the globe are not always fitting to …</p></div></div>

<h2 id="flyover-country">Flyover Country</h2>

<p>When I was younger and my family finally made it <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/2014/05/upward-immigrant-toy-mobility-in-the-wild-1990s/">to the American middle class</a>, we went on vacations to Europe. Plane travel was a lot more boring in the days before cell phones, and I would spend a significant amount of any given flight tracking the progress of the tiny plane icon on the flickering screen. When Godthab, Greenland, and then the tiny dot labeled Reykjavik appeared on the legend, I knew we were close to our destination across the Atlantic.</p>

<p>For most traveling Americans, until very recently, Iceland was no more than a flyover destination. But the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%E2%80%932011_Icelandic_financial_crisis">2008 financial crisis</a>, the eruption of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyjafjallaj%C3%B6kull">Eyjafjallajökull</a>, and the filming of Game of Thrones <a href="http://icelandmag.visir.is/article/thingvellir-featured-first-episode-season-4-game-thrones">there</a>, combined with aggressive marketing and low pricing by Iceland’s two airlines have drastically improved Iceland’s standing on the map.</p>

<p>Today, if you talk to any pour-over coffee drinker living within driving distance of an Ikea, there’s a seventy-six bajillion percent chance they’ve been. Since over <a href="https://www.vox.com/new-money/2016/10/18/13261804/iceland-tourism-on-the-rise">1.5 million tourists hit Iceland last year</a> it really seems like everyone I know has either been, or is headed north.</p>

<p>In spite of all that, Iceland is still not a country Americans really pay attention to. I mean, we don’t care about most things that aren’t Kardashian, but Iceland, nestled way up against the Arctic Circle with a population smaller than Cleveland, can be easy to overlook.  As such, I had no preconceived notions going in. But, almost immediately I was won over.</p>

<h2 id="welcome-to-iceland-heres-some-júníus-meyvant">Welcome to Iceland. Here’s some Júníus Meyvant</h2>

<p>What amazed me the most was that there is a USB charging port right next to the TV screen of my Icelandair flight. I’ve flown an average amount, and nowhere yet have I seen this feature in economy class on American planes.</p>

<p>At first glance, this, seems like a totally banal yuppie thing to get excited about. But if you are flying with a smartphone, it’s a HUGE relief not to have to worry about charging in the airport where you land, saving battery, and generally running around like crazy on what should be your vacation or business trip. You just plug in, and you’re ready to go. It’s a really small thing that makes a huge difference in peace of mind for travelers.</p>

<p>As we boarded, Icelandair also played <a href="https://soundcloud.com/recordrecords/junius-meyvant-neon-experience-1">soft mood music</a> from a <a href="https://play.spotify.com/user/icelandair">Spotify playlist</a>. To someone who is used to traveling within the American flight culture, where you’re lucky if the flight attendants throwing $14 bags of peanuts at you hit in the general vicinity of your torso, it was all very new. And, of course, you could track the flight path on your phone free of charge.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/flightrack.PNG" alt="viking"></p>

<p>It so happened that we went to Iceland because Mr. B was invited to a bachelor party there.  In my day, these parties were held at local dive bars where the floor was more Miller Lite than laminate, but that was before Instagram. I decided to tag along for a couple days before the party, because Iceland was so close, and because it’s been a while since I’ve travelled further than the distance between the crib and the couch.</p>

<p>We got in at six in the morning, but even in my red-eyed haze, I could see just how pristine everything at Keflavík Airport was. My freshly-charged phone immediately connected to Iceland’s Vodafone network without a glitch.  “We’re here. Everything is clean and smells like Ikea,” I texted my mom.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/airport.png" width="400"></p>

<p>I had already booked a ticket on <a href="https://www.re.is/flybus/">Flybus</a>, which goes from Keflavík to Reykjavik, online, so all we had to do was get on and wait. I’ve never been brave enough to take public transportation from the airport anywhere I’ve been, including even Israel, where I speak the language, but the website made it so easy. The bus, like the plane, had Wi-Fi, a feature we’d see being offered again and again on buses, in cafes, restaurants, and bookstores, like a lure to trap urban Americans wearing plaid button-downs.</p>

<h2 id="iceland-is-for-humans">Iceland is for humans</h2>

<p>From the get-go, there were a lot of things in Iceland that seemed like they were out of a fairy tale about what an ideal human life should look like, at least from the perspective of someone living in the United States.</p>

<p>For example, on our first day, our guide from <a href="http://www.iheartreykjavik.net/">I Heart Reykjavik</a>, took us on a walk through Reykjavik, stopping at a small building that looked like something out of Goldilocks and the Three Bears. “That’s the prime minister’s office,” she told us. “No guards, nothing. He just goes about his work here.” We walked on, towards another two-story building that looked like an office for a small-to-medium business.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/Althingi.JPG" alt="viking"></p>

<p>It was the national Parliament, the Alþingi. “It’s made up of 48% women,” our guide said.  “We’re just short of 50%,” she continued ruefully. I have to admit, I had a sharp intake of breath. It sounded like an impossible miracle. But in Iceland, equality, and more importantly, humanity, shows itself in lots of different ways.</p>

<p>There is the USB charger so you don’t have to coddle your smartphone like an animal.  In the big picture, there is <a href="https://grapevine.is/mag/articles/2017/05/05/poll-most-icelanders-support-equal-pay-law/">gender equality</a>. Not only do women make up a large percentage of the workforce, but childcare is heavily subsidized, costing something like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/28/iceland-women-feminist-paradise-gender-gap-pay">$180 a month per child</a> for eight hours of childcare, including food. Mr. B and I personally pay $800/month, and I know our daycare is on the cheaper end.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/woke.JPG" alt="viking"></p>

<p>There is also a large <a href="https://grapevine.is/news/2017/05/03/only-3400-unemployed-in-iceland/">social safety net</a>, healthcare, and all the goodies that make Scandinavia – Scandinavia.</p>

<p>Additionally, I felt more like a treasured guest than a potential criminal when passing through Icelandic customs, more than I can say for my trip back to the country where I’m actually a citizen.</p>

<p>But there is a lot of humanity in the small things, too. For example, the tap water is not only potable, but delicious.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/water.jpeg" width="400"></p>

<p>When we went to buy a bottle of water at the supermarket, the clerk looked at us like we were crazy. “You know it’s the same thing in the tap,” she said, motioning for us to put the bottle back. The shower water smells like sulfur, because all of Iceland gets its cold water from a glacier, and hot water from <a href="http://wakeupreykjavik.com/the-icelandic-water/">geothermal heating.</a></p>

<p>Then, there’s the matter of the prisons. The <a href="http://www.icenews.is/2016/05/26/old-prison-in-reykjavik-center-gets-a-new-role/#axzz4gOqBvd8b">old town prison in Reykjavik</a>, which had no wire fence around it, or even bars on the windows, grew too small (it can only house 16 prisoners) and is being reconsidered for repurpose as a cultural center.  The current prison population of Iceland is <a href="http://www.icenews.is/2016/05/26/old-prison-in-reykjavik-center-gets-a-new-role/#axzz4gOqBvd8b">153</a>, or less than one tenth of one percent of the population.</p>

<p>Oh, and everyone speaks nearly perfect English.</p>

<p>It seems very, very hard to find anything wrong with Iceland. Until you get to the financial crisis of 2008, when the three largest banks folded, the currency plummeted, and unparalleled levels of corruption were exposed in the government, leading to massive unemployment and genuine fear and panic.</p>

<p>But even as large and traumatic as that <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/iceland-financial-crisis-bankruptcy-and-economy-3306347">devastating moment of extremely poor judgement for the country</a>, was, Iceland now seems to have passed it, i<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35485876">f not with flying colors</a>, at least with more wisdom and grace than the U.S. could muster up during its own fall.  It’s true that the krona has fallen and Iceland experienced a brain drain after the crisis. But it’s also true that a restructuring of the economy has led to a significant decrease in unemployment. The bankers that caused the 2008 financial crisis <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-03-31/welcome-to-iceland-where-bad-bankers-go-to-prison">are also in prison</a>, where they “spend their days doing laundry, working out in the jailhouse gym, and browsing the Internet.” “Sometimes they go horseback riding,” our guide said.</p>

<p>The economy has been on the upswing since 2011, particularly with a lot of strength in the tourism sector, which the Icelandic government is heavily pushing - probably the reason all my friends have known about it. The low cost of the airfare to Iceland relative to Europe or even the West Coast in America, thanks to the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/03/business/filling-a-trans-atlantic-air-niche.html?pagewanted=all">hub and spoke model</a> (Iceland is a huge place for flights from Europe and the United States to connect, thus maximizing capacity and optimizing costs for travelers), is huge.</p>

<h2 id="from-lice-to-nice">From lice to nice</h2>

<p>How did Iceland get to this point?  Originally settled in the 10th century by Vikings (and any <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/news/why-people-in-iceland-look-just-like-us-1.1104676">Irish slaves</a> they picked up on the way), the island was not a very hospitable place.  When the settlers first came, there were almost no native animal species, so they had to bring by boat all the livestock they could to survive. There were also few trees, meaning most houses were made of mud and turf. Life was simply miserable for the first thousand years of Iceland’s existence.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/thingvallir.JPG" alt="viking"></p>

<p>Also, the weather in Iceland is terrible. There are two seasons: rain, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laki">lava</a>. Exposed to both the Arctic wind and laid bare to all the vagaries of the Atlantic Ocean, it rains at least a little every day, in spurts. It was sunny for maybe 15 minutes that I was there. On a particularly windy day, we went <a href="http://eldhestar.is/">riding</a> on the <a href="http://www.visiticeland.com/things-to-do/activities/the-icelandic-horse">small, sturdy horses</a> that are descendants of the original horses the Vikings brought over (no imports are allowed to keep the purity of the breed), and all I could think about, instead of focusing on the beautiful, broody landscape of Hveragerði was about how many Vikings died of pneumonia and ear infections.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/us.JPG" alt="viking"></p>

<p>Things got marginally better over the centuries with more established trade routes, but as late as the the 1800s, men were climbing vertical cliffs plunging to the sea to steal sea bird eggs from ledges. Without these natural “pantries”, a large amount of Icelanders would likely have starved. If you weren’t killed by hunger, the climate, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Abductions">random Turkish raiding parties</a>,  there were always the eagles, one of the only native bird species to grace the island.</p>

<p>The economy really kicked into gear when exposed to the economic crosswinds of World War II, and, of course the British and the Americans. Once the economy took off, it’s been going. Iceland is now diversified away …</p></article></div></div>

<div>
    <p>Alan Kay, the inventor of the term “object-oriented programming”, told a story once during a talk more than 20 years ago. You can build a dog house using only a hammer, nails, planks, and just a little bit of skill. I figure even I would be able to build it given enough time. Once you've built it you've earned the skills and know-how, and could apply it to other projects. Next, you want to build a cathedral, using the same approach with your hammer, nails, and planks. It's a 100 times larger, but you've done this before — right? It'll only take a little longer.</p>

    <p>While the scale went up by a factor of 100, its mass went up by a factor of 1.000.000 and its strength only by 10.000. Inevitably, the building will collapse. Some people plaster over the rubble, make it into a pyramid and say it was the plan all along; but you and I know what really went on.</p>

    <p>Alan used this metaphor to explain a critical problem he saw with “modern OOP” 20 years ago. I think it still holds today: we've taken the solution to a problem — OO code — we've scaled it by a factor of 100, and expected it to work the same way. Today still, we don't think enough about architecture — which is rather crucial if you're building a cathedral — we use the OO solutions we learned without any extra thought. Most of us learned OO in isolation with small examples, and rarely at scale. In most real life projects, you cannot simply apply the patterns you've learned and expect everything to fall into place the same way it did with Animals, Cats, and Dogs.</p>
    <p>This reckless scaling of OO code is what cause many people to voice their disapproval of it in recent years. Personally I believe OOP is as good a tool as any other — functional programming being the modern-day popular contestant — <em>if</em> used correctly.</p>
    <p>My takeaway from Alan's vision is that each object is a little program on its own, with its own internal state. Objects send messages between each other — packages of immutable data — which other objects can interpret and react to. You can't write all code this way, and that's fine — it's fine to not blindly follow these rules.
        Still, I have experienced the positive impact of this mindset first hand. Thinking of objects as little standalone programs, I started writing parts of my code in a different style. I hope that, now that we're going to look at OOP, you'll keep Alan's ideas in mind. Don't blindly apply patterns and principles. Try to look at what you're building as a whole.</p>
    <h2 id="the-pitfall-of-inheritance"><a href="#the-pitfall-of-inheritance">#</a> The pitfall of inheritance</h2>
    <p>I found it difficult to believe at first, but classes and inheritance have nothing to do with OOP the way Alan envisioned it. That doesn't mean they are bad things per se, but it <em>is</em> good to think about their purpose and how we can use, as well as abuse them.
        Alan's vision only described objects — it didn't describe how those objects were created. Classes were added later as a convenient way to manage objects, but they are only an implementation detail, not the core idea of OOP. With classes came inheritance, another a useful tool when used correctly. That hasn't been the case though: the problem Alan tried to address 20 years ago still exists today.</p>
    <p>One of the acclaimed strengths of OOP is that it models our code in ways humans think about the world. In reality though, we rarely think in terms of abstractions and inheritance. Instead of using inheritance in places where it actually makes sense, we've been abusing it as a way to share code, and to configure objects in an obscure way.
        I'm going to show you a great example that illustrates this problem, though I want to say up front that it isn't my own: it's Sandi Metz's, a great teacher on the subject of OOP. Let's take a look.</p>
    <p>There's a children's nursery rhyme called “The House That Jack Built” (it's also a horror movie but that's unrelated).
        It starts like this:</p>
    <pre><code>This is the house that Jack built.</code></pre>
    <p>Every iteration there's a sentence added to it:</p>
    <pre><code>This is the malt that lay in
        the house that Jack built.</code></pre>
    <p>And next:</p>
    <pre><code>This is the rat that ate
        the malt that lay in
        the house that Jack built.</code></pre>
    <p>Get it? This is the final poem:</p>
    <pre><code>This is the horse and the hound and the horn that belonged to
        the farmer sowing his corn that kept
        the rooster that crowed in the morn that woke
        the priest all shaven and shorn that married
        the man all tattered and torn that kissed
        the maiden all forlorn that milked
        the cow with the crumpled horn that tossed
        the dog that worried
        the cat that killed
        the rat that ate
        the malt that lay in
        the house that Jack built.</code></pre>
    <p>Let's code this together, I'll be using PHP. We're going to make a program that you can ask a given iteration, and it will produce the poem up until that point. Let's do it in an OO way. We start by adding all parts into a data array within a class; let's call that class <code><span>PoemGenerator</span></code> — sounds very OO, right? Good.</p>
    <pre><code><span><span>class</span> <span>PoemGenerator</span>
</span>{
    <span>private</span> <span>static</span> <span>array</span> <span>$data</span> = [
        <span>'the horse and the hound and the horn that belonged to'</span>,
        <span>'the farmer sowing his corn that kept'</span>,
        <span>'the rooster that crowed in the morn that woke'</span>,
        <span>'the priest all shaven and shorn that married'</span>,
        <span>'the man all tattered and torn that kissed'</span>,
        <span>'the maiden all forlorn that milked'</span>,
        <span>'the cow with the crumpled horn that tossed'</span>,
        <span>'the dog that worried'</span>,
        <span>'the cat that killed'</span>,
        <span>'the rat that ate'</span>,
        <span>'the malt that lay in'</span>,
        <span>'the house that Jack built'</span>,
    ];
}</code></pre>
    <p>Now let's add two methods <code><span>generate</span></code> and <code><span>phrase</span></code>. <code><span>generate</span></code> will return the end result, and <code><span>phrase</span></code> is an internal function that glues the parts together.</p>
    <pre><code><span><span>class</span> <span>PoemGenerator</span>
</span>{
    

    <span>public</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>generate</span><span>(<span>int</span> $number)</span>: <span>string</span>
    </span>{
        <span>return</span> <span>"This is {$this-&gt;<span>phrase</span>($number)}."</span>;
    }

    <span>protected</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>phrase</span><span>(<span>int</span> $number)</span>: <span>string</span>
    </span>{
        $parts = <span>array_slice</span>(<span>self</span>::<span>$data</span>, -$number, $number);

        <span>return</span> <span>implode</span>(<span>"\n        "</span>, $parts);
    }
}</code></pre>
    <p>It seems like our solution works: we can use <code><span>phrase</span></code> to take x-amount of items from the end of our data array and implode those into one phrase; next we use <code><span>generate</span></code> to wrap the final result with <code>This is</code> and <code>.</code>. By the way, I implode on that spaced delimiter just to format the output a little nicer.</p>
    <pre><code>$generator = <span>new</span> <span>PoemGenerator</span>();

$generator-&gt;<span>generate</span>(<span>4</span>);




</code></pre>
    <p>Exactly what we'd expect the result to be.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Then comes along… a new feature request. Let's build a <em>random</em> poem generator: it will randomise the order of the phrases. How do we solve this in a clean way without copying and duplicating code? Inheritance to the rescue — right?
        First let's do a little refactor, let's add a protected <code><span>data</span></code> method, so that we have a little more flexibility in what it actually returns:</p>
    <pre><code><span><span>class</span> <span>PoemGenerator</span>
</span>{
    <span>protected</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>phrase</span><span>(<span>int</span> $number)</span>: <span>string</span>
    </span>{
        $parts = <span>array_slice</span>(<span><span>$this</span>-&gt;<span>data</span>()</span>, -$number, $number);

        <span>return</span> <span>implode</span>(<span>"\n        "</span>, $parts);
    }

<span>    <span>protected</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>data</span><span>()</span>: <span>array</span>
    </span>{
        <span>return</span> [
            <span>'the horse and the hound and the horn that belonged to'</span>,
            
            <span>'the house that Jack built'</span>,
        ];
    }</span>}</code></pre>
    <p>Next we build our <code><span>RandomPoemGenerator</span></code>:</p>
    <pre><code><span><span>class</span> <span>RandomPoemGenerator</span> <span>extends</span> <span>PoemGenerator</span>
</span>{
    <span>protected</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>data</span><span>()</span>: <span>array</span>
    </span>{
        $data = <span>parent</span>::<span>data</span>();

        <span>shuffle</span>($data);

        <span>return</span> $data;
    }
}</code></pre>
    <p>How great is inheritance! We only needed to override a small part of our code, and everything works just as expected!</p>
    <pre><code>$generator = <span>new</span> <span>RandomPoemGenerator</span>();

$generator-&gt;<span>generate</span>(<span>4</span>);</code></pre>
    <pre><code>This is the priest all shaven and shorn that married
        the cow with the crumpled horn that tossed
        the man all tattered and torn that kissed
        the rooster that crowed in the morn that woke.</code></pre>
    <p>Awesome!</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Once again… a new feature request: an echo generator: it repeats every line a second time. So you'd get this:</p>
    <pre><code>This is the malt that lay in the malt that lay in
        the house that Jack built the house that Jack built.</code></pre>
    <p>We can solve this; inheritance — right?</p>
    <p>Let's again do a small refactor in <code><span>PoemGenerator</span></code>, just to make sure our code stays clean! Let's extract the array slicing functionality in <code><span>phrase</span></code> to its own method, because that's a better separation of concerns — which we learned is a good thing!</p>
    <pre><code><span><span>class</span> <span>PoemGenerator</span>
</span>{
    

    <span>protected</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>phrase</span><span>(int $number)</span>: <span>string</span>
    </span>{
        $parts = <span><span>$this</span>-&gt;<span>parts</span>($number)</span>;

        <span>return</span> <span>implode</span>(<span>"\n        "</span>, $parts);
    }

<span>    <span>protected</span> <span><span>function</span> <span><span>parts</span></span><span>(int $number)</span>: <span>array</span>
    </span>{
        <span>return</span> <span>array_slice</span>(<span>$this</span>-&gt;<span>data</span>(), -$number, $number);
    }</span>}</code></pre>
    <p>Having refactored this, implementing <code><span>EchoPoemGenerator</span></code> is again very easy:</p>
    <pre><code><span><span>class</span> <span>EchoPoemGenerator</span> <span>extends</span> <span>PoemGenerator</span>
</span>{
    <span>protected</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>parts</span><span>(<span>int</span> $number)</span>: <span>array</span>
    </span>{

    <p>Can we take a moment to appreciate the power of inheritance?

We've even used SOLID principles to ensure that our code is decoupled so that it's easy to override specific parts. This is what great OOP is about — right?</p>

    <p>If we're extending <code><span>PoemGenerator</span></code>, we'll have to override both our <code><span>data</span></code> and <code><span>parts</span></code> methods, essentially copying code from both <code><span>RandomPoemGenerator</span></code> and <code><span>EchoPoemGenerator</span></code>.

<li><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2020/husky-ai-threat-modeling-machine-learning/">Attacks</a>: Some of the attacks I want to investigate, learn about, and try out</li>
</ul>
<p>A few weeks ago while preparing demos for my GrayHat 2020 - Red Team Village presentation I ran across “Image Scaling Attacks” in <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec20-quiring.pdf">Adversarial Preprocessing: Understanding and Preventing Image-Scaling Attacks in Machine Learning</a> by Erwin Quiring, et al.</p>
<p>I thought that was so cool!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-an-image-scaling-attack">What is an image scaling attack?</h2>
<p>The basic idea is to hide a smaller image inside a larger image (it should be about 5-10x the size). The attack is easy to explain actually:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attacker crafts a malicious input image by hiding the desired target image inside a benign image</li>
<li>The image is loaded by the server</li>
<li>Pre-processing resizes the image</li>
<li>The server acts and makes decision based on a different image then intended</li>
</ol>
<p>My goal was to hide a husky image inside another image:</p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/image-rescale-attack.gif"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/image-rescale-attack.gif" alt="Image Rescaling Attack"></a></p>
<p>Here are the two images I used - before and after the modification:
<a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/image-rescaling-attack-schoenbrunn.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/image-rescaling-attack-schoenbrunn.png" alt="Image Rescaling Attack"></a></p>
<p>If you look closely, you can see that the second image does have some strange dots all around. But this is not noticable when viewed in smaller version.</p>
<p>You can find the code on <a href="https://github.com/EQuiw/2019-scalingattack">Github</a>. I used Google Colab to run it, and there were some errors initialy but it worked - let me know if interested and I can clean up and share the Notebook also.</p>
<h2 id="rescaling-and-magic-happens">Rescaling and magic happens!</h2>
<p>Now, look what happens when the image is loaded and resized with <code>OpenCV</code> using default settings:</p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/image-rescaling-attack.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/image-rescaling-attack.png" alt="Image Rescaling Attack"></a></p>
<p>On the left you can see the original sized image, and on the left the same image downsized to 128x128 pixels.</p>
<p><strong>That’s amazing!</strong></p>
<p>The downsized image is an entirely different picture now! Of course I picked a husky, since I wanted to attack “Husky AI” and find another bypass.</p>
<h2 id="implications">Implications</h2>
<p>This can have a set of implications:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Training process:</strong> Images that poisen the training data (as pre-processing rescales images)</li>
<li><strong>Model queries:</strong> The model might predict on a different image than the one the user uploaded</li>
<li><strong>Non ML related attacks:</strong> This can also be an issue in other, non machine learning areas.</li>
</ol>
<p>I guess security never gets boring, there is always something new to learn.</p>
<h2 id="mitigations">Mitigations</h2>
<p>Turns out that Husky AI uses PIL and that was not vulnerable to this attack by default.</p>
<p>I got lucky, because initially Husky AI did use <code>OpenCV</code> and it’s default settings to resize images. But for some reason I changed that early on (not knowing it would also mitigate this attack).</p>
<p>If you use <code>OpenCV</code> the issue can be fixed by using the <code>interpolation</code> argument when calling the <code>resize</code> API to not have it use the default.</p>
<p>Hope that was useful and interesting.</p>
<p>Cheers,
Johann.</p>

<p>Firearms (guns) are one of the hot button issues in the United States and globally. I’m sure it is understandable why — pull the trigger and something dies. Killing is the primary purpose of a firearm. Naturally, this leads many to be fearful of firearms, but should people be fearful?</p>
<p>When I started writing this, I wanted to answer:</p>
<blockquote><p>Are firearms inherently unsafe?</p>
<p>Should firearms be banned, as many believe?</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s quite ambitious. One may believe you can just find an answer on a website / paper somewhere or is obvious. Unfortunately, the reality is far more complicated and has turned this into my longest article to date.</p>
<p>It’s been said,</p>
<blockquote><p>Guns don’t kill people, people kill people. <em>– unknown</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Many agree and many others strongly disagree. That divisiveness has made firearms a political issue, leading to a plethora of bias studies, inaccurate analysis, and more. Thus, to answer these questions I had to go through the data myself; I pulled <a href="#Data_Tooling">data from the CDC, FBI, RAND, Census and others</a> and completed my own analysis.</p>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Due to the nature of this analysis, it is important to highlight some items upfront.</p>
<p>1. The United States is often the focus throughout the analysis. This is because the United States has an abundance of firearms, a relatively uniform society and the most available &amp; accurate records.</p>
<p>2. This analysis focuses on general trends. Specific situations vary wildly, even in the same region: country, state, county, city, and neighborhood situations vary. As such, I caution making detailed / specific inference, beyond what the data explicitly shows (in the general case).</p>
<p>3. Some important data is lacking, such as socioeconomic status associated with crimes. This makes it very difficult to isolate confounding factors and leads to confusion / lack of definitive answer(s).</p>
<p>The goal of this analysis was to analyze available (and unbiased) data as in-depth as enabled, with no particular outcome in mind. <em>If new data comes in that materially changes what can be inferred, I’ll attempt to update the analysis.</em> With that in mind, I want to highlight that I dive into demographic information and I found some surprises. Politics seems to stifle this topic and in fact the truth. Instead I went to the data, I hope you can find it as interesting as I do.</p>
<blockquote><p>The truth is not for all men, but only for those who seek it.<br>
– Ayn Rand</p></blockquote>
<p>If anything in this analysis was missed,<strong> please feel free to reach out or leave comments.</strong></p>


<p>Globally, firearms are highly controlled, particularly in the Europe and Asia. In contrast, the United States has more firearms held by it’s citizens than the rest of the world combined.<a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country.png" alt="" width="1107" height="687" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country.png 1107w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country-300x186.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country-1024x635.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country-768x477.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1107px) 100vw, 1107px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country.png 1107w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country-300x186.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country-1024x635.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country-768x477.png 768w"></a>The real question — do the number of firearms really matter? From the graph above, it’s clear China, Russia and Iran have a high number of military firearms when compared civilian held firearms (and I suspect most civilian held firearms are former military, in countries such as China, Russia ,Iran, India, etc). In contrast, the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_World" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free world</a>” has an order of magnitude more civilian firearms, when compared to military firearms.</p>
<p>Clearly, what matters to “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">second world</a>” is having a large military arsenal, when compared to civilian held firearms.</p>
<p>It can be argued an unarmed society allows the military to impose their will, allowing countries to maintain the status quo and avoiding violent revolutions overthrowing the government.</p>
<h2><span id="Homicides_Firearms_Globally"></span>Homicides &amp; Firearms Globally<span></span></h2>
<p>In the “free world,” the main concern surrounding firearms are homicides &amp; suicides, with homicides being the most concerning. Below is a comparison of homicides by firearm deaths per 100,000 people across the globe.</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2.png" alt="" width="1228" height="677" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2.png 1228w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2-300x165.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2-1024x565.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2-768x423.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1228px) 100vw, 1228px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2.png 1228w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2-300x165.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2-1024x565.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2-768x423.png 768w"></a>When we compare the world, a few things become clear:</p>
<ol>
<li>The America’s, Caribbean and Africa have a much higher firearm homicide rate</li>
<li>The United States has the highest firearm homicide rate of a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first world</a>” country</li>
<li>Europe has the lowest firearm homicide rate globally</li>
</ol>
<p>What’s not clear, is whether or not firearms are really leading the increased firearm homicide rate.</p>
<p>Are homicides just naturally higher in these regions?</p>
<h2><span id="Firearm_Death_Rate_per_Firearm"></span>Firearm Death Rate per Firearm<span></span></h2>
<p>Below is an argument from the Amnesty International’s website:</p>
<blockquote><p>governments [with] poor regulation of the possession and use of <strong>guns lead to violence</strong> and that they must tackle this now through strict controls on guns and effective interventions in communities suffering high levels of gun violence.</p>
<p>– <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/arms-control/gun-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amnesty International</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The key statement is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Guns lead to violence</p></blockquote>
<p>The statement above implies a couple of things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gun volume and violence are correlated</li>
<li>As the number of guns increase, violence increases</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a few ways to invalidate / validate this statement. The clearest method is to simply compare firearm deaths per firearm. If firearms lead to more violence, we should see the ratio of firearm deaths to firearms (firearm deaths / firearms) staying constant (or growing at a constant rate). This ratio should stay or grow at a constant rate because as the firearm count increases, the firearm homicides should increase (keeping the ratio constant). We could also assume a direct correlation if “guns lead to violence” as it would probably occur at some constant rate.</p>
<p>Below you can see the comparison between firearm deaths and firearms:</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5.png" alt="" width="1313" height="687" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5.png 1313w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5-300x157.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5-1024x536.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5-768x402.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1313px) 100vw, 1313px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5.png 1313w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5-300x157.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5-1024x536.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5-768x402.png 768w"></a>As seen in the chart, the Caribbean, South America, Africa have a high number of firearm deaths per firearm, Columbia having one death per five hundred firearms. In contrast, “First World” (Europe and the United States) has a much lower number of fatalities per firearm, the United States having only one death per ten thousand firearms.</p>
<h3><span id="Firearms_vs_Homicide_Rate"></span>Firearms vs Homicide Rate<span></span></h3>
<p>For further evidence firearms aren’t correlated with violence, it’s possible to directly compare the number of firearms vs homicides:<a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5.png" alt="" width="1107" height="687" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5.png 1107w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5-300x186.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5-1024x635.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5-768x477.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1107px) 100vw, 1107px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5.png 1107w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5-300x186.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5-1024x635.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5-768x477.png 768w"></a>Across the bottom of the chart you can see all the countries with high homicide rates. The United States stands out clearly, if firearms were correlated with homicides we’d expect the U.S. to have many more homicides than it currently does. It does not appear more firearms are correlated with more homicides, in fact the trend line shows the opposite to be true (more firearms are correlated to less homicides).</p>
<p>For a final validation, we can compare firearms against homicides and firearm homicides against total homicides. Both should have a similar growth rate, if there was a correlation.</p>

<p>It’s important to note the graph is a logarithmic comparison for homicides and homicides by firearm (firearms per 100k Inhabitants are not logarithmic). The trend line comparison of Total Homicides and Homicides by Firearm is linear, but because the comparison is logarithmic, it appears exponential on the chart.</p>
<p>It is clear as homicides increase, homicides by firearm increase (blue data points). In contrast, when there are more firearms, homicides by firearm remain flat (purple data points), implying more firearms do not cause increase the number of homicides involving a firearm.</p>
<p>Further, you can see the blue star representing the United States homicide rate to homicide firearm deaths is right where it is expected. However, the purple star, representing the United States homicide rate to firearms per 100k inhabitants, is way outside the norm.</p>
<p>To summarize,</p>
<blockquote><p>Globally, as the firearm homicide rate increases, the total homicide rate increases; as the prevalence of firearms increase, the homicide rate <span>does not increase</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>The United States is clearly the largest holder of firearms in the world, most states have more firearms than entire countries. Fun fact:</p>
<blockquote><p>Texans and the Chinese military have the same number of firearms.</p></blockquote>
<p>Clearly, there’s a culture of gun ownership in the United States. When the United States was formed it had just fought a war of independence and regularly combated Native Americans, settling North America by force. Even today, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Guard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">United States National Guard</a> is one of the largest militias in the world.</p>
<blockquote><p>A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.<br>
–<a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-2/"> Constitution of the United States</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Without diving into politics, the constitution &amp; culture has enabled the United States to be relatively unique. Firearms are regulated, but just barely. Generally, citizens can do everything from carrying a firearms in public to purchasing assault rifles, flamethrowers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minigun" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">miniguns</a>, rocket launcher(s), etc. Often the only requirement is obtaining permit to own weapons, after that you can regularly purchase as many firearms as you’d like.</p>
<p>As seen in the previous section, the United States does have a higher (on average) number of firearm deaths. However, this doesn’t necessarily tell the whole story. In the prior section, we focused on the homicide rate. In the following sections, the focus will expand as uniform data collection, similar social norms and a widespread framework for law makes comparisons much easier.</p>
<p>Some topics we will explore here are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suicide vs homicide vs accidental rates</li>
<li>The type of weapons used in homicides</li>
<li>How demographics impact firearm fatalities</li>
<li>How firearm fatalities compare to other fatalities</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="Suicides_Homicides_in_the_United_States"></span>Suicides &amp; Homicides in the United States<span></span></h2>
<p>First, it is also important to highlight just how small the number of firearm related homicides really are, when compared to all deaths. On average, the total (suicide, homicide &amp; accidental) number of firearm related fatalities account for about 1.33% of all deaths in the United States (firearm related homicides account for ~0.44% of all deaths) and it varies wildly between states.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important item to discuss is that this is the “<em>firearm fatality rate</em>“, often conflated with the “<em>firearm homicide rate</em>” by political pundits. While all fatalities are unfortunate, most American’s would argue there is a different between <em>suicides</em> and <em>homicides</em>. Some states, such as Washington, support medically assisted suicides (for the terminally ill).</p>

</pre><p>We will be running the gateway on processor #1.</p><p>The lowest latencies can be achieved if we run clients on processor #4 and #5
since they reside on the same node as processor #1.</p><p>We will include an experiment to measure the cross-connect between the two nodes.
That can be achieved by running one of the clients on processor #3, for example.</p><p>Further readings</p><ul><li><a href="https://roq-trading.com/docs/tutorials/deployment/ubuntu/">How to configure an Ubuntu server</a></li></ul></div><div id="prerequisites"><h3>2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prerequisites</h3><p>Download Miniconda</p><pre>wget -N https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

<p>There’s a popular book called “JavaScript: The Good Parts.” And there’s a common meme around the relative size of that book versus “JavaScript: The Definitive Guide.”</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wIf3EJh.jpg"></p><p>Haskell is in my opinion a far more well designed and coherent language than JavaScript. However, it’s also an old language with some historical baggage. And in many ways it’s a bleeding edge research language that sometimes includes… half-baked features. And due to an inconsistent set of rules around backwards compatibility, it sometimes will break code every six months, and sometimes keep strange decisions around for decades.</p>

<p>After a request and some tongue-in-cheek comments in that thread, I decided a longer form blog post was in order. I’m going to start off by expanding on the four examples I gave in that tweet. But there are many, many more examples out there. If there’s more interest in seeing a continuation of this series, please let me know. And if you have pet peeves you’d like me to address, input will be very welcome.</p>
<h2>What is a “bad part”</h2>
<p>Very rarely is there such a thing as a language feature, function, type, or library that is so egregiously bad that it should never, ever be used. Null is of course the billion dollar mistake, but it’s still incredibly useful in some cases. So when I say that something is a “bad part” of Haskell, I mean something along these lines:</p>
<ul>
<li>A rarely-useful feature has been promoted to a position of prominence</li>
<li>A function has major downsides that are not documented</li>
<li>There’s an unexpected performance implication</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s a large tendency in the Haskell community to be overly literal in responding to blog posts. Feel free to do that to your heart’s content. But this caveat serves as a word of warning: I’m not going to caveat each one of these with an explanation of “yes, but there’s this one corner case where it’s actually useful.”</p>
<h2>Why attack Haskell?</h2>
<p>Since I’m a Haskeller and advocate of the language, you may be wondering: why am I attacking Haskell? I don’t see this as an attack. I <em>do</em> wish we could fix these issues, and I think it’s a fair thing to say that the problems I’m listing are warts on the language. But every language has warts. I’m writing this because I’ve seen these kinds of things break real world projects. I’ve seen these failures manifest at runtime, defeating yet again the false claim that “if it compiles it works.” I’ve seen these become nefarious time bombs that disincentivize people from ever working with Haskell in the future.</p>
<p>I hope by calling these out publicly, I can help raise awareness of these problems. And then, either we can fix the problems at their source or, more likely, get more widespread awareness of the issue.</p>
<p>Also, because it feels appropriate, I’m going to take a more jovial tone below. I personally find it easier to beat up on a language I love like that.</p>
<h2>foldl</h2>
<p>Duncan Coutts <a href="https://www.well-typed.com/blog/2014/04/fixing-foldl/">already did this one</a>. <code>foldl</code> is broken. It’s a bad function. Left folds are supposed to be strict, not lazy. End of story. Goodbye. Too many space leaks have been caused by this function. We should gut it out entirely.</p>
<p>But wait! A lazy left fold makes perfect sense for a <code>Vector</code>! Yeah, no one ever meant that. And the problem isn’t the fact that this function exists. It’s the <strong>name</strong>. It has taken the hallowed spot of the One True Left Fold. I’m sorry, the One True Left Fold is strict.</p>
<p>Also, side note: we can’t raise linked lists to a position of supreme power within our ecosystem and then pretend like we actually care about vectors. We don’t, we just pay lip service to them. Until we fix the wart which is overuse of lists, <code>foldl</code> is only ever used on lists.</p>
<p>OK, back to this bad left fold. This is all made worse by the fact that the true left fold, <code>foldl'</code>, is not even exported by the <code>Prelude</code>. We Haskellers are a lazy bunch. And if you make me type in <code>import Data.List (foldl')</code>, I just won’t. I’d rather have a space leak than waste precious time typing in those characters.</p>
<p>Alright, so what should you do? Use an alternative prelude that doesn’t export a bad function, and does export a good function. If you really, really want a lazy left fold: add a comment, or use a function named <code>foldlButLazyIReallyMeanIt</code>. Otherwise I’m going to fix your code during my code review.</p>
<h2>sum/product</h2>
<p>The <code>sum</code> and <code>product</code> functions are implemented in terms of <code>foldr</code>. Well, actually <code>foldMap</code>, but list’s <code>foldMap</code> is implemented in terms of <code>foldr</code>, and lists are the only data structure that exist in Haskell. “Oh, but <code>foldr</code> is the good function, right?” Only if you’re folding a function which is lazy in its second argument. <code>+</code> and <code>*</code> are both strict in both of their arguments.</p>
<p>If you’re not aware of that terminology: “strict in both arguments” means “in order to evaluate the result of this function/operator, I need to evaluate both of its arguments.” I can’t evaluate <code>x + y</code> without knowing what <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are. On the other hand, <code>:</code> (list cons) is lazy in its second argument. Evaluating <code>x : y</code> doesn’t require evaluating <code>y</code> (or, for that matter, <code>x</code>). (For more information, see <a href="https://www.fpcomplete.com/haskell/tutorial/all-about-strictness/">all about strictness</a>.)</p>
<p>“But wait!” you say. “What if I have a custom data type with a custom typeclass instance of <code>Num</code> that has a custom <code>+</code> and/or <code>*</code> that is in fact lazy in the second argument! Then <code>sum</code> and <code>product</code> are perfect as they are!”</p>
<p>That’s true. Now go off and write your own <code>lazySum</code> and <code>lazyProduct</code>. 99 times out of 100, or more likely 999,999 times out of 1,000,000, we want the fully strict version.</p>
<p>“But it doesn’t matter, GHC will optimize this away.” Maybe. Maybe not. Stop relying on GHC’s optimizer to convert horribly inefficient code into not efficient code. (But I digress, we’ll talk about why the <code>vector</code> package is bad another time.)</p>
<h2>Data.Text.IO</h2>
<p>I’ve already covered this one once before when I told everyone to <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2016/12/beware-of-readfile">beware of <code>readFile</code></a>. In that blog post, I talk about a bunch of <code>String</code> based I/O functions, especially the titular <code>readFile</code>, which is obnoxiously exported by <code>Prelude</code>. Those are bad, and I’ll reiterate why in a second. But <code>Data.Text.IO</code> is arguably far worse. The reason is that there’s pretty good awareness in the community that <code>String</code>-based I/O is bad. Even though the <code>String</code> part is the least of our worries, it does a good job of scaring away the uninitiated.</p>
<p>But <code>Data.Text.IO</code> is a wolf in sheep’s clothing. We’re all told by people who think they can tell people how to write their Haskell code (<em>cough</em> me <em>cough</em>) that we should exorcise <code>String</code> from our codebases and replace it in all cases with <code>Text</code>. Attacking the <code>Text</code> type is a topic for another time. But the problem is that by cloaking itself in the warm embrace of <code>Text</code>, this module claims more legitimacy than it deserves.</p>
<p>The only module worse in this regard is <code>Data.Text.Lazy.IO</code>, which should be buried even deeper.</p>
<p>OK, what exactly am I on about? Locale sensitive file decoding. It’s possible that this has been the number one example of a Haskell bug in the wild I’ve encountered in my entire career. Not the spooky memory leak. Partial functions like <code>head</code> randomly throwing exceptions are up there, but don’t quite rise to prominence.</p>
<p>You see, when you are dealing with file formats, there is typically an actual, defined format. YAML, XML, JSON, and many others give a lot of information about how to serialize data, including character data, into raw bytes. We want to be consistent. We want to write a file in one run of the program, and have it read in a separate run. We want to write the file on a Windows machine and read it on a Linux machine. Or we want to interact with programs in other languages that read or write data in a consistent format.</p>
<p>Locale sensitive file encoding and decoding laughs in our face. When you use <code>Data.Text.IO.readFile</code>, it plays a mind reading game of trying to deduce from clues you don’t care about which character encoding to use. These days, on the vast majority of systems used by native English speakers, this turns out to be UTF-8. So using <code>readFile</code> and <code>writeFile</code> typically “just works.” Using functions from <code>Data.Text.IO</code> looks safe, and can easily get hidden in a large PR or a library dependency.</p>
<p>That’s when all hell breaks loose. You ship this code. You run it in a Docker container. “Oops, you forgot to set the <code>LANG</code> env var, Imma crash.” But it’s worse than that. Typically things will work well for weeks or months, because it can often be a long time before someone tries to encode a non-ASCII character.</p>
<p>The same kind of thing happens regularly to Stack. Someone adds a new feature that writes and reads a file. The code passes all integration tests. And then someone in Russia with a weird Windows code page set and a Cyrillic character in their name files a bug report 2 years later about how they can’t build anything, and we sheepishly tell them to run <code>chcp 65001</code> or build in <code>c:\</code>.</p>
<p>Friends don’t let friends use <code>Data.Text.IO</code>.</p>
<p>“Oh, but <code>putStrLn</code> is fine!” Yeah, maybe. It’s also potentially slow. And it will throw a runtime exception due to character encoding mismatches. Just use a good logging library. That’s why we have one in <code>rio</code>.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Since so many people have asked: instead of <code>readFile</code>, I recommend using <a href="https://www.stackage.org/haddock/lts-16.20/rio-0.1.19.0/RIO.html#v:readFileUtf8"><code>readFileUtf8</code></a>, which is available from <a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/rio"><code>rio</code></a>.</p>
<h2>Control.Exception.bracket</h2>
<p>This is by far the least objectionable of the bad things in this list. I included it because the entire original tweet was inspired by a coworker telling me about a bug he ran into because of this function.</p>
<p>Async exceptions are subtle. Very, very subtle. Like, super duper subtle. I’ve devoted a large percentage to my Haskell teaching career towards them. Async exceptions are a concept that don’t truly exist in most other languages. They require rewiring the way your brain works for …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’ve always placed the user experience first, here at Skroutz. Since a performant application is essential for a seamless journey, speed has always been at our core.</p>

<p>Our rapidly evolving environment -the number of development teams, the adoption of new technologies, the addition of new features etc.- gradually slowed us down.</p>

<p>We knew we had to take action.</p>

<p>For this, we formed a non-typical task-force team to speed us up. We identified the problems, chose our measurement tools and methods and took the plunge.</p>

<p>Measuring performance is not an easy task. It involves both user perception and strictly defined metrics and thresholds.</p>

<p>In order to improve the speed, we tried various solutions. Some worked. Some didn’t. Below you can read in short the key takeaways.</p>

<p><strong>Assets</strong>. Our main goal was to optimize the number and timing of requests. By initially loading only the necessary above the fold images and fine tuning our lazy loading mechanisms, we noticed significant gains in terms of initial requests (almost half in our Product page and up to 30 less in our Listing) and therefore some worthy improvement in Speed Index metrics (in some cases up to ~4.5%).</p>

<p><strong>HTML</strong>. Excessive DOM size was one of our most critical performance bottlenecks. Our Product pages (the most important section) could reach up to ~8k nodes in some cases, far from Google’s proposal of 1,5k.<br>
We tried various solutions involving windowing (rejected), async loading product cards’ content and showing less user reviews (by risking losing valuable user generated content).<br>
What did make a huge difference was timing: Loading the information when it actually needed to exist. This was achieved by implementing a mechanism that would notify each card when it was about to appear in the viewport. The only element needed beforehand was a single-node placeholder. In some cases the DOM nodes were reduced by 45%, which results in an increase of ~10 points in our overall Lighthouse score!</p>

<p><strong>CSS</strong>. Although our styling architecture was in pretty good shape, we thought it might be worth trying critical CSS. The concept was to initially load only the necessary styles for rendering anything above-the fold. This would improve metrics such as First Contentful Paint &amp; Largest Contentful Paint while making the loading feel faster. It turned out that the above metrics were too slightly improved compared to the effort needed to add it in our pipeline. In short, this didn’t work for us.</p>

<p><strong>Javascript</strong>. Moving gradually from static to interactive pages caused code bloating, especially at the Javascript side. Our main JS file was including lots of libraries that were not used in every page. This is a problem, especially for mobile devices, due to the fact that JS runs in the main thread.<br>
Our actions, directed to reduce our webpack bundle size in order to release main thread calculations for the initial load, and iterate over the Redux architecture to improve speed after user interaction, led to slightly better performance.</p>

<p>During this journey, we also started addressing some issues on new <strong>Web Vitals</strong> user-centric metrics. We mainly focused on visual stability, by eliminating any layout shifts.</p>

<p>After a year’s work, we <strong>made Skroutz.gr faster</strong>. And more stable.</p>

<p>If you are interested in more details, and you’re ready for a deeper technical dive, make yourself a coffee and keep on reading (it will take ~30 minutes to read).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.skroutz.gr/" target="_blank">Skroutz.gr</a> was always a quite fast and sophisticated web application.</p>

<p>Speed has always been a critical component for <a href="https://www.skroutz.gr/" target="_blank">Skroutz.gr</a> since we believe
that for a modern web experience, it’s important to get fast and stay fast.</p>

<p>Historically, the biggest problem we were facing regarding speed (and the biggest blessing at the same time),
was the really huge amount of content (DOM) in some of our most popular pages, which contains a lot of shops and user-generated content, like reviews, questions, etc.
This problem becomes bigger and bigger as we add extra information for Products and Categories or extra services
(we have developed a <a href="https://www.skroutz.gr/ecommerce/landing">Marketplace functionality</a> where users can buy directly from Skroutz.gr).</p>

<p>Back in 2016, the huge DOM of some pages was causing crashes due to memory restrictions in some devices (i.e. iPad),
while at the same time the performance was poor, in terms of rendering and painting.
<a href="https://engineering.skroutz.gr/blog/Skroutz-redesign-how-we-designed-and-implemented-our-own-Design-System/#html" target="_blank">To solve these issues at that time</a>,
we started requesting and rendering elements asynchronously.</p>

<p>However, since <a href="https://engineering.skroutz.gr/blog/Skroutz-redesign-how-we-designed-and-implemented-our-own-Design-System/" target="_blank">our last major redesign in 2016</a>,
lots of things have changed.</p>

<p>Facts like the rapidly growing number of development teams, the adoption of new technologies (i.e. React js, CSS Grid),
the addition of more and more features in our pages, etc., led to worse rendering performance, despite the fact that today
there are better and more powerful devices our applications are running on.</p>

<p>Rendering speed took a backseat.</p>

<p>On the other hand, one of the main questions we’re regularly asking ourselves here at Skroutz, is whether our website responds to our users’ expectations and what we can do in order to help them with their buying decisions. When it comes to user experience, speed matters.</p>

<p>Today, consumers are more demanding than they’ve ever been. When they weigh up the experience on a site, they aren’t just
comparing it with their competitors, they’re rating it against the best in class services they use every day.</p>

<p>Being of “Moderate Speed” was not acceptable for us, so we decided to take action in order to resolve the issues.</p>

<p>We formed a non-typical task-force team, consisting of engineers, SEO-ers and product owners and we started working on,
in order to improve our speed.</p>

<p>In the following, we describe things we did, how we measured our actions, what worked for us, what didn’t work, and some
takeaways from our experience during the journey.</p>

<hr>


<p>Imagine you’re walking through an unfamiliar city to get to an important appointment. <br>
You walk through various streets and city centers on your way. But here and there, there are slow automatic doors
you have to wait for to open and unexpected construction detours lead you astray. All of these events interrupt
your progress, increase stress and distract you from reaching your destination.</p>

<p>People using the web are also on a journey, with each of their actions constituting one step in what would ideally be a continuous flow.
And just like in the real world, they can be interrupted by delays, distracted from their tasks and led to make errors. <br>
These events, in turn, can lead to reduced satisfaction and abandonment of a site or the whole journey.</p>

<p>In both cases, removing interruptions and obstacles is the key to a smooth journey and a satisfied user
[<a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/the-science-behind-web-vitals.html" target="_blank">chromium blog</a>].</p>

<p>When it comes to user experience, speed matters. A
<a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en/press-releases/2016/2/streaming-delays-mentally-taxing-for-smartphone-users-ericsson-mobility-report" target="_blank">consumer study</a>
shows that the <strong>stress response to delays in mobile speed are similar to that of watching a horror movie or solving
a mathematical problem</strong>, and greater than waiting in a checkout line at a retail store [<a href="https://web.dev/why-speed-matters/" target="_blank">ref</a>]. <br></p>

<p>Website performance is crucial to a web application’s success. <br></p>

<p>Amazon found that each additional 1/10th of a second of load time corresponded with a 1% reduction in sales.
Walmart found that for every second they improved their page load times they added an additional 2% to their conversion rate
[<a href="https://www.alphabetcreative.com/speed-matters-website-performance-and-perception/" target="_blank">ref</a>].
EBay saw a 0.5% increase in “Add to Cart” count for every 100 milliseconds improvement in search page loading time
[<a href="https://web.dev/shopping-for-speed-on-ebay/" target="_blank">ref</a>].</p>

<p>Besides conversion rates, you may know that <a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2018/01/using-page-speed-in-mobile-search.html" target="_blank">Google uses the performance of a website as a ranking factor</a> in search results as well!</p>

<p>In his book <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/books/usability-engineering/" target="_blank">Usability Engineering (1993), Jakob Nielsen</a>*
identifies three main response time limits.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>0.1 second</strong> — Operations that are completed in 100ms or fewer will feel instantaneous to the user.
This is the gold standard that one should aim for when optimising your websites.</li>
  <li><strong>1 second</strong> — Operations that take 1 second to finish are generally OK, but the user will feel the pause.
If all operations take 1 second to complete, a website may feel a little sluggish.</li>
  <li><strong>10 seconds</strong> — If an operation takes 10 seconds or more to complete, the user may switch over to a new tab,
or give up on the website completely (this depends on what operation is being completed.
For example, users are more likely to stick around if they’ve just submitted their card details in the checkout
than if they’re waiting to load a product page).</li>
</ul>

<p>* <em>Since these limits published back in 1993, as internet speed have increased and we are now browsing the web
at a lightning pace, there is a speculation that the upper limit is pretty smaller, close to 5 seconds or even lower.</em></p>

<p><strong>Takeaway: Performance is important</strong>! It can mean the difference between making a sale, or losing a customer to the competition.</p>

<hr>


<p>Performance is a foundational aspect of good user experiences.</p>

<p><strong>But what exactly is Performance?</strong></p>

<p>And how do we put a page in the fast or in the slow bucket?</p>

<p>Users of the web expect that the pages they visit will be fastly rendered, interactive and smooth.
Pages should not only load quickly, but also run well; scrolling should be stick-to-finger fast, and animations and interactions should be silky smooth.</p>

<p>Performance is more about user perception and less about the actual, objective duration.
How fast a website feels like it’s loading and rendering has a greater impact on user experience than how fast the website actually loads and renders.</p>

<p>How fast or slow something feels like, depends a lot on whether the user is actively or passively waiting for this thing to happen. Waits can have an active and passive phase. When …</p></div></div>

<p>“TIL” (<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=TIL">today I learned</a>) is an acronym I recently discovered (Example usage: “TIL what TIL means”). Since I’m ESL (<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ESL">English as Second Language</a>) I use the urban dictionary a lot to look up these acronyms. “TIL” turned out to be a very useful term, because it’s true: One never stops learning. And so it happened that I started this blog writing about <a href="https://jonnylangefeld.com/blog/python-flask-base-project">a Python Flask API</a> and continued with a three part series on <a href="https://jonnylangefeld.com/blog/how-to-write-a-go-api-part-1-webserver-with-iris">how to write a go API</a>. And while there is a lot of valuable information in those posts, today I am writing about what I learned since then and what my current set of best practices is to write an efficient and production ready API.</p>

<p>Reading many blogs myself, I sometimes miss context on given examples. So I published a sample repo which can be found on <a href="https://jonnylangefeld/go-api">github</a>. Every code example in this post links to the source lines of this repo.</p>

<p>The following paragraphs feature a large set of best practices and why I like them. Send me an <a href="https://jonnylangefeld.com/about#contactform">email</a> or tweet me <a href="https://twitter.com/jonnylangefeld">@jonnylangefeld</a> if you feel like something is missing!</p>

<p>With that out of the way, lets look into the <code>main.go</code> file.</p>

<h3 id="2-the-toolsgo-pattern">2. The tools.go Pattern</h3>

<p>I’m really a fan of managing tool dependencies also through go modules. That pins their versions and includes them in my vendor directory. Marco Franssen wrote in-depth about this pattern in <a href="https://marcofranssen.nl/manage-go-tools-via-go-modules/">this blog post</a>.</p>

<h3 id="3-command-line-flags-with-pflag">3. Command Line Flags With <a href="https://github.com/spf13/pflag">pflag</a></h3>

<p>There are many ways to work with command line flags and configurations in go. One can go fancy with <a href="https://github.com/spf13/viper"><code>viper</code></a> or stay simple with go’s built in <code>flags</code> package. I like <a href="https://github.com/spf13/pflag"><code>pflag</code></a> because of it’s simplicity and similarity to go’s own package, yet it offers POSIX/GNU-style flags making it more natural to use on your command line. The <a href="https://jonnylangefeld/go-api">sample repo</a> contains an example usage:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>init</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>pflag</span><span>.</span><span>StringVarP</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>addr</span><span>,</span> <span>"address"</span><span>,</span> <span>"a"</span><span>,</span> <span>":8080"</span><span>,</span> <span>"the address for the api to listen on. Host and port separated by ':'"</span><span>)</span>
	<span>pflag</span><span>.</span><span>Parse</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><sup>(<em><a href="https://github.com/jonnylangefeld/go-api/blob/v1.0.0/main.go#L22-L25">source</a></em>)</sup></p>

<p>Pflag comes with help built in:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ go-api -h
Usage of go-api:
  -a, --address string   the address for the api to listen on. Host and port separated by ':' (default ":8080")

</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="4-structured-logging-with-zap">4. Structured Logging With <a href="https://github.com/uber-go/zap">zap</a></h3>

<p>This is certainly an opinionated decision, but my favorite logger is <a href="https://github.com/uber-go/zap">zap</a>. It can be configured in all kinds of ways, but I like to keep it very simple. This is the configuration I use:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// configure logger</span>
<span>log</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span> <span>:=</span> <span>zap</span><span>.</span><span>NewProduction</span><span>(</span><span>zap</span><span>.</span><span>WithCaller</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>))</span>
<span>defer</span> <span>func</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>_</span> <span>=</span> <span>log</span><span>.</span><span>Sync</span><span>()</span>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p><sup>(<em><a href="https://github.com/jonnylangefeld/go-api/blob/v1.0.0/main.go#L34-L38">source</a></em>)</sup></p>

<p>Which gives me a beautiful log output like the following:</p>

<h3 id="5-graceful-exits">5. Graceful Exits</h3>

<p>This one is not ultimately necessary but I’ve seen it a lot and ensures cleanup tasks when the API is shutting down. A graceful exit is implemented by making a channel in the beginning of your program and listening for a certain event, like this one for a keyboard interrupt:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// gracefully exit on keyboard interrupt</span>
<span>c</span> <span>:=</span> <span>make</span><span>(</span><span>chan</span> <span>os</span><span>.</span><span>Signal</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
<span>signal</span><span>.</span><span>Notify</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>,</span> <span>os</span><span>.</span><span>Interrupt</span><span>,</span> <span>syscall</span><span>.</span><span>SIGTERM</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><sup>(<em><a href="https://github.com/jonnylangefeld/go-api/blob/v1.0.0/main.go#L30-L32">source</a></em>)</sup></p>

<p>At the end of the program, after starting the webserver in a go routine (see #5), we react to the signal:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;-</span><span>c</span>
<span>log</span><span>.</span><span>Info</span><span>(</span><span>"gracefully shutting down"</span><span>)</span>
<span>os</span><span>.</span><span>Exit</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><sup>(<em><a href="https://github.com/jonnylangefeld/go-api/blob/v1.0.0/main.go#L58-L61">source</a></em>)</sup></p>

<h3 id="6-log-version-on-startup">6. Log Version on Startup</h3>

<p>This one is also minor, but it turns out to be very useful to see the version by just reading the logs for debugging. It makes it clear which exact code base ran the code and resulted in a potential error.</p>

<p>The version is injected by using an unset <code>version</code> variable in the <code>main.go</code> file and setting it via the build command (for instance in your <code>Makefile</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>VERSION ?<span>=</span> <span>$(</span>shell git describe <span>--match</span> <span>'v[0-9]*'</span> <span>--tags</span> <span>--always</span><span>)</span>

build:
	@go build <span>-ldflags</span> <span>"-X main.version=</span><span>$(</span>VERSION<span>)</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><sup>(<em><a href="https://github.com/jonnylangefeld/go-api/blob/v1.0.0/Makefile#L1-L4">source</a></em>)</sup></p>

<p>In the <code>main.go</code> file you can use the version as follows (after instantiating it via <code>var version string</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// print current version</span>
<span>log</span><span>.</span><span>Info</span><span>(</span><span>"starting up API..."</span><span>,</span> <span>zap</span><span>.</span><span>String</span><span>(</span><span>"version"</span><span>,</span> <span>version</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="7-define-types-in-their-own-package">7. Define Types in Their Own Package</h3>

<p>Types should be reusable. Let’s say someone was to build a command line interface interacting with your API, they would appreciate if they could just import your API types. So we define types as <code>struct</code>s in <code>pkg/types/types.go</code> (we will get to the struct tags and the doc strings later):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Article is one instance of an article</span>
<span>type</span> <span>Article</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>// The unique id of this item</span>
	<span>ID</span> <span>int</span> <span>`gorm:"type:SERIAL;PRIMARY_KEY" json:"id" example:"1"`</span>
	<span>// The name of this item</span>
	<span>Name</span> <span>string</span> <span>`gorm:"type:varchar;NOT NULL" json:"name" example:"Skittles"`</span>
	<span>// The price of this item</span>
	<span>Price</span> <span>float64</span> <span>`gorm:"type:decimal;NOT NULL" json:"price" example:"1.99"`</span>
<span>}</span> <span>// @name Article</span>

<h3 id="8-chi-as-http-framework">8. <a href="https://github.com/go-chi/chi">chi</a> as HTTP Framework</h3>

<p>My http framework of choice these days is <a href="https://github.com/go-chi/chi">go-chi/chi</a> (upon recommendation by <a href="https://twitter.com/elsesiy">@elsesiy</a> - thank you!) for its light weight, idiomatic implementation, but mainly for its 100% compatibility with <code>net/http</code> allowing you to use any existing middleware.</p>

<p>Custom middlewares are very powerful. They are basically an injection into the sequence of handlers of the api and can do anything ‘along the way’. In this instance we know we are in a part of our router tree, that will always require the article object pulled from the database. So we inject a custom middleware, that does exactly that for us and injects it into the context of the request. The context is available through the entire handler chain, so for any succeeding handler our object will be available.</p>

<p>The following middelware is the <code>http.Handler</code> we used above via <code>r.Use(m.Article)</code> and injects the article object into the context.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Article middleware is used to load an Article object from</span>

October 28, 2020 | https://blog.frantic.im/all/todo-apps-are-meant-for-robots/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.frantic.im/all/todo-apps-are-meant-for-robots/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In&nbsp;my lifetime I’ve tried a&nbsp;dozen todo apps. In&nbsp;the&nbsp;beginning they all seem different, novel and&nbsp;special. Slick UI, shortcuts, tags, subtasks, the&nbsp;list goes on&nbsp;and&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>But&nbsp;all our stories were the&nbsp;same: I start using the&nbsp;new app, then after awhile I stop using it.</p>
<p>Up until the&nbsp;last week I thought the&nbsp;problem was in&nbsp;myself (you probably think so too). After all, <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/">David Allen</a> seems to&nbsp;have figured this shit out. Also there are people leaving long 5 star reviews on&nbsp;every major todo list app, they discuss them on&nbsp;forums, recommend them to&nbsp;friends.</p>
<p>But&nbsp;then I read <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Close_open_loops?stackedNotes=z5tiFxnNKMZCnc8G9R1N51L5hknyRGmyCQx18&amp;stackedNotes=z8aZybuJJopS5fL7TnPou2JcmCsBUJeqirbBh&amp;stackedNotes=z5vXaKVAPBNKAAi9RXNudduhyGadGXqtMVTEs">Andy Matuschak’s notes</a>, and&nbsp;it really resonated with me. What if I’m a&nbsp;left-handed person in&nbsp;the&nbsp;world of&nbsp;right-handed tools? All popular todo apps out there have the&nbsp;same problems:</p>

<ol start="1">
<li>Willpower needed to&nbsp;make decisions is a&nbsp;limited resource. And&nbsp;most TODO apps are lazy and&nbsp;don’t consider the&nbsp;impact on&nbsp;your willpower. You want to&nbsp;postpone a&nbsp;task? Please enter the&nbsp;exact date to&nbsp;postpone this to. Which project to&nbsp;add this to? Tags? Subtasks? The&nbsp;amount of&nbsp;things one can customize is really large, but&nbsp;making all this decisions has a&nbsp;cost.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Long lists are overwhelming. TODO apps are all about lists. And&nbsp;these lists tend to&nbsp;get large when the&nbsp;tasks inflow exceeds the&nbsp;tasks outflow (i.e. every modern knowledge worker’s queue). Looking at&nbsp;the&nbsp;ever-growing list of&nbsp;things that need to&nbsp;get done is not&nbsp;inspiring to&nbsp;say the&nbsp;least. As&nbsp;the&nbsp;lists get longer, there’s less and&nbsp;less chance that anything from it will get done, which also decreases the&nbsp;motivation to&nbsp;look into these lists. Removing stuff without getting it done is also painful, it requires a&nbsp;complex emotional and&nbsp;rational decision to&nbsp;be made (see the&nbsp;point about the&nbsp;willpower above).</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Sense of&nbsp;accomplishment is important but&nbsp;rare in&nbsp;the&nbsp;digital world. When you mark a&nbsp;task as&nbsp;done in&nbsp;your TODO app, it just hides it. That’s it, no&nbsp;reward, no&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;accomplishment (unless you make your own). I think that’s why some people like Trello or&nbsp;pen-and-paper TODO list: when you get something done, you can see a&nbsp;card moved or&nbsp;a&nbsp;text crossed out. An&nbsp;artifact that proves there was a&nbsp;task here, and&nbsp;now it’s done. Now you are one step closer to&nbsp;your goal.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>We need to&nbsp;trust our systems. GTD works only when you follow the&nbsp;rules. If you let your inbox grow unbound, the&nbsp;whole point about GTD gets lost and&nbsp;you also start losing trust in&nbsp;GTD. Another negative feedback loop. I’ve never seen a&nbsp;TODO app that lets you recover from this downward spiral.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>Tasks are not&nbsp;the&nbsp;same. Get milk, write an&nbsp;essay, plan a&nbsp;vacation, reconnect with a&nbsp;friend. These are things of&nbsp;different magnitude, different emotional connection, different context and&nbsp;time commitment. Some tasks aren’t even tasks, e.&nbsp;g. simply items to&nbsp;keep track of&nbsp;or&nbsp;be reminded of. But&nbsp;TODO apps treat them the&nbsp;same. They get the&nbsp;similar looking rows neatly organized in&nbsp;a&nbsp;unified interface.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li>Sometimes humans need help. A&nbsp;little nudge here and&nbsp;there can make a&nbsp;huge difference. It’s also very personal: different things work for&nbsp;different types of&nbsp;people. I’ve made a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;strategies to&nbsp;help me get things done, and&nbsp;ended up with 13 items (things like “extract the&nbsp;next smallest step as&nbsp;a&nbsp;separate task” or&nbsp;“work on&nbsp;it for&nbsp;just 2 minutes”). Thirteen! Guess how many nudges all my TODO apps have? Zero (except the&nbsp;deadline push notification reminder which just adds anxiety).</li>
</ol>
<ol start="7">
<li>Context is important. We are tired in&nbsp;the&nbsp;evening and&nbsp;have less willpower. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFwRkl-TTc">Getting a&nbsp;small task done first thing in&nbsp;the&nbsp;morning can boost our confidence and&nbsp;energy levels</a>. Work tasks are better be hidden during the&nbsp;weekend. Sophisticated TODO apps have the&nbsp;flexibility to&nbsp;do this, but&nbsp;they require a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;investment in&nbsp;configuration</li>
</ol>
<p>I now see all TODO apps as&nbsp;a&nbsp;shallow copy-pasta of&nbsp;the&nbsp;same rigid, inhuman, anxiety-inducing template.</p>
<p>But&nbsp;there’s hope!</p>
<p>In&nbsp;fact the&nbsp;advanced solution technology lies in&nbsp;the&nbsp;hands of&nbsp;productivity enemies: social media apps and&nbsp;games. Instagram, TikTok and&nbsp;Candy Crush have figured all this out. They know how to&nbsp;make you do something with very little willpower. They know how to&nbsp;present information in&nbsp;a&nbsp;way that’s not&nbsp;overwhelming. They give you rewards for&nbsp;doing things. Hints, nudges, suggestions.</p>
<p>I think there’s plenty of&nbsp;room for&nbsp;TODO innovations.</p>
<p>As&nbsp;for&nbsp;me -- I’m not&nbsp;registering a&nbsp;domain name for&nbsp;a&nbsp;new pet project. Not&nbsp;yet :)</p>

<p>Call me arrogant, but I’d rather optimize my indoor environment than try to spend more time in the capricious outdoors. I think it’s defeatism to give up on improving our indoor spaces and resign ourselves to the fickle weather and seasons. </p>
<p>If I was going to create an ideal environment for a human, I think there are several things I would include that we routinely fail to include in our homes and offices.</p>
<h3 id="lighting">Lighting</h3>
<p>Our indoor lighting situation usually sucks. The fact that “natural lighting” is a selling point in real estate shows how terrible a job we are doing in this department. We rely on the sun naturally providing us with sufficient light, and if it’s an overcast day or the days have grown shorter in the winter, then I guess we’re shit out of luck. </p>
<p>Usually, indoor areas are around 50-500 lux. This is hundreds of times dimmer than the sunlight. Clearly, we weren’t designed to thrive in such dim environments, and science does verify a connection between brighter light and alertness. If we don’t want to be sleepy like it’s nighttime, we shouldn’t light our rooms like it’s nighttime. For some, the effects of dim lighting go beyond simple lethargy and, especially in the winter, cause serious mood problems like seasonal affective disorder or the winter blues. This is common, but it’s not necessary. Bright light, particularly blue light, can also generally boost mood and may be a comparable stimulant to caffeine. (Those who are prone to mania should be careful, as intense light can trigger mania or hypomania in those predisposed.) Brighter lighting can also help circadian rhythm issues (which I, for example, have struggled with for years), both by entraining your circadian rhythm so your body better knows when it’s day, and by shortening it if it’s too long. </p>
<p>Lighting isn’t as expensive as it used to be, so we can do better than we have in the past. The cost of electricity for LED lighting is now negligible, and the only real factor is the cost of the bulbs themselves. Reaching for the full 100,000 lux of sunlight would still be prohibitively expensive, but going for at least 10,000 lux is doable with only a few hundred dollars. I won’t go into specifics here, but you can get more information on specific lighting setups <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hC2NFsuf5anuGadFm/how-to-build-a-lumenator">here</a> or <a href="https://meaningness.com/metablog/sad-light-lumens">here</a>. In particular, get bulbs with a color temperature close to sunlight (5600k), but make sure the bulbs have a <span>good<span>good means 90+</span></span> Color Rendering Index (CRI), otherwise the light will feel harsh.</p>
<p>I recommend putting any bright lighting you buy for your home on electrical timers so you don’t accidentally leave them on during the evening and screw up your sleep. You may also want to set your phone/computer brightness on a timer, if you can. The goal is to mimic the natural day/night cycle of our evolutionary environment, but without all the pesky volatility of nature. You can get programs like f.lux too, which reduce the amount of blue light emitted by your device in the evening, but in my experience this isn’t good enough and reducing the actual brightness of the device at night is also important.</p>
<p>“But what about vitamin D? Just go outside!” This is terrible advice, and I hear it too often. Sunlight is a powerful carcinogen, and vitamin D supplements are not, and they’re cheap. </p>
<h3 id="carbon-dioxide">Carbon dioxide</h3>
<p>Carbon MON-oxide is the deadly one you probably already have a monitor for in your house. Carbon DI-oxide is the feeble cousin of carbon monoxide, but it still has a negative effect on human health: <span>high (but common)<span>1,000 ppm or higher</span></span> levels impairs our ability to think. Just what you don’t want in an office. High levels may also have a negative long-term impact in other areas of our health. </p>
<p>Hold your breath. When it sucks and you decide to start breathing again, it’s carbon dioxide buildup, not lack of oxygen, causing you to feel panic and the need to breath. Carbon dioxide is a toxin. And we breath it out into poorly ventilated rooms, where the levels can rise to double or triple what they are <span>outdoors<span>around 400 ppm</span></span>.</p>
<p>Several studies have shown significant (temporary) cognitive impairments due to carbon dioxide levels over 1,000 ppm, but such levels are <span>common<span>I recently bought a carbon dioxide meter and found such levels in my home.</span></span> in poorly ventilated shared spaces. Fortunately, the solution is simple: open a window. Unfortunately, this doesn’t work when it’s raining, or when it’s too hot outside, or when it’s too cold outside… In particular, I have to contend with Canadian winters, which means opening the window is a valid strategy for a minority of the year unless I buy an expensive heat recovery ventilator. I don’t have a good solution for mitigating carbon dioxide buildup in the winter. Let me know if you do.</p>
<p>And, by the way, plants won’t work. They won’t suck up nearly enough carbon dioxide. You would need hundreds of plants per person, or roughly a dozen full-size trees per person, to offset the carbon dioxide exhaled by humans in a room.</p>
<p>A fun fact: if we don’t stop pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, then in about a century, carbon dioxide <em>outdoors</em> may reach cognitively impairing levels. Then what do we do? </p>
<h3 id="temperature-and-humidity">Temperature and Humidity</h3>
<p>High/low humidity and high/low temperature both lead to discomfort and lower scores on concentration measures. People generally have temperature under control, or at least it’s something they’re aware of. Humidity is less common to measure, but a $10 hygrometer should help you get your indoor space to the ideal 30-50% humidity range if it isn’t already. Air conditioners also tend to reduce humidity as well as temperature, so air-condition in the summer and use a humidifier in the winter.</p>
<p>At night, drop the temperature a few degrees if you can; It’s easier to sleep in a cool room. I wonder how many hours of sleep have been reclaimed already due to the advent of smart thermostats.</p>
<h3 id="background-noise">Background Noise</h3>
<p>I imagine this factor is more subjective than the others, but too loud is distracting, even aggrivating; too quiet makes your sniffles and sighs painfully audible to others, and so is distracting. Uneven background noise like traffic is worse than the uniform background noise of white noise or trickling water. Bad background noise leads to poorer cognition and focus.</p>
<p>It’s easy to be bothered by noise and not realize it until the noise stops and a wave of relief finally makes you aware of how annoyed you were by the sound. Noise issues are happily easy to control: earplugs or noise-cancelling headphones will generally do the trick. It would be utopic to eliminate bothersome noise from the environment altogether, but it’s not necessary. </p>
<h3 id="segregation-of-activities">Segregation of Activities</h3>
<p>A heroin addict who normally takes their dose in their car decides one day to inject in their bathroom. They die of an overdose, even though they took the same amount they normally do. Why? Our brains maintain associations with different environments. If you normally inject heroin when you get in your car, then your body starts to prepare you for the drug as soon as you get in the car. Drug tolerance, then, is partly environmental. (This <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1196296/">actually happened</a> and happens regularly.) Your mind and body are affected by your environment due to Pavlovian conditioning. When the bell rings, the dog salivates. When the lunch bell rings, so do you. </p>
<p>One common piece of advice given by doctors to insomniacs is to only use your bed for sleeping and for sex, and it’s good advice. If you use your bed for reading, studying, and watching TV, then your mind will not form a strong association between the bed and sleep, and you will have a harder time falling asleep. </p>
<p>Likewise, if you do all your slacking off at the same desk you do your work at, you will probably have a harder time focusing. Even having your smartphone within your field of view while you work has been shown to reduce focus. So it wouldn’t hurt to have different areas for work and play, and to not eat at your desk. (And even different user accounts on your computer for work and non-work, if you don’t find that idea to be a pain in the ass like I do.)</p>
<p>We also form associations not just with space, but with time. Hence another piece of common sleep hygeine advice: go to sleep at the same time every night. Your body will learn to expect sleep at that time. Likewise, people who eat at the same time every day eat with their bodies prepared to receive food, and so are less likely to become obese. Studies have shown this. Unfortunately, setting every aspect of your life to a clock can make you feel like a robot, so I usually don’t tolerate such rigidity in my life. But it’s worth thinking about.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<ul>
<li>Brighter lights for your poor eyes</li>
<li>Better ventilation for your poor lungs</li>
<li>Optimal temperature and humidity for your poor skin</li>
<li>Less distracting background noise for your poor ears</li>
<li>Activity-specific areas for your poor brain</li>
</ul>
<p>I also think the aesthetics of most of our indoor environments could use an upgrade, but I don’t have much to say on the subject besides simply saying so. (Though I would bet: green lush &gt; grey drab.)</p>
<p>We sometimes act like we are just <span>machines<span>caffeine in ⟶ code out</span></span>, but we are not. We’re mushy creatures with delicate bodies and delicate minds, too. And we evolved for one specific environment. There is no guarantee that the indoor environment which is cheapest to produce is going to be just as good for us as a bespoke imitation of our evolutionary environment, and in fact it is not. I think life would be more pleasant if people took these factors more serously when designing indoor environments, and our work would be more efficient and less prone to mistakes.</p>

<div id="dt-post-content">
<p>A recently published book in France warns about how digital devices are seriously affecting the neural development of children and young people.</p>
<p>The text is called <em>The digital cretin factory</em> and it was written by Michel Desmurget, director of research at the French National Institute of Health.</p>
<p>In an interview with the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-54554333.amp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC</a>, the author of the work, which has become a bestseller in his country, assures that today’s young people are the first generation in history with a lower IQ than the previous one.</p>
<p>“Researchers have observed in many parts of the world that IQ increased from generation to generation.  This was called the ‘Flynn effect’, in reference to the American psychologist who described this phenomenon.  But recently, this trend began to be reversed in several countries ”, says the researcher.</p>
<p>“In those countries, digital natives are the first children to have a lower IQ than their parents.  It is a trend that has been documented in Norway, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, France, etc. ”.</p>
<p>Although the specific factors involved in this phenomenon have not yet been determined, it has been proven that the time a child spends in front of a screen would have an important effect on their IQ.</p>
<p>Thus, according to the author, when the use of television or video games increases, IQ and cognitive development tend to decrease.</p>
<p>This would directly affect the main foundations of our intelligence, such as language, concentration, memory and culture in general, which would end up causing a significant drop in academic performance.</p>
<h2>Why is this happening?</h2>
<p>According to Desmurget, dependence on screens and digital devices is associated with a decrease in the quality and quantity of family interactions, as well as a decrease in the time spent on other activities that can be more enriching.</p>
<p>Sleep disruption, overestimation of attention, intellectual under-stimulation (the brain cannot unfold its full potential) and the adoption of an excessively sedentary lifestyle are also involved.</p>
<p>Michel Desmurget, with studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the University of California, criticizes the enormous amount of time that today’s children spend in front of digital devices.</p>
<p>“On average, almost three hours a day for 2-year-olds, about five hours for 8-year-olds and more than seven hours for adolescents,” he explains.</p>
<p>“This means that before reaching the age of 18, our children will have spent the equivalent of 30 school years in front of recreational screens or, if you prefer, 16 years of full-time work!  It is simply crazy and irresponsible ”.</p>

<h2><a href="https://chrisseaton.com/">Chris Seaton</a>, 28 October 2020</h2>


</header>

<p>There’s a proposal to add <em>Software Transactional Memory</em>, or <em>STM</em>, to the Ruby programming language. This is part of a wider effort to add better support for concurrency and parallelism in Ruby, and in particular the idea of <em>ractors</em>. A concept has been <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17261">proposed</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/3652">implemented</a> by Koichi Sasada.</p>

<figcaption>An animation of the algorithm we're going to use as an example of STM - we'll explain this later on</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This article gives some context on what STM is, how you use it, and why you might want to use it. We’ll show an application which is well-suited to STM and we’ll use this to talk about the benefits, issues, and some open questions.</p>

<p>We’ll finish by setting a challenge for STM in Ruby.</p>

<p>I wrote the first half of my PhD on STM, and the second half on Ruby, so I’ve got quite a bit of experience with both and the idea of their combination is very interesting to me.</p>

<h2 id="why-might-we-want-an-stm">Why might we want an STM?</h2>

<p>Let’s say we’re a bank managing many bank accounts. Each account has a total. We get a never-ending stream of requests to move a sum of money <code>m</code> from an account <code>a</code> to account <code>b</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_next_transfer</span>
  <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-=</span> <span>m</span>
  <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span> <span>+=</span> <span>m</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Something not everyone may know about Ruby is that <code>x += y</code> is equivalent to writing <code>t = x; x = t + y</code>. We’ll write that out in full to make that clear to ourselves.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_next_transfer</span>
  <span>a_balance</span> <span>=</span> <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span>
  <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>a_balance</span> <span>-</span> <span>m</span>
  <span>b_balance</span> <span>=</span> <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span>
  <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>b_balance</span> <span>+</span> <span>m</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ve got a lot of transfers to run through, so we’ll have multiple threads processing these transfers.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>n</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_next_transfer</span>
      <span>a_balance</span> <span>=</span> <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span>
      <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>a_balance</span> <span>-</span> <span>m</span>
      <span>b_balance</span> <span>=</span> <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span>
      <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>b_balance</span> <span>+</span> <span>m</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ve got a few problems here now. With all these threads running at the same time, what happens if two threads are putting money into your account concurrently?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>100</span>

<span># thread 1                        # thread 2</span>
<span>balance</span> <span>=</span> <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span>
  <span># balance = 100</span>
                                  <span>balance</span> <span>=</span> <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span>
                                    <span># balance = 100</span>
<span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>balance</span> <span>+</span> <span>10</span>
  <span># accounts[a] = 110</span>
                                  <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>balance</span> <span>+</span> <span>10</span>
                                    <span># accounts[a] = 110</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The two transfers have run, but your balance is 110. The other 10 has been lost - this is called a <em>lost update</em>, meaning it’s as if the update was never made.</p>

<p>Also consider what happens if the thread crashes after taking money from <code>a</code> but before putting it into <code>b</code>? The transfer would be applied partially and again we’d lose money.</p>

<p>We need to use some kind of <em>synchronization</em> on our accounts. Ruby has <em>mutual exclusion locks</em> or <em>mutexes</em>, so we can try using those.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>n</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_next_transfer</span>
      <span>locks</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>].</span><span>synchronize</span> <span>do</span>
        <span>locks</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>].</span><span>synchronize</span> <span>do</span>
          <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-=</span> <span>m</span>
          <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span> <span>+=</span> <span>m</span>
        <span>end</span>
      <span>end</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Does this work? What if we process a transfer from account 1001 to account 1002 on one thread at the same time as processing a transfer from account 1002 to 1001, so the other way around, at the same time?</p>

<p>The first thread will try to lock 1001 and then 1002. The second thread will try to lock 1002 and then 1001. If the first thread gets as far as locking 1001, and the second as far as locking 1002, then both will be waiting for the opposite lock and will never release the lock they already have. We will be in <em>deadlock</em>.</p>

<p>If we always acquired locks in the same order, by collecting them up first and sorting them, we could fix this.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>n</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_next_transfer</span>
      <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>].</span><span>sort</span>
      <span>locks</span><span>[</span><span>x</span><span>].</span><span>synchronize</span> <span>do</span>
        <span>locks</span><span>[</span><span>y</span><span>].</span><span>synchronize</span> <span>do</span>
          <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-=</span> <span>m</span>
          <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span> <span>+=</span> <span>m</span>
        <span>end</span>
      <span>end</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now in both transfers account 1001 is locked first and 1002 is locked second. That will work.</p>

<p>We have to make up a somewhat artificial requirement to explain the next issue, but consider if for some good reason we wanted to transfer to one account if we had a lot of money, and a different account if we only had a little money. Maybe if we’re rich this month we donate to charity, otherwise we unfortunately need to save for ourselves.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if account balance &gt; 1000
  transfer 10 to charity
else
  transfer 10 to savings
end
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll talk about accounts <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>, now, and a threshold of money <code>t</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>n</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>do</span>

<p>It’s starting to get very complicated. And this locks more than it needs to - it locks both <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> but then only uses one of them. If you use <code>b</code> in the end, ideally another thread could be serving a transfer to <code>c</code> at the same time, but you’ve locked it and it can’t. Imagine if instead of two potential accounts it was thousands and you had to lock them all. Imagine if you couldn’t work out at all which account you’d be transferring to until you started the transfer - then you’d never be able to process two transfers at the same time.</p>

<p>At this point as well we’re likely to start to make errors trying to do all this locking and ordering of locks and things.</p>

<p>Stepping back and taking it all in, we can draw up some requirements for what we need.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>atomicity</em> - that all writes in the transfer are applied or none are applied</li>
  <li><em>consistency</em> - meaning that our data structures are always valid - the total sum of money never changes</li>
  <li><em>isolation</em> - meaning one transfer does not interfere with another</li>
  <li><em>durability</em> - meaning that when applied the transfer is available to all subsequent transactions</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally a library or the language could do this all for us. We’d like to be able to write almost what we originally wrote, but with just an annotation to make the code inside a block atomic, consistent, isolated, and the result durable.</p>

<p>This is what a <em>transactional</em> memory can let us do. It will automatically monitor what you read and write inside the <code>atomically</code> block, which is a <em>transaction</em>, and will make sure it is either applied fully or not, that the balance of the whole system is always consistent, that transactions do not see the result of each other partially applied, and that writes appear and stay.</p>

<p>It may be implemented using the code we eventually arrived at ourselves, or it could do something else instead. In practice how it is often implemented is that
reads and writes are stored in a log, then at the end the transaction works out if anyone else has written locations that you’ve read. If they have then the values you read are no longer valid, so your transaction <em>conflicts</em> with another, is <em>aborted</em> and retries, reading the locations again. When it eventually does not conflict with any other transactions it is <em>committed</em> and succeeds. This means you don’t need to lock everything up-front, which means you avoid the problem of what happens if you may potentially need every account. Locking everything up-front is called <em>pessimistic locking</em>. We’re moving to <em>optimistic locking</em></p>

<p>Koichi’s <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17261">proposed</a> STM for Ruby, in combination with his proposed <em>ractors</em> (similar to <em>actors</em>) would look like this.</p>

<p>He’s using a <code>Ractor</code> but you can think of it as a thread for the purposes of this article. Instead of an array of account balances, we now have an array of <code>TVar</code> objects that contain values. A <code>TVar</code> is a <em>transactional variable</em>. Only these variables are transactional - not any other Ruby value you read or write. His design requires that the <code>TVar</code> objects you’re going to use are passed into the <code>Ractor</code>, due to rules about sharing that aren’t relevant for this article.</p>

<p>This looks good, doesn’t it!</p>

<h2 id="a-more-complex-application">A more complex application</h2>

<p>Let’s consider a larger application, in order to illustrate further and to talk about some issues and open questions. The <a href="https://github.com/chrisseaton/ruby-stm-lee-demo">code is available on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s say it’s our job to lay out the wires on a circuit board. We get a board with <em>pads</em> (connections to components mounted on the board) and a list of <em>routes</em> that we need to draw between these pads. There are a great many pads and routes, there isn’t much space on the tiny board, and another catch is that it’s very expensive to have wires crossing each other. Let’s say it’s exponentially more expensive for more deeply stacked wires.</p>

<p>In this minimal example we we can see two routes, and how they have to cross each other.</p>

<p>This example is a processor module and shows what kind of scale we might want to be working at. This board has many longer routes which are more likely to conflict.</p>

<p>There’s an algorithm to lay each routes, and it actually produces an optimal solution for an individual route, but not for all routes. It’s called <em>Lee’s algorithm</em> and was published back in 1960. We’ll …</p></article></div>

    <p>Perhaps you've read posts like <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/">Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Names</a>
and <a href="http://infiniteundo.com/post/25326999628/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-time">Falsehoods programmers believe about time</a>.
Maybe you've also read <a href="http://wiesmann.codiferes.net/wordpress/?p=15187&amp;lang=en">Falsehoods programmers believe about geography</a>.</p>

<p>Addressing is a fertile ground for incorrect assumptions, because everyone's used to dealing with addresses and 99% of the time they seem so simple.
Below are some incorrect assumptions I've seen made, or made myself, or had reported to me.
(If you want to look up an address for a UK postcode or vice-versa to confirm what I'm telling you, try the <a href="http://www.royalmail.com/postcode-finder/">Royal Mail Postcode Finder</a>)</p>

<!-- Composition of building numbers -->

<ul>
<li><p><strong>An address will start with, or at least include, a building number.</strong></p>

<p>Counterexample: Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London, WC2E 9DD, United Kingdom.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>When there is a building number, it will be all-numeric.</strong></p>

<p>Counterexample: 1A Egmont Road, Middlesbrough, TS4 2HT</p>

<p>4-5 Bonhill Street, London, EC2A 4BX</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No buildings are numbered zero</strong></p>

<p>Counterexample: 0 Egmont Road, Middlesbrough, TS4 2HT</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Well, at the very least no buildings have negative numbers</strong></p>

<p>Guy Chisholm provided this counterexample: Minusone Priory Road, Newbury, RG14 7QS</p>

<p>(none of the databases I've checked render this as -1)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>We can put those funny numbers into the building name field, as no buildings have both a name and a funny number</strong></p>

<p>Counterexample: Idas Court, 4-6 Princes Road, Hull, HU5 2RD</p></li>
<li><p><strong>When there's a building name, there won't be a building number (or vice-versa)</strong></p>

<p>Counterexample: Flat 1.4, Ziggurat Building, 60-66 Saffron Hill, London, EC1N 8QX, United Kingdom</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A building number will only be used once per street</strong></p>

<p>The difference between 50 Ammanford Road, Tycroes, Ammanford, SA18 3QJ and 50 Ammanford Road, Llandybie, Ammanford, SA18 3YF is about 4 miles (<a href="https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=SA18+3QJ+to+SA18+3YF">Google Maps</a>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>When there's line with a number in an address, it's the building number.</strong></p>

<p>Counterexample: Flat 18, Da Vinci House, 44 Saffron Hill, London, EC1N 8FH, United Kingdom</p>

<p>You also get suite numbers, floor numbers, unit numbers, and organisations with numbers in their names.</p>

<p>Adrien Piérard contributes an address from Japan with fifteen digits in six separate numbers (five if you count the zip code as a single number). The format is: 980-0804 (zip code), Miyagi-ken (prefecture) Sendai-shi (city) Aoba-ku (ward) Kokubuncho (district) 4-10-20 (sub-district-number block-number lot-number) Sendai (building name) 401 (flat number).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OK, the first line starting with a number then</strong></p>

<p>Counterexample: 3 Store, 311-318 High Holborn, London, WC1V 7BN</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A building will only have one number</strong></p>

<p>Benton Lam offers this address from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region - it has both a number on its road (14) and in its group of buildings (3): 15/F, Cityplaza 3, 14 TaiKoo Wan Road, Island East, HKSAR</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The number of buildings is the difference between the highest and lowest building numbers</strong></p>

<p>Tibor Schütz points out building numbers may be skipped - for example, on a street where even-numbered buildings are on one side, odd numbers on the other; multiple buildings sharing the same number (such as where a new house has been built) and buildings with more than one number.</p>

<p>Cyrille Chépélov and Sami Lehtinen tell me in Antibes, France and rural Finland some buildings are numbered based on the distance from the start of the road - such as Longroad 65 for the building 750m from the start of longroad.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If the addresses on the left of the road are even, the addresses on the right must be odd</strong></p>

<p>Cyrille Chépélov points out that in places, <a href="https://maps.google.fr/maps?q=48.857415,2.467167">Boulevard Théophile Sueur, Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis, France</a> has evens-only on both sides. The two sides are also in different cities and Départements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A building name won't also be a number</strong></p>

<p>Ben Tilly reports on Ten Post Office Sq, Boston MA 02109 USA - which is not, reportedly, the same as 10 Post Office Sq, Boston MA 02109 USA.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Well, at least you can omit leading zeros</strong></p>

<p>Shaun Crampton reports living at 101 Alma St, Apartment 001, Palo Alto - where apartments 1 and 001 were on different floors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A street with a building A will not also have a building Alpha</strong></p>

<p>Douglas Perreault reports he lived in a block within a condo association; it was a large association, with blocks A through Z then Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Theta. Mail and deliveries were often misrouted from block Alpha to block A and vice-versa. His address at the time was: 14100 N 46th St., Alpha 39, Tampa, FL 33613</p></li>
</ul>

<!-- Composition of street names -->

<ul>
<li><p><strong>A street name won't include a number</strong></p>

<p>8 Seven Gardens Burgh, WOODBRIDGE, IP13 6SU (pointed out by Raphael Mankin)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OK, but numbers in street names are expressed as words, not digits</strong></p>

<p>Jan Jongboom reports streets can be numbered in the Netherlands - for example, Plein 1944 in Nijmegen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>When there's a numbered street and a house number, there will be a separator between them</strong></p>

<p>Another from Jan Jongboom: Gondel 2695, Lelystad, means area Gondel, street 26, number 95</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Street names always end in descriptors like 'street', 'avenue', 'drive', 'square', 'hill' or 'view'</strong></p>

<p>They don't always - for example: Piccadilly, London, W1J 9PN</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OK, but when they do have a descriptor there will only be one</strong></p>

<p>A street name can be entirely descriptors: 17 Hill Street, London, W1J 5LJ or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenue_Road">Avenue Road, Toronto, Ontario</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OK, but when they do have a descriptor it will be at the end</strong></p>

<p>French addresses use prefix descriptors like 'rue', 'avenue', 'place' and 'allee'.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OK, but if there's a descriptor it'll be at the start or end of the street name.</strong></p>

<p>Or the middle, like 3 Bishops Square Business Park, Hatfield, AL10 9NA</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OK, but at the very least you wouldn't name a town Street</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Street,+Somerset">Actually there's a town called Street in Somerset, UK</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Street numbers (and building numbers) don't contain fractions</strong></p>

<p>Dan, Fred Kroon, David Underwood and Daniel Dickison submitted examples of fractional street numbers like <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=43rd%20%C2%BD%20st,%20Pittsburgh,%20PA">43rd ½ St, Pittsburgh, PA</a>, and of fractional building numbers. These can be written in unicode (43rd ½ St), as a fraction with a slash (43 1/2) or as a decimal (43.5)</p>

<p>Gene Wirchenko reports a fractional building number: 1313 1/2 Railroad Ave Bellingham WA 98225-4729</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Street names don't recurr in the same city</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=from:W3+6LJ+to:W5+5DB+to:N8+7PB+to:SE25+6EP+to:E13+0AJ+to:E17+7LD+to:NW10+4LX+to:N1+9TR+to:E1+6PG+to:NW1+0JH+to:W14+8NL+to:SE13+6AD+to:SW19+5DX+to:E11+2AJ+to:SW19+2AE+to:E6+2HJ+&amp;saddr=W3+6LJ&amp;daddr=W5+5DB+to:N8+7PB+to:SE25+6EP+to:E13+0AJ+to:E17+7LD+to:NW10+4LX+to:N1+9TR+to:E1+6PG+to:NW1+0JH+to:W14+8NL+to:SE13+6AD+to:SW19+5DX+to:E11+2AJ+to:SW19+2AE+to:E6+2HJ">Here's a map of the following addresses:</a></p>

<ul>
<li>High Street, London, W3 6LJ</li>
<li>High Street, London, W5 5DB</li>
<li>High Street, London, N8 7PB</li>
<li>High Street, London, SE25 6EP</li>
<li>High Street, London, E13 0AJ</li>
<li>High Street, London, E17 7LD</li>
<li>High Street, London, NW10 4LX</li>
<li>Islington High Street, London, N1 9TR</li>
<li>Shoreditch High Street, London, E1 6PG</li>
<li>Camden High Street, London, NW1 0JH</li>
<li>Kensington High Street, London, W14 8NL</li>
<li>Lewisham High Street, London, SE13 6AD</li>
<li>High Street Wimbledon, London, SW19 5DX</li>
<li>High Street Wanstead, London, E11 2AJ</li>
<li>High Street Colliers Wood, London, SW19 2AE</li>
<li>High Street North, London, E6 2HJ </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>But street names don't recurr in close proximity</strong></p>

<p>Julian Fleischer provides an example from Bocholt in Germany showing several roads in close proximity all called <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.853945,6.615334">Up de Welle</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>An address will be comprised of road names</strong></p>

<p>Kirk Kerekes spent several years using an address of the form "2 mi N then 3 mi W of Jennings, OK 74038" which regularly got successful deliveries. Mike Riley used to mail the Very Large Array radio telescope at "50 miles (80 km) West of Socorro, New Mexico, USA"</p>

<p>Sam pointed me to <a href="http://www.menomoneefallsnow.com/news/99857214.html">Menomonee Falls</a> where houses are addressed using Milwaukee County's grid system instead of house numbers - giving addresses like N88 W16541 Foobar St.</p>

<p>Andy Monat sent the following address example, from a <a href="http://ciapa.tulane.edu/uploads/1_EE_2012_Acceptance_Packet_INFORMATION-1340749206.pdf">semester abroad program at Tulane University </a>: CIAPA, 50 meters north of the Hypermas/Walmart of Curridabat, San Jose, Costa Rica. Adrien Piérard and Luke Allardyce point out street names are seldom used in Japan - instead, districts and blocks and lot numbers are used (more info on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_addressing_system">Wikipedia entry for the Japanese addressing system</a>).  A <a href="http://www.worldpress.org/Americas/592.cfm">2002 World Press Review report</a> gave this sample address: From where the Chinese restaurant used to be, two blocks down, half a block toward the lake, next door to the house where the yellow car is parked, Managua, Nicaragua. Shaun Crampton sent <a href="https://vianica.com/nicaragua/practical-info/14-addresses.html">an article with more details and examples of the Nicaraguan system</a>. Stig Brautaset pointed out <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14806350">a BBC article about post in Kabul</a> gives this example: "Hamid Jaan, behind Darul-Aman palace". Nathan Fellman reports similar addressing is used in Nicaragua and Costa Rica.</p>

<p>Paul Puschmann and Tibor Schütz pointed out the city of <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratestadt">Mannheim in Germany is sometimes called Quadratestadt (City of Squares)</a> as the city centre is arranged in a grid, with blocks assigned a letter (along the north-south axis) and a number (along the east-west axis) then buildings numbered by block number. So an example address at numbers 6 to 13 on block R 5 would be: Institut für Deutsche Sprache, R 5, 6-13, D-68161 Mannheim </p>

<p>Leoni Lubbinge gives an example of a South African address: Part 84, Strydfontein 306 JR, Pretoria which means the 84th plot of the farm Strydfontein 306 JR.</p></li>
</ul>

<!-- Elements being present or absent -->

<ul>
<li><p><strong>A road will have a name</strong></p>

<p>Plenty of roads like driveways, onramps and the aisles of carparks don't have names. Some roads in Japan also don't have names, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_addressing_system">the prevalent addressing system works on districts, subdistricts, blocks, lots and lot numbers</a>.</p>

<p>Peter Kenway points out in America some homes are addressed as Rural Routes, where numbers are allocated to boxes on a route covering multiple roads. For example: Box 1234, R.R. 1, Winthrop, ME 04364.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A road will only have one name</strong></p>

<p>Many different roads, from Goswell Road in London to Regent Road in Edinburgh, make up the 410 mile <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A1_road_%28Great_Britain%29">A1</a>. And while there may only be one "1 Goswell Road" and only one "1 Regent Road" there are multiple buildings numbered 1 on the road designated A1.</p>

<p>Roads may also be named in multiple languages. For example, in Ireland roads may be named in both English and Irish</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Addresses will only have one street</strong></p>

<p>The Royal Mail have what they call a 'dependent street' - for example: 6 Elm Avenue, Runcorn Road, Birmingham, B12 8QX, United Kingdom (Runcorn Road is the street, Elm Avenue is the stubby 'dependent street' and isn't unique within the city. <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=B12+8QX">Google Maps</a> )</p>

<p>Another counterexample: Rogue Hair, 1 Hopton Parade, Streatham High Road, London, SW16 …</p></li></ul></div></div>

<p><span>Written: 28 Oct 2020 by <i>Jeremy Howard</i></span></p><blockquote>
<p><em>Update Oct 20, 2020</em>: NumFOCUS <a href="https://numfocus.org/blog/jeremy-howard-apology">has apologized</a> to me. I accept their apology. I do not accept their assertion that “At the time of the interview, the committee had not determined that there was a violation of the code of conduct, only that there were two complaints filed and being examined.” The email to set up the call said “We would like to schedule a meeting so that we can discuss the results of our investigation with you” - nothing further. During the call, the committee stated the list of violations, and said “that is what the reporters stated, and what we found”. I asked why they didn’t take a statement from me before that finding, and they said “we all watched the video, so we could see for ourselves the violation”. The committee offered in their apology email to me to have a follow-up discussion, and I declined the offer.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Summary: NumFOCUS found I violated their Code of Conduct (CoC) at JupyterCon because my talk was not “kind”, because I said Joel Grus was “wrong” regarding his opinion that Jupyter Notebook is not a good software development environment. Joel (who I greatly respect, and consider an asset to the data science community) was not involved in NumFOCUS’s action, was not told about it, and did not support it. NumFOCUS did not follow their own enforcement procedure and violated their own CoC, left me hanging for over a week not even knowing what I was accused of, and did not give me an opportunity to provide input before concluding their investigation. I repeatedly told their committee that my emotional resilience was low at the moment due to medical issues, which they laughed about and ignored, as I tried (unsuccessfully) to hold back tears. The process has left me shattered, and I won’t be able to accept any speaking requests for the foreseeable future. I support the thoughtful enforcement of Code of Conducts to address sexist, racist, and harassing behavior, but that is not what happened in this case.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In my recent JupyterCon keynote, “I Like Jupyter Notebooks” (re-recording provided at the bottom of this post, if you’re interested in seeing it for yourself), I sought to offer a rebuttal to Joel Grus’ highly influential JupyterCon presentation “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U">I Don’t Like Notebooks</a>”. Joel claimed in his talk that Jupyter is a poor choice for software development and teaching, and I claimed in my talk that it is a good choice. The NumFOCUS committee found me guilty of violating their code of conduct for having not been “kind” in my disagreement with Joel, and for “insulting” him. The specific reasons given were that:</p>
<ul>
<li>I said that Joel Grus was “wrong”</li>
<li>I used some of his slides (properly attributed) and a brief clip from one of his videos to explain why I thought he was wrong</li>
<li>That I made “a negative reference” to his prior talk</li>
<li>I was also told that “as a keynote speaker” I would “be held to a higher standard than others” (although this was not communicated to me prior to my talk, nor what that higher standard is)</li>
</ul>
<p>Code of Conducts can be a useful tool, when thoughtfully created and thoughtfully enforced, to address sexism, racism, and harassment, all of which have been problems at tech conferences. Given the <a href="https://medium.com/tech-diversity-files/if-you-think-women-in-tech-is-just-a-pipeline-problem-you-haven-t-been-paying-attention-cb7a2073b996">diversity issues in the tech industry</a>, it is important that we continue the work of making conferences more inclusive, particularly to those from marginalized backgrounds. Having a code of conduct with explicit rules against violent threats, unwelcome sexual attention, repeated harassment, sexually explicit pictures, and other harmful behavior is the first step towards addressing and stopping those behaviors. The JupyterCon code provides the following examples of unacceptable behavior, none of which are at all similar to what I did (i.e. saying that someone was wrong on a technical topic, and explaining how and why):</p>
<ul>
<li>Violent threats or violent language directed against another person</li>
<li>Discriminatory jokes and language</li>
<li>Posting sexually explicit or violent material</li>
<li>Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”)</li>
<li>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms</li>
<li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
<li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior</li>
<li>Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop</li>
</ul>
<p>My experience with the NumFOCUS code of conduct raises a few key issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>The CoC enforcement process involved conflicting &amp; changing information, no opportunity for me to give input, the stress of a long wait of unknown duration with no information about what I was accused of or what would happen next, and the committee members violated their own CoC during the process</li>
<li>There were two totally different Codes of Conduct with different requirements linked in different places</li>
<li>I was held to a different, undocumented and uncommunicated standard</li>
<li>The existence of, or details about, the CoC were not communicated prior to confirmation of the engagement</li>
<li>CoC experts recommend avoiding requirements of politeness or other forms of “proper” behavior, but should focus on a specific list of unacceptable behaviors. The JupyterCon CoC, however, is nearly entirely a list of “proper” behaviors (such as “Be welcoming”, “Be considerate”, and “Be friendly”) that are vaguely defined</li>
<li>CoC experts recommend using a CoC that focuses on a list of unacceptable behaviors. Both the codes linked to JupyterCon have such a link, and none of the unacceptable behavior examples are in any way related or close to what happened in this case. But NumFOCUS nonetheless found me in violation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would rather not have to write this post at all. However I know that people will ask about why my talk isn’t available on the JupyterCon site, so I felt that I should explain exactly what happened. In particular, I was concerned that if only partial information became available, the anti-CoC crowd might jump on this as an example of problems with codes of conduct more generally, or might point at this as part of “cancel culture” (a concept I vehemently disagree with, since what is referred to as “cancellation” is often just “facing consequences”). Finally, I found that being on the “other side” of a code of conduct issue gave me additional insights into the process, and that it’s important that I should share those insights to help the community in the future.</p>
<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<p>The rest of this post is a fairly detailed account of what happened, for those that are interested.</p>
<h3 id="my-talk-at-jupytercon">My talk at JupyterCon</h3>
<p>I recently gave a talk at <a href="https://jupytercon.com/">JupyterCon</a>. My partner Rachel gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frc7FgheUj4">talk at JupyterCon</a> a couple of years ago, and had a wonderful experience, and I’m a huge fan of Jupyter, so I wanted to support the project. The conference used to be organized by O’Reilly, who have always done a wonderful job of conferences I’ve attended, but this year the conference was instead handled by <a href="https://numfocus.org/">NumFOCUS</a>.</p>
<p>For my talk, I decided to focus on Jupyter as a literate and <a href="https://www.fast.ai/2019/12/02/nbdev/">exploratory programming environment</a>, using <a href="https://nbdev.fast.ai/">nbdev</a>. One challenge, however, is that two years earlier Joel Grus had given a brilliant presentation called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U">I Don’t Like Notebooks</a> which had been so compelling that I have found it nearly impossible to talk about programming in Jupyter without being told “you should watch this talk which explains why programming in Jupyter is a terrible idea”.</p>
<p>Joel opened and closed his presentation with some light-hearted digs at me, since I’d asked him ahead of time <em>not</em> to do such a presentation. So I thought I’d kill two birds with one stone, and take the opportunity to respond directly to him. Not only was his presentation brilliant, but his slides were hilarious, so I decided to directly parody his talk by using (with full credit of course) some of his slides directly. That way people that hadn’t seen his talk could both get to enjoy the fantastic content, and also understand just what I was responding to. For instance, here’s how Joel illustrated the challenge of running cells in the right order:</p>
<figure>
<img srcset="https://www.fast.ai/images/numfocus/joel-order.png 2w" sizes="1px" src="https://www.fast.ai/images/numfocus/joel-order.png">
</figure>
<p>I showed that slide, explaining that it’s Joel’s take on the issue, and then followed up with a slide showing how easy it actually is to run all cells in order:</p>
<figure>
<img srcset="https://www.fast.ai/images/numfocus/jeremy-order.png 2w" sizes="1px" src="https://www.fast.ai/images/numfocus/jeremy-order.png">
</figure>
<p>Every slide included a snippet from Joel’s title slide, which, I explained, showed which slides were directly taken from his presentation. I was careful to ensure I did not modify any of his slides in any way. When first introducing his presentation, I described Joel as “a brilliant communicator, really funny, and wrong”. I didn’t make any other comments about Joel (although, for the record, I think he’s awesome, and highly recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Scratch-Principles-Python/dp/1492041130">his book</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-code-of-conduct-violation-notice">The Code of Conduct violation notice</h3>
<p>A week later, I received an email telling me that two CoC reports were filed regarding my JupyterCon keynote presentation. I was told that “The Code of Conduct Enforcement Team is meeting tomorrow to review the incident and will be contacting you to inform you of the nature of the report and to understand your perspective”.</p>
<p>The CoC wasn’t mentioned at all until after I’d been invited to speak, had accepted, and had completed the online registration. I had reviewed it at that time, and had been a bit confused. The email I received linked to a <a href="https://jupytercon.com/codeofconduct/">JupyterCon Code of Conduct</a>, but that in turn didn’t provide much detail about what is and isn’t OK, and that in turn linked to a different <a href="https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct">NumFOCUS Code of Conduct</a>. A link was also provided to <a href="https://numfocus.typeform.com/to/ynjGdT">report violations</a>, which also linked to and named the NumFOCUS CoC.</p>
<p>I was concerned that I had done something which might be viewed as a violation, and looked forward to hearing about the nature of the report and having a chance to share my perspective. I was heartened that JupyterCon documented that they follow the <a href="https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct/response-and-enforcement-events-meetups">NumFOCUS Enforcement Manual</a>. I was also heartened that the manual has a section “Communicate with the Reported Person about the Incident” which says they will “Let the reported person tell someone on the CoC response team their side of the story; the person who receives their side of the story should be prepared to …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><h3 id="smart-code-splitting">Smart code splitting</h3><p>No matter which page your user lands on, the total footprint of a Remix app is about 50kb over the network (including dependencies). It doesn't matter how large your application gets, each page only downloads what it needs, which is actually pretty uncommon in the React ecosystem.</p><p>React apps are typically built two ways: bundle everything into one enormous file (yikes!) or code split into multiple bundles to load on demand. The apps that code split usually send down a very large build manifest, listing every asset you could possibly need. That means as you add files and pages to your site, the footprint of <em>every page</em> grows.</p><p>Remix never loads more code than the page the user is looking at. You can have 10 or 10,000 routes, the footprint for each remains constant. Just because you added some routes to the photo viewer doesn't mean the contact page gets bigger over the network.</p><h3 id="beyond-heavy-javascript-in-the-browser">Beyond heavy JavaScript in the browser</h3><p>Do you ever look at some of the pages on your website and think "why does this need to download any JavaScript at all?". We do too. Go ahead and open the dev tools on this page you're reading right now.</p><p>Yeah, you, open the dev tools.</p><p>That's right, no JavaScript! This is a marketing page with nothing interactive but links. There's no reason to load JavaScript here. You might think "but wouldn't you be able to speed up the transitions if you loaded in a client side router?" Great question. The answer is, not always.</p><p>Open the devtools again. You'll note in the network tab that we've already loaded in the "/buy" page with a link response header. When you click "buy" (please click buy), the browser already has the page and will navigate there immediately. It can't get faster than that.</p><p>With Remix, you have full control of how your app is delivered at every route. Load a bunch of JavaScript for a really interactive page, or skip it for a static page. Preload a page you think they'll navigate to, or only load that page when they navigate to it. It's all up to you.</p><h3 id="closing-the-gap-between-production-and-development-builds">Closing the gap between production and development builds</h3><p>Remember that one time you were implementing dark mode and put a <code>window.matchMedia</code> in state? Remember how everything was awesome until you deployed and then suddenly the production server was crashing? That's right, there is no window on the server and you weren't server rendering in dev!</p><p>Remember when you pushed some new CSS to production and your elements started bouncing around because your CSS lib was moving style tags around in production but not dev?</p><p>Remember when the requests for code split resources in development seemed fine but in production they were widly different and included way more in them than expected?</p><p>Production bugs live in the delta between development and production environments. Remix closes that gap.</p><p>Remix server renders the same in development as production, loads CSS the same (<code>&lt;link/&gt;</code>, ofc) and code splits the same. How can we do this? We only build the page you're looking at in development, so we can build it like production in a few milliseconds.</p><h3 id="a-refreshing-take-on-css">A refreshing take on CSS</h3><p>Remix lets you use the CSS skills you already have. While we love the innovation that has happened in the CSS-in-JS space, and you can use them in Remix, we provide a back-to-basics approach with a twist.</p><p>One of the trickiest parts of CSS and highly dynamic websites is knowing when to apply it and when to remove it. Because of nested routes, we know the layouts that are being rendered and which aren't. As the user navigates around Remix automatically loads and unloads the styles for the layouts on the page.</p><p>It might sound like no big deal at first, but once you try it you'll realize it's quite powerful.</p><p>Remix also adds a few improvements to CSS like auto prefixing and nesting, and support for tailwind out of the box, but other than that, we keep it simple.</p><h3 id="so-much-more">So much more</h3><p>Perhaps the most unique thing about Remix is that there's hardly any API at all. It gets out of your way wherever it can to allow you to use the web and React the way they were each designed. You have control over every entry point into your app, from the initial request handler to the deepest matching route's meta tags. No plugins, no complicated rendering abstractions, just React and HTTP as designed.</p><h3 id="who-is-remix">Who is Remix?</h3><p>We're Michael Jackson (no, not that one) and Ryan Florence. We've been running the company <a href="https://reacttraining.com/">React Training</a> since 2015. We've taught hundreds of teams and thousands of people at top companies around the world how to get the most out of React while also working our open source projects: React Router, Unpkg, and Reach UI. Before that, we worked on some of the apps at <a href="https://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/US">the most visited sites on the internet</a> like Twitter (twitter.com) and Canvas (instructure.com).</p><p>As trainers and open source authors, we've seen where teams struggle with React, and we've struggled with these things ourselves! We're now dedicated to helping you build better websites with Remix.</p></article></div>]]>

            <p>Last week, <a href="https://www.vrfinal.com/oculus-founder-offers-a-further-5000-reward-for-quest-2-jailbreakers/">we reported that someone had claimed the $10,000 bounty to jailbreak the Oculus Quest 2</a>. Well, this week it's been officially verified.</p><p><em>Mozilla</em>'s Robert Long and <em>Oculus</em> Founder Palmer Luckey came together last week to put up $5000 each as a reward for the task. They also promised that, after a round of crowdfunding, the final bounty would be <em>even higher</em>. Of course, it didn't take long for someone to claim it.</p><p>However, Long soon explained on his Discord server that, after congratulating the budding hacker, he had directed the jailbreaker to "a team of security and legal professionals who can evaluate this claim and determine how to responsibly publish these findings."</p><p>And this week, in a statement on Twitter, Long announced that the claimant's efforts had been verified:</p><figure><img src="https://www.vrfinal.com/content/images/2020/10/ElRXLEpUUAAVKzM.png" alt=""><figcaption>(Credit: @arobertlong, Twitter)</figcaption></figure><p>But now the project has hit a bump in the road and the team have some hard questions to answer. After all, is the jailbreak even legal?</p><p>XR Safety Initiative researchers were able to verify the successful method and are now hard at work "gathering assurances" for other successful jailbreakers to protect them from legal retaliation from Oculus.</p><p>Long has asked other successful hackers to get in touch, explaining that XRSI's "legal and security expertise [have] been crucial in pushing this effort forward":</p><blockquote>"If you are one of those researchers, we urge you to contact us and share the details in a secure manner. Contact XR Safety Initiative XRSI via info@xrsi.org or Use Signal 510-990-4438"</blockquote><figure><img src="https://www.vrfinal.com/content/images/2020/10/goroman-oculus-2-6-e1602602129217-768x431.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://www.vrfinal.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/goroman-oculus-2-6-e1602602129217-768x431.jpeg 600w, https://www.vrfinal.com/content/images/2020/10/goroman-oculus-2-6-e1602602129217-768x431.jpeg 768w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The successful jailbreak was reported with incredible speed, but now the real challenge begins. (Credit: RoadToRV)</figcaption></figure><p>The jailbreaking grey area revolves around the practice's relationship with "Right to Repair" - a framework which legally gives users full control over the hardware and software they purchase. The practice is already widely accepted in the smartphone world, but the XRSI organisation is campaigning to extend it's use to VR headsets.</p><p>If it all works out, I think the successful hacker is deserving of his $10,000+ reward. And if they can ensure it is legally kosher, the jailbreak will be great news for Oculus Quest 2 fans, too.</p><p><a href="https://www.vrfinal.com/facebook-confirms-that-logging-into-multiple-quest-headsets-wont-get-you-banned/">Especially while the controversy around the Facebook account requirement continues to develop</a>...</p>

        <p>The BEAM is the virtual machine that Erlang and Elixir runs on. It is widely cited as a battle-tested piece of software though I don’t know in which wars it has seen action. It has definitely paid its dues in the telecom space as well as globally scaled projects such as Whatsapp and Discord. It is well suited to tackle soft-realtime distributed systems with heavy concurrency. It has been a good platform chugging along. And with a small team at Ericsson responsible for much of its continuing development it has been managed in a deeply pragmatic way. Erlang has always been a bit of a secret and silent success. Almost no-one uses it if you look at market shares. But among the ones that use it there seems to be a very positive consensus. And then Elixir came and caused a bit of a boom. I think the BEAM has benefited from Elixir and Elixir wouldn’t exist without the BEAM. With that bit of background I’d like to shine a light on some cool developments that I think makes the BEAM more interesting or even uniquely interesting in the future.</p>
<h2 id="the-jit-is-here-soon-otp-24">The JIT is here (soon, OTP 24)</h2>
<p>With OTP 24 landing sometime next year we are going to get the a JIT for the BEAM. Based on the project <a href="https://github.com/asmjit/asmjit">AsmJit</a> this will mean that some BEAM code will be translated to native instructions. It will not be the kind of warm-up-for-performance-gains JIT that I’ve heard of in PyPy but rather significantly simpler. The goal of the project was to introduce a JIT that could give performance gains for some cases but would not cause any performance regressions. A pragmatic and laudable approach. Considering this made the Jason JSON-library (written in Elixir) beat the Jiffy JSON-library (written as a C NIF) in <strong>some</strong> tests I think this has the potential to obviate the need for some NIF implementations. Avoiding reaching out to the lower level code that is more capable but more dangerous is a good win.</p>
<p>Anyone running RabbitMQ should look forward to the update as measurements indicate 30-50% increased message throughput. Which is a nice thing to get for no code changes at all.</p>
<p>Pushing the performance of the BEAM closer to native is magnificent. To be clear the BEAM is already quite a good performer. I would put Erlang and Elixir at the abstraction level of languages like Python/Ruby/Node.js. Python and Ruby are poor performers. The Python ML stuff all goes into C++ or similar for performance. I’ve worked a bunch with Python and the things I hear from the Ruby world makes them sound quite equivalent in performance. They are a bit slow and can only <a href="https://underjord.io/more-than-one-thing-at-a-time.html">do one thing at a time</a>. Node.js is a bit different. It can do multiple things at a time, if you append asterisks and squint. It does it largely the same way Python + Gevent does it. This approach is incredibly susceptible to CPU-bound work causing head-of-line blocking. It becomes the single most important consideration for building a performant application “get to IO, don’t compute”. V8 that Node.js runs on is heavily optimized and fast for such a dynamic language. I think the BEAM provides a better approach that can deliver comparable results without as many footguns (opportunities for shooting yourself in the foot). But getting better at the raw crunching is a big gain with this JIT implementation and I look forward to the release.</p>
<h2 id="lumen---static-compilation--wasm">Lumen - Static compilation &amp; WASM</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://getlumen.org/">Lumen project</a> is a huge effort by a gang of open source developers and DockYard to implement a compiler (and more) that can take Elixir and Erlang into the browser. By solving that they end up solving static compilation for Erlang and Elixir as well. So this isn’t compiling and shipping the BEAM to the browser. This is a faithful reimplementation of the BEAM functionality in a way that allows it to be compiled statically. It uses LLVM and requires quite a bit of effort both in development and in wrangling the Web Assembly work group process stuff to make sure that the standard is not entirely run by Object-Oriented Programming needs.</p>
<p>I don’t think Lumen will replace the BEAM. The BEAM has a brilliant track record for long-running services and distributed computing that the Lumen project do not even attempt to achieve right now. Instead the Lumen project will allow Elixir and Erlang to move into spaces where the BEAM might be a bit too heavy and still provide the same guarantees. Typically I see it being good for command line tools, web frontends (super interesting to consider the Actor model going there), serverless/edge computing and potentially with WASM competing with Docker as a delivery mechanism for code in Kubernetes, using something like <a href="https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet">Krustlet</a> (<a href="https://player.fm/series/software-sessions/webassembly-on-the-server-with-krustlet">good podcast episode on WASM/Krustlet</a>). It’s probably Cloud Native or something. Who knows.</p>
<p>What gives Lumen the potential to be a better fit in these circumstances is that it can optimize for filesize (by cutting out hot code updates) and it is likely able to start much faster. Lumen is written in Rust. Which seems to be the popular choice around Web Assembly from what I’ve seen. Lumen is still an early release project and not fit for production. But it is beeing actively pushed forward.</p>
<h2 id="nerves---an-iot-platform-with-minimal-suck">Nerves - An IoT platform with minimal suck</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves project</a> is fantastic. I’m a hardware hobbyist, not an IoT dev but I’ve worked a fair bit with Nerves and it is so, so good. What Nerves gives you when working with a Raspberry Pi for example is a way to let your code run all of the device. The BEAM is basically your operating system on top of a minimal Linux installation. The Linux you have is based on the solid foundation of Buildroot so it is quite feasible to modify it as you see fit. The big idea is that if you are running a Linux-level SBC already you might as well build on something that gives you the guarantees of the BEAM.</p>
<p>Beyond that the default setup encodes a lot of good embedded practices by default so that you avoid bricking devices with firmware updates, you get easy support for pushing firmware over the network or USB and much, much more.</p>
<p>There are a ton of good libraries for sensors and assorted hardware, as well as the common protocols like GPIO/SPI/I2C/UART. Networking support is well considered and has been reworked since I first started using Nerves a few years back (and it worked well then too). BLE is getting more and more good support recently.</p>
<p>The project also created <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/nerveshub">NervesHub</a> which is a solution for managing a fleet of devices by securely providing firmware updates, allowing the switching on of a remote console on devices if that’s a need on your product. I think the most recent stuff is a UI revamp and some serious work on binary diffed patches to minimize firmware update sizes for data-constrained deployments.</p>
<p>This is very much a production project and people are shipping hardware with Nerves. It keeps marching forward.</p>
<h2 id="the-beam-can-be-your-entire-application">The BEAM can be your entire application</h2>
<p>Saša Jurić, author of the much-acclaimed Elixir in Action book has produced a library called <a href="https://github.com/sasa1977/site_encrypt">site_encrypt</a>. It allows you to handle LetsEncrypt configuration without a separate webserver or actually using certbot.</p>
<p>Now this library is good and meaningful in its own right but the underlying idea is why I bring it up. The BEAM can be your entire application. This is something I’ve realized over time. Where in Python you would reach for Gunicorn to run you Django app and Nginx to protect Gunicorn from the big bad world.. The BEAM is made for this. Introducing an intermediate layer of Nginx (or another HTTP server) might actually be detrimental in that you now have two things you need to configure correctly and two pools of multi-core processing workers that care about this request/response cycle and can independently screw it up.</p>
<p>The BEAM was always built for this. OTP has a lot weird corners where you find interesting libraries such as <code>wx</code> for WxWidgets (window management) and <code>ssh</code> for both SSH client and server work I believe. Because it is meant to be delivered as a full solution. It can run and manage multiple different types of work inside of it. Gracefully. It doesn’t replace Kubernetes for the large deployment or polyglot environments. But it might very well mean you don’t actually need to go there early. Or you can reduce how much Ops you need in your Dev. If your entire stack is Elixir or Erlang front to back I think you have empowered your developers significantly.</p>
<p>There is already a move towards this where tools are converging that give us a lot of things out of the box that we’d otherwise need to move outside our application for. These are pragmatic 80-90% solutions. The normal solutions are still all there if you need to reach for them. But maybe you don’t. I see these as moves in the same vein:</p>
<ul>
<li>LiveView - We can reduce the amount of frontend we need to build that isn’t BEAM code (Elixir or Erlang), in some cases get rid of it entirely.</li>
<li>Live Dashboard - Application insights right in your application stack instead of pushing them out to another solution.</li>
<li>Phoenix PubSub - Distributed PubSub without requiring coordination via something like Redis.</li>
<li>Phoenix Channels - Distributed PubSub over WebSockets using the above PubSub to coordinate delivery.</li>
<li>Phoenix Presence - Distribute Presence. A CRDT-powered thing for maintaining information about if someone is connected to a channel or not, like chatrooms and online/offline. Using Channels.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lowering complexity by keeping the solutions in a system you understand well is potentially very powerful. At some point many projects will need to pick up external dependencies such as Nginx, Redis or whatever. But I think there is something compelling about building your application inside a system that can do all of it quite well. Elixir and Phoenix already have significant mind-share in the startup world. I wouldn’t be surprised if this ends up being a very popular solution for startups. No frontend-specific code for the MVP, no New Relic or Mixpanel bill we make do with the Live Dashboard. Distribution is Erlang distribution + Swarm/Horde/Libcluster or something …</p></article></div>

<p>2020-10-26</p>

<p>For some weeks now I've been fantasizing about creating this blog. I've thought about creating an HTTP server from scratch just to serve it on a Linode instance, writing a static blog engine to generate the HTML from Markdown, besides every other kinds of over-engineering just for fun.</p>

<p>I've also compiled a list with a dozen blogs I enjoy the most. Then I've tried to distill what are their qualities that makes me enjoy them, and how I may achieve those in my own blog.</p>

<p>Well, as you may see, this is my first post. Doing all of the above lead me to not start any blog at all.</p>

<p>This may be called "analysis paralysis", "over-engineering" or "perfect is the enemy of the good". Whatever it may be, I'm done with it now.</p>

<p>The most valuable thing is to produce something and put it out in the world. All the planning, engineering, thinking exists just to support that. With no realization, no "getting started", ultimately there's no value to be generated at all.</p>

<p>This is obvious in hindsight, but it's very easy to forget this lesson.</p>

<p>So, what have <em>you</em> been putting off through planning and fantasizing? What is keeping you from just <em>doing</em> what you want to do? Can't you get started right now or are you avoiding it by doing easier things? And by doing what you are doing, are you generating any value for yourself or for anyone?</p>

<p>2020-10-26</p>

<p>The <em>Growth Mindset</em> research is one of the most impacting developments of cognitive psychology. Spearheaded by the decades of research of the psychologist Carol Dweck, it reveals how our <em>beliefs</em> about intelligence and skill shape our performance.</p>

<p>This research brilliantly sidesteps the long debate of "nature vs nurture", or how much are our intelligence, talent or skill brought up by our intrinsic genes or by our extrinsic environment and actions. The focus is on the <em>belief</em> itself that the individual holds.</p>

<p>Dweck has shown that individuals with a <em>Growth Mindset</em>, that believe that intelligence can be developed and skill is acquired through effortful practice, end up being more successful. This happens because such individuals tend to embrace challenges, push out of their zone of comfort and accept negative feedback.</p>

<p>On the other hand, individuals with a <em>Fixed Mindset</em>, that believe that intelligence is bestowed upon birth and not developed thereafter, end up being less successful. They tend to deal worse with setbacks, seeing failures as permanent testaments of their limitations. Because of this, they tend to avoid new situations and challenges above their level of skill. As a self-fulfilling prophecy, they end up not further developing their skills.</p>

<p>Dweck has also shown that we are strongly biased towards a Fixed Mindset, but with conscious effort it is possible to rewire ourselves to be more oriented towards a Growth Mindset. The psychologist has urged parents and teachers to instill in kids a Growth Mindset by praising the effort they put in instead of seemingly natural intelligence or talent.</p>

<p>The book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FCKPHG/">"Mindset: The New Psychology of Success"</a> is a great read and goes into details of how the Growth Mindset was studied and how one can become more growth-oriented.</p>

			<h3>Philae’s path on comet 67P</h3><p>
			The Phi­lae re­search mod­ule sep­a­rat­ed from ESA's Roset­ta or­biter on 12 Novem­ber 2014 in or­der to land on Comet 67P/Churyu­mov-Gerasi­menko. Af­ter sev­en hours of freefall, it touched the Ag­ilkia land­ing site (top left out­side the im­age) at walk­ing pace as planned. How­ev­er, Phi­lae could not an­chor it­self be­cause the an­chor har­poons pro­vid­ed for this pur­pose did not ac­ti­vate. Due to the low grav­i­ty, Phi­lae bounced off the sur­face, rose to a height of more than one kilo­me­tre, col­lid­ed with a cliff edge while falling, touched the comet's sur­face a sec­ond time (TD2) and fi­nal­ly came to a halt af­ter two hours (TD3). The lo­ca­tion of TD2 was un­known un­til re­cent­ly and could on­ly now be re­con­struct­ed. Phi­lae was lo­cat­ed in a place with suf­fi­cient sun­light to pro­duce enough en­er­gy to run its ten ex­per­i­ments for ap­prox­i­mate­ly 60 hours.

			<h3>Philae’s two minutes on TD2 (Touchdown 2)</h3><p>
			An­i­ma­tion show­ing how Roset­ta’s Phi­lae lan­der moved through touch­down site two on Comet 67P/Churyu­mov-Gerasi­menko on 12 Novem­ber 2014. Ini­tial­ly trav­el­ling in a down­ward di­rec­tion, Phi­lae slides down the edge of a boul­der (1) and flips ver­ti­cal­ly, ro­tat­ing like a wind­mill to pass be­tween two boul­ders (2) ex­pos­ing lay­ers of ice in the crevice walls with its feet. A dust wall was cre­at­ed by the wind­mill ac­tion, push­ing through the dust that had heaped up be­tween the boul­ders up to that point in time. The crevice is about 2.5 m long and is curved with a width of 1–1.5 m, al­low­ing Phi­lae to pass through. Phi­lae then stamps a 25 cm im­print of the top of the lan­der in­to the comet’s sur­face (3) – a hole made by the top of the SD2 (Sam­pling, Drilling and Dis­tri­bu­tion de­vice) tow­er that sticks up above the top of Phi­lae can be recog­nised. Phi­lae then climbed out of the crevice, knock­ing off ma­te­ri­al from an over­hang (4a) and was pushed down again with its top sur­face, cre­at­ing an im­pres­sion in the dust cor­re­spond­ing to the ‘eye’ of the fea­ture that re­sem­bles a skull (4b).

			<h3>Philae’s contact with the comet put into regional context</h3><p>
			Phi­lae’s flight across the sur­face of Comet 67P/Churyu­mov-Gerasi­menko on 12 Novem­ber 2014 saw the lan­der strike the sur­face in mul­ti­ple lo­ca­tions. This graph­ic sum­maris­es the main touch­down sites. At 15:35 UTC Phi­lae made first con­tact with the sur­face at Ag­ilkia – the im­age shown here was tak­en by Phi­lae’s own cam­era, RO­LIS, be­fore touch­down, ap­prox­i­mate­ly 40 me­tres from the sur­face. Phi­lae then took flight across the Hat­mehit de­pres­sion on the ‘top’ of the small comet lobe, col­lid­ing with a cliff edge at 16:20 UTC. This set it on course with the sec­ond touch­down site, where it in­ter­act­ed with the sur­face mul­ti­ple times over a pe­ri­od of two min­utes start­ing at around 17:24 UTC. Phi­lae ar­rived at its fi­nal rest­ing place at Aby­dos, about 30 m away, at 17:31 UTC. The im­age has been en­hanced to al­low Phi­lae, hid­ing in the shad-ows just 30 me­tres away from the sec­ond touch­down lo­ca­tion, to be seen.

			<h3>Philae leaves traces at contact point two</h3><p>
			This com­pi­la­tion shows the mea­sure­ments record­ed by Phi­lae's ROMAP in­stru­ment – a mag­ne­tome­ter with a boom – dur­ing the sec­ond touch­down on Comet 67P/Churyu­mov-Gerasi­menko on 12 Novem­ber 2014, along­side OSIRIS im­ages tak­en lat­er, which show ev­i­dence of the key mo­ments of Phi­lae's con­tacts with the sur­face (and the re­con­struct­ed po­si­tions of Phi­lae pro­ject­ed on­to them). Sig­na­tures rel­a­tive to the lan­der were record­ed in the mag­ne­tome­ter da­ta from the ROMAP boom when the boom phys­i­cal­ly moved by hit­ting an ob­sta­cle on the sur­face, bend­ing slight­ly (the boom pro­trudes 48 cen­time­tres from the lan­der). This pro­duced a char­ac­ter­is­tic set of 'peaks' in the ROMAP da­ta, which pro­vid­ed an es­ti­mate of the du­ra­tion of Phi­lae's pen­e­tra­tion of the ice. The da­ta could al­so be used to es­ti­mate the ac­cel­er­a­tion of Phi­lae dur­ing these con­tacts. They show that Phi­lae spent al­most two full min­utes at touch­down point two and made con­tact with the sur­face sev­er­al times. Phi­lae first moved down­wards, slid­ing down the edge of a cliff (1) and ro­tat­ing ver­ti­cal­ly like a wind­mill to pass be­tween two boul­ders (2), ex­pos­ing lay­ers of ice in the crevices with its spi­der legs. The 'wind­mill ac­tion' cre­at­ed a wall of dust through which Phi­lae pushed it­self. The gap is ap­prox­i­mate­ly 2.5 me­tres long, curved, and has a width of 1–1.5 me­tres. Then Phi­lae pushed a 25-cen­time­tre im­print of the top of the lan­der in­to the sur­face of the comet (3) – a hole cre­at­ed by the top of the SD2 (Sam­pling, Drilling and Dis­tri­bu­tion De­vice) tow­er. Phi­lae then rose out of the crevice, was pressed down again by an over­hang (4a), its up­per sur­face cre­at­ing an im­pres­sion in the dust that pressed the 'eye' in­to the skull (4b).

			<h3>Philae’s magnetometer measurements on TD2</h3><p>
			The high­ly sen­si­tive mag­ne­tome­ter ROMAP built un­der the di­rec­tion of the Tech­ni­cal Uni­ver­si­ty of Braun­schweig for the Roset­ta mis­sion was switched on dur­ing Phi­lae's de­scent from the or­biter to the comet's sur­face. It con­tin­u­ous­ly record­ed the (very weak) mag­net­ic field da­ta in three ax­i­al di­rec­tions (mag­net­ic field com­po­nent in x-di­rec­tion = blue, y = or­ange, z = grey) with a mea­sur­ing rod al­most half a me­tre long from the first con­tact with the sur­face un­til the probe came to a fi­nal stand­still. The scale on the left in­di­cates the mag­ni­tude of the mag­net­ic flux den­si­ty in the unit nan­otes­la. For com­par­i­son: the in­ter­stel­lar medi­um has a mag­net­ic field strength of up to 10 nan­otes­la, while the Earth's mag­net­ic field has about five thou­sand times this val­ue in Ger­many. From the mea­sure­ments, it was pos­si­ble to re­con­struct the course of the bumpy on­ward flight of Phi­lae down to the sec­ond af­ter the first touch­down. Now the long-sought ‘touch­down point 2’ (TD2) has al­so be …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div>

<p>To see it in action, we declare an enum of all possible actions.
Of course, these can be way more complicated in the real world use-case.</p>
<div data-language="rust"><pre><code><span>#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord)]</span>

<p>Then generate a few actions.</p>

    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{:?}"</span><span>,</span> action<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Which gives us the following output.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span><span data-user="root" data-host="localhost"></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span>cargo run --example traffic

<p>Notice how after each <code>SignIn</code> there's a <code>ListTodos</code>, which means <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>L</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>T</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>d</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>s</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mi>S</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>I</mi><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">P(ListTodos|SignIn)=1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.
Built model can represent inherent rules of our application.
Some series of actions will not be generated, those having probability <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, which is a lot better than uniformly generated random data.</p>
<p>Some combination of actions might not be possible, because they'd break business rules.
Those can be filtered out, or left in to test invalid requests.</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>For founders, this question comes up a lot:</p><blockquote>“I have too many startup ideas. I don’t know which idea to focus on.”</blockquote><p>It certainly did for me. </p><p>I have been building SaaS products for the last few years, with bad to mediocre results. Each one taught me something new. Each one revealed one or two factors about the idea that I wish I knew BEFORE working on it.</p><p>For example, if there is a HUGE population with the problem I'm solving, then there's a better chance of me surviving despite incumbents and competitors. Larger pie, more slices to go round.</p><p>If I had known how to evaluate these ideas beforehand, I would have saved a lot of time. It won't be a guarantee of success, but it would have helped increase my odds.</p><p>I wanted to know what else I should know before starting work on an idea, so I researched articles, podcasts and videos with successful founders to find out how they evaluate ideas.</p><p>The result is a <strong>30-point checklist</strong>, curated from over 40 founders, that I want to share with you below. </p><p>Having a list makes it easy, and even fun, to evaluate your ideas in a structured and repeatable way. Think of it as <strong>due diligence</strong> you're doing before investing your time in your idea.</p><h2 id="but-ideas-don-t-matter-execution-does-">"But ideas don't matter. Execution does!"</h2><p>The intention of this advice is good, but, I feel this is misleading.</p><p>Given two ideas, executing on the one that has a better chance of succeeding will yield better results. Executing on a bad idea wastes time, money, and motivation.</p><p>Would you not want to know if an idea is a "good idea" before you spend lots of time and money trying to validate it?</p><p>If you think evaluating an idea before investing time and money in it isn't practical, then tell that to angel investors. They have to - they can't afford to give away money based on hunches. In their world, it's called due diligence.</p><blockquote>"Ideas mean everything and nothing at the same time. They mean everything, because you can 10x your odds of success by simply picking a better one. They mean nothing, because with bad execution you'll achieve nothing, no matter how good the idea." — Alex West, <a href="http://cyberleads.co/">cyberleads.co</a></blockquote><h2 id="the-saas-idea-evaluation-checklist">The SaaS idea evaluation checklist</h2><p>So here's the list I'm using. I have grouped them into 3 groups:</p><ul><li>Must-haves: Don't even start without having all of these.</li><li>Should-haves: The more you have of these, the better your chances.</li><li>Nice-to-haves: Not essential, but really helps if you do have them.</li></ul><h3 id="must-haves">Must-haves</h3><p>1. <strong>Solves a very specific problem</strong>. What's the specific problem you are aiming to solve?</p><p>2. <strong>Targets a very specific niche</strong>. Which specific group of people has that problem?</p><p>3. <strong>Has a large enough market</strong>. How big is this market? Is it enough to meet your business goal? A large market also means there's room for competitors.</p><p>4. <strong>Will generate profit</strong>. How much will it cost to run this business, and will you be able to turn a profit? Obvious, but a surprising number of founders don't work this out until much later!</p><p>5. <strong>Can operate profitably without the founder</strong>. Can this business grow profitably without you?</p><h3 id="should-haves">Should-haves</h3><p>6. <strong>Solves my own problem</strong>. Are you building this for yourself? Great start if you are!</p><p>7. <strong>"Hair on fire" problem</strong>. Will your customers need your solution urgently? Or is it not that important?</p><p>8. <strong>Frequently occurring problem</strong>. How often does someone have this problem? Hourly, daily, or at most weekly, would be best.</p><p>9. <strong>Growing market with this problem</strong>. More and more people are having this problem every day. More and more people will want your solution.</p><p>10. <strong>This is a mandatory problem</strong>. For example, this there's been a change in law and your customers need a solution. Like GDPR.</p><p>11. <strong>Customers are small businesses</strong>. These are the best customers to have because they have money, are motivated to spend, and has short lead times.</p><p>12. <strong>Founder has built an audience in target group</strong>. Do you already have followers or subscribers that have this problem.</p><p>13. <strong>Can be launched quickly</strong>. The faster you can launch, the quicker you can learn, and the quicker you get to revenue.</p><p>14. <strong>Clear customer acquisition channel</strong>. You can think of at least one obvious way to reach your target customers and offer your solution.</p><p>15. <strong>Founder - market fit</strong>. Do you know this market well?</p><p>16. <strong>Founder - product fit</strong>. Are you the right person to create this solution? Do you need to build a team?</p><p>17. <strong>Founder unfair advantage</strong>. Are you one of only a handful of people who can build on this idea? E.g. you own a patent.</p><p>18. <strong>You love serving this market</strong>. Will you enjoy talking to and serving this group of customers day in and day out? Do you genuinely want to help them?</p><p>19. <strong>Market is proven</strong>. Are people already paying money to solve this problem? Are your competitors making tonnes of money?</p><p>20. <strong>Arduous but not impossible</strong>. Is this a problem that not many people want to solve because it's so troublesome? Is it a solution that requires a lot of "<a href="http://paulgraham.com/schlep.html">schlep</a>"?</p><p>21. <strong>Unique value proposition</strong>. Are you providing novel solution to the problem? Perhaps focusing on a small part of the bigger problem and providing a focused, but effective, solution?</p><p>22. <strong>Can be a sellable asset</strong>. Can this business become an asset that you can sell later?</p><p>23. <strong>No monopolies</strong>. Are the incumbents monopolies that can wipe you out in 2 seconds?</p><h3 id="nice-to-haves">Nice-to-haves</h3><p>24. <strong>Market is highly motivated</strong>. The market is willing to spend money on anything that will improve their lives or work.</p><p>25. <strong>The market has the purchasing power</strong>. They have the money to spend on your solution.</p><p>26. <strong>Able to pre-sell the solution</strong>. Are you able to pre-sell the solution, as a way to validate demand?</p><p>27. <strong>The problem is not sexy</strong>. Sexy products get people excited, but also attracts more competitors. There's money being made on problems that don't get mentioned in TechCrunch or Wired.</p><p>28. <strong>The solution is simple</strong>. Is your solution simpler to understand and use than your competitor's?</p><p>29. <strong>Target customers exist as communities</strong>. Do your customers hang out online together? This helps with word of mouth traffic.</p><p>30. <strong>Quick time to first customer</strong>. Are you able to get your first paying customer within 4 weeks? Or quicker, relative to your other ideas?</p><h2 id="how-to-use-this-checklist">How to use this checklist</h2><p>To make it easy for you, I have created a checklist in a Google Sheet with all the criteria above. Just make a copy of it and then use it to quickly tick off attributes of your idea, and to find gaps in research that you may need to do. I've included one idea as an example - a simple Shopify analytics app for store owners.</p><p><strong>✅ </strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/101Hi6atV5cY3R4Fb39jWv7slS2Tth3Ti54fAMrVODno/edit?usp=sharing"><strong>Get the SaaS Idea Evaluation Sheet here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Here's how I use the scoring sheet:</p><ul><li>As a way to score and compare my ideas before I pick the next one to work on. For this, I assign points to the criteria in each category and then just sum up the ones that the idea has.</li><li>As a checklist for questions I should be asking myself.</li><li>As a way to evaluate other people's ideas, when they ask, "do you think this is a good idea?".</li></ul><blockquote>"The Idea Matters - A bad idea, executed well, will not make a good business" — Dan Norris, The 7 Day Startup</blockquote><h2 id="if-you-want-more-">If you want more...</h2><p>This post is a short version of an eBook I am creating, titled <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/evaluatesaas">"How to pick a good SaaS idea: A pre-validation guide and evaluation checklist"</a>. </p><p>In the eBook I include:</p><ul><li>Descriptions, example startups, supporting resources, and quotes from founders, for each criteria.</li><li>A Google Sheet for automatically scoring and comparing your ideas.</li><li>A beautifully formatted PDF scoring sheet, for printing out.</li><li>PDF, MOBI, and ePub versions.</li></ul><p>If you feel that this will help you, then you can pre-order the eBook at the discounted pre-sale price of<strong> $4.99</strong>: click the button below or click <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/evaluatesaas">https://gumroad.com/l/evaluatesaas</a> now.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p>Late last week, the RIAA sent a legal threat to Github, claiming that the popular (and absolutely lawful) tool youtube-dl (which allows users to download Youtube videos for offline viewing, editing and archiving) violated Section 1201 of the #DMCA.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/24/1201-v-dl-youtube/#1201">https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/24/1201-v-dl-youtube/#1201</a></p>
<p>Even by the heavy-handed standards of the RIAA – a monopolist's "association" dominated by only three members – this was extraordinary. The law in question derives much of its efficacy from its vagueness, which chills software developers from risking its severe penalties.</p>
<p>DMCA1201 is an "anti-circumvention" law, banning the distribution of tools that bypass "effective means of access control" for copyrighted work, with a $500k fine and a 5-year sentence for a first violation.</p>
<p>Thus 1201 gives companies the power to felonize any action, even lawful ones. All you need to do is design a product so that using it in ways that you dislike requires bypassing "access controls" and presto! Your preferences are laws – "Felony contempt of business-model."</p>
<p>That's how Apple makes it a crime for me to write an app and sell it to you for your Iphone without giving Apple 30% of the purchase price. It's how Medtronic makes it a crime to fix its ventilators. It's how HP makes it a crime to refill a printer cartridge.</p>
<p>For all its centrality to modern commerce, 1201 has seen precious few cases litigated to judgment, so its contours remain fuzzy. That works to companies' advantage. They know that risk-averse competitors, security researchers and investors steer wide to avoid violating it.</p>
<p>Who wants to risk a wrong guess about the lawfulness of your activities that can land you in prison for 5 years?</p>
<p>There have been moments when the RIAA's rage brought us close to litigating key features of 1201, but cooler heads prevailed and they surrendered rather than putting their theories in front of a judge and risking a narrowing of 1201.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/felten-et-al-v-riaa-et-al7/">https://www.eff.org/cases/felten-et-al-v-riaa-et-al7/</a></p>
<p>In threatening youtube-dl, RIAA is risking a lot. Like what is an "effective means of access control"? There's an argument that goes, "If I can bypass it, how was it 'effective'?" That was tried in the 2600 case over Decss, and it didn't fly.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/effector/15/14">https://www.eff.org/effector/15/14</a></p>
<p>But while the courts were reluctant to decide how stout an access control must be to acquire statutory protection, they were unsympathetic to the arguments of the defunct file-sharing tool Aimster, which used Pig Latin to "encrypt" its filenames.</p>
<p>They argued that RIAA enforcers violated 1201 by "decrypting" them. This was quickly dismissed by courts, putting a floor under what "effective" means: "stronger than Pig Latin, weaker than Decss."</p>
<p><a href="https://news.slashdot.org/story/01/03/06/1448236/aimster-uses-pig-latin-encryption-to-defeat-riaa">https://news.slashdot.org/story/01/03/06/1448236/aimster-uses-pig-latin-encryption-to-defeat-riaa</a></p>
<p>The "access controls" that youtube-dl bypasses are (AFAIK) somewhere within those two bounds – basically a lot of obfuscation, but not encryption. If this goes to trial, "obfuscation" methods could end up being fair game for circumvention.</p>
<p>The other thorny question RIAA is raising here is standing – they're arguing that since some of their members' works are restricted by Google's access controls, then they have the right to sue over circumvention, even if Google doesn't mind.</p>
<p>If this question is ruled on, then it could go badly for RIAA irrespective of the ruling. If the court rules that only the creator of an access-control can invoke DMCA 1201, the list of potential aggressors under 1201 dwindles to a mere handful.</p>
<p>If the court rules that the RIAA <em>does</em> have standing, then that means that every single rightsholder whose works are implicated by an access control would ALSO have standing.</p>
<p>If the day comes that the RIAA's members want to break with a Big Tech music company (like Youtube, say!), and authorize their customers to jailbreak their music and take it with them to a rival service, any other rightsholder with a file on Youtube could stop this.</p>
<p>Indeed, under this theory, there may be no way of <em>ever</em> authorizing a circumvention – you'd need cooperation from every implicated rightsholder and the access-control's creator. The RIAA's members strongly value their own self-determination and this could really hurt them.</p>
<p>Will this go to trial? It's hard to say. Certainly, the RIAA has firehosed around so many complaints that they've created a cohort of potential defendants who might be willing to take their chances in court.</p>
<p>As Torrentfreak reports, before hitting Github, RIAA sent out notices in Germany – to Uberspace (the youtube-dl project's host) and to former project maintainer Philipp Hagemeister (no longer involved).</p>
<p><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/riaas-youtube-dl-takedown-ticks-of-developers-and-githubs-ceo-201027/">https://torrentfreak.com/riaas-youtube-dl-takedown-ticks-of-developers-and-githubs-ceo-201027/</a></p>
<p>And Natfriedman, Github's CEO, joined the developers' IRC channel to offer support (he told Torrentfreak, "We want to help the youtube-dl maintainers defeat the DMCA claim so that we can restore the repo").</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/t3rr4dice/status/1320660235363749888">https://twitter.com/t3rr4dice/status/1320660235363749888</a></p>
<p>The notice seems to have radicalized the company: "We are thinking about how GitHub can proactively help developers in more DMCA cases going forward, and take a more active role in reforming/repealing 1201."</p>
<p>Interestingly, Github's owner, Microsoft, is an RIAA member.</p>
<p>In the meantime, copies of the youtube-dl sourcecode have proliferated as developers and activists have mirrored it in protest of the RIAA's heavy hand.</p>
<p>DMCA 1201 is unconstitutional: that's an argument EFF is making in its lawsuit on behalf of Matthew Green and Andrew "bunnie" Huang, which seeks to overturn the law.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/green-v-us-department-justice">https://www.eff.org/cases/green-v-us-department-justice</a></p>
<p>A legal reckoning over 1201 is long overdue, thanks to the tactical cowardice of RIAA, which has run from the victims that stood up to its bullying rather than risking a day in court and the law's judicial overturn. EFF's suit has been slow going, plagued by long delays.</p>
<p>It's never good to be on the receiving end of legal threats from wealthy, powerful, connected industry groups. But here might be a case that finally drives a stake through 1201's heart. It's not a silver lining, but at least it's something.</p>

<p>Trumpism is an incompetent death cult. The movement's incompetence (embodied by the inability of many of its worst monsters to keep their jobs long enough to enact their key policies) finally met its match with the pandemic, though.</p>
<p>When the plague started, Trumpism's thought-leaders rushed to advise the elderly voters who constitute its base that they should engage in high-risk conduct:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/04/a-mind-forever-voyaging/#receipts-r-us">https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/04/a-mind-forever-voyaging/#receipts-r-us</a></p>
<p>They insisted that the answer to the plague was for the "free market" to decide which countermeasures would save our lives:</p>

<p>And when that failed, they literally told old people it was their moral duty to commit suicide-by-virus in order to save the economy:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/03/dan-patrick-coronavirus-grandparents">https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/03/dan-patrick-coronavirus-grandparents</a></p>
<p>Now, as Trump desperately hauls his mouldering carcass through the precincts he needs to swing for him after he spent half a year telling them to kill themselves, he's tripped over his own tie, hospitalizing his few remaining stalwarts.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/10/28/omaha-trump-rally-thousands-attendees-stranded-cold-after-event/3760175001/">https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/10/28/omaha-trump-rally-thousands-attendees-stranded-cold-after-event/3760175001/</a></p>
<p>Last night, Trump rallied his heavily comorbid base at Nebraska’s Eppley Airfield, finishing his speech and flying off in his presidential jet as temperatures plummeted to 34' (about 1' C).</p>
<p>The thousands of attendees he left behind were at the mercy of the kind of grifter Trump gets to throw rallies for him. Unfortunately for them, that's the kind of grifter who provides no shelter for attendees and takes four hours to bus them all offsite.</p>
<p>"We need at least 30 more buses" – Omaha officer on the scene.</p>
<p>Many experienced hypothermia. At least seven attendees were hospitalized. Law enforcement reported elderly attendees were "frozen cold unable to move with an altered mental status."</p>

<p>The fact that he can't bestir himself from attempting to murder his supporters until <em>after</em> election-day really says it all.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
  

  <p>A few days ago, the YouTube algorithm suggested to me and many other a BBC TopGear video about a new world record
    for the
    fastest <em>production</em> car.</p>

  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N22JfNHiC1k" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

  <p>SSC North America, a sports car manufacturer, claims in this video to have reached 532.8km/h with their latest car
    (331mph if you still didn't get the memo about the
    world using metric units). It's a single run and the video doesn't include the second run driving back to the
    starting point. A real speed record for cars is the mean of the two runs to take into account elevation changes and
    wind. Still, it's <em>a lot</em> faster than the previous official world record held by Bugatti on their dedicated
    track at
    431km/h, or the non-official world record of Koenigsegg at 447km/h.</p>

  <p>You can argue whether these cars are production cars, or the utility to drive at such high speeds when after each
    run of a few seconds you need to change the tires, the wheels, and sometimes the engine. You can also wonder why our
    societies still invest in fast supercars cars when they should prioritize low consumption electric cars. Or you can
    reflect on the point of building cars at all, shouldn't we bike and develop more public transports? I
    was impressed by this record. I like fast cars, I own a Bugatti Chiron in Lego.</p>

  <p>You may have guessed, the record is perhaps invalid. Many people did question the record, by computing the average
    speed on the road section shown on the video or doing the maths of the aerodynamics force involved at such extremely
    high speeds for example.</p>

  <p>Yesterday, Misha Charoudin who is a professional driver and a vlogger published a video of him and a friend
    discussing the record attempt with some technical details, such as the gearbox ratios and the wheels
    dimensions of the car. Using this information, I got the idea to try computing the maximum speed using an audio
    frequency spectrum analysis. The idea is to use the engine sound to guess the car real speed. Everything is
    connected, it should be straightforward.</p>

  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fSNRKBj_hUE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

  <h3>Step 1: Download the record attempt video using youtube-dl.</h3>

  <p><code>youtube-dl --list-formats https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N22JfNHiC1k</code></p>
  <p>I selected the format with the highest audio bitrate.</p>
  <p><code>youtube-dl --format 251 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N22JfNHiC1k</code></p>

  <h3>Step 2: Extract the audio from the video.</h3>

  <p>There is a ffmpeg command to extract the audio from the video, but I used VLC because I didn't feel like installing
    ffmpeg and searching for the right command. I exported to FLAC because it's a lossless format compatible with
    Audacity.</p>

  <img src="https://fungiboletus.github.io/ssc-rpm/vlc-convert.png" alt="Screenshot of VLC to convert the video to audio">

  <h3>Step 3: Loading the audio file in Audacity</h3>

  <img src="https://fungiboletus.github.io/ssc-rpm/audacity-load.png" alt="Screenshot of the audio file in Audacity">

  <p>The file is in stereo, but the analysis is simpler in mono. I used the "Split stereo to mono" option and deleted
    one of the track. It doesn't matter which one, but to be sure I tried both and I obtained the same final
    result.</p>

  <img src="https://fungiboletus.github.io/ssc-rpm/audacity-split.png" alt="Screenshot of the context menu to select split stereo to mono">

  <h3>Step 4: Setting up the spectrogram</h3>

  <p>I selected the spectrogram view, a very cool feature of Audacity.</p>
  <img src="https://fungiboletus.github.io/ssc-rpm/audacity-spectrogram.png" alt="Screenshot of the context menu to select the spectrogram view">
  <br>
  <img src="https://fungiboletus.github.io/ssc-rpm/spectrogram.png" alt="Spectrogram">

  <p>Nothing is very visible yet, it's mostly (wind) noise. So I tried a few settings and after some tries, I got
    something a lot more interesting. I used the highest window size and ignored the frequencies above 600Hz as I'm more
    interested in the main harmonic frequencies of the engine. I also resized the spectrogram view.</p>

  <img src="https://fungiboletus.github.io/ssc-rpm/spectrogram-settings.png" alt="Screenshot of the spectrogram view settings">
  <br>
  <img src="https://fungiboletus.github.io/ssc-rpm/nice-spectrogram.png" alt="A nicer spectrogram">

  <h3>Step 5: Analysing the spectrogram</h3>

  <p>The lines are harmonic frequencies of the car components, such as the gearbox, the engine, the wheels,
    etc. One line is particularly visible, and thanks to the gearshifts it's easy to guess that it's one harmonic
    related to the engine sound.</p>
  <img src="https://fungiboletus.github.io/ssc-rpm/spectrogram-explained.png" alt="An explained version of the spectrogram">

  <p>I then zoomed on the part when the car is the fastest in the video, and selected the audio where the harmonic is at
    its highest pitch. I then plotted the spectrum in the analyze menu, to have a more precise idea of the frequency.
    Finding out where is the corresponding peak in the chart is a bit difficult but it's for sure the one at 251Hz.</p>

  <img src="https://fungiboletus.github.io/ssc-rpm/audacity-selection.png" alt="Selection of the audio at the maximum speed">
  <br>
  <img src="https://fungiboletus.github.io/ssc-rpm/frequency-analysis.png" alt="Frequency analysis of the video sound at the maximum speed">

  <h3>Step 6: Computing the engine RPM</h3>

  <p>So after that, I knew that at the highest speed, my nice engine harmonic had a frequency of 251Hz. I only needed to
    figure out the formula to compute the RPM from this harmonic frequency. Thankfully, the video from Misha includes
    data with the engine RPM at two points in time. The dashboard is blurred in the YouTube video of record, I wonder
    why,
    but according to the Misha video SSC also published on Instagram videos with a not blurred dashboard,
    allowing them to know the RPM at two points in time.</p>

  <p>I also quickly searched the formula and found out it was something like
    <code>RPM = 60 * frequency * something</code>. The main thing is that we need to convert from Hz to RPM and it's
    linear.</p>

  <p>Using audacity I analyzed the frequencies of the same harmonic. I got 243Hz at 1m21, for about 7300rpm, and 189Hz
    at 1m37 for about 5400rpm. My formula was, therefore, <code>RPM = 30 * frequency</code>.</p>

  <p>Finally, to compute the engine RPM at the maximum speed, I multiplied the frequency of the harmonic by 30. So
    <code>251 * 30 = 7530 rpm</code>.</p>

  <h3>Step 7: Getting the final speed</h3>

  <p>Computing the car speed from the engine RPM is simple if you have the data, you know how fast the engine rotates
    and you need to know how fast the wheels rotate, and their size.</p>

  <p>Good news, SSC <a href="https://www.sscnorthamerica.com/news/jerod-shelby-explains-world-record">gave us the
      data.</a> We rear wheels had <code>89.125</code> inches of circumference, <code>2.263775</code> meters. The final
    drive ratio was <code>2.92</code> and the sixth gear, the one used for the record had a ratio of <code>0.757</code>.
  </p>

  <p>The gearbox ratios are different than in the Misha video. I think they didn't know SSC had used a specific gearbox.
    We got a final drive ratio of <code>3.167</code> and a sixth gear ratio of <code>0.784</code>.

  </p><p>Putting everything together, we have
    <code>speed = rear_wheel_circumference * rpm / 60 / final_drive_ratio / sixth_gear_ratio</code>.</p>

  <p>With SSC data, at <code>7530</code> rpm it means <code>128.5m/s</code> or <code>460.8km/h</code> or
    <code>286.3mph</code>. Still above the previous records.</p>
  <p>With Misha's video data, at <code>7530</code> rpm it means <code>114.4m/s</code> or <code>411.9km/h</code> or
    <code>255.9mph</code>.</p>

  <h3>Who is right?</h3>

  <p>SSC <a href="https://www.sscnorthamerica.com/news/jerod-shelby-explains-world-record">announced</a> that the engine
    was at <code>8600rpm</code> at the maximum speed, but I&nbsp;computed <code>7530rpm</code>. I may have used some wrong
    data
    when estimating the RPM, though I like the cleanness of my formula: <code>RPM = 30 * frequency</code>.</p>

<p>Finage is a financial data provider that’s known for its strong backend and high performance. The Finage WS (FWS) Engine is keeping the connection alive and providing high performance. Let’s dive into the system. </p>







<p>Finage offers VPS (Virtual Private Server) for every customer that subscribed to any professional WebSocket package. This means you’ll have more control over your server. You can check the total connections, server CPU, and more. </p>







<h2 id="u-s-stock-historical-api">
	<span>
		<span>U.S STOCK HISTORICAL API</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>After your <em><strong>WebSocket subscription</strong></em>, Finage will create two keys for you. </p>



<p><strong>ADDRESS_KEY</strong>:  This is used to create your own personal address. For example, if your ADDRESS_KEY is “abcd1234” then you’ll have a WebSocket address like <strong>abcd1234.finage.ws </strong>to create a connection.</p>



<p><br><strong>SOCKET_KEY</strong>&nbsp;= This key is like a API_KEY. You need to use this key to create a connection on your server. In addition to this, the FWS engine checks the incoming connection’s IP address, if it’s not in the whitelist, then rejects the connection. For example, if your SOCKET_KEY is “<strong>SOCKET_KEY2R2TZMRNTRG9VHR3CR4KDUJD3P5JPQ8RC2PQNTMB8MWMXJDK</strong>“. Then you can use the address given below to create a connection.</p>



<p><strong><em>wss://abcd1234.finage.ws/?token=SOCKET_KEY2R2TZMRNTRG9VHR3CR4KDUJD3P5JPQ8RC2PQNTMB8MWMXJDK </em></strong></p>



<p>This address is your own and can only be used by you.</p>







<p>After the connection, you can <strong>subscribe</strong> a symbol with the command given below;</p>



<pre><code>{<br>     "action":"subscribe",<br>     "symbols":"AAPL"<br>}</code></pre>



<p>Also, you can subscribe more than one symbol at one time</p>



<pre><code>{<br>     "action":"subscribe",<br>     "symbols":"AAPL,AMZN,TESLA"<br>}</code></pre>







<p>Unsubscribing a symbol is easy also;</p>



<pre><code>{<br>     "action":"unsubscribe",<br>     "symbols":"AAPL"<br>}</code></pre>







<p>You’ll get the responses from the server after your subscription. </p>







<pre><code>[{<br>     "symbol": "AAPL",<br>     "ask": 111.82,<br>     "bid": 111.8,<br>     "timestamp": 1603920820567<br>}]</code></pre>







<p>Finage also has open, high, low, close (<strong>OHLC</strong>) and <strong>volume</strong> values. We can add it to your response and edit your responses according to your needs. In Finage, you can define your own rules. </p>







<h2 id="u-s-stock-historical-api-2">
	<span>
		<span>U.S Stock Historical API</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>Finage has <strong>30-Year Historical U.S. Stock API</strong>. In our packages, the default package is <strong>15-Year Historical U.S Stock API</strong>. According to your needs, you can customize your professional package. </p>







<p>It’s easy to use Finage’s historical API. After your subscription, we will define an API KEY to your account. You can see your API KEY in the dashboard (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://moon.finage.co.uk/" target="_blank">https://moon.finage.co.uk</a>).</p>



<p>For example, let’s see the APPLE’s <strong>OHLC</strong> and <strong>Volume</strong> data in <em>2005-02-03</em> ;</p>



<p><a href="https://api.finage.co.uk/HISTORY/STOCK/OPEN-CLOSE?STOCK=AAPL&amp;DATE=2005-02-03&amp;APIKEY=YOUR_API_KEY">https://api.finage.co.uk/history/stock/open-close?stock=AAPL&amp;date=2005-02-03&amp;apikey=YOUR_API_KEY</a></p>



<p>After the request, you will get a response like;</p>



<pre>{
    "symbol":"AAPL",
    "open":79.1,
    "high":79.43,
    "low":77.33,
    "close":77.81,
    "volume":13089041,
    "from":"2005-02-03"
}</pre>











<p>With Finage, you have the freedom to customize, edit and create your own rules on the system without any coding or extra fees. Our tech team is always ready to help you out.</p>

The three of us had all worked together before at <a href="http://taskrabbit.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">TaskRabbit</a>, but since we were starting a brand new company, we decided to approach how we would work from a first principles approach. I thought we’d share some tidbits about how we work right now.</p><p><img alt="The Grouparoo team at our founding meeting" src="https://www.grouparoo.com/posts/how-grouparoo-works-as-a-team/team-photo.jpg"></p><h3>Remote-first and asynchronous-first</h3><p>We view these two principles as distinct, but how these two principles interact is often intertwined. We decided to make the company remote-first for a few reasons. First, the three of us all live in different areas (ok, Brian and I are both in the SF Bay Area, but we’re easily 60 minutes apart so let’s just say we’re in different areas for convenience’s sake 😅). Additionally, we believe that there is good talent everywhere, not just around the major tech hubs or cities. We’d all had varying degrees of experience working remotely, but few of us had done so from the start. Starting remote from the beginning of the company actually wasn’t too challenging. We’d all used <a href="http://slack.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Slack</a>, Google Meet/Zoom, Github, and various other tools for our past roles, so the tools weren't particularly new to us. We’ve also been very happy with <a href="https://tuple.app/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tuple</a>, a screen-sharing tool made specifically for pair programming. The ability to use someone else’s mouse and keyboard remotely really approximated the pair-programming experience we were used to (sidenote that we're still bummed that Slack bought ScreenHero and did approximately nothing with that product before shutting it down).</p><p>The trickier part for us was moving to asynchronous working. We were mostly used to sitting in the same room as our colleagues. Often with the tap on the shoulder or a slack message, you can pull their attention away. Many studies have shown that getting into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">flow-state</a> (having uninterrupted time to focus) improves people’s satisfaction with their work as well as their work output. One of the many cultural practices that I loved from my time at <a href="http://stripe.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Stripe</a> was how nearly every decision or idea was written in a document. Writing your thoughts in a document both helps you think through what your ideas are, and then additionally, having a document gives people time to digest and respond. We've adopted this practice here at Grouparoo, and it's worked pretty well for us so far. That isn’t to say writing docs is the best approach for all instances, but it’s a solid default stance to take.</p><p>We do still meet synchronously when it’s warranted; we have daily “stand-ups” in a video chat, and we have a weekly planning meeting on Monday and a weekly demo/retro. If we ever chat in Slack and there’s a fair amount of back-and-forth, we’ll propose we jump into a call in case that could help eliminate confusion about our discussion.</p><h3>Meeting IRL is great (when it can happen)</h3><p>While our default is async and remote, meeting in-person is still very important to us. Before COVID, we would meet in-person once a month for a day-long “on-site”. During those days, we’d brainstorm our plans for the month, discuss strategy and the roadmap, goals, and have a team dinner (and maybe a team game of Civilization).</p><p>While we haven’t been able to meet IRL since March 2020, we’ve moved these full-day “on-sites” online. That said, they haven’t taken the same form. Attending a full-day on-site IRL can be draining; attending a full-day <strong>online</strong> on-site is mind-numbing. We’re now spreading them out into a few 60-90 minute meetings across a couple of days, and doing more pre-work so the discussions can be more focused. I wouldn’t say we’re 100% nailing this process, but we’re still learning and evolving with each month.</p><p>Since we aren’t able to meet IRL, we’ve taken to playing games online for some non-work activities. Most recently we played some Settlers of Catan!</p><p><img alt="The Grouparoo team plays a friendly game of Settlers of Catan" src="https://www.grouparoo.com/posts/how-grouparoo-works-as-a-team/team-catan.jpeg"></p><h3>Default to open</h3><p>When we decided to build an open-source product, we found ourselves asking over and over again “should this feature be open-source/free or paid?” Asking that question for every roadmap item could get exhausting, so we decided to take a framework-approach to how we’d think about open-ness. We landed on, by default, everything we do will be open, from our <a href="https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">core project</a>, our <a href="https://www.grouparoo.com/roadmap" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">roadmap</a>, and even our <a href="https://github.com/grouparoo/www.grouparoo.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">marketing site</a>. That said, there are some artifacts that we don't keep open, such as pay and our longer-term strategy. That said, we have all of those docs available privately to all of our team members (in Github, of course).</p><h3>Snapshot</h3><p>Most of what I shared is just a snapshot of how we work right now in October 2020. One of the most exciting parts about growing the team is that the culture and practices of the company will (and should!) change and evolve. We don’t presume to have the answers to everything, so we’re very excited to bring in new team members and for them to contribute ideas to how we can work better together. <a href="http://grouparoo.com/jobs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">We’re hiring!</a></p></span></p><br><div role="alert"><div><p><img src="https://www.grouparoo.com/_next/static/images/andy_jih-0eebb98acb7e40f0e3b81672c92ea91c.png"></p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div>
        <p>
            This is a very short book about copying. Its contents, unless
            otherwise noted, are licensed under
            <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CC-BY SA 4.0</a>
            (more on that in a bit). You can download, copy, remix, excerpt,
            change, and repost it however you see fit.
        </p>
        <p>I</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Charles Eames</strong> said
            it best: “We don’t do ‘art’ — we solve problems.”<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
        </p>

        <p>
            To buy furniture in 1950, you had to choose between affordable and
            enduring, between rugged and fashionable. Charles and Ray designed a
            chair that was all the above and sold it for $20.95.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
            They called it the LCW.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
        </p>

        <p>
            The LCW embodies the Eames’ obsession with simplicity in material
            and method. “We want to make the best for the most for the least,”
            they said.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
            The design was revolutionary: in 1999, <em>Time</em> magazine called
            the LCW “the best design of the century.”<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
            Today, you can buy a brand new LCW from Herman Miller (the
            officially licensed manufacturer of Eames products) for $1,195.
        </p>
        <p>
            Or, you can buy a chair called the “Fathom” from a company called
            Modway for $145.
        </p>
        <p>Functionally and aesthetically, the chairs are identical.</p>

        <p>
            There’s an LCW from 1946 in MOMA’s collection. It’s one of the very
            first ever made. Most people would call it the original LCW.
        </p>
        <p>
            Charles and Ray Eames sold the manufacturing rights for their
            furniture to Herman Miller in 1947. Collectors call the LCWs made in
            the ’40s and ’50s “originals.” But in some sense, these — and the
            more recently manufactured Herman Miller versions — are copies of
            that LCW in the MOMA collection.
        </p>
        <p>
            And then there’s the Modway Fathom. It’s clearly a copy, an
            unlicensed one at that. But at $145 (the equivalent of $12.78 in
            1947) it’s more affordable than the LCW was when it was first
            manufactured and sold. In spirit, it’s more of an original than any
            LCW: the best, for the most, for the least.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            I’m sharing this story because it demonstrates a surprising fact:
            what makes something “original” (the first, the best, the most
            famous, the most true) or a “copy” (an identical copy, an
            unauthorized replica, an interpretation or a remix) isn’t always
            obvious — or important.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m a designer. As a designer, I feel the need to be original. If
            you’re a designer, or even if you’re just interested in design, you
            probably feel the need to be original, too. We tend to worship
            inventors and originators, designers who were trailblazing and
            innovative. And we copy them.
        </p>
        <p>
            This oxymoron of a craft can drive a person crazy. There’s lots of
            space between originality and industry, authorship and
            acknowledgement, riffing and ripping. I wrote this very short book
            to explore that space.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some people have been frustrated by copying, refused to accept it,
            and struggled with every ounce of their strength against it. Other
            people have used copying to their advantage, whether to improve
            themselves, build a community, or subvert authority.
        </p>
        <p>I’ve only been able to have a career in design because I copied.</p>
        <p>
            I hope that by the time you’ve finished reading, you’ll see how
            important copying is. Right or wrong, virtue or vice, copying is the
            way design works.
        </p>
        <p>II</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Steve Jobs copied.</strong>
            “Great artists steal,” he said, quoting Pablo Picasso (or was it
            Stravinsky? T. S. Eliot?<sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>). Jobs and Apple copied many designs in their early days, most
            notably from a Xerox research laboratory in Palo Alto. The story
            goes like this:
        </p>
        <p>
            In the early 20th century, Xerox was a pioneer of office technology.
            By the middle of the century, computers were getting smaller and
            more affordable, and Xerox knew they’d have to work hard to keep
            their market dominance. In 1970, The Xerox Palo Alto Research Center
            — Xerox PARC — was founded to explore the future of the “paperless
            office.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Within two years, Xerox PARC had designed a groundbreaking computer
            called the Alto. One of its innovations was a graphical user
            interface: programs and files were displayed in virtual windows
            which users navigated using a mouse. It was an eerily accurate
            picture of what personal computers would look like 30 years later.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jef Raskin, leader of the Macintosh project at Apple, had seen
            Xerox’s work. He wanted Steve Jobs to see it for himself, and set up
            a meeting.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I thought it was the best thing I’d ever seen in my life,” Jobs
            said of the Alto’s user interface. “Within ten minutes it was
            obvious to me that all computers would work like this some day.”
        </p>
        <p>
            When the Macintosh was released in 1984, it featured a graphical
            user interface. Programs and files were displayed in virtual windows
            which users navigated using a mouse.
        </p>
        <p>It was just like the Alto.</p>

        <p>Steve Jobs didn’t like to be copied.</p>
        <p>
            In 1985, a year after the Macintosh was launched, Apple sued a
            company called Digital Research Interactive for copying the
            Macintosh’s user interface. Digital Research settled out of court,
            and changed the appearance of its icons, windows, and mouse
            pointers.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1990, Apple sued both Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard. The case was
            a repeat: Microsoft’s Windows and HP’s NewWave featured designs that
            Apple claimed were copies of the Macintosh’s operating system. But
            early licensing agreements between Apple and Microsoft made it
            unclear if any infringement took place; the case was thrown out.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the middle of Apple’s case against Microsoft, Xerox sued Apple,
            hoping to establish its rights as the inventor of the desktop
            interface. The court threw out this case, too, and questioned why
            Xerox took so long to raise the issue.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>
            Bill Gates later reflected on these cases: “we both had this rich
            neighbor named Xerox ... I broke into his house to steal the TV set
            and found out that [Jobs] had already stolen it.”<sup><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            The rampant copying fueling the explosive growth of consumer
            computers meant that by 1990, the desktop user interface was
            ubiquitous; it was impossible to determine who originated any part
            of it, or who copied who. The quest to stake their claim nearly
            consumed Apple. But when they emerged, they had learned a thing or
            two. Today, Apple holds more than 2,300 design patents.<sup><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup>

            This story ends in 2011, with Apple suing Samsung for copying the
            design of its software and hardware products. One of the most
            remarkable claims: Samsung broke the law when it sold “a rectangular
            product with four evenly rounded corners.”<sup><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            The court rejected Apple’s claim to own rounded rectangles. But it
            upheld the other claims, fining Samsung a blistering $539 million
            for patent violations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Designers copy. We steal like great artists. But when we see a copy
            of our work, we’re livid. Jobs, on Google’s Android: “I will spend
            my last dying breath if I need to, and I will spend every penny of
            Apple’s $40 billion in the bank, to right this wrong. I’m going to
            destroy Android, because it’s a stolen product.”<sup><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            Steve Jobs was unmatched in his visionary dedication to innovation.
            But he never came to terms with the inevitability of copying.
        </p>
        <p>III</p>
        <p>
            <strong>John Carmack had </strong>a
            different relationship with copying. For him, copying was a way to
            learn, a challenge to overcome, and a source of new ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
            Carmack was — still is — a brilliant coder. He’s best known for
            programming the ultraviolent and action-packed first-person shooters
            <em>Doom</em> and <em>Quake</em>. Those games pushed the limits of
            consumer computers and defined a genre. But his first real
            breakthrough game was simpler, cuter, more whimsical. It was called
            <em>Commander Keen</em>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p>Oat++ ORM framework is a set of generalized interfaces and their implementations to make it easy to work with databases.</p> <p>It's based on an <a href="https://oatpp.io/docs/components/dto/">object-mapping framework</a> and ensures data consistency when manipulating with data.
Also, it integrates perfectly with other Oat++ components ensuring seamless data-flow in the application
(example: from REST to database, from the database to REST).</p>  <h2 id="high-level-overview"><a href="#high-level-overview">#</a> High-Level Overview</h2> <h3 id="declare-dbclient"><a href="#declare-dbclient">#</a> Declare DbClient</h3> <p>The main component you are going to work with is the <a href="https://oatpp.io/api/latest/oatpp/orm/DbClient/">DbClient</a>.
You may treat it as the main point interfacing with your data. Here you declare database queries and manage database schema migrations.</p> <p>Database queries are declared with the help of code-gen macros.<br>
DbClient code generation section must begin with
<code>#include OATPP_CODEGEN_BEGIN(DbClient)</code> and must be closed with
<code>#include OATPP_CODEGEN_END(DbClient)</code>.<br> <em>Do not forget to close the code generation section in order to avoid macro conflicts later in the code!</em></p> <h3 id="create-dbclient-component-and-connect-to-database"><a href="#create-dbclient-component-and-connect-to-database">#</a> Create DbClient Component And Connect to Database</h3> <p>DbClient is a heavy object - you want to instantiate it once and then inject it in whatever places you are going to use it.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong></p> <ul><li><code>ConnectionProvider</code> and <code>ConnectionPool</code> objects can be reused by multiple <code>Executors</code> unless it's
prohibited by a database-specific implementation.</li> <li><code>Executor</code> can be reused by multiple DbClients unless it's prohibited by a database-specific implementation.</li></ul> <h3 id="dbclient-usage-example"><a href="#dbclient-usage-example">#</a> DbClient Usage Example</h3> <p>Output:</p> <h2 id="supported-databases"><a href="#supported-databases">#</a> Supported Databases</h2> <h3 id="available-database-adaptors"><a href="#available-database-adaptors">#</a> Available Database Adaptors</h3> <table><thead><tr><th>Adaptor</th> <th>Database</th> <th>Limitations</th> <th>Example Project</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td><a href="https://github.com/oatpp/oatpp-sqlite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">oatpp-sqlite</a></td> <td>SQLite</td> <td><strong>Full feature support</strong></td> <td><a href="https://github.com/oatpp/example-crud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">example-crud</a></td></tr> <tr><td><a href="https://github.com/oatpp/oatpp-postgresql" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">oatpp-postgresql</a></td> <td>PostgreSQL</td> <td>Doesn't support all postgres types</td> <td><a href="https://github.com/oatpp/example-postgresql" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">example-postgresql</a></td></tr></tbody></table> <h3 id="libraries-hierarchy"><a href="#libraries-hierarchy">#</a> Libraries Hierarchy</h3> <p>The main <strong>oatpp</strong> module contains ORM interfaces only.

Thus you ensure the correct order of arguments.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong><br>
The query template variable names are now starting with <code>user</code>, like <code>user.username</code> -
where <code>user</code> is the name of the DTO parameter, and <code>username</code> is the name of DTO field.</p> <ul><li><strong>Yes</strong>, you can specify a path to nested DTO fields like <code>:user.path.to.nested.field</code>.</li> <li><strong>Yes</strong>, you can have multiple DTO parameters in the query, and you can mix DTO parameters with regular parameters.</li></ul> <h3 id="query-with-prepared-statement"><a href="#query-with-prepared-statement">#</a> Query With Prepared Statement</h3> <p><strong>Note</strong>:<br>
The database adapter may ignore this.
For example:</p> <ul><li>SQLite is always using prepared statements to execute queries thus <strong>oatpp-sqlite</strong> will ignore this parameter.</li> <li>PostgreSQL has a special method to execute prepared statements thus <strong>oatpp-postgresql</strong> will not ignore this parameter.</li></ul> <h3 id="execute-an-arbitrary-query"><a href="#execute-an-arbitrary-query">#</a> Execute An Arbitrary Query</h3> <p>To execute an arbitrary query use <a href="https://oatpp.io/api/latest/oatpp/orm/DbClient/#dbclient-executequery">DbClient::executeQuery()</a> method.<br>
Use this method when it's needed to dynamically build a query.</p> <p>You can add parameters using parameters map:</p> <p>When building parameters map dynamically you have to use <code>std::unordered_map::insert()</code> method.<br>
The <code>[]</code> operator WON'T work.</p> <p>To build a query string it's recommended to use <a href="https://oatpp.io/api/latest/oatpp/core/data/stream/BufferStream/#bufferoutputstream">oatpp::data::stream::BufferOutputStream</a>.</p> <h3 id="enable-type-interpretations"><a href="#enable-type-interpretations">#</a> Enable Type Interpretations</h3> <p>When using custom or non-standard types as parameters in <code>QUERY</code> macro,
as well as when reading query results to custom/non-standard structures, you have to
explicitly enable corresponding type interpretations.</p> <p>The recommended place to do it - is the constructor:</p> <h4 id="query-with-custom-type-parameter"><a href="#query-with-custom-type-parameter">#</a> Query With Custom Type Parameter</h4> <h4 id="map-query-result-to-custom-type"><a href="#map-query-result-to-custom-type">#</a> Map Query Result To Custom Type</h4> <h3 id="transactions"><a href="#transactions">#</a> Transactions</h3> <p>Use <a href="https://oatpp.io/api/latest/oatpp/orm/DbClient/#dbclient-begintransaction">DbClient::beginTransaction()</a> method to begin a transaction.<br>

						<p>Now that 2020 is here, let’s look at what we can expect from the next decade in software. As Web developers, our solutions can help shape the organizations we work for. The tools we build and the architectural decisions we make have a compounding effect on society at large. What are the new trends, and will they help empower or enslave people?</p>
<h2>The Old Trends</h2>
<p>The trends in the last 10-20 years have led to more and more <a href="https://qbix.com/blog/2017/08/20/centralization-and-open-source/">centralization of the Web</a>, consolidation of power in the hands of the largest services (Facebook, Google, Amazon, Reddit) and their extended ecosystems. Between these and the large publications, the “independent Web” has suffered a tremendous setback.  Most people and organizations trust large corporations with proprietary algorithms to manage their data, identity and brand. This has led to <a href="https://qbix.com/blog/2019/03/08/how-qbix-platform-can-change-the-world/">massive new issues for individuals and society</a>, involving governments and corporations, and how we all relate to one another. Attempts to resolve these issues have spawned some projects to <a href="https://qbix.com/blog/2017/08/30/the-future-of-decentralization/">decentralize the Web</a>.</p>
<p>When the Web was born, browsers rendered HTML documents, and there was very little support for client-side programming. Whatever Javascript support was introduced over the next decade was inconsistent because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars">browser wars</a>, and led to <a href="http://www.jqueryvsmootools.com/">Javascript libraries</a> to bridge the gap, of which jQuery emerged as the winner. The last 10 years saw the rise of <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> and <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, new versions of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5">Javascript</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API">HTML5 Web APIs</a>, which finally made front-end Web programming a powerful proposition on the most widely deployed platform in the world.</p>
<h2>Client-First Web Apps</h2>
<p>As Javascript was maturing, a conventional wisdom has developed among most Web developers, that you should render the HTML on the client side, and then progressively enhance it with Javascript. This was considered best practice and recommended by pretty much every authority from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-it-matters-e80c7aaf834a/">2009</a> to <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-it-matters-e80c7aaf834a/">2018</a>.</p>
<p>In this decade, Web developers will turn this conventional wisdom on its head, and start to consider progressive enhancement to go the other way:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, develop static HTML, CSS and Javascript</li>
<li>Make Javascript fetch data from servers, render it on the client</li>
<li>Progressively enhance the site for older environments (Server-rendered HTML)</li>
</ol>
<p>What follows are multiple reasons for why this is the better approach going forward. <span>This one shift in how we approach Web development will have profound technological and societal implications.</span></p>
<h2 id="distributing-software">Distributing Software</h2>
<p><strong>1. Separation of concerns.</strong> It pays to decouple the rendering of an interface from the delivery of code / markup. That way we are not tied to one type of app delivery — that of a server on the web sending our executable code. We are able to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sideloading">sideload apps</a>, download them from <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources">app stores</a>, and update specific files when they have changed. And we use one language for each task, too: JS is the code. HTML / Handlebars / etc. can be used for templates / markup. CSS is used for presentation. JSON or XML is used for data. After you have done this, if you want to pre-render HTML on a server for AJAX, you can, but will start to feel “dirty” as you’ll be coupling things unnecessarily again. Things are going this way as <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-10-15-free-headless-cms/">headless CMSes</a> are making an appearance, while <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/">Cordova</a>, <a href="https://ionicframework.com/">Ionic</a> and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a> represent other ways of delivering code through app stores.</p>
<p><strong>2. Trust. </strong> You can’t trust what code is running remotely (although Signal <a href="https://signal.org/blog/private-contact-discovery/">has been experimenting</a> with using <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/innovative-technology-for-cpu-based-attestation-and-sealing">Software Guard Extensions</a> by CPU makers, originally designed for DRM, to go the other way and ensure what code runs on a server). But even if you can, you have no guarantee some other process won’t steal or corrupt your data. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_computing_base">Trusted Computing Base</a> should not include arbitrary amounts of remote sites shipping code at any time. Decoupling how the code is loaded (see point #1) onto your client allows you or your user agent to verify checksums and certify that it is indeed the code you think it is. And it is that code that should be managing your data and using the personal keys on your device. Package managers and app stores will be able to distribute code that has been audited by third-party security firms, and people will be able to trust them.</p>
<p><strong>3. Decentralization of Code.</strong> As the next decade unfolds, we will find that&nbsp;code bases don’t necessarily have to live shrink-wrapped on a specific server. Rather, clients can use multiple interoperable software modules and versions and can have multiple app stores and distributors in the future helping maintain repos and package managers for end-users and organizations. We will probably see automated package management become more user friendly in the 2020s, as we already have a docker container culture, we have browser based package managers etc.</p>
<h2 id="data-ownership">Data Ownership</h2>
<p><strong>4. Decentralization of Data.</strong> This is the big one in terms of effect on society. By having web servers render your webpage, you are implicitly locking yourself and your organization into the type of model where the servers store and access the data in a private database. They have enough data to render everything, apply access control rules to manage what you can read and write, and so on. Instead, we as a society need to empower people and their client side apps, and push the logic of fetching data, caching it and assembling it to the <a href="https://continuations.com/post/108271329110/tedxnewyork-big-and-bot-policy-proposals">user agents</a>. We can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security">capabilities</a> / <a href="https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/">access tokens</a> for data instead of a centralized site rendering HTML. <span>In this way, always inverting the progressive enhancement is an <em><span>activist</span></em> position to change society against the abuses of power </span><a href="https://qbix.com/blog/2019/03/08/how-qbix-platform-can-change-the-world/">like the ones listed here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>5. Reliability</strong> After the 2015 ISIS attacks in Paris, countries around the world expressed solidarity with the French people. French colors were flown, but similar-sized attacks at the same time by ISIS in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/16/world/middleeast/beirut-lebanon-attacks-paris.html?smid=tw-nytimesworld&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=0">Beirut</a> were totally forgotten. Facebook rolled out a feature to customize one’s profile with the French flag superimposed, but only the French flag. So we used the Qbix Platform to quickly build a small app called <a href="https://customizemypic.com/">customizemypic.com</a> to allow anyone to change their profile picture to a flag of their choice. The goal was to make a statement and express solidarity with people in Beirut, Baghdad and other areas hard hit by terrorism. Today, that same app is no longer able to do its core function because Facebook <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2018/04/24/new-facebook-platform-product-changes-policy-updates/">removed any way for users to give permissions to apps</a> to upload a photo on their behalf. This is what happens when you rely on third parties to announce what you can and cannot do with your own profile picture. The most extreme reliability is achieved by an <a href="http://offlinefirst.org/">offline-first</a> approach, which is a close cousin of the client-first trend that will grow in the 2020s.</p>
<p><strong>6. End to End Encryption.</strong> Server-side rendering perpetuates a culture where the server has all the data unencrypted. Even if the data is encrypted at rest, the served holds all the decryption keys and is one central target for hackers, government agencies, and advertisers. Rendering things client-side goes hand-in-hand with a culture of people storing their own keys on devices of their choice, and letting key management and password management be the domain of operating systems and trusted computing bases, not random websites.</p>
<h2 id="Data Delivery">Data Delivery</h2>
<p><strong>7. Bandwidth.</strong> Ever since <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm8FAHGJB3M">Steve Jobs presented WebObjects</a>, we have wanted sites to render dynamically. Well, that often involves looping through various items and rendering each one. It is extremely wasteful to send the HTML results of rendering hundreds of items to a client, when you could have just sent the data, which would then be “hydrated” into 5. templates by the client. However, I can understand pre-rendering just the items above the fold (if one could estimate this number, not knowing the size of the window on the first request).</p>
<p><strong>8. Caching Issues.</strong> Often, you have subtle and pervasive changes on every page when a person is logged in vs out. (I should remark that “logging in” into a site itself is an artifact of “centralized” thinking, but I digress.) Their avatar might be rendered in various places. New links are shown that might not be available otherwise. And new information may be shown that access control and discovery suggestions determines they can see. If you render everything on the served, there is no way to cache most of the fragments of the page, because they are changing. If you render client-side, all this comes for free.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps for Web Developers</h2>
<p>So by now you may be convinced that “client-first” is a good design pattern and progressive enhancement can be implemented later, by “speeding up” the first render, and by making it available to “dumb” crawlers and user agents who don’t execute Javascript in 2020. Here is how that would actually look, in actionable terms:</p>
<p><strong>9. Preloading. </strong>Okay, now that you are rendering everything client-side, you can implement a mechanism to preload data from the server. Perhaps put all the JSON in one file and send it over on the first render. Which — remember — happens only when you use a Web Browser to visit a page directly, a very specific scenario. Every other request besides that, including subsequent requests from a web browser, don’t need this preload. It’s an extra flair you can add for that specific use case. So the preloaded data comes and your Javascript will already have it and will render the HTML synchronously and quickly.</p>
<p><strong>10. Static Site Generation. </strong>The most popular static site generators today are still pretty narrow in their use-case. They help with blogs and publishing, eg <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, etc. But if you already have a dynamic site, you can sort of transform it into a static site by having a server-side script request some (dynamically specified) set of pages and render them to some related static html documents, and then begin sending 301 redirects on the dynamic pages to permanently tell browsers to go to the static pages in the future. (Because rewriting all links in your site may be infeasible). This approach runs into problems I described in point 5 — so a naive approach would only work for publicly accessible pages …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	<div><p>This is a deep-dive into some of the implementation details of <a href="https://taskcluster.net/">Taskcluster</a>.
Taskcluster is a platform for building continuous integration, continuous deployment, and software-release processes.
It’s an <a href="https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster">open source project</a> that began life at Mozilla, supporting the Firefox build, test, and release systems.</p>

<p>The Taskcluster “services” are a collection of microservices that handle distinct tasks: the queue coordinates tasks; the worker-manager creates and manages workers to execute tasks; the auth service authenticates API requests; and so on.</p>



<p>Until April 2020, Taskcluster stored its data in Azure Storage tables, a simple NoSQL-style service similar to AWS’s DynamoDB.
Briefly, each Azure table is a list of JSON objects with a single primary key composed of a partition key and a row key.
Lookups by primary key are fast and parallelize well, but scans of an entire table are extremely slow and subject to API rate limits.
Taskcluster was carefully designed within these constraints, but that meant that some useful operations, such as listing tasks by their task queue ID, were simply not supported.
Switching to a fully-relational datastore would enable such operations, while easing deployment of the system for organizations that do not use Azure.</p>

<h2 id="always-be-migratin">Always Be Migratin’</h2>

<p>In April, we migrated the existing deployments of Taskcluster (at that time all within Mozilla) to Postgres.
This was a “forklift migration”, in the sense that we moved the data directly into Postgres with minimal modification.
Each Azure Storage table was imported into a single Postgres table of the same name, with a fixed structure:</p>

<pre><code>create table queue_tasks_entities(
    partition_key text,
    row_key text,
    value jsonb not null,
    version integer not null,
    etag uuid default public.gen_random_uuid()
);
alter table queue_tasks_entities add primary key (partition_key, row_key);
</code></pre>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/helfi92/taskcluster/blob/6b3220305124388803da060811d8ea584f92aefe/infrastructure/tooling/src/importer/importer.js">importer</a> we used was specially tuned to accomplish this import in a reasonable amount of time (hours).
For each known deployment, we scheduled a downtime to perform this migration, after extensive performance testing on development copies.</p>

<p>We considered options to support a downtime-free migration.
For example, we could have built an adapter that would read from Postgres and Azure, but write to Postgres.
This adapter could support production use of the service while a background process copied data from Azure to Postgres.</p>

<p>This option would have been very complex, especially in supporting some of the atomicity and ordering guarantees that the Taskcluster API relies on.
Failures would likely lead to data corruption and a downtime much longer than the simpler, planned downtime.
So, we opted for the simpler, planned migration.
(we’ll revisit the idea of online migrations in part 3)</p>

<p>The database for <a href="https://firefox-ci-tc.services.mozilla.com/">Firefox CI</a> occupied about 350GB.
The other deployments, such as the <a href="https://community-tc.services.mozilla.com/">community deployment</a>, were much smaller.</p>

<h2 id="database-interface">Database Interface</h2>

<p>All access to Azure Storage tables had been via the <a href="https://github.com/taskcluster/azure-entities">azure-entities</a> library, with a limited and very regular interface (hence the <code>_entities</code> suffix on the Postgres table name).
We wrote an implementation of the same interface, but with a Postgres backend, in <a href="https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/tree/23e2fb746068f6e647946347eebffddd5e1b93fb/libraries/entities">taskcluster-lib-entities</a>.
The result was that none of the code in the Taskcluster microservices changed.
Not changing code is a great way to avoid introducing new bugs!
It also limited the complexity of this change: we only had to deeply understand the semantics of azure-entities, and not the details of how the queue service handles tasks.</p>

<h2 id="stored-functions">Stored Functions</h2>

<p>As the <a href="https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/tree/23e2fb746068f6e647946347eebffddd5e1b93fb/libraries/entities">taskcluster-lib-entities</a> README indicates, access to each table is via five stored database functions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>&lt;tableName&gt;_load</code> - load a single row</li>
  <li><code>&lt;tableName&gt;_create</code> - create a new row</li>
  <li><code>&lt;tableName&gt;_remove</code> - remove a row</li>
  <li><code>&lt;tableName&gt;_modify</code> - modify a row</li>
  <li><code>&lt;tableName&gt;_scan</code> - return some or all rows in the table</li>
</ul>

<p>Stored functions are functions defined in the database itself, that can be redefined within a transaction.
<a href="http://code.v.igoro.us/posts/2020/10/tc-db-part-2.html">Part 2</a> will get into why we made this choice.</p>

<h3 id="optimistic-concurrency">Optimistic Concurrency</h3>

<p>The <code>modify</code> function is an interesting case.
Azure Storage has no notion of a “transaction”, so the azure-entities library uses an optimistic-concurrency approach to implement atomic updates to rows.
This uses the <code>etag</code> column, which changes to a new value on every update, to detect and retry concurrent modifications.
While Postgres can do much better, we replicated this behavior in taskcluster-lib-entities, again to limit the changes made and avoid introducing new bugs.</p>

<p>A modification looks like this in Javascript:</p>
<pre><code>await task.modify(task =&gt; {
  if (task.status !== 'running') {
    task.status = 'running';
    task.started = now();
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>For those not familiar with JS notation, this is calling the <code>modify</code> method on a task, passing a modifier function which, given a task, modifies that task.
The <code>modify</code> method calls the modifier and tries to write the updated row to the database, conditioned on the etag still having the value it did when the task was loaded.
If the etag does not match, <code>modify</code> re-loads the row to get the new etag, and tries again until it succeeds.
The effect is that updates to the row occur one-at-a-time.</p>

<p>This approach is “optimistic” in the sense that it assumes no conflicts, and does extra work (retrying the modification) only in the unusual case that a conflict occurs.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>

<p>At this point, we had fork-lifted Azure tables into Postgres and no longer require an Azure account to run Taskcluster.
However, we hadn’t yet seen any of the benefits of a relational database:</p>
<ul>
  <li>data fields were still trapped in a JSON object (in fact, some kinds of data were hidden in base64-encoded blobs)</li>
  <li>each table still only had a single primary key, and queries by any other field would still be prohibitively slow</li>
  <li>joins between tables would also be prohibitively slow</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://code.v.igoro.us/posts/2020/10/tc-db-part-2.html">Part 2</a> of this series of articles will describe how we addressed these issues.
Then part 3 will get into the details of performing large-scale database migrations without downtime.</p>

    <!-- .sidebar -->

    <section>
      
      

      <p><span>Last week, an article from tech blog </span><a href="https://www.coywolf.news/seo/apple-search-engine/"><span>Coywolf</span></a><span> lit a fire under rumors that Apple could soon launch a search engine to compete with Google. The story went </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/ihfk5w/apple_showing_signs_it_may_soon_launch_a_search/"><span>viral on Reddit</span></a><span>, and it’s easy to see why. Fans (read: shareholders) have long speculated and </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/search?q=search%20engine&amp;restrict_sr=1"><span>hoped</span></a><span> that the company would create a search engine so that Apple, already </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/31/apple-surpasses-saudi-aramco-to-become-worlds-most-valuable-company.html"><span>the most valuable company in the world</span></a><span>, could grow to even more gargantuan proportions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The evidence author Jon Henshaw lays out seems convincing, too. Google pays billions to Apple to remain its default search engine on Safari and iOS devices, and UK regulators, who have a track record of cracking down on Google, are </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-google/uk-regulators-take-aim-at-apples-search-engine-deal-with-google-idUSKBN242748"><span>looking to break up the deal</span></a><span>. Should that happen, Apple would be perfectly positioned to launch its own engine and thrive without a Google partnership, especially since Apple has been bolstering its existing search tools like Siri Spotlight and web crawler Applebot.</span></p>
<p><span>It’s easy to get excited about Apple launching a service that could make stocks go crazy, but our advice is to cool your expectations. Our data shows that no, Apple is probably not about to launch a search engine. Let’s explain why.</span></p>


<p><span>Over the last three years, our data shows that job listings on Apple’s site for “Search” or “Search Engineer” positions have increased meaningfully from about 30 listings throughout 2017 to about 70 throughout 2020 so far, which helps explain the improvements to Applebot and Siri Spotlight. But that is still only 70 people who are theoretically working towards building a search engine, and job listings with these keywords took a notable dive over the last month down to 53.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>By comparison, Google revealed in its </span><a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/"><span>latest quarterly filing</span></a><span> that its employee count was 127,498 as of June, and that the largest headcount additions by product were for Google Cloud and Search. That’s not just an anomaly for this quarter, either. The same language was used in its Q1 2020 filing, as well as in its yearly filing for 2019. Between its Q1 and Q2 filings, Google claims to have hired 4,450 employees - we can reasonably assume that a large portion of those hires are dedicated to its search engine. If the rumors are true,&nbsp;</span><span>Apple’s 70 or so listings pale&nbsp;in comparison to the hundreds or possibly even thousands of new additions each month that Google devotes to simply maintaining and updating its search engine.</span></p>
<p><span>The Coywolf article points to the huge number of job listings that pop up on Apple’s site when you search for “</span><a href="https://jobs.apple.com/en-us/search?search=search%20engineer&amp;sort=relevance"><span>search engineers</span></a><span>” as evidence that Apple is ramping up production on a search engine. Why, then, does our data only show 53 listings?</span></p>


<p><span>The answer is that Apple’s jobs site is not only searching for posts with “search engineer” in the title or description, but also those with “search” and “engineer,” substantially inflating the results. Our data shows that Apple currently has around 2,300 open listings that contain the keyword “engineer.” Maybe Apple should hire some search engineers to refine searches for search engineer jobs.</span></p>
<p><span>As some Redditors&nbsp;pointed out, similar articles to Coywolf’s have popped up throughout Apple's history, like when </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/ihfk5w/apple_showing_signs_it_may_soon_launch_a_search/g2zyepe?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3"><span>Applebot was first announced</span></a><span>, and have routinely proven to be false or more indicative of other, smaller moves. Coywolf certainly lays out a compelling case, but a closer look at hiring data reveals that the fabled Apple search engine will remain just that for now.</span></p>
<h3>About the Data:</h3>
<p><span><span><span>Thinknum tracks companies using the information they post online, jobs, social and web traffic, product sales, and app ratings, and&nbsp;creates data sets that measure factors like hiring, revenue, and foot traffic. Data sets may not be fully comprehensive (they only account for what is available on the web), but they can be used to gauge performance factors like staffing and sales.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Small things matter.</p>
<ul>
<li>Know where things are. Naming is crucial.</li>
<li>A piece of code should be where you expect to find it. If not, refactor to get it there.</li>
<li>Don't litter your code with comments and commented-out code that "capture history or wished for the future".</li>
<li>Standardization is important.</li>
<li>Have the discipline to follow the practices. To frequently reflect upon your work — and be willing to change.</li>
</ul>
<p>"In code, refactor mercilessly". Reminds me of a simple writing tip: Imagine that you are paid for each word that you remove, while still keeping the meaning. That's how you write well.</p>
<p>Craftsmanship is the way to write good code. How do we learn it? Knowledge and work. Gain the knowledge (principles, patterns, practices, heuristics) and grind that knowledge into yourself by working hard and practicing.</p>
<p>You could know it all, but without the hard work, you wouldn't be able to put it to practice. Practice and fail. And then try again.</p>
<p>You could skip the case studies in this book, in which case you've read another 'feel good' book about writing good code. Then you've learned nothing. But you can pay close attention to even the smallest details and follow along closely, then you'll learn quite a lot.</p>

<p>If you keep making a mess, it'll slow you down in the long run.</p>
<p>We read more code than we write, so we should make it easier to read — even if that makes it harder to write. But since we can't write it without reading it, we're actually making it easier to write as well. But this is over the long term.</p>
<p>We don't just write clean code. We have to maintain it as well. So keep it clean.</p>

<ul>
<li>Names should reveal intentions. If it requires a comment to explain, it's not a good name</li>
<li>"Avoid Disinformation"</li>
<li>Be very careful with similar names — it can be very misleading (breaking the above rule!)</li>
<li>"Make Meaningful Distinctions" — different names for different things. <code>v1</code> and <code>v2</code> could be <code>source</code> and <code>destination</code> — much better names.</li>
<li>"Noise words are redundant". <code>variable</code> should never appear in a variable name, don't put <code>string</code> in the name of a string, don't make two variables like <code>thing</code> and <code>theThing</code>. Distinguishing names is important.</li>
<li>"Use Pronounceable Names"</li>
<li>"Use Searchable Names"</li>
<li>"Avoid Encodings" — never actually seen this before.</li>
<li>
<p>"Avoid Mental Mapping" — Just because you know what it means, doesn't mean that someone else will.</p>
<ul>
<li>Class names should be nouns or noun phrases, not verbs.</li>
<li>Method names should be verbs or verb phrases. Accessors, mutators, and predicates should be prefixed with <code>get</code>, <code>set</code>, or <code>is</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"Don't Be Cute" — Say what you mean. Jokes are only fun for you and those in on them.</li>
<li>"Pick One Word per Concept" — If you write <code>fetch</code> and not <code>retrieve</code>, stick with it.</li>
<li>"Don't Pun"</li>
<li>"Use Solution Domain Names" — You can use technical terms</li>
<li>"Use Problem Domain Names" — When there are no technical terms, use the name from the problem domain.</li>
<li>"Add Meaningful Context" — If you see an address form, you might see 'state' as a variable. But if you see 'state' alone somewhere, would you assume that it's related to an address? Here, meaningful context could be naming it <code>addrState</code>.</li>
<li>"Don't Add Gratuitous Context"</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Functions should be small.</li>
<li>They should do only one thing.</li>
<li>One Level of Abstraction per Function.</li>
<li>Code should be able to read from the top to bottom. This is <em>The Stepdown Rule</em>.</li>
<li>General rule for switch statements: "they can be tolerated if they appear only once, are used to create polymorphic objects, and are hidden behind an inheritance".</li>
<li>Use descriptive names.</li>
<li>The fewer arguments the better.</li>
<li>They should have no side effects.</li>
<li>They should either do something or answer something. Not both.</li>
<li>Exceptions &gt; Returning Error Codes</li>
<li>Extract Try/Catch blocks into functions of their own.</li>
<li>Error handling is one thing.</li>
<li>Don't Repeat Yourself. The more duplicates, the more has to be changed when necessary. And more room for errors.</li>
<li>You don't have to get all of this perfect in your first try. It is as writing. You can edit and refine.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Only for when we can't express ourselves well enough with code.</li>
<li>Comments don't make up for bad code.</li>
<li>Explain yourself in code — comments should not be necessary.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Good comments (if necessary)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Legal comments — copyright, authorship, etc.</li>
<li>Informative comments</li>
<li>Explanation of intent</li>
<li>Clarification</li>
<li>Warning of Consequences</li>
<li>Todos</li>
<li>Amplification (of importance)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bad comments</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mumbling — Commenting because you 'should'</li>
<li>Redundant comments — explaining code that explains itself</li>
<li>Misleading comments — not accurate</li>
<li>Mandated comments</li>
<li>Journal comments — use source control...</li>
<li>Noise comments — restate the obvious, provide no new information</li>
<li>Scary noise — copy pasting and forgetting to change contents</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Functions or variables &gt; comments</li>
<li>Don't have commented-out code</li>
<li>Don't have 'attribution comments'. Source control can do that.</li>
<li>No systemwide information in the context of a local comment</li>
<li>Don't put historical discussions or irrelevant descriptions of details into comments.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Agree upon rules for formatting and be consistent in following them.</li>
<li>Source files names should be simple but explanatory.</li>
<li>Source files shouldn't be too big.</li>
<li>Variables should be declared as close to their usage as possible.</li>
<li>Instance variables should be declared at the top of the class.</li>
<li>If a function calls another, they should be vertically close. The caller should be above the callee, if possible.</li>
<li>In general, a function that is called should be below a function that does the calling.</li>
<li>Short lines — you shouldn't have to scroll to the right.</li>
<li>Indentation is important.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>We want to be free to change the type of variables or implementation on a whim.</li>
<li>"Objects hide their data behind abstractions and expose functions that operate on that data"</li>
<li>"Data structure expose their data and have no meaningful functions"</li>
<li>The Law of Demeter: "a module should not know about the innards of the objects it manipulates"</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>"Error handling is important, but if it obscures logic, it's wrong".</li>
<li>Exceptions &gt; return codes</li>
<li>Write <code>Try-Catch-Finally</code> first</li>
<li>Don't return null. And don't pass it either.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Having bad tests is worse or equal to having no tests.</li>
<li>Readability makes tests clean. Clarity, simplicity, and density of expression. Say a lot with as few expressions as possible.</li>
<li>One assert per test.</li>
<li>A single concept per test.</li>
<li>
<p>Clean tests are <strong>F.I.R.S.T</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fast, independent, repeatable, self-validating, and timely.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Variables first. Then public functions. Private utilities thereafter.</li>
<li>Variables and utility functions should be kept private, but that's not a strict rule.</li>
<li>Classes should be small. It shouldn't have too many responsibilities.</li>
<li>The name of a class should describe it's responsibilities.</li>
<li>The Single Responsibility Principle = classes or modules should only have one responsibility — one reason to change.</li>
<li>Classes should have a small number of instance variables.</li>
<li>Each method should manipulate one or more of those variables. The more variables a method manipulates, the more cohesive it is to the class. We want this cohesion to be high.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Design is simple (according to Kent Beck) if it:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Runs all the tests"</li>
<li>"Contains no duplication"</li>
<li>"Expresses the intent of the programmer"</li>
<li>"Minimizes the number of classes and methods"</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Concurrency helps us decouple what gets done from when it gets done.</li>
<li>
<p>Common misconceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>It always improves performance.</li>
<li>Design doesn't change because of it.</li>
<li>Understanding it is not important when working with a container.</li>
<li>It incurs some overhead.</li>
<li>"Complex concurrency is complex, even for simple problems."</li>
<li>The bugs aren't usually repeatable.</li>
<li>It requires a fundamental change in design strategy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Limit access to data that may be shared.</li>
<li>Threads should be as independent as possible.</li>
<li>Know your library. Know what's available to you.</li>
<li>
<p>Know your execution models.</p>
<ul>
<li>Producer-Consumer</li>
<li>Readers-Writers.</li>
<li>Dining Philosophers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To understand those execution models, you might want to know about Bound Resources, Mutual Exclusion, Starvation, Deadlock, and Livelock.</li>
</ul>

October 28, 2020 | https://wickedchicken.github.io/post/macos-nix-setup/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wickedchicken.github.io/post/macos-nix-setup/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>I recently got a new Macbook, and began setting up the <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a> package manager to
install my developer toolset. I mainly did this to try and have a working setup without
installing <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>. Since I ran into a few issues, I wanted to briefly
document what I did and why in case others wanted to try the same.</p>
<h3 id="why-nix-and-why-not-homebrew-or-macports">Why Nix? (and why not Homebrew or MacPorts?)</h3>
<p>The short answer: hype.</p>
<p>The long answer: I’ve been frustrated with Homebrew’s user experience for years now, and
used this opportunity to start afresh. The default non-Homebrew answer is the venerable
<a href="https://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>, which has been around for quite a while. Most people who aren’t
functional programming or build system nerds should probably use MacPorts, as it has been
around long enough to have good support documentation floating around the internet.
Unfortunately I’m a sucker for hermetic builds <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, so I decided to try
Nix.</p>
<p>In addition, Nix has one cool feature I haven’t seen anywhere else: temporarily installing
packages using <code>nix-shell</code>. For example, I can install <code>ripgrep</code> inside a temporary shell,
and the package is automatically cleaned up when I’m done:</p>
<p>There’s a lot of cool stuff <code>nix-shell</code> can do, check out some more examples
<a href="https://ghedam.at/15978/an-introduction-to-nix-shell">here</a>.</p>
<h4 id="why-not-homebrew">Why not Homebrew?</h4>
<p>If Homebrew works for you, then by all means keep using Homebrew! However, I’ve grown
frustrated with it. Homebrew has spent a lot of effort making a software delivery system
work across many iterations of OSX/MacOS, and countless developers have installed <code>brew</code>
as one of the first things on a new Mac. It is with this acknowledgement of the work the
Homebrew developers have put into the software and its resulting success that I offer
these criticisms:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Unpredictable command times. I never know if running <code>brew install</code> or <code>brew upgrade</code>
is going to take 5 seconds or 20 minutes. This usually means knowing if a program or
dependency is being downloaded as a prebuilt binary or compiled on the spot. It would
be nice to signal to the user if compilation is about to happen, so they can plan the
install accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Very slow <code>brew update</code> times. Homebrew’s core package database is a
<a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core">git repository</a>, which is great for enabling collaboration. Nix uses
the <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs">same model</a>, but the difference lies in how the clients get the package
database: <code>brew update</code> does a <code>git pull</code> under the hood, while <code>nix-channel --update</code>
downloads a compressed tarball each time the channel is updated. This means Homebrew
updates can rely on git and GitHub itself as an efficient distribution mechanism,
getting delta updates “for free” without setting up extra infrastructure. However,
this design choice means that the client has to maintain its own git repo –
<a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/4755#issuecomment-416572560"><code>git gc</code> can strike at any time</a>, for example, and slow things down
tremendously. It is also a nightmare for <a href="https://discourse.brew.sh/t/best-practice-for-homebrew-on-travis-brew-update-is-5min-to-build-time/5215">CI</a>, where the lack of
an updated Homebrew git cache can negatively impact build times. Meanwhile,
<code>nix-channel --update</code> runs are very predictable, even if a bit inefficient – you’re
downloading a 16Mb tarball when the channel is updated, but that’s it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bad interactions when packages are upgraded. I’m not sure exactly why this happens, but
occasionally when certain packages are upgraded (such as <code>python</code> from 3.7 to 3.8),
<a href="https://discourse.brew.sh/t/homebrew-updating-major-python-version-breaks-a-lot-of-things-on-my-system/8545">related packages can break</a>. Because Nix builds are hermetic,
packages should all “work together” regardless of how the system was previously set
up.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="why-not-macports">Why not MacPorts?</h4>
<p>To be honest, MacPorts is probably just fine for your needs. I haven’t used it in forever,
but my understanding is that it’s reliable and has plenty of built-up community knowledge
on how to fix things. Take a look at it and see if it fits your needs! I also quickly
found <a href="https://saagarjha.com/blog/2019/04/26/thoughts-on-macos-package-managers/">this post</a> which details some differences between it and
Homebrew. But hey, if you like adventure, give Nix a shot!</p>
<h4 id="why-not-nix">Why not Nix?</h4>
<p>I felt it was honest to include a section like this.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I haven’t done a deep evaluation, but my impression is that Nix is the least documented
and least mature of the bunch. Expect to do a bit more digging to solve issues, but
once you get started it generally just works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Workarounds are currently needed for Catalina and above, especially if you have an
older Mac without a T2 chip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You’ll need to understand a bit of the <a href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nix_Expression_Language">Nix Expression Language</a>. It’s
not as scary as it sounds, but you will have to edit a <code>.nix</code> file to install a
package (there is no CLI equivalent to <code>brew install</code> that I am aware of).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="installing-nix">Installing Nix</h3>
<p>Installing Nix requires two phases: installing Nix itself, and then installing
<a href="https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin">nix-darwin</a>. The installation methods I know of involve <code>curl</code>ing with an
eventual <code>sudo</code> call inside the script<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. You will have to do something extra if
you’re running Catalina<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> or above.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Install Nix:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-Catalina: <code>curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh</code> (I haven’t tested this).</li>
<li>Catalina with a T2 chip: <code>sh &lt;(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --darwin-use-unencrypted-nix-store-volume</code>
(according to the site, “unecrypted” is a misnomer as the chip will encrypt it
anyway).</li>
<li>Catalina without a T2 chip: follow <a href="https://www.philipp.haussleiter.de/2020/04/fixing-nix-setup-on-macos-catalina/">these instructions</a>
<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure that <code>nix-build</code> is now in your <code>PATH</code>. You may have to source
<code>$HOME/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh</code> in your shell’s <code>rc</code> file to get this to
work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install <code>nix-darwin</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">nix-build https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin/archive/master.tar.gz -A installer ./result/bin/darwin-installer
</code></pre></div><p>You should now have <code>darwin-rebuild</code> in your <code>PATH</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="using-nix">Using Nix</h3>
<p>The basic workflow for using Nix is editing <code>~/.nixpkgs/darwin-configuration.nix</code> and then
running <code>darwin-rebuild switch</code> to activate those changes.</p>
<h4 id="editing-darwin-configurationnix">Editing <code>darwin-configuration.nix</code></h4>
<p>Open up <code>~/.nixpkgs/darwin-configuration.nix</code> with your favorite editor. Look at
<code>environment.systemPackages</code>: this is the list of packages you’ll want to install.
<a href="https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills/basics-of-language.html#idm140737320584496">Nix lists</a> are space-delimited (not comma-delimited). The packages listed
there come from the Nixpkgs channel you’re subscribed to. You can list what packages are
available by running <code>nix-env -qaP</code> or searching <a href="https://search.nixos.org/packages">Nixpkgs</a> online. All the
packages are prepended with <code>pkgs.</code>; I used Nix’s <code>with pkgs;</code> clause to prepend that by
default:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  environment<span>.</span>systemPackages <span>=</span> <span>with</span> pkgs; [
      gitAndTools<span>.</span>gitFull
      byobu
      wget
    ];
</code></pre></div><h4 id="activating-your-changes">Activating your changes</h4>
<p>Once you’re done editing, run <code>darwin-rebuild switch</code> to install your new packages! If you
made an error, <code>darwin-rebuild</code> will let you know and your current environment will not be
affected.</p>
<h4 id="updating-the-package-database">Updating the package database</h4>
<p>If you want to update the package database, you can run</p>
<h4 id="advanced-usage">Advanced usage</h4>
<p>Nix will detect conflicts and error out, such as when two packages install the same
binary. This can happen when <code>python37</code> and <code>python38</code>, for example, both want to create a
binary called <code>pydoc3</code>. To resolve this, you can call <code>lowPrio</code> to declare a package low
priority and have the other package win.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  environment<span>.</span>systemPackages <span>=</span> <span>with</span> pkgs; [
      python37
      (lowPrio python38)
    ];
</code></pre></div><p>(As a side note: once you’ve installed both, look at how quickly you can uninstall and
reinstall each package. It takes between 1 and 2 seconds to uninstall or reinstall
python3.7, which in my opinion is ridiculously fast.)</p>
<h3 id="further-reading">Further reading</h3>
<p>I have to admit that I only have a shallow knowledge of Nix, and the information above
has made it sufficient as a daily replacement for Homebrew. However, there is a rich
ecosystem around Nix that you may want to explore further. Here are a few links to learn
more:</p>

<p>I hope this guide was helpful! Thanks to the Nix team for making such a cool package
manager. As I’m relatively new to Nix, feel free to contact me if there’s something I got
wrong or could have explained more clearly. Good luck and have fun with Nix!</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/release-engineering/">Google SRE book</a>: a build that is “insensitive to
the libraries and other software installed on the build machine.” This greatly
increases reliability, because it means that whatever you have installed on your
computer is less likely to affect the build process and the resulting program. This is
similar to <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Dockerizing</a> an application, but less extreme and less
resource-intensive to run. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>This is just as risky as the classic <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29382739/why-using-curl-sudo-sh-is-not-advised"><code>curl | sudo sh</code></a>.
Unfortunately I can’t find another way to easily install Nix, so I guess you can
download <a href="https://nixos.org/nix/install">https://nixos.org/nix/install</a> and <a href="https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills/install-on-your-running-system.html#idm140737320801568">compare its signature</a> before
running it. <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Catalina gets a lot of shade for its read-only root filesystem and signed
binaries, but I think it’s a step forward for general purpose computing. What I object
to is that signed binaries must be signed with registered Apple developer accounts,
which cost money. It would be nice if that was a bit distributed, so anyone could sign
and Apple maintained a reputation database or something. I’m annoyed at Apple for
mixing good security and OS maintenance practices with total, walled-garden lockdown.
Admittedly, the web has a lot of the <a href="https://xkcd.com/1367/">same security benefits</a>, but we’re not at a
point yet where web apps can compete with native applications. Hopefully we’ll get
there one day. <a href="#fnref:3" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

<p><a name="node_idx_466"></a><a name="node_idx_468"></a><a name="node_idx_470"></a>McCarthy’s nondeterministic operator
<code><span>amb</span></code> [<a href="https://ds26gte.github.io/tyscheme/index-Z-H-24.html#node_bib_25">25</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://ds26gte.github.io/tyscheme/index-Z-H-24.html#node_bib_4">4</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://ds26gte.github.io/tyscheme/index-Z-H-24.html#node_bib_33">33</a>] is as old as
Lisp itself, although it is present in no Lisp.
<code><span>amb</span></code> takes zero or more expressions, and makes a
nondeterministic (or “ambiguous”) choice among them,
preferring those choices that cause the program to
converge meaningfully.  Here we will explore an
embedding of <code><span>amb</span></code> in Scheme that makes a depth-first
selection of the ambiguous choices, and uses Scheme’s
control operator <code><span>call/cc</span></code> to backtrack for alternate
choices.  The result is an elegant backtracking
strategy that can be used for searching problem spaces
directly in Scheme without recourse to an extended
language.  The embedding recalls the continuation
strategies used to implement Prolog-style logic
programming [<a href="https://ds26gte.github.io/tyscheme/index-Z-H-24.html#node_bib_16">16</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://ds26gte.github.io/tyscheme/index-Z-H-24.html#node_bib_7">7</a>], but is sparer because the
operator provided is much like a Scheme boolean
operator, does not require special contexts for its
use, and does not rely on linguistic infrastructure
such as logic variables and unification.</p>

<h2><a href="https://ds26gte.github.io/tyscheme/index-Z-H-1.html#node_toc_node_sec_14.1">14.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Description of <code><span>amb</span></code></a></h2>
<p>An accessible description of <code><span>amb</span></code> and many example
uses are found in the premier Scheme textbook
SICP [<a href="https://ds26gte.github.io/tyscheme/index-Z-H-24.html#node_bib_1">1</a>].  Informally,
<code><span>amb</span></code> takes zero or more expressions and <em>nondeterministically</em> returns the value of <em>one</em> of
them.  Thus,</p>

<pre>(<span>amb</span> <span>1</span> <span>2</span>)
</pre>



<p>may evaluate to 1 <em>or</em> 2.</p>
<p>
<code><span>amb</span></code> called with <em>no</em> expressions has no
value to return, and is considered to <em>fail</em>.
Thus,</p>

<pre>(<span>amb</span>)
<span><tt><strong><i>--&gt;ERROR!!!</i></strong></tt></span> <span>amb</span> <span>tree</span> <span>exhausted</span>
</pre>



<p>(We will examine the wording of the error message later.)</p>
<p>
In particular, <code><span>amb</span></code> is required to return a value if at
least one its subexpressions converges, ie, doesn’t fail.
Thus,</p>

<pre>(<span>amb</span> <span>1</span> (<span>amb</span>))
</pre>



<p>and</p>

<pre>(<span>amb</span> (<span>amb</span>) <span>1</span>)
</pre>



<p>both return 1.</p>
<p>
Clearly, <code><span>amb</span></code> cannot simply be equated to its first
subexpression, since it has to return a <em>non-failing</em>
value, if this is at all possible.  However, this is not
all: The bias for convergence is more stringent than a
merely local choice of <code><span>amb</span></code>’s subexpressions.  <code><span>amb</span></code>
should furthermore return <em>that</em> convergent value
that makes the <em>entire program</em> converge.  In
denotational parlance, <code><span>amb</span></code> is an <em>angelic</em>
operator.</p>
<p>
For example,</p>

<pre>(<span>amb</span> <span>#f</span> <span>#t</span>)
</pre>



<p>may return either <code><span>#f</span></code> or <code><span>#t</span></code>, but in the program</p>

<pre>(<span>if</span> (<span>amb</span> <span>#f</span> <span>#t</span>)
    <span>1</span>
    (<span>amb</span>))
</pre>



<p>the first <code><span>amb</span></code>-expression <em>must</em> return <code><span>#t</span></code>.
If it returned <code><span>#f</span></code>, the <code><span>if</span></code>’s “else” branch would be
chosen, which causes the entire program to fail.</p>

<h2><a href="https://ds26gte.github.io/tyscheme/index-Z-H-1.html#node_toc_node_sec_14.2">14.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementing <code><span>amb</span></code> in Scheme</a></h2>
<p>In our implementation of <code><span>amb</span></code>, we will favor
<code><span>amb</span></code>’s subexpressions from left to right.  Ie, the
first subexpression is chosen, and if it leads to overall
failure, the second is picked, and so on.  <code><span>amb</span></code>s occurring
later in the control flow of the program are searched for
alternates before backtracking to previous <code><span>amb</span></code>s.  In
other words, we perform a <em>depth-first</em> search of the
<code><span>amb</span></code> <em>choice tree</em>, and whenever we brush against
failure, we backtrack to the most recent node of the tree
that offers a further choice.  (This is called <em>chronological backtracking.</em>)</p>
<p>
We first define a mechanism for setting the base failure
continuation:</p>

<pre>(<span>define</span> <span>amb-fail</span> <span>'</span><span>*</span>)

(<span>define</span> <span>initialize-amb-fail</span>
  (<span>lambda</span> ()
    (<span>set!</span> <span>amb-fail</span>
      (<span>lambda</span> ()
        (<span>error</span> <span>"amb tree exhausted"</span>)))))

(<span>initialize-amb-fail</span>)
</pre>



<p>When <code><span>amb</span></code> fails, it invokes the continuation bound at
the time to <code><span>amb‑fail</span></code>.  This is the continuation invoked
when all the alternates in the <code><span>amb</span></code> choice tree have been
tried and were found to fail.</p>
<p>
We define <code><span>amb</span></code> as a macro that accepts an indefinite
number of subexpressions.</p>

<pre>(<span>define-macro</span> <span>amb</span>
  (<span>lambda</span> <span>alts...</span>
    <span>`</span>(<span>let</span> ((<span>+prev-amb-fail</span> <span>amb-fail</span>))
       (<span>call/cc</span>
        (<span>lambda</span> (<span>+sk</span>)

          <span>,@</span>(<span>map</span> (<span>lambda</span> (<span>alt</span>)
                   <span>`</span>(<span>call/cc</span>
                     (<span>lambda</span> (<span>+fk</span>)
                       (<span>set!</span> <span>amb-fail</span>
                         (<span>lambda</span> ()
                           (<span>set!</span> <span>amb-fail</span> <span>+prev-amb-fail</span>)
                           (<span>+fk</span> <span>'</span><span>fail</span>)))
                       (<span>+sk</span> <span>,</span><span>alt</span>))))
                 <span>alts...</span>)

          (<span>+prev-amb-fail</span>))))))
</pre>



<p>A call to <code><span>amb</span></code> first stores away, in
<code><span>+prev‑amb‑fail</span></code>, the <code><span>amb‑fail</span></code> value that was
current at the time of entry.  This is because the
<code><span>amb‑fail</span></code> variable will be set to different failure
continuations as the various alternates are tried.</p>
<p>
We then capture the <code><span>amb</span></code>’s <em>entry</em> continuation <code><span>+sk</span></code>, so
that when one of the alternates evaluates to a non-failing
value, it can immediately exit the <code><span>amb</span></code>.</p>
<p>
Each alternate <code><span>alt</span></code> is tried in sequence (the
implicit-<code><span>begin</span></code> sequence of Scheme).</p>
<p>
First, we capture the current continuation <code><span>+fk</span></code>, wrap it
in a procedure and set <code><span>amb‑fail</span></code> to that procedure.  The
alternate is then evaluated as <code>(<span>+sk</span> <span>alt</span>)</code>.  If <code><span>alt</span></code>
evaluates without failure, its return value is fed to the
continuation <code><span>+sk</span></code>, which immediately exits the <code><span>amb</span></code>
call.  If <code><span>alt</span></code> fails, it calls <code><span>amb‑fail</span></code>.  The first
duty of <code><span>amb‑fail</span></code> is to reset <code><span>amb‑fail</span></code> to the value
it had at the time of entry.  It then invokes the failure
continuation <code><span>+fk</span></code>, which causes the next alternate, if
any, to be tried.</p>
<p>
If all alternates fail, the <code><span>amb‑fail</span></code> at <code><span>amb</span></code> entry,
which we had stored in <code><span>+prev‑amb‑fail</span></code>, is
called.</p>

<h2><a href="https://ds26gte.github.io/tyscheme/index-Z-H-1.html#node_toc_node_sec_14.3">14.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Using <code><span>amb</span></code> in Scheme</a></h2>
<p>To choose a number between 1 and 10, one could say</p>

<pre>(<span>amb</span> <span>1</span> <span>2</span> <span>3</span> <span>4</span> <span>5</span> <span>6</span> <span>7</span> <span>8</span> <span>9</span> <span>10</span>)
</pre>



<p>To be sure, as a program, this will give 1, but
depending on the context, it could return any of the
mentioned numbers.</p>
<p>
The procedure <code><span>number‑between</span></code> is
a more abstract way to generate numbers from a given <code><span>lo</span></code>
to a given <code><span>hi</span></code> (inclusive):</p>

<pre>(<span>define</span> <span>number-between</span>
  (<span>lambda</span> (<span>lo</span> <span>hi</span>)
    (<span>let</span> <span>loop</span> ((<span>i</span> <span>lo</span>))
      (<span>if</span> (<span>&gt;</span> <span>i</span> <span>hi</span>) (<span>amb</span>)
          (<span>amb</span> <span>i</span> (<span>loop</span> (<span>+</span> <span>i</span> <span>1</span>)))))))
</pre>



<p>Thus <code>(<span>number‑between</span> <span>1</span> <span>6</span>)</code> will first
generate 1.  Should that fail, the <code><span>loop</span></code> iterates,
producing 2.  Should <em>that</em> fail, we get 3, and
so on, until 6.  After 6, <code><span>loop</span></code> is called with
the number 7, which being more than 6, invokes
<code>(<span>amb</span>)</code>, which causes final failure.   (Recall that
<code>(<span>amb</span>)</code> by itself guarantees
failure.)  At this point, the program containing the
call to
<code>(<span>number‑between</span> <span>1</span> <span>6</span>)</code> will backtrack to the
chronologically previous <code><span>amb</span></code>-call, and try to
satisfy <em>that</em> call in another fashion.</p>
<p>
The guaranteed failure of <code>(<span>amb</span>)</code> can be used to program
<em>assertions</em>.</p>

<pre>(<span>define</span> <span>assert</span>
  (<span>lambda</span> (<span>pred</span>)
    (<span>if</span> (<span>not</span> <span>pred</span>) (<span>amb</span>))))
</pre>



<p>The call <code>(<span>assert</span> <span>pred</span>)</code> insists that <code><span>pred</span></code> be
true.  Otherwise it will cause the current <code><span>amb</span></code> choice
point to fail.<a name="node_call_footnote_Temp_9"></a><sup><small><a href="#node_footnote_Temp_9">1</a></small></sup></p>
<p>
Here is a procedure using <code><span>assert</span></code> that generates a prime
less than or equal to its argument <code><span>hi</span></code>:</p>

<pre>(<span>define</span> <span>gen-prime</span>
  (<span>lambda</span> (<span>hi</span>)
    (<span>let</span> ((<span>i</span> (<span>number-between</span> <span>2</span> <span>hi</span>)))
      (<span>assert</span> (<span>prime?</span> <span>i</span>))
      <span>i</span>)))
</pre>



<p>This seems devilishly simple, except that when called as
a program with any number (say 20), it will produce the
uninteresting first solution, ie, 2.</p>
<p>
We would certainly like to get <em>all</em> the solutions,
not just the first.  In this case, we may want <em>all</em>
the primes below
20.  One way is to explicitly call the failure
continuation left after the program has produced its first
solution.  Thus,</p>

<pre>(<span>amb</span>)
<span>=&gt;</span> <span>3</span>
</pre>



<p>This leaves yet another failure continuation, which can
be called again for yet another solution:</p>

<pre>(<span>amb</span>)
<span>=&gt;</span> <span>5</span>
</pre>



<p>The problem with this method is that the program is
initially called at the Scheme prompt, and successive
solutions are also obtained by calling <code><span>amb</span></code> at the Scheme
prompt.  In effect, we are using different programs (we
cannot predict how many!), carrying over information from a
previous program to the next.  Instead, we would like to be
able to get these solutions as the return value of a
form that we can call in any context.  To this end, we
define the
<code><span>bag‑of</span></code> macro, which returns all
the successful instantiations of its argument.  (If the argument
never succeeds, <code><span>bag‑of</span></code> returns the empty list.)
Thus, we could say,</p>

<pre>(<span>bag-of</span>
  (<span>gen-prime</span> <span>20</span>))
</pre>



<p>and it would return</p>

<pre>(<span>2</span> <span>3</span> <span>5</span> <span>7</span> <span>11</span> <span>13</span> <span>17</span> <span>19</span>)
</pre>



<p>The <code><span>bag‑of</span></code> macro is defined as follows:</p>

<pre>(<span>define-macro</span> <span>bag-of</span>
  (<span>lambda</span> (<span>e</span>)
    <span>`</span>(<span>let</span> ((<span>+prev-amb-fail</span> <span>amb-fail</span>)
           (<span>+results</span> <span>'</span>()))
       (<span>if</span> (<span>call/cc</span>
            (<span>lambda</span> (<span>+k</span>)
              (<span>set!</span> <span>amb-fail</span> (<span>lambda</span> () (<span>+k</span> <span>#f</span>)))
              (<span>let</span> ((<span>+v</span> <span>,</span><span>e</span>))
                (<span>set!</span> <span>+results</span> (<span>cons</span> <span>+v</span> <span>+results</span>))
                (<span>+k</span> <span>#t</span>))))
           (<span>amb-fail</span>))
       (<span>set!</span> <span>amb-fail</span> <span>+prev-amb-fail</span>)
       (<span>reverse!</span> <span>+results</span>))))
</pre>



<p><code><span>bag‑of</span></code> first saves away its entry <code><span>amb‑fail</span></code>.  It
redefines <code><span>amb‑fail</span></code> to a local continuation <code><span>+k</span></code> created within an
<code><span>if</span></code>-test.  Inside the test, the <code><span>bag‑of</span></code> argument <code><span>e</span></code>
is evaluated.
If <code><span>e</span></code> succeeds, its result is collected
into a list called <code><span>+results</span></code>, and the local continuation
is called with the value <code><span>#t</span></code>.  This causes the
<code><span>if</span></code>-test to succeed, causing <code><span>e</span></code> to be <em>retried</em> at its
next backtrack point.  More results for <code><span>e</span></code> are obtained this
way, and they are all collected into <code><span>+results</span></code>.</p>
<p>
Finally, when <code><span>e</span></code> fails, it will call the base
<code><span>amb‑fail</span></code>, which is simply a call to the local
continuation with the value <code><span>#f</span></code>.  This pushes control
past the <code><span>if</span></code>.   We restore <code><span>amb‑fail</span></code> to
its  pre-entry value, and return the <code><span>+results</span></code>.  (The
<code><span>reverse!</span></code> is simply to produce the results in the order
in which they were generated.)</p>

<p>The power of depth-first search coupled
with backtracking becomes obvious when applied to solving
logic puzzles.  These problems are extraordinarily difficult
to solve procedurally, but can be solved concisely and
declaratively with <code><span>amb</span></code>, without taking anything away
from the charm of solving the puzzle.</p>

<p>Chess, for practical purposes, is solved. Using online platforms players can compare their moves against optimal moves generated by chess engines/AI’s. Centipawn Loss (CPL) is a measure of how suboptimal one’s move is. A centipawn is equal to <code>1/100th</code> of a pawn, meaning a CPL of <code>100</code> indicates the player made a move that lost the equivalent to <code>1</code> pawn. A CPL of <code>100</code> does not necessarily mean you lost a pawn unnecessarily; CPL also takes into account positions and potential mates. <a href="https://lichess.org/faq#acpl">Average Centipawn Loss</a> (ACPL) is the average CPL across a given game. ACPL is a positive number between 0 and infinity. An ACPL near 20 is excellent indicting near perfect play, whereas an ACPL above 300 either means you’re a 3 year old toddler or purposefully losing the game. Being able to calculate ACPL raises the question, is ACPL correlated to one’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">rating</a>?</p>

<details><summary>In-depth CPL explanation</summary>

<div>

    <p>Let’s examine the following board</p>

    <p><img src="https://kwojcicki.github.io/img/posts/even_game.PNG" alt="Even chess game"></p>

    <p>Both sides have similar pieces and similar positions. <a href="https://stockfishchess.org/">Stockfish</a> gives this board a score of <code>-0.69</code> (i.e. black is up <code>69/100th</code> of a pawn or <code>69</code> Centipawn’s).</p>

    <p>The optimal move is to move your bishop to <code>b4</code>.</p>

    <p><img src="https://kwojcicki.github.io/img/posts/optimal_move.PNG" alt="Average Centipawn Loss vs Rating"></p>

    <p>That board is evaluated at <code>-0.71</code>.</p>

    <p>If instead we played the bishop to <code>c3</code>, Stockfish will reevaluate the board to <code>-0.89</code>.</p>

    <p><img src="https://kwojcicki.github.io/img/posts/bad_move.PNG" alt="Average Centipawn Loss vs Rating"></p>

    <p>Since the optimal move resulted in a board evaluation of <code>-0.71</code> and our move achieved an evaluation of <code>-0.89</code>, our move receives a CPL of <code>-71 - -89 = 18</code>.</p>

  </div>
</details>

<figure>
  <img src="https://kwojcicki.github.io/img/posts/acpl_vs_rating.PNG" alt="Average Centipawn Loss vs Rating">
  <figcaption><b>Fig 1</b>: Rating vs ACPL per game <sup id="a1"><a href="#f1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="a15"><a href="#f15">[1.5]</a></sup></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The graph shows a negative correlation between rating and ACPL (ACPL decreases as rating increases) which follows common sense; as a player gets better they tend to perform moves that are closer to the optimal.</p>

<p>ACPL, as most performance indicators, require context. A player can achieve an ACPL of 20 in a variety of ways. They can immediately blunder their queen and attempt to stretch out the inevitable<sup id="a2"><a href="#f2">2</a></sup> or they can play an excellent game.</p>

<p>Instead of looking at rating vs ACPL, we’ll look at rating vs move types. Online chess platforms tend to classify moves into several broad categories: best move, good move, inaccuracy (CPL between <code>50-100</code>), mistake (CPL between <code>100-300</code>) and blunder (CPL <code>&gt;200</code>).</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://kwojcicki.github.io/img/posts/errors_vs_rating.PNG" alt="Errors vs Rating">
  <figcaption><b>Fig 2</b>: Rating vs Errors per game <sup id="a1"><a href="#f1">[1]</a></sup></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As one would expect, the number of blunders (game losing moves) drastically decreases with rating. It is unclear if the actual CPL per blunder decreases or increases with rating.</p>

<p>What is interesting is how mistakes stay relativity even, this may be due to the examined games being from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_chess#:~:text=and%20regular%20ratings.-,Blitz,minutes%20or%20less%20per%20player.&amp;text=The%20USCF%20defines%20blitz%20chess,and%2010%20minutes%20per%20player.">blitz variant</a> of chess. Since the players have a limited time to think they are likely making moves that are good in the short term (<code>3-5</code> moves ahead), but may be suboptimal in <code>10+</code> moves. Realistically, it will be difficult for humans to ever eliminate all mistakes and inaccuracies from their play, but concentrating on reducing one’s blunders even by <code>25%</code> yields incredible gains in ones rating.</p>



<p>In both graphs, it is evident that the correlation factor between errors/ACPL and rating is low. Both are metrics that can be used to estimate the players’ rating in a range, but are unideal to accurately judge a player’s performance. Nonetheless, it is difficult to dispute the notion that better players have better ACPL.</p>



<p><b id="f1">[1]</b> A sample of <code>~2500</code> games was taken using <a href="https://lichess.org/api">Lichess’s API</a>, resulting in <code>~5000</code> ACPL samples being used. Players were pooled in buckets based on their ELO (i.e. the ACPL was averaged for players across <code>700-719</code>, <code>720-739</code> etc). <a href="#a1">↩</a></p>

<p><b id="f15">[1.5]</b> There is a peculiar uptick in ACPL at the very upper ranks likely due to low sampling of <code>2900+</code> rated games. <a href="#a15">↩</a></p>

<p><b id="f2">[2]</b> One can imagine a scenario where the player immediately blunders their queen, causing their initial ACPL to be very high. As the game progresses, since the game is in such a dire position, all the player’s available moves will be roughly of the same quality, meaning any move the player makes will have a CPL close to 0. Eventually, as the number of moves grows larger the initial spike in CPL will be averaged off. <a href="#a2">↩</a></p>

                    <p>Posting on Hacker News is like a box of chocolates – you never know what you’re gonna get. I’ve been submitting since 2017 and never had more than one point. So I stopped trying.</p><p>A month ago, I got access to OpenAI API. After ten minutes of tinkering, I’ve got an idea: what if I could make it write good Hacker News titles for my blog posts? I quickly looked up the most favorited posts, designed the prompt in plain English, and generated my first title. It looked weird. I even doubted for a few minutes if it’s worth sharing. But I was curious – so I closed my eyes and hit submit.</p><p>The post went to the moon with <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24547098">229 points and 126 comments</a> in one day. Fascinated, I continued generating titles (and what would you do?). In three weeks, I got to the front page five times, received 1054 upvotes, and had 37k people come to my site.</p><p>Below is everything I’ve learned building a Hacker News post titles generator with OpenAI API, designing GPT-3 prompts, and figuring out how to apply GPT-3 to problems ranging from sales emails to SEO-optimized blog posts. At the end of the post, I cover the broader implications of GPT-3 that became obvious only after a month of working with the tool. If you’re an entrepreneur or an investor who wants to understand the change this tech will drive, you can read my speculations there.</p><p>If you have no idea what I’m talking about, read more about GPT-3 in <a href="https://www.gwern.net/newsletter/2020/05">Gwern’s post</a> first, or check <a href="https://beta.openai.com/">OpenAI’s website</a> with demo videos. In my work, I assume you’re already familiar with the API on some basic level.</p><p><em>Oct 28 update: After I published the draft, 23 people asked how to apply GPT-3 to their problems.

Designing a prompt</h3><p>The best way to program the API is to write a direct and straightforward task description, as you would do if you were delegating this problem to a human assistant. </p><p>Here’s how my first prompt looked like:</p><blockquote>Generate viral titles for Hacker News (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">https://news.ycombinator.com/</a>) posts. The titles have to be provocative and incentivize users to click on them.</blockquote><p>Data-wise, I needed to clean up the list slightly, get rid of irrelevant stuff like IDs, and choose up to five titles to use as a sample – OpenAI team suggests that selecting three to five titles works best for text generation. If you feed the API more examples, it picks up wrong intents and generates irrelevant completions.</p><p>In a few minutes of Google Sheets work, the cleanup was done, and I had a data set of the most favorited HN post titles of all time.

Tinkering with completions</h3><p>The first completion was unpromising. The list of titles had too many Ask HNs, and GPT-3 picked up questions as a pattern:</p><figure><img src="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.40.59-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.40.59-AM.png 600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.40.59-AM.png 1000w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.40.59-AM.png 1600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.40.59-AM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>My first attempt to generate HN titles.</figcaption></figure><p>To fix that, I cut out half Ask HNs from the dataset and began tinkering.</p><p>If there was one thing I could tell someone about GPT-3, it’d be that getting a perfect completion from the first try is a dream. The best stuff comes after dozens of experiments, sometimes after generating completions with the same parameters many times with the Best Of parameter and writing another GPT-3 classifier to discover a good one. Moreover, you need to test the prompt’s quality, data samples, and temperature (“creativity” of responses) individually to understand what you need to improve. </p><p><em>If you’re looking for prompt design tips, head on to chapter 2 of the post.</em></p><p>Here’s a list of experiments I’ve done:</p><ul><li>Edited the prompt many times, including and excluding adjectives from the task description. I tried “catchy,” “provocative,” “thought-provoking,” and many others. The best configuration I’ve got was “Write a short, thought-provoking, and eye-catching post title for a Hacker News (https://news.ycombinator.com/) submission.”</li><li>Split the prompt into two sentences, separating the task and its description. Discovered that one-sentence long prompts work best for simple tasks.</li><li>Played with data samples. I added and removed Ask HNs, randomly sampled from the list of most favorited posts, and tried picking more subjectively thoughtful titles.</li><li>Changed the temperature. The best results came at .9, while anything less than .7 was repetitive and very similar to the samples. Titles generated with temperature 1 were too random and didn’t look like good HN titles at all.</li></ul><p>To judge the quality of completions, I’ve come up with a question: “If I saw this on HN, would I click on it?” This helped me move quickly through experiments because I knew what bad results looked like.</p><p>After half an hour of tinkering, I’ve got the following completion: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.54.17-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.54.17-AM.png 600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.54.17-AM.png 1000w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.54.17-AM.png 1600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.54.17-AM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>My first good GPT-3 completions for HN titles.</figcaption></figure><p>That’s when I realized that I’m onto something. From the list of generated titles above, I’d click on at least three links just out of curiosity. Especially on “A developer’s guide to getting in shape.”</p><p>What’s even more interesting, the completion above was a result of fine-tuning the API. Title8, What You Love Is Not Your Life’s Work, was originally a part of another completion that was lame. So I cut out the bad stuff, added Title8 to my data sample, and continued generating from there.</p><p>The next step was to see if I could make GPT-3 create a custom title for my blog post.</p><h2 id="generating-custom-titles">Generating custom titles</h2><h3 id="1-changing-the-method">1. Changing the method</h3><p>To make GPT-3 generate custom titles, I needed to change my approach. I was no longer exploring new, potentially interesting headlines but figuring out how to make a good one for a post that was already written. To do that, I couldn’t just tell the API, “hey, generate me a good one.” I needed to show what a good one actually is and give GPT-3 some idea of what the post is about.</p><p>The first thing I changed is the prompt. This was relatively easy because I applied the same model of thinking again – “What would I tell a human assistant if I had to delegate this problem?”</p><p>Here’s a prompt that I used:</p><blockquote>Write a short, thought-provoking, and eye-catching post title for Hacker News (https://news.ycombinator.com/) submission based on a blog post’s provided description.</blockquote><p>One unexpected benefit from tinkering with the prompt is the clarity of thought. When you’re dealing with GPT-3, there’s no way to make it work if you don’t know what you’re doing. You need to express your thought in clear terms. It’s a brilliant natural constraint and one of the most underrated benefits of GPT-3: when you must state clearly what you want to do, you begin to better understand the problem.</p><h3 id="2-updating-the-data">2. Updating the data</h3><p>After I designed a new prompt, I had to update my data set. I went back to my previous experiment, selected five titles from the list of most favorited posts of all time, and wrote a clear and concise description for each of them. Lastly, I wrote a description of my own work that I wanted to generate the title for. I left the title field blank and hit “Generate.”</p><figure><img src="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-10.35.59-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-10.35.59-AM.png 600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-10.35.59-AM.png 1000w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-10.35.59-AM.png 1600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-10.35.59-AM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Updated data set for generating custom HN titles.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="3-experimenting-with-titles">3. Experimenting with titles</h3><p>This time, the completions were shockingly good.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>
On Monday I launched my newsletter on Substack, <a href="https://mvpsprint.substack.com/">The MVP Sprint</a>. I'm chronicling my journey to validate an idea and build an MVP - adapting the popular <a href="https://www.gv.com/sprint/">Design Sprint</a> methodology to the startup launch process.
</p>

<p>
Going into it, I didn't know what to expect. I've never built in public like this before. I've shared articles in the past that were met with nothing but crickets. But this one was different.
</p>

<p>
<b>I've gained 108 subscribers in the first 48 hours since launch</b>.
</p>

<p>
I'm going to share the blueprint I followed and the metrics it produced to help out future newsletter newbs like myself.
</p>

<h3>Where did I share it?</h3>
<p>Everywhere I could think of! Here's some details on individual channels:</p>

<h4>Indie Hackers</h4>
<p>
I shared <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/after-4-brain-surgeries-i-left-my-6-figure-tech-job-now-i-m-launching-a-startup-in-public-87e569e566">this post</a> in the "Building in Public" group. This seemed like the most relevant place to share it, but with 359 members, I wasn't sure if it would get many eyeballs.
</p>

<p>
As of right now, it has 34 upvotes, 26 comments, and 811 views. Not bad! It started off quite slow, seemed to pick up steam after the IH email newsletter went out, and then picked up a lot more after  <a href="https://twitter.com/IndieHackers/status/1320899528862633985">this shoutout from the @IndieHackers Twitter account</a>.
</p>

<h4>Twitter</h4>
<p>
I shared <a href="https://twitter.com/AnotherTimJones/status/1320801476491595780?s=20">a tweet storm from my personal twitter account</a> to my modest group of &lt;300 followers (at the time). A few of my friends gave me Twitter shoutouts and retweeted me.
</p>

<h4>Linkedin</h4>
<p>
I shared a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tjones4413/">my personal Linkedin</a>. It currently has 72 reactions, 20 comments, and 3,318 views within the news feed.
</p>

<p>
I also tried out the new Linkedin stories, but had &lt;15 views in the first 24 hours. I probably won't do this again. 
</p>

<h4>Reddit</h4>
<p>
I posted in the following subreddits:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/jie5an/how_do_you_come_up_with_ideas_for_tech_startups/">r/startups</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/jie8l1/a_startup_idea_is_just_a_recipe/">r/startup_ideas</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/jielur/after_4_brain_surgeries_i_left_my_6figure_tech/">r/EntrepreneurRideAlong</a> - This one did particularly well with &gt;180 upvotes and 54 comments.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I did my best to give as much value as possible within the posts themselves - only with a modest link at the end to the newsletter. And I tweaked the content for each subreddit to make it more relevant.
</p>

<p>
Outside of a few haters, folks on Reddit were super supportive. I received lots of friendly DM's and emails from people saying they loved the story and even wanted to help out.
</p>

<h4>Instagram</h4>
<p>
I threw together some images on Figma and shared a 2-part story on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/anothertimjones/">my personal Instagram</a> where I have 585 followers. Outside of a few supportive messages from friends, I can't really pull out the IG contribution to subscriber count.
</p>

	<div>

		</p>
	</div>
</div>

<p><i>These are the same assets I used for my Linkedin story.</i></p>

<h4>Medium</h4>
<p>
I tried <a href="https://themvpsprint.medium.com/cooking-up-a-recipe-in-the-startup-kitchen-3597cdcd5f4b">syndicating my first article to Medium</a>. So far it has 12 views and 3 "reads". Not sure if I'll continue this or not. Long-term I'll want to harness the SEO benefits on my own domain and syndicated content without a canonical tag won't do me any favors there.
</p>

<h4>Substack Stats</h4>
<h5>Engagement on <a href="https://mvpsprint.substack.com/p/choose-a-problem">the first article </a>:</h5>
<p><img alt="Article 1 stats" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/do0vbqz18/image/upload/v1603899472/MVP%20Sprint/article%201%20stats.png">
</p>

<p>
The view count feels accurate, but I'm not reading much into the "40 free signups after reading this". Maybe this means lots of people subscribed without reading?
</p>

<h5>Here's the breakdown of visits and and signups by channel:</h5>
<p><img alt="Article 1 stats" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/do0vbqz18/image/upload/v1603899619/MVP%20Sprint/substack%20stats.png">
</p>

<p>
<b>A few thoughts:</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm guessing that "direct" visitors was actually less than 343. I suspect that some of these are from Instagram (where I didn't include a direct link) and some from users where the referral header wasn't set.</li>
<li>The signup column doesn't add up to even half of my total subscribers, so I'm not reading much into that.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Future Channels</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Twitter</b> - I'm new to using Twitter in a professional sense, but it's no secret that this <i>could</i> and <i>should</i> be a great channel for me moving forward. I just have to invest in it and find my voice.
</li><li><b>Reddit</b> - Reddit feels like it could be a great tool, but I'll have to experiment with how to consistently engage in a way that drives value and doesn't feel spammy. 
</li><li><b>Linkedin</b> - I have a pretty deep Linkedin network so I'll keep tapping into that.
</li><li><b>Product Hunt</b> - After I have maybe 5-10 articles, I'm planning on spinning up my own landing page and newsletter "stack". At that point, I'll probably throw it up on Product Hunt.
</li></ol>

<h3>Some closing thoughts</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>People want to support you</b> (if you give them the chance) - I sometimes feel awkward asking for help. Maybe some of you are the same. But I realized from this experience that not only can be people be extremely helpful, but they <b>thoroughly enjoy helping</b>, maybe even a bit of  living vicariously through the startup journey.
</li><li><b>Reply to everyone</b> -  I did my best to reply to almost everyone that commented on a post. Not only does this cultivate a deeper connection with readers, but I think it helps to boost the engagement flywheel.
</li></ul>

<p>
That's it! Any advice for me moving forward? <a href="https://twitter.com/anothertimjones">Shoot me a DM on Twitter!</a>

This site started out as a page about PDP-10 emulation, which will continue to be its main focus.</p>
		<p><b>Note:</b> While the primary focus of this website is <i>emulation</i> of DEC Hardware, I also include any and all hardware documentation that I'm aware of.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Choosing a business partner could be the second most important relationship you ever choose, (the first being who you marry).&nbsp;<br></p><p>To be honest, if you don’t handle it right, ending a business partnership can be more challenging and more expensive than a divorce.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Having done both, trust me I know.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Now 5 years later -- after our “divorce” -- I want to share a little of my story and many of the things I wish I had known to discuss from the beginning.<br></p><p>The truth was I didn’t know what I didn’t know. Now I realize that if we had some hard conversations earlier, we may have had a smoother time ending the partnership.<br></p><p><strong>In this post I’ll share:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>how things went for me; the ‘A’ years</strong></li><li><strong>how to decide if you need a partner</strong></li><li><strong>qualities you should look for <em>(and what to avoid)</em></strong></li><li><strong>how do you split equity</strong></li><li><strong>the operating agreement; some key things you’ll want in there</strong></li><li><strong>buy/sell agreement</strong></li><li><strong>business partner checklist (a to-do list for following everything in this post)</strong></li><li><strong>other tips from my trauma <em>(lol… but really</em></strong><em>)</em><strong><em>‍</em></strong></li></ul><h3><strong>my story</strong><a href="https://littlemight.com/#"><br></a></h3><p>I started <a href="https://lttlmg.ht/bestself" target="_blank">BestSelf</a>, with my business partner (who I will refer to as 'A') in mid-2015, around 18-months after we initially met. </p><p>In that time we'd hung out in person around 4-5 times. To continue the analogy of business partnership being like marriage, I'd married someone that I'd only been on a few dates with and barely knew. I partnered out of insecurity with someone who talked a good game and seemed strong in the areas I felt weak.This insecurity cost me $$$</p><figure id="w-node-76af6d16a676-3448d0da"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ea0c87d3db0d2d23479ff47/5f8750eb6f143d07b654067a_partnership-2.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>We met through an entrepreneurship course online and became accountability partners soon after. With him being in New Jersey and me in NYC, we were close enough to be able to meet in person once every few months.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Through being accountability partners we became aware of each other's strengths and complementary skill sets, him with marketing and me with product design and branding.<br></p><p>As background, before <a href="https://lttlmg.ht/bestself">BestSelf</a> was born I had another Shopify store selling graphic design products that was paying all my bills and generating a good living. I considered that business my ‘Freedom vehicle’ as it allowed me to quit my Architecture job but I wasn’t passionate about doing it long-term.<br></p><p>I <em>was</em> deeply passionate about personal development during this time and was always reading and finding ways to upgrade my skills and productivity. I felt like I’d found the cheat code to life and wished I’d been introduced to it sooner. Before I quit my architecture job, I set myself a task to <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/the-22-books-that-helped-me-quit-my-job" target="_blank">read 22 books around specific topics so I would be ready for the world of entrepreneurship.</a><br></p><p>The <a href="https://lttlmg.ht/journal" target="_blank">Self Journal</a> was later born from my personal struggle for years of finding a planner that would both keep me organized and also help me reach my most important goals.<br></p><p>I decided I wanted to turn the journal I built for myself into a product to sell, because it seemed whenever I showed it to someone they wanted to buy it.&nbsp; I didn’t think this product would be the start of something bigger, I just wanted to bring this product to life.</p><p>It was then I thought having someone who knew sales and marketing would be beneficial so I asked ‘A’ to partner with me on it. He also had his own journaling structure&nbsp; so I felt it was a common interest.<br></p><p><strong>In retrospect, I partnered out of my insecurities around marketing and selling myself. </strong></p><h6>Most entrepreneurs don't have business problems, they have emotional problems disguised as business problems —<strong> and so I disguised my fear of putting myself out there with a business partner.&nbsp;</strong><br></h6><p>And so it began.<br></p><p>The original name we came up with for the company was “Self Improvement Labs”... but I <em>hated</em> it. One weekend when ‘A’ was gone I knew I had to come up with something better to replace it with<em>.</em></p><p><em>(because I don’t like when people criticize something without giving a reasonable alternative).</em><br></p><p>In those 2 days I came up with the idea for <a href="https://lttlmg.ht/bestself">BestSelf</a>, bought the domain BestSelf.co and created a whole branding package. Thankfully there was no pushback, ‘A’ agreed it was a better name and we moved forward.<br></p><p>We launched the Kickstarter campaign in August 2015. I had experience with launching Kickstarter campaigns in the past and so I had a formula for how to do it which helped us a lot. You can read how we did it <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/kickstarter-step-by-step" target="_blank">here</a>.<br></p><p><strong>We funded in 28 hours and over the course of 34 days we raised over $322,000 which was enough to both create the product for backers and launch the entire business.</strong></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ea0c87d3db0d2d23479ff47/5ea0cb1d0f854b10467cf739_5e2a2251be4a7438101d60a6_image.png" alt="funding progress graph"></p></figure><p>We launched our online store in January 2016 and the business continued to grow. We won the <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/shopify-2016-build-a-business-experience" target="_blank">2016 Shopify Build a Business award</a> in August of 2016 and then in 2017 we scaled 4X and won the Build a BIGGER Business Award.</p><figure id="w-node-ac6b3b3d99ee-3448d0da"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ea0c87d3db0d2d23479ff47/5f857aa10221b7fa4725f1a6_image5.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><figure id="w-node-9ccd9ba5eca2-3448d0da"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ea0c87d3db0d2d23479ff47/5f857aae7da8462c3bf9000a_image1.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>When things are going so well business-wise it’s easy for things to run smoothly, it’s like the early dating phase when you don’t have to deal with too much harsh reality yet. Then the pandemic starts and you find out what your relationship is really made of.<br></p><p>By late 2016, while professionally things were still good with the business, cracks began appearing in our personal relationship… the 2016 election was a definite factor here. That was the first time it became clear how differently we saw the world and how opposite our backgrounds were.<br></p><p>In 2017, we’d hired out the majority of his role in marketing and by April 2018 he had stepped away from all business operations - informally anyway.&nbsp;<br></p><p>By informally I mean there was never a discussion of him passing the baton and stepping out, he just suddenly was no longer there. But he was still taking as much money out of the company as I was -- or more.<br></p><p><strong>As you can imagine being a 50/50 partner where one partner is working full-time and the other is completely disconnected is tough — really tough. I was essentially hamstrung on big decisions and company direction. </strong></p><p>And anything I could decide could be overwritten or debated even after I thought it was settled. The same went for team members, as every now and again he'd jump on calls, start giving advice or instruction (without knowing what was even happening) and cause frustration and confusion with team members. </p><p>By early 2019, I was becoming resentful as our distributions were still 50/50 <strong>but I wasn’t getting any salary for the 60+ hour weeks of time I was putting in. </strong>When I brought it up to him, as if he were my boss, he would say <em>“I don’t equate time with value,”</em> yet he wasn’t giving either to the company.<br></p><p>At the same time as he would reject my salary request, he’d post stuff like this on his Instagram:</p><figure id="w-node-be8cd5eaae18-3448d0da"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ea0c87d3db0d2d23479ff47/5f873b98bd121731d6cf0d21_3-hour-week.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h6>Here's a tip, if someone’s telling you running a business is easy — they’re either lying, or trying to <strong>sell</strong> you something.<br></h6><p>In the case of ‘A’, it was both.<br></p><p>Each video “guru” post he’d share taking credit for work that wasn’t his &nbsp;felt like a slap in the face — not just to me but,&nbsp; more importantly, to the team. <strong>Being under-paid (or not paid at all) is one thing, but having my value be dismissed on top of that was actually the bigger issue -- and was the beginning of the end.</strong><br></p><p>I ended up removing him on all social media platforms in mid 2019 because posts like the one above were triggering me.<br></p><p>By July 2019, we finally agreed on a modest salary for me in lieu of taking distributions which I would be made up for later. This still meant that I was getting the same $ amount or less per month as he was but at least now I had an IOU.&nbsp;<br></p><p><em>(I did this as I didn’t want to take more cash out of the business that would negatively impact our growth.)</em><br></p><p>Yay, a salary! <strong>I was now the 3rd highest paid person on my team of 10</strong> -- and getting the same as the person that had done nothing for the company in more than a year.<br></p><figure id="w-node-cc78a0f0c1db-3448d0da"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ea0c87d3db0d2d23479ff47/5f86195162505211420ac4da_Image%202.JPG" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>By the end of 2019, other things happened that I won’t go into. Suffice to say, I was mentally exhausted and felt completely taken advantage of by someone I had trusted.&nbsp;<br></p><p>So we looked for options to get out...either of the business, or at least the partnership.<br></p><p>When numbers around buyout expectations came up, there was a chasm of difference between what ‘A’ felt he deserved and what was realistic -- especially given how much he’d already taken over the last 18 months without working ($400k+).&nbsp;<br></p><p>Taking on investors or another partner seemed like the only option. However, by that point, I had no interest in bringing in someone that may have me ending up in the same place.<br></p><p><strong>Better the devil you know...</strong><br></p><p>Going into 2020 I felt stuck between a rock and a hard place.&nbsp;<br></p><p>On one hand I wanted to grow the business, innovate with new products and keep my team charged. Yet, on the other hand, I knew doing so would mean eventually paying him more in a buyout situation.<br></p><p>Every year I do a yearly review to reflect on the prior year and to set some big goals for the new year. Maybe you’ve seen them. Good, bad and mixed… I've shared my review publicly in <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/2014-review" target="_blank">2014</a>, <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/2015-review" target="_blank">2015</a>, <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/2016-review" target="_blank">2016</a>, <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/2017-review" target="_blank">2017</a>, <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/2018-review" target="_blank">2018</a>... right up until this year.<br></p><p><strong>This year I couldn't bring myself to share my review and big goal <em>publicly</em>.</strong><br></p><p><em>(It seems funny now given the dumpster fire that 2020 has been that I just knew putting plans out there might not be the best idea.)</em><br></p><p>The thing I was scared to share publicly was that <strong>my biggest goal for 2020 was to end my business partnership with ‘A’ once and for all.</strong><br></p><p>Between COVID affecting business and other extenuating factors, we could finally agree on a reasonable buyout number in August 2020 -- after over 7 months of negotiation. While it had me taking on a significant amount of personal debt, I was happy to do so because I believe so strongly BestSelf -- and in my incredible team.<br></p><p>As of September 24th 2020 I’m officially 100% owner in <a href="https://lttlmg.ht/bestself" target="_blank">BestSelf</a> - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CFr72LMHSIk/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target="_blank"><strong>official announcement here</strong></a><strong>.</strong><br></p><h6><strong>To say I was excited would be an understatement 🙌🏻</strong></h6><figure id="w-node-8453fbbbca5b-3448d0da"><a href="http://instagram.com/cathryn.lavery" target="_blank"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ea0c87d3db0d2d23479ff47/5f861a99397936d25e6798ea_giphy%20(9).gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></a><figcaption>yay!</figcaption></figure><h3>‍<strong>what I would do differently</strong><br></h3><p>I don’t believe in regrets or wishing things were different - everything worked out as it was meant to and this was a huge learning experience for me.&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote><em>“Don’t wish it was easier, wish you were better”</em> - Jim Rohn</blockquote><p>This famous Jim Rohn quote perfectly fits here, this whole experience taught me a lot about myself and what I’m capable of.&nbsp;<br></p><p>That said… I learned some big lessons that would make me approach any future partnership extremely differently.

</pre></div><p>As you can see, using <strong>csvcut </strong>with the option <strong>-n </strong>can list all the headers we have with their associated order which can help us select some specific columns that we're interested in.</p><h2>Selecting specific columns</h2><p>In this tutorial, we're interested in four columns and these are their descriptions as reported by the COVID&nbsp;Tracking&nbsp;Project:</p><ol start="1" role="list"><li>data:&nbsp;Date on which data was collected by The COVID Tracking Project.</li><li>state: Two-letter abbreviation for the state or territory.</li><li>positive: Total number of <strong>confirmed plus probable cases</strong> of COVID-19 reported by the state or territory</li><li>death:&nbsp;Total <strong>fatalities with confirmed OR probable COVID-19 case diagnosis</strong><br></li></ol><p>Let's see how we can get the first 10 lines of these 4 columns in our CSV&nbsp;file at the command line:</p><div><pre>$ csvcut -c date,state,positive,death all-states-history.csv | head | csvlook 
|       date | state | positive |  death |
| ---------- | ----- | -------- | ------ |
| 2020-10-26 | AK    |   14,413 |     68 |
| 2020-10-26 | AL    |  185,322 |  2,866 |
| 2020-10-26 | AR    |  106,727 |  1,833 |

| 2020-10-26 | DC    |   16,812 |    642 |
</pre></div><p>So <strong>csvcut </strong>with the option <strong>-c </strong>is used here to select the upcoming columns separated by commas. These 10 lines look better aligned with <strong>csvlook</strong></p><p>Note that we could've done that with either of the following commands:</p><div><pre>$ csvcut -c 1,2,22,4 all-states-history.csv | csvgrep -c state -m CA |head | csvlook
$ csvcut -c 1-2,22,4 all-states-history.csv | csvgrep -c state -m CA |head | csvlook
$ csvcut -c 1-2,positive,4 all-states-history.csv | csvgrep -c state -m CA |head | csvlook
</pre></div><p>Meaning you can select the columns with their numbers or ranges or a combination of numbers and column names as strings.</p><p>Take care that this CSV&nbsp;data may differ from yours if you're using the recent data from the COVID&nbsp;Tracking Project on another day than the day this tutorial was written.</p><h2>Filtering information</h2><p>Let's now filter out COVID&nbsp;data at California state:</p><div><pre>$ csvcut -c date,state,positive,death all-states-history.csv | csvgrep -c state -m AL | head | csvlook

</pre></div><p>We used here <strong>csvgrep</strong> with the option <strong>-c </strong>to select the column that we’re filtering which is the <em>state </em>here to match <em>AL</em> using <strong>-m </strong>option that matches the pattern we search for.</p><p>I'd like to make sure of this data, so I&nbsp;went to Google and asked how many cases we have at Alabama and this is the answer:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f359c073455c743bc873ee4/5f988fc5968f41509e41fbfe_Screen%20Shot%202020-10-27%20at%2011.22.07%20PM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Image by the Author</figcaption></figure><p>Looks like the data reported by the COVID Tracking Project is close to what Google is reporting having 186K positive cases and 2892 fatalities.</p><p>If you also put another column to show the increase in the positive cases from the previous day, you'd find:</p><div><pre>$ csvcut -c date,state,positive,24,death all-states-history.csv | csvgrep -c state -m AL | head | csvlook

</pre></div><p>Note here that <strong>csvjoin </strong>command takes much time because it's reading both files into memory.</p><p>Here we joined the two CSV files on a column for each CSV; <em>Abbreviation</em> in the first file and <em>state </em>in the second one and then we filtered out 5 columns to view using <strong>csvcut -c </strong></p><p>Also, note that there the second column you filtered out when you joined is gone meaning if you filtered out <em>state (</em>which was the column that has the two-letter abbreviation of the state) it will give an error that 'state' is invalid which means this column is not there anymore.</p><h2>Comparing between xsv and csvkit utilities</h2><p>As we noticed, some commands took much time using csvkit command line utility.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Impostor Syndrome is real and if you have never heard of it you can easily google the concept to find an infinite amount of articles about the theme.</p><p>Here is a simple definition of Impostor Syndrome given by Wikipedia to save you the trouble of opening another tab:</p><p>"Impostor syndrome is a psychological pattern in which an individual doubts their skills, talents, or accomplishments and has a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a "fraud". Despite external evidence of their competence, those experiencing this phenomenon remain convinced that they are frauds, and do not deserve all they have achieved. Individuals with impostorism incorrectly attribute their success to luck or interpret it as a result of deceiving others into thinking they are more intelligent than they perceive themselves to be. While early research focused on the prevalence among high-achieving women, impostor syndrome has been recognized to affect both men and women equally."</p><p>Last week I saw a <a href="https://twitter.com/Swizec/status/1318242994491772928">tweet</a> about a bug on Spotify, the major app when you think about a "music app" these days, even though they have big competitors like Apple Music and YouTube Music.</p><p>When you look for "coffe", the search results worked fine:</p><p><img src="https://renanmf.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/spotify_bug_1.png" alt=""></p><p>But when you look for "coffee", the results didn’t show:</p><p><img src="https://renanmf.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/spotify_bug_2.png" alt=""></p><p>This is not a big issue, of course, maybe some metadata missing or something else more punctual.</p><p>And this not to bash Spotify as a company, their app is great and, as a developer, I’m a heavy user of their services.</p><p>But this is a good example of how even an established company with a net worth of billions of dollars can make silly mistakes like this.</p><p>After seeing this I <a href="https://twitter.com/renanmouraf/status/1318595074511589380">tweeted</a> about this random idea of a site called "defeat your impostor syndrome", where people would post a collection of gifs and videos of bugs on apps like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc.</p><p>The tag line is "If the big companies making billions have their share of problems, why do you have to be perfect?".</p><p>Since I don’t have the time to work on this, I shared with the world, maybe someone will pick it up and build it.</p><p>The tech space is getting wider every day, no matter what you do.</p><p>It’s easy to feel behind when you are a Java developer and see everybody talking about JavaScript, or if you are a Web Developer and keep reading about Machine Learning and Python and you know zero about both, not to mention the mobile apps development space and many other areas.</p><p>Becoming a good software developer is way more about how you adapt to a given situation than how you are fully prepared for it.</p><p>You will never know everything there is to know and this is ok!</p><p>There are an incredible amount of developers who have lived good lives and made good careers out of a single platform or framework like Ruby on Rails.</p><p>Master the basics well, learn algorithms and data structures, learn object-oriented programming, how to design a database properly, get your fundamentals of vanilla JavaScript rock-solid so you can switch from React to Vue or Angular way more easily.</p><p>If you are a newbie, pick a language and become proficient in it, stop looking for the next shiny thing every week, when you get really god in one, most of the knowledge is transferable.</p><p>Get past the "intro" level in something and move on to the next level, you can read <a href="https://renanmf.com/machine-learning-for-humans-how-to-learn-better-and-faster/">Machine Learning for Humans: how to learn better and faster?</a> to see why this is important and why you should focus.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>As part of a continued series of blog posts themed about “Relational databases and NoSQL”,
Dr. Michael Stonebraker and I co-authored a new blog post just published on
<a href="https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/universal-relation-data-modelling-considered-harmful">EnterpriseDB’s blog</a>.</p>
<p>This post discusses the “Universal Relation” data model, which has become trendier recently under
the name of “Single Table Design”, and is frequently used and recommended in DynamoDB. We discuss a sample
DynamoDB application, and run a benchmark analyzing potential conflicts with DynamoDB transactions.
All source code is <a href="https://gitlab.com/ahachete/blog-posts-src/-/tree/master/202009-universal_relation/src">open source and
public</a>. The
source <a href="https://gitlab.com/ahachete/blog-posts-src/-/blob/master/202009-universal_relation/src/relational.sql">also contains a trivial exercise</a>,
not detailed in the blog post, on how to emulate Single Table Design with Postgres views. Not of
real utility, but shows Postgres flexibility.</p>

In particular, we’re going to talk about a system that Dominick architected and led the development of called Mailcore, which is Jane Street’s own homegrown mail server. </p><p> And I think this is interesting on its own because email is an interesting topic and the whole architecture behind it, but I think it’s also a lens into some interesting questions about software design and how you manage infrastructure, some questions about how you make this choice of when you build your own thing and when you use standard, existing tools, and also some interesting questions about how programming language plays a role in systems design.</p></div>

<h2 id="000048">00:00:48</h2>

<p>Hi, Ron.</p>

<h2 id="000049">00:00:49</h2>

<p>Hey, DLo. So, to get started, can you tell us a little bit about how email works?</p>

<h2 id="000054">00:00:54</h2>

<div><p>Sure. Yeah. So email is based on an old and venerable protocol on the Internet called the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, SMTP, and SMTP… you can kind of think of it as playing the role that the Postal Service plays in delivering regular mail. It is a way for one server that wants to deliver a message somewhere, to hand that message off to another party, who can get it to its final destination, whether that is the eventual destination server itself or some intermediary who can help you get a little bit closer.
</p><p>Email itself came into fruition, as we know today, in the early days of the Internet, and the protocol itself is very simple. You basically have the actual body of the message itself, which has its own separate format and specification, and then you have a set of instructions for expressing who that message is destined for and who it’s coming from, and so one server connects to another.
</p><p>And it says, “I’ve got a message. It’s coming from so and so, and it’s meant to be delivered to some other person. Here’s the body of the message,” and the receiving server can do with that what it will. It can either say, “Great, I’ll take that, and I’ll be responsible for it from here on out.” It can say, “No, I don’t know anything about that person. You have to find somebody else to deliver that to” or reject it for any number of other reasons, like, “This looks like it has a virus,” or “You’re not allowed to connect to me,” or “I’m not available for receiving mail right now.”</p></div>

<h2 id="000217">00:02:17</h2>

<p>And one thing that always strikes me about email is it’s this kind of wondrous artifact from the early Internet, which is a <em>truly</em> open social network. There’s lots of things that people talk about, right? Could we make existing social networks better and more open and all of that, and email, just <em>is</em> from its initial design; and its complete history has been this very open thing, and as you point out, the core protocols and transports are relatively simple, although there is actually a surprising amount of complexity in the RFCs that tell you how to parse a particular email. The overall system is pretty simple, but there’s a lot of complexity in all of the different players who build systems that actually manage and transfer email around and how they deal with the various problems that happen, like spam and people attacking systems via email and all of that. So the foundations are relatively simple, but the emergent complexity of the system is actually pretty high.</p>

<h2 id="000310">00:03:10</h2>

<p>Like with many protocols of the old Internet, it was designed in a time where the world was much simpler than it is today, especially the Internet-connected world. You know, there were probably 50 institutions that had Internet connections or ARPANET connections at the time, and you didn’t really have to worry that anybody was going to be spamming because barely anybody even know what email was in the first place.</p>

<h2 id="000330">00:03:30</h2>

<div><p>When you start and build a new thing, the early properties of the thing that you build can often be really sticky and really matter in a way that’s kind of hard to predict. So this one early property of being open has stayed there. Email is a thing that anyone can participate in. Organizations can build their own infrastructure to connect to it, and through all the rather large transformations that the email system has gone through, that openness remains as a core property.
</p><p>This is the horrible thing about designing to build a new thing,  when you want to design something new, you have to make a bunch of choices, and clearly, you shouldn’t worry about them that much, because probably the thing you build is going to fail and isn’t going to work out, and even if it does, you’re going to learn more about the problem later, and so you shouldn’t worry too much about the early decisions. But also, some of the early decisions, you don’t know which ones are going to turn out to be very hard to change.</p></div>

<h2 id="000413">00:04:13</h2>

<p>That’s right.</p>

<h2 id="000414">00:04:14</h2>

<p>And you’ll be stuck with them until the end of time.</p>

<h2 id="000416">00:04:16</h2>

<p>And in fact, you know, the big players in email today – obviously Google and Gmail, are a really large percentage of the email sending and receiving on the Internet – but they’re still wrestling with some of those early decisions and some of that openness that are architected in, as they try to figure out how they can make email more secure and how they can protect their users and rein in some of the malicious actors on the Internet, and that’s just a hard thing to do while trying to maintain the existing openness that email has; it cuts both ways I guess.</p>

<h2 id="000445">00:04:45</h2>

<p>That openness, in the end, has a lot of value.</p>

<h2 id="000446">00:04:46</h2>

<p>Absolutely. Yeah.</p>

<h2 id="000448">00:04:48</h2>

<p>So the story here is about how you ended up building the system called Mailcore. What did email at Jane Street look like when you first ran into the problem?</p>

<h2 id="000456">00:04:56</h2>

<div><p>So you might think that there’s really not much special about the way Jane Street uses email compared to any other company, and largely, that’s true. I think we have a few special requirements by dint of the fact that we are in a regulated industry, so we have some requirements around logging for compliance purposes every message that is sent or received by somebody at Jane Street.
</p><p>But other than that, our email system looks pretty similar, or has looked, in the past, pretty similar, to the way an email system in any organization might look, and the rough summary is we have some mail gateways that sit on the outside of our network for receiving email from foreign servers, you know, from external parties, and then we have some mail server, or a set of servers, inside of our network that handle all of the complicated business logic around what to do with those messages.
</p><p>So, in some cases, it’s as simple as receive the message and deliver it into the mailbox of the user if we are the intended recipient. In other cases, it is apply filtering for things like spam and viruses and other things that we might want to extract from messages before we deliver them, do expansion for mailing lists. So if you send an email to some group at Jane Street, you want to be able to expand that group name to the actual list of recipient mailboxes to make sure that it actually ends up in the inboxes of the recipients who it’s destined for. And then this extra compliance implication of making sure that we’re logging all of the right messages with all of the right metadata. </p><p>And at the time that I started, the mail infrastructure here was all based on an open source mail server that has its own config language and is pretty widely used on the Internet at large, and we had about 400 or 500 lines of configuration in the most complex case, I think, for this system to get it to do all of these different things that we wanted it to be able to do.</p></div>

<h2 id="000644">00:06:44</h2>

<p>Great. So that sounds like a reasonable approach in terms of how to build oneself a mail system. What problems did we run into with it?</p>

<h2 id="000650">00:06:50</h2>

<div><p>Yeah, so the biggest problem here, at the end of the day, was the complexity required for configuring this system to do all of the things that we needed it to do. So, now, I said 400 or 500 lines of configuration – that probably doesn’t sound like a huge number, but when it’s in a kind of bespoke configuration language that’s unlike the configuration of any other system and unlike any programming language that a developer or engineer at Jane Street would be familiar with, the complexity of 400 or 500 lines in a foreign language is pretty large and can be a little bit imposing to deal with.
</p><p>In particular, we had some scary near-misses where we realized that we had done the wrong thing in terms of archiving some email for compliance purposes that we were supposed to archive, and luckily, in each of those cases, there were mitigating factors such that it didn’t end up being a big deal, but that near-miss gave us a little bit of a scare because we went and looked at the configuration and wanted to understand how we had gotten ourselves into this position, and it was harder than it felt like it should be to understand what had gone wrong and how to fix it.</p></div>

<h2 id="000750">00:07:50</h2>

<p>It’s maybe also worth mentioning that the problem of logging all of your messages for compliance purposes may sound easy, but it’s made more complicated by the fact that Jane Street is a company that operates in lots of different regulatory regimes and has actually different rules for some of the different places it operates. So even the sort of seemingly simple, “Let’s just write everything down” is more complicated than it might appear at first.</p>

<h2 id="000811">00:08:11</h2>

<p>That’s right, yeah. We have different requirements in terms of what has to be written down and what kinds of metadata we need to store and where the extra copies need to be physically located around the world and things like that, which are reasonable sounding when you think about the human aspects of it, you know, when you reason about, okay, yeah, you need a copy for this and a …</p></div></div>

<p>You know, sometimes those cards can be fun... Look for the 
humour in this image taken from the Air Finland 757-200 safety card.</p>

<p>It is also very interesting to see what the aircraft interior 
looks like. The next picture shows Berlusconi's A319CJ (Aeronautica Militare 
Italiana).</p>

<p>There is this awesome book about safety cards. It's called '<b>Design 
For Impact</b>'. It takes you way back to the very beginning of the safety 
cards, to an era in aviation where men wore high hats and their women fancy 
dresses. It turns out that the first 'real' safety cards were introduced on 
board airplanes in the Thirties. They mostly consisted of written words, where 
today's cards only contain pictures and drawings. Anyway, if any of you is 
looking for an interesting book to read with a lot of pictures of old safety 
cards, then this is a 'must&nbsp;have'.</p>

Since then, we’ve gone from a deck and a provisional patent to a team of 12+, a lead drug, and a head brimming with new knowledge and experiences. These are some of my biggest learnings in the last year. </p><h3>Small decisions compound exponentially, especially around team &amp; culture</h3><p>One of the most important things I ever did for our culture was a mistake. The week before a key proof-of-concept study, I decided to completely rework the study design and re-question all of our assumptions. This delayed our timelines and made most of our previous work moot. It also saved the study. </p><p>That was a show not tell moment with our values - it showed the team that truth seeking is the most important thing, and no one has to be scared to tell me if they want to change up something last minute (because I did it myself!). This paved the way to many other close saves. </p><h3>For key relationships, make sure motivations are aligned</h3><p>From investors and advisors to contractors and employees, taking time to understand to fully empathize with their priorities and worries, and not automatically assuming that their motivations are the same as yours, was a hard lesson to embody. As a stereotypical bombastic founder, it was hard for me to comprehend someone <em>not </em>being mission-motivated and not wanting this in the world as badly as I do.</p><p>In hiring, I’ve found that even the most talented person will not perform well if they don’t deeply and truly care about your mission (at least at this stage of the company). In professional relationships, it’s unlikely their motivation is the same as yours, but often motivations can be complimentary. Everything is so much easier when they are. </p><h3>Most catchy startup advice has layers of nuance and conditionals that you wont realize until you’re in the thick of it</h3><p>I hit this one a lot this year, a likely consequence from listening to a few too many startup podcasts. A good example is ‘hire fast, fire fast’. Generally good advice, in my opinion. But no one tells you how difficult it is to execute on that advice, the accusations you’ll face from the person or others, the emotional toll of making a decision that affects someone’s wellbeing, and the ripple effects a firing, even if necessary, can have on the team and how to deal with that. Correct advice? Totally. But far from the full picture. One of my biggest learnings this year was becoming aware of and starting to learn how to predict the nuance and conditionals around things that seem simple from the outside. </p><h3>The line between optimism and naïveté is a wide as a hair </h3><p>To do novel hard things requires optimism that you have some key insight or ability that means you can achieve what others haven’t. You need to be optimistic to trudge through the sludge and to recruit others to your crazy idea long before it’s proven. Naive optimism is so important for building a company and telling a story. But you also need to be paranoid and see around corners. </p><p>Balancing these is difficult - too optimistic and you’ll fall into a trap, too paranoid and you’ll never make a decision. Over the last year, I’ve gained a healthy respect for the challenges ahead of us, moving my natural tendency of optimism a few inches closer to paranoia. I think this will serve us well on this next stage of our journey. </p><p>For me, the hardest part of this was realizing that the optimal balance between optimism and realism differs depending on the situation; what works when facing investors doesn’t work when recruiting, and these two situations differ significantly to the balance you need to hold internally. </p></div></div></div></div></div>

<![CDATA[The Privacy Puzzle: A Baffled Voter's Guide to California's Prop 24]]>

October 28, 2020 | https://sandiegoprivacy.org/prop24.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://sandiegoprivacy.org/prop24.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
    
    <p>
      Proposition 24 is a 52-page law that overhauls privacy laws in California. It's so complex that it has split the privacy community, and experts disagree about what it would mean for Californians. Most voices agree Prop 24 has some changes to love, and some to reject. The typical voter is probably very uncertain about whether to vote "Yes" or "No".
    </p>
    <p>
      We are <strong>San Diego Privacy</strong>, a small group of privacy advocates in San Diego, and we'd like to help by offering a neutral analysis. Below you'll find 10 of the biggest issues with Prop 24, along with the main points supporters (the "Yes" side) and opponents (the "No" side) make about that issue.
    </p>
    <p>We suggest you first pick the issues in purple that jump out to you the most. Then, keep count of whether you find the Yes side or the No side more compelling, for the issues you've picked. Last, total up your counts.</p>
    <p>Then, as always, go vote your values.</p>

    <p><strong><i>Update</i></strong>: When you pick the issues below that matter to you, consider <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FSWtcqBEbe-SOUUWZ9d7j_M3Ft1ap5CR?usp=sharing" target="_blank">downloading a shareable image</a> of that issue as well, and posting it on social media to generate discussion.</p>

            <div>
              <p>
                <strong>Pay for Privacy</strong> means that if you demand privacy, companies can charge you more for goods and services.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Companies that rely on targeted advertising, like newspapers or free streaming music services, currently rely on targeted ads.</li>
                <li>Some privacy options allow you to block the ability to show you targeted ads.</li>
                <li>Pay-for-privacy is already allowed in existing California law.</li>

                  <li>Claims companies who rely on targeted ads, like newspapers, would be imperiled if pay-for-privacy was eliminated.</li>

                </p>
                <p>
                   When interviewed, Prop 24 author Alastair Mactaggart warns the newspaper industry would be hit hard if pay-for-privacy options were blocked. (<a href="https://youtu.be/eWOFZOPJm78?t=2186" target="_blank">Union-Tribune video interview</a> with Yes on 24)

                  <li>Argues privacy is a constitutional right of Californians; it is not for sale.</li>
                  <li>Warns Prop 24 further emboldens businesses to charge consumers for privacy.</li>

        Authors' Note: It's important to emphasize here that pay-for-privacy is already allowed in current law. Opponents see Prop 24's choice to further expand pay-for-privacy, rather than ban it, as one reason to oppose it.

              <p>
                <strong>Global Opt-Out</strong> allows you to set up your privacy options in one place, and have them apply universally. Prop 24 allows companies to ignore those global settings, in some cases.

              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>In the future, you'll be able to set your privacy preferences in one place, rather than at each site or service.</li>
                <li>Prop 24 includes provisions for allowing companies to ignore your global privacy preferences for certain reasons, like if they want you to pay.</li>
                <li>There could be other reasons companies won't have to respect your global privacy preferences.</li>

        Authors' Note: This is a good place to note that many privacy advocates believe all efforts to collect your data should require affirmative consent from you, rather than using the "opt-out" model where companies collect your data first, and then require you to ask it be deleted or not collected.

        Authors' Note: Privacy advocates feel very strongly that Californians should have the "private right of action," or the right to sue companies to enforce privacy law. It seems to us unlikely that privacy organizations will support overhauls to California's privacy laws without that private right of action being included.

            <div>
              <p>
                Prop 24 is a 52-page law with so much complexity that even experts disagree on its meaning. It was written privately and then submitted directly to voters.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Alastair Mactaggart wrote Prop 24. It has not been reviewed by the legislature.</li>
                <li>Mactaggart invited some industries to provide changes to Prop 24 as it was drafted.</li>
                <li>Mactaggart helped get California's existing CCPA privacy law passed through the legislature.</li>

It’s far and away the most influential and successful venture capital firm in the world. It’s dominant in the United States and China, and it has a growing profile in India. It has a stable of early stage bets that it should be cashing in soon and some astounding late stage investments that have already gone public. Sequoia Capital is like LeBron James. He is at once widely recognized as the greatest basketball player in the game right now, and <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2913030-lebron-james-i-want-my-damn-respect-after-leading-lakers-to-2020-nba-title">still doesn’t think he gets the respect he deserves</a>. </p><p>So far this year, Sequoia has seen public listings from Unity, Snowflake, Sumo Logic, Berkeley Lights, and Lemonade. Airbnb and DoorDash could list later this year. Sequoia started investing in Stripe in its seed round. Business for Sequoia is going great.</p><p>But the firm is interesting right now because<strong> Sequoia’s leader, Doug Leone, is a die-hard, Fox News-watching Republican who supports a president whose policies undermine the firm in big and small ways. </strong>Leone shares Republican memes to his Facebook page, like one from June that reads in all capital letters: “Since liberal governors are allowing protesters to be smashed together like sardines, it’s obvious that coronavirus was never about saving lives, it was about destroying the Trump economy!” Leone is an avid Trump supporter and someone who believes the meritocracy got him where he is today, I’m told. His fervent Republican support has been <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/8/10/21362401/donald-trump-tiktok-ban-sale-microsoft-doug-leone-sequoia">earning media attention</a>. </p><p>Sequoia’s <strong>Michael Moritz</strong>’s Democratic donations certainly counterbalance <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/8/10/21362401/donald-trump-tiktok-ban-sale-microsoft-doug-leone-sequoia">Leone’s Republican political giving</a>. (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/individual-contributions/?contributor_employer=Sequoia+capital&amp;two_year_transaction_period=2020&amp;min_date=01%2F01%2F2019&amp;max_date=12%2F31%2F2020">They are both donating aggressively</a> ahead of the election.) That doesn’t change how problematic Leone’s politics are for the firm in a Silicon Valley where Trump’s politics are considered by many (myself included) to be beyond the pale.</p><p>Putting aside Trump’s racist and authoritarian tendencies, how can Sequoia’s leader so viscerally support an anti-China American president when the firm makes so much of its money in China? Leone helped set up Sequoia’s China strategy, but he supports a president who has made attacking China one of his signature issues.</p><p>So much of Sequoia’s financial success depends on its ability to get money into and out of China. <strong>Neil Shen</strong> — an iconic investor in China and one of Sequoia’s stewards — is seen as a candidate to replace Leone whenever he steps aside. Leone’s Republican affinity may have helped the firm navigate Trump’s attack on TikTok, but the long-term hostility toward China will be harder to unwind no matter who wins on Nov. 3. </p><p>Now after four years with China as a political football, would Sequoia’s limited partners accept a China-focused venture capitalist running its global operations? Shen’s success would seem to justify a seat at the top. “Neil Shen is probably going to run that firm long-term,” one rival American VC told me. “He's driving immense returns from China.”</p><p>The decision as to whether Shen, who is based in Hong Kong, would be elevated to run Sequoia would have major ramifications for the fund and for the relations between two superpowers. For the fund, the question is whether Shen would stick around if he were passed over. His reputation in China is so exemplary that he could easily build his own empire. “The question I’ve always asked, and other people ask is, ‘Why does he stay there?’” one well-connected American tech source said. “By straight returns, he’s the most successful investor in the world. He’s in every important China deal in a big way.” And China’s technology industry has been booming.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f62ea6b-3552-4daa-a3b4-1f24b6f0331c_2848x1947.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f62ea6b-3552-4daa-a3b4-1f24b6f0331c_2848x1947.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0f62ea6b-3552-4daa-a3b4-1f24b6f0331c_2848x1947.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:995,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1817501,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></p><p>Geopolitically, if Shen were named the head of Sequoia, it would be taken as a sign of goodwill between the two countries. But it would also seem to signal a shift in the balance of power between Silicon Valley and the Chinese technology industry. (On paper, local business heads like Shen run their own businesses independently, while the global managing partner oversees the firm’s operations and culture.) </p><p>I don’t know if globalism snaps back quickly enough to make room for Shen at the helm of America’s top venture capital firm. Personally, I’d bet on <strong>Roelof Botha</strong>, the firm’s U.S. leader. </p><p>It’s always possible Sequoia tries to split the role or that Shen could stick around under Botha’s leadership. Botha scored only two spots behind Shen on the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/midas/list/">Midas list</a> this year. It wouldn’t exactly be an insult if Botha were put in charge. (Botha’s politics aren’t as publicly accessible. Recently <a href="https://twitter.com/roelofbotha/status/1316578275360083969?s=20">on Twitter</a> he accused the New York Times of building “an echo chamber catering to the previously held beliefs of its existing audience” as he <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/10/11/the-new-york-times-guild-once-again-demands-censorship-for-colleagues/">shared an article</a> about the newspaper’s union demanding “sensitivity readers.” Botha also recently <a href="https://twitter.com/roelofbotha/status/1316588807538405379?s=20">defended his family’s role in</a> South Africa as overseeing a “peaceful transition to democracy rule.”)</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20ae63fd-fe97-4573-91e4-92bf785746cb_4381x3289.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20ae63fd-fe97-4573-91e4-92bf785746cb_4381x3289.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/20ae63fd-fe97-4573-91e4-92bf785746cb_4381x3289.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1093,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2110640,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></p><p><strong>It’s not just the China issue where the firm’s politics matter. </strong>A Trumpian worldview inhibits the firm’s capacity to recruit women and minority investors. There’s an old guard of venture partners (and my sense is this includes Leone) that believe in a sort of fatalistic meritocracy, where the best talent rises to the top. A younger guard of founders have stopped believing the system works so organically. Sequoia doesn’t have any Black partners and its senior ranks are dominated by men. That puts a lot of unfair pressure on partners like <strong>Jess Lee</strong> to succeed. I’ve heard the firm is making attempts at recruiting a Black investor, which is long overdue. Given that Sequoia is the top venture firm in the world, it should be ahead, not behind on this issue.</p><p>Sequoia’s spokeswoman declined to comment.</p><h2><em><strong>What could Silicon Valley’s politics look like in a Biden presidency?</strong></em></h2><p>I see two possible paths. </p><p><strong>On the one hand</strong>, there’s a strong desire among a subsection of Silicon Valley to go back to business as usual. “What troubles me the most is the increased polarization of U.S. society,” Botha tweeted earlier this month. “There seems to be scant willingness or tolerance – on either side – for joint engagement to address our problems. How do we transcend this disunity so we can work together to build a better future?”</p><p>There are a lot of rich white men who are exhausted by what they might call “woke politics.” You can hear it on Clubhouse. They’d love to get back to building apps without everything having a political lens. And they’d like to return to a world where political ideologies are shrugged off as personal preferences, rather than some sort of Scarlet Letter. </p><p><strong>On the other hand</strong>, I think there’s a world in which people who supported Trump when he was in power look far worse once he’s out of power. Right now, everyone who depends on powerful people, including the media, has an incentive to treat the President like a valid political actor. Leone’s Trump support right now can be positioned as savvy, rather than deplorable. But should Trump leave office, suddenly, the power the president held goes away. Everyone felt much freer to admit that the Iraq War was a disaster once George W. Bush was a lame duck president. If Biden wins big in an election where college educated voters are largely aligned, I think the billionaire Silicon Valley Republican holdouts could look more contemptible than they already do. I’m told Leone is a nice guy and I believe it. But politics isn’t basketball. The election has consequences, and it matters who the most powerful person at the most powerful venture capital firm is rooting for.</p><p><strong>I do also wonder what a post-Trump era (should we be so lucky) looks like in policy and PR shops around Silicon Valley. </strong>There’s a reason that former Romney and McCain operatives have done so well in tech. Democrats don’t think they were trying to destroy the country. But it’s not as if Silicon Valley drew a line in the sand on the Bush years. <strong>Joel Kaplan</strong>, an operative in the Bush administration and during the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/25/washington/limelight-finds-new-white-house-deputy.html">Florida recount effort</a>, is one of the most influential executives at Facebook.</p><p>While plenty of liberal-minded firms and companies will wrestle with the lines of acceptability, some firms are more insulated from criticism than others. <strong>Keith Rabois</strong> may be insufferable on Twitter, but if you’re a fintech company and he wants to invest, it’s harder to say no. And Founders Fund has already cornered the market on, to put it nicely, unconventional thinkers. Sequoia is fundamentally dependent on its firm-wide brand in a way that I think some younger firms are not. </p><p>I don’t think there’s any one partner at Sequoia outside of Shen who feels as vital to a particular sector. The firm is having a lot of success and they’re all excellent at what they do, for sure, but a lot of the credit flows up to the brand the firm has built over decades. “Sequoia is powerful because when they invest in a company,” one unicorn founder said, “suddenly that new company gets all that brand pixie dust.” In a Silicon Valley where employees protest their bosses, will the next generation of founders still see Sequoia the same way if it seems stuck in the past? </p><p>I hope not.</p></div></div>]]>

		<p>Since I live in a different town from my family, the holidays are the majority of the time I get to spend with my twelve year-old brother (we have a 17 year age gap).</p>
<p>Now that he’s nearly a teenager, he’s almost the age I was when I started thinking independently from family and friends. For me, a big part of that was discovering Paul Graham’s essays. Hopefully one day my brother reads through them (but I won’t force him).</p>
<p>This got me thinking: if I were to recommend them to him, would I want him to read them chronologically? Or should I point him to specific essays based on his interests?</p>
<p>Alternatively, if one were to compile all of Paul’s essays into a collection or a <i>Hackers and Painters</i> sequel, how would it be organized?</p>
<p>So below is my attempt at tagging Paul Graham’s essays by subject matter.</p>

                    <p>Clearly NVIDIA has had issues keeping up with demand for their 3000 series graphics cards. And while they claim that they pushed back the launch of today's RTX 3070 to shore up supply, given that this is positioned as an RTX 2080 Ti killer for 500 bucks US, I doubt anything they've done in the last couple of weeks is going to help. Unless of course, we fire it up on our trusty test bench and it falls way short of expectations.</p>
<p><img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99aec1afe00.webp" alt="NVIDIA RTX 3070 Review" width="854" height="auto" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99aec1afe00.webp">It looks like as far as NVIDIA's big gaming performance claims go, the RTX 3070 does adjust fine, matching or beating our 2080 Ti Founder's Edition more often than not.<img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99aed5afc59.webp" alt="NVIDIA RTX 3070 Review" width="854" height="auto" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99aed5afc59.webp"> At least in games that take advantage of it's beefier RT cores, and tensor cores, which are focused on real-time Ray tracing and deep learning workloads respectively.<img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99aee2d856b.webp" alt="NVIDIA RTX 3070 Review" width="854" height="auto" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99aee2d856b.webp"></p>
<p>There was a time in the past when we might've called NVIDIA's DLSS deep learning upscaling a performance hack and forced their cards to compete with it disabled. <img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99af0132b93.webp" alt="NVIDIA RTX 3070 Review" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99af0132b93.webp" height="auto">But, there's just no other way to put this. It's gotten really good. <img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99af1b9cbb5.webp" alt="NVIDIA RTX 3070 Review" width="854" height="auto" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99af1b9cbb5.webp">When we turned all that stuff off, in Wolfenstein: Youngblood though, and forced a more traditional rendering approach, we did observe a small but measurable four to 5% dip in performance. So, it isn't quite a 2080 Ti, but at less than half the price, I don't think anyone's complaining.</p>
<p><img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99af303cb7a.webp" alt="NVIDIA RTX 3070 Review" width="854" height="auto" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99af303cb7a.webp">Microsoft Flight Simulator, while CPU-bound at virtually any resolution, revealed a curious twist in our story though. The minimum frame rate is lower than the 2080 Ti, but the average is higher, suggesting that while the GPU is fast enough to keep up, there's a memory bandwidth bottleneck in the mix, thanks to the 3070's narrower 256 bit bus. <img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99af473da7e.webp" alt="NVIDIA RTX 3070 Review" width="854" height="auto" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99af473da7e.webp">It still excels in our parallel Nintendo 64 test but Counter-Strike: Global Offensive sees it fall below the RTX 2080 Ti again.<img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99af550f7c4.webp" alt="NVIDIA RTX 3070 Review" width="854" height="auto" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99af550f7c4.webp"></p>
<p>Although, we're still talking 450 versus 470 frames per second. So, it's pretty easy to forgive when you look at the bigger picture.</p>
<p>Productivity is another area where NVIDIA's new Ampere architecture GPUs really shine. <img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99af6be7eea.webp" alt="NVIDIA RTX 3070 Review" width="854" height="auto" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99af6be7eea.webp">Our blender benders on the 3070 went roughly 20 to 30% faster than the 2080 Ti.<img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99af7830ed2.webp" alt="NVIDIA RTX 3070 Review" width="854" height="auto" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99af7830ed2.webp"> That is a significant improvement, likely down to the sheer number of cooler cores that NVIDIA has packed into this thing, with Samsung's eight nanometer process. <img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99af83bd277.webp" alt="NVIDIA RTX 3070 Review" width="854" height="auto" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99af83bd277.webp">V-Ray and Redshift show us similar results while OctaneBench shows us once again the difference between having RTX on versus off. <img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99af8f33bce.webp" alt="NVIDIA RTX 3070 Review" width="854" height="auto" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99af8f33bce.webp">Those RT cores are where this GPU's main advantage comes into play whenever memory bandwidth is an issue. <img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99af9ad457a.webp" alt="NVIDIA RTX 3070 Review" width="854" height="auto" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99af9ad457a.webp"></p>
<p>Speaking of which, the new SPECviewperf 2020<img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99afabd58a6.webp" alt="NVIDIA RTX 3070 Review" width="854" height="auto" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99afabd58a6.webp"> shows us that while it's great for rendering, and nearly as good for some other tasks that just need to crunch numbers, a lot of high-end workstation users suffer from the constrained memory bandwidth of consumer cards like this one, and performance of our RTX 3070 fell to as low as 80% of what the last gen RTX 2080 could provide. <img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99afb924c74.webp" alt="NVIDIA RTX 3070 Review" width="854" height="auto" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99afb924c74.webp"></p>
<p>To be fair to NVIDIA though, that's not what this card is designed to do. It just happens to be a consideration if you're self-employed or working from home and you do need to run these applications during work hours.</p>
<p>If we average all of our results though, we can see that we're hovering right around that magic 100% mark compared to the 2080 Ti, which is extremely impressive. <img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99afcff2811.webp" alt="NVIDIA RTX 3070 Review" width="854" height="auto" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99afcff2811.webp">Unless the 3070 has an Achilles heel that we haven't found yet. Let's take a closer look then, at our founder's edition card.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's got the same flow-through cooler design as the RTX 3080, and RTX 3090, but it's super tiny and has the same fan layout as the RTX 20 series, which isn't to say it's light.<img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99aff44d33e.webp" alt="NVIDIA RTX 3070 Review" width="854" height="auto" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99aff44d33e.webp"> I was surprised at how heavy it is for its size. And I was surprised to see NVIDIA's new radical 12-pin power connector, in the same visually jarring position.</p>
<p>I mean, at least the adapter only requires a single eight pin instead of two.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Interestingly, the grill on the I/O plate is indented a little. <img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99b01ecf459.webp" alt="NVIDIA RTX 3070 Review" width="854" height="auto" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99b01ecf459.webp">So it bolts directly onto the cooler rather than tabs on the display outputs, making the design feel much sturdier and therefore more likely to survive a drop.</p>
<p>Our card was we're able to ramp to 1.9 to two gigahertz all day long, with its core sitting at RTX 2080 Ti temperatures. <img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99b0352813a.webp" alt="NVIDIA RTX 3070 Review" width="854" height="auto" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99b0352813a.webp">Which is toastier than our RTX 2070 Super. <img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99b03fcf606.webp" alt="NVIDIA RTX 3070 Review" width="854" height="auto" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99b03fcf606.webp">But in fairness, the cooler here is significantly smaller which shows just how efficient NVIDIA's pass-through approaches. <img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99b04c09108.webp" alt="NVIDIA RTX 3070 Review" width="854" height="auto" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99b04c09108.webp">When we look at power consumption<img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99b05a934b9.webp" alt="NVIDIA RTX 3070 Review" width="854" height="auto" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99b05a934b9.webp"> it was a touch higher over the course of our SPECviewperf run, compared with the RTX 2070 Super, with our peak recorded wattage no higher 253 Watts compared to that card's 224.<img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99b06812750.webp" alt="NVIDIA RTX 3070 Review" width="854" height="auto" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99b06812750.webp"> This is excellent news because the RTX 3080 guzzled far more power than even the 2080 Ti, and the RTX 3090 sees massive power spikes that can cause mere mortal power supplies to just blink off, thanks to their over current protection.</p>
<p>On that subject, you'll have to forgive me for going back to the previous 3000 series launches again here. But there was yet another power debacle where some powder boards would crash due to a flawed power delivery design. Some brands ended up shipping bad boards all the way to customers. But even ones who didn't like EVGA suffered product delays from not having all the testing and info that they needed in time for launch.</p>
<p>Nobody would go on the record for us blaming NVIDIA for this outright. But as far as we can put together, team green just didn't give their partners enough lead time to flesh out their designs, while they themselves enjoy a massive headstart, putting together revolutionary new coolers for their Ampere cards.</p>
<p>I've given NVIDIA the benefit of the doubt on this so far. But with today's move, it's clear that they are openly and unashamedly competing on an uneven playing field against their own partners.</p>
<p>What have they done today, you might ask? Well look around. Where are all the reviews of non-Founders RTX 3070s, that have normal power connectors on them. Not in any NVIDIA-sanctioned reviews at the embargo lift. Why? Well, because their embargo hasn't lifted yet. It's kind of genius, really. NVIDIA goes and creates a big splash and sells out of their Founder's Edition cards first which they've had longer to perfect. Then their partners rush to launch their competing products with less time to prepare, giving NVIDIA a second wave of review coverage, comparing their product, the GPU itself, with their product, the Founder's Edition card, often quite favorably.</p>
<p>I doubt that anything that I say is going to change NVIDIA's behavior. But, it's a crappy way to treat a partner. And I wanted to make sure that at least they feel bad about it.</p>
<p>On the subject of competition, though, AMD's Radeon announcement is tomorrow, which, again knowing NVIDIA is probably why they carpet-bombed the review cycle. <img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99b102e2111.webp" alt="NVIDIA RTX 3070 Review" width="854" height="auto" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99b102e2111.webp"></p>
<p>So today, from numbers alone. It was always gonna be easy to recommend the RTX 3070 to anyone in this price range. <img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99b1196a0ca.webp" alt="NVIDIA RTX 3070 Review" width="854" height="auto" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/10/5f99b1196a0ca.webp"> The good news, for the entire industry though, is that NVIDIA's supply woes could be AMD's big chance to make a splash with the unveiling of their new Radeon 6000 series. We still don't know for sure what that's gonna look like. But what we do know is that between it, 3070's compelling value, and the potential for deals on last gen cards come Black Friday, it is going to be a good season to buy a gaming rig.</p>

    <h2>You Won't Advance Through Coding</h2>
    <small>2020-10-26</small>
    <p>I used to work myself to death.  Not resting, I would try to complete as many tasks as possible each day.  Organized todo lists, itemized jira boards, and productivity hacks littered my second monitor as I did my best to cram as much work into each day as possible.  By the end of the day, I felt exhausted. I thought this was a sign I had a productive day.</p>
    <p>Much to my surprise, I was passed over for promotion.  When asking my manager for feedback, I was told I did a good job and didn't have much to pick at.  I felt I was a top performer.  I mean, hell, I was busting my ass every day to do as much work as possible. I had a stellar performance review.  What was the problem?</p> 
    <p>After this happened a couple of times, I saw others around me promoted on a faster time line and obtain more benefits. Most of them were doing good work as well, but it didn't seem that they were doing more than I was.  Some of them didn't do much work at all.</p>
    <p>I inappropriately attributed my lack of success with company values.  I left that company and moved to one I thought would value my technical expertise and solid work ethic.</p>
    <p>I encountered the same situation at this new company.  It was here that I figured out something was wrong with me.</p>
    <p>I misunderstood what companies value in general, not a particular company's values. Things engineers value in well-written code are almost irrelevant to the actual corporation.  What is valuable to a corporation is creating software that fulfills the customers' needs at a profit.</p>
    <h3>Solve the business problem</h3>
    <p>The ultimate question every business entity cares about is: "does this piece of software solve our problem within the budget afforded it."  Everything else is a non-issue.</p>
    <p>This is the reason there are so many bank systems written in Fortran and older programming languages.  This is also the reason that the co-worker who can't program themselves out of a paper bag can still find a way to remain in the company.</p>
    <p>TDD, language choice, and other hot programmer topics are a complete non-issue to the business side unless they interfere with meeting budget or hurt the business's value proposition.</p>
    <p>Technical chops are secondary to reliability and willingness to work for the salary given.</p>
    <p>Crafting quality software is important to your immediate development team.  But don't expect your VP or CEO (i.e. your actual clients) to applaud you on having built a system with in the hottest framework out there.</p>
    <h3>There is no Meritocracy</h3>
    <p>Corporations do not promote people based on how skilled they are in their craft.  For developer jobs at large corporations, it's nearly impossible to track how valuable a particular developer is.</p>
    <p>Negative work, managing expectations of stakeholders, and whether or not the developer writes good unit tests can affect the influence a developer has over a codebase.  But most of the ways a single developer influences the product are not quantifiable.</p>
    <p>I used to believe that as long as I became the best software developer possible, my advancement would be inevitable.</p>
    <p>When I finally was promoted, it had nothing to do with my technical skills.  It wasn't until I had a long enough tenure at the company to justify being promoted and was <b>put in charge of a project that allowed me to delegate some work to other developers</b> that I finally obtained the coveted senior position I gunned for.</p>
    <p>The combination of time in company and programming away from the keyboard resulted in my promotion.  In fact, during the promotion process, not one time did anyone mentioned how great my code was or how awesome I was at unit testing.  It sucked!</p>
    <h3>Program for yourself</h3>
    <p>Your coding skills are for you alone to enjoy.  Yes, you might work for teams in small enough companies that your actual skill will be more applicable.  On a small team, dead weight and negative work are compounded enough to show if someone isn't pulling their weight.</p>
    <p>Most of the time this will not be the case.  Forge your technical skills to earn implementaton self-confidence.  Solve your own problems.  Scratch that itch.</p>
    <p>There is a giant upside to having solid technical skills.  Although promotions are not determined by coding, if you want to stay in a technically-oriented track and hop between projects or teams, having awesome technical skills will make your life a lot easier.</p>
    <p>Imagine you are put on a team building an application in a language you have never used before.  Regardless of your time in the industry, if you have spent your career painstakingly acquiring deep technical knowledge, learning the new language will be MUCH easier.  It chould prove to be the difference between a couple weeks of learning versus a couple of months.</p>
    <p>Whether you found a job in software because you love to code or learned to code because you wanted a job in software, having solid technical skills will help you wade through bullshit and feel more confident in a particular role. Just remember that they probably won't rocket you up into the C-suite.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/675336d96deabd0007621a71180bcfb57edb6b11/805fd/images/2020-04-04-porsche_classifier/718.jpg" alt="porsche-718"></p>

<p>Trained using <a href="https://fast.ai/">fastai-v3</a>, <a href="https://pytorch.org/">pytorch</a> and <a href="https://gradient.paperspace.com/">Gradient</a>.
Uses <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ref/resnet50.html">resnet50</a> and trained on a <a href="https://images.nvidia.com/content/pdf/quadro/data-sheets/192195-DS-NV-Quadro-P5000-US-12Sept-NV-FNL-WEB.pdf">Nvidia Quadro P5000</a>.
Built on <a href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a> and is hosted on <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/app-service/web/">Microsoft Azure Web Services</a>.
Trained on a dataset of publicly sourced images containing 30000 Porsche car models of varying degree of quality.
Porsche cars, specially the latest generations of the Panamera/Taycan, Macan/Cayenne &amp; 911 / 718 can be pretty tricky to tell apart for a layman who isn’t paying very close attention, which is why I wanted to test out what kind of features this deep learning model would pick up.</p>

<h3 id="creating-your-own-dataset-from-google-images">Creating your own dataset from Google Images</h3>

<p>In this tutorial we will see how to easily create an image dataset through Google Images. Note: You will have to repeat these steps for any new category you want to Google (e.g once for dogs and once for cats).</p>
<div><pre>```python
from fastai.vision import *
```</pre></div>
<h4 id="get-a-list-of-urls">Get a list of URLs</h4>

<h5 id="search-and-scroll">Search and scroll</h5>

<p>Go to Google Images and search for the images you are interested in. The more specific you are in your Google Search, the better the results and the less manual pruning you will have to do.</p>

<p>Scroll down until you’ve seen all the images you want to download, or until you see a button that says ‘Show more results’. All the images you scrolled past are now available to download. To get more, click on the button, and continue scrolling. The maximum number of images Google Images shows is 700.</p>

<p>It is a good idea to put things you want to exclude into the search query, for instance if you are searching for the Eurasian wolf, “canis lupus lupus”, it might be a good idea to exclude other variants:</p>

<p>“canis lupus lupus” -dog -arctos -familiaris -baileyi -occidentalis</p>

<p>You can also limit your results to show only photos by clicking on Tools and selecting Photos from the Type dropdown.</p>

<h3 id="download-into-file">Download into file</h3>

<p>Now you must run some Javascript code in your browser which will save the URLs of all the images you want for you dataset.</p>

<p>In Google Chrome press CtrlShiftj on Windows/Linux and CmdOptj on macOS, and a small window the javascript ‘Console’ will appear. In Firefox press CtrlShiftk on Windows/Linux or CmdOptk on macOS. That is where you will paste the JavaScript commands.</p>

<p>You will need to get the urls of each of the images. Before running the following commands, you may want to disable ad blocking extensions (uBlock, AdBlockPlus etc.) in Chrome. Otherwise the window.open() command doesn’t work. Then you can run the following commands:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">urls<span>=</span>Array<span>.</span>from(document<span>.</span>querySelectorAll(<span>'.rg_i'</span>))<span>.</span><span>map</span>(el<span>=&gt;</span> el<span>.</span>hasAttribute(<span>'data-src'</span>)?el<span>.</span>getAttribute(<span>'data-src'</span>):el<span>.</span>getAttribute(<span>'data-iurl'</span>));
window<span>.</span><span>open</span>(<span>'data:text/csv;charset=utf-8,'</span> <span>+</span> escape(urls<span>.</span>join(<span>'</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span>)));</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="create-directory-and-upload-urls-file-into-your-server">Create directory and upload urls file into your server</h3>

<p>Choose an appropriate name for your labeled images. You can run these steps multiple times to create different labels.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">    In [<span>0</span>]:
    folder <span>=</span> <span>'718'</span>
    <span>file</span> <span>=</span> <span>'718.csv'</span>
    In [<span>0</span>]:
    folder <span>=</span> <span>'911'</span>
    <span>file</span> <span>=</span> <span>'911.csv'</span>
    In [<span>0</span>]:
    folder <span>=</span> <span>'cayenne'</span>
    <span>file</span> <span>=</span> <span>'cayenne.csv'</span>
    In [<span>0</span>]:

    folder <span>=</span> <span>'panamera'</span>
    <span>file</span> <span>=</span> <span>'panamera.csv'</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You will need to run this cell once per each category.</p>

<p>Finally, upload your urls file. You just need to press ‘Upload’ in your working directory and select your file, then click ‘Upload’ for each of the displayed files.</p>

<p><code>uploaded file</code></p>

<h3 id="download-images">Download images</h3>

<p>Now you will need to download your images from their respective urls.</p>

<p>fast.ai has a function that allows you to do just that. You just have to specify the urls filename as well as the destination folder and this function will download and save all images that can be opened. If they have some problem in being opened, they will not be saved.</p>

<p>Let’s download our images! Notice you can choose a maximum number of images to be downloaded. In this case we will not download all the urls.</p>

<p>You will need to run this line once for every category.</p>

Some of our top losses aren<span>'t due to bad performance by our model. There are images in our data set that shouldn'</span>t be<span>.</span>

Using the ImageCleaner widget <span>from</span> fastai.widgets we can prune our top losses, removing photos that don<span>'t belong.</span>

<span>```</span>

<span>In [0]:</span>
<span>from fastai.widgets import \*</span>

<span>```</span>
<span>First we need to get the file paths from our top_losses. We can do this with .from_toplosses. We then feed the top losses indexes and corresponding dataset to ImageCleaner.</span>

<span>Notice that the widget will not delete images directly from disk but it will create a new csv file cleaned.csv from where you can create a new ImageDataBunch with the corrected labels to continue training your model.</span>
<span>```</span>

<span>In [0]:</span>
<span>db = (ImageList.from_folder(path)</span>
<span>.split_none()</span>
<span>.label_from_folder()</span>
<span>.transform(get_transforms(), size=224)</span>
<span>.databunch()</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>In [0]:</span>

<span># If you already cleaned your data using indexes from `from_toplosses`,</span>

<span># run this cell instead of the one before to proceed with removing duplicates.</span>

<span># Otherwise all the results of the previous step would be overwritten by</span>

<span># the new run of `ImageCleaner`.</span>

<span>db = (ImageList.from_csv(path, '</span>cleaned<span>.</span>csv<span>', folder='</span><span>.</span><span>')</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>Setting up unicode math and <code>orgmode</code> for painless Anki deck building</p></blockquote><h2 id="background">Background</h2><p>A recent <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24878171">Hacker News post</a> reminded me of <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/getting-started">Anki</a>, and that brought back memories of
my Anki <code>orgmode</code> setup. I thought I’d re-create and immortalize it.</p><p>The standard way of working with Anki, is with a pretty awkward GUI. There are
changes to be made here, which make life a little easier, including the setup of
custom cards, but the inherent concerns of the WYSIWYG editor are basically
insurmountable.</p><figure><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/68485cf6f823570638998b339d289abd560a2ab7/5f026/ox-hugo/2020-10-27_00-13-31_screenshot.png" alt="Figure 1: Anki GUI"><figcaption><p>Figure 1: Anki GUI</p></figcaption></figure><p>The goal is to get this a better workflow than manual editing of Anki decks.
<code>orgmode</code> is perfect for making cards, especially in the larger context of using
it for storing images and rich <code>pdfs</code>.</p><figure><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f5af670548a89a7dfd69002c5529aeeda9d101fb/3e4f8/ox-hugo/2020-10-26_23-53-05_screenshot.png" alt="Figure 2: A pleasant way to make anki decks"><figcaption><p>Figure 2: A pleasant way to make anki decks</p></figcaption></figure><h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2><p>To accomplish this, we basically need to have the following:</p><dl><dt><a href="https://github.com/louietan/anki-editor">anki-editor</a></dt><dd>This <code>emacs</code> plugin will facilitate the conversion from our <code>orgmode</code> files to the Anki markup</dd><dt><a href="https://github.com/FooSoft/anki-connect">anki-connect</a></dt><dd>We need a server of sorts set up to allow us to push pull and get errors from the running Anki server, this is an Anki plugin</dd><dt><a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/937148547">LaTeX process editor</a></dt><dd>It wouldn’t be much better than manually making cards in Anki if we couldn’t leverage <code>unicode</code> characters, so we need to modify the internal Anki build process for TeX</dd></dl><h3 id="anki-editor">Anki Editor</h3><p>As with all <code>emacs</code> related setup snippets on this site, these should be modified and adapted as needed, especially for those not using <a href="https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/">doom-emacs</a>.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp"><span>(</span><span>use-package</span> <span>anki-editor</span>

<p><em>“Yeah… here’s the thing - I don’t want people to log into my software.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Wait, what?”</em></p>
<p>This was one of the earliest conversations with our investors - almost 3 years ago.</p>
<p>It was an interesting way to start our first investor meeting (our investors would probably describe it as "harrowing").</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.saleswhale.com/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-10-26%20at%2012.18.01%20AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-10-26 at 12.18.01 AM"><span><em>Saleswhale's KPI sheet for investors</em></span></p>
<h2>Thumbing our noses at conventional wisdom</h2>
<p>The prevailing wisdom at the time was the consumerization of SaaS.</p>
<p>The most successful SaaS companies focused on usage - daily active users (DAUs), weekly active users (WAUs), monthly active users (MAUs). Similar to consumer companies.</p>
<p>The poster boys of the "consumerization of the enterprise"-era were Slack, Asana, Zendesk, Trello.</p>
<p>I had other ideas though.</p>
<p>Workflow products were the winning playbook of the previous 5-10 years.</p>
<p>My thesis was that in the next 5-10 years, the next generation of winning SaaS products would be what we call "anti-usage" products.</p>
<p>Products focused on solving a problem and driving outcomes, without requiring users to log in everyday.</p>
<p>This sounds counterintuitive - and I had to spend some time to convince my co-founders and investors in the early days.</p>
<p>Here’s the thought process that led me to the above conclusion.</p>
<h2>The evolution of SaaS products</h2>
<p><strong>First generation of SaaS products</strong></p>
<p>The first generation of cloud-based SaaS products were designed to replace manual systems like spreadsheets (and pen &amp; paper), or clunky, on-premise, client-server products.</p>
<p>Most of them were "<a href="https://venturebeat.com/2016/03/19/how-to-create-a-billion-dollar-saas-company-build-a-system-of-record/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">systems of record</a>" - the ultimate source and "record" of critical business data. And usually, the backbone of business processes.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your general ledger is stored in Quickbooks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your customer data is stored in Salesforce</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your payroll information is stored in Workday</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The main outcome of a system of record is to generate reports / insight.</p>
<p><strong>Second generation of SaaS products</strong></p>
<p>The second generation of SaaS products deal with workflows.</p>
<p>They are task-specific tools that help employees do their jobs — aka. systems of engagement. Most of them integrate with the above mentioned "system of records".</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your customer support agents live in Zendesk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your sales development reps and account executives live in Outreach or SalesLoft</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your digital marketing team lives in Mailchimp, HubSpot or Marketo</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your employees use Slack for high-resolution internal communications</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The second-generation SaaS vendors understood that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/16/from-its-beginnings-in-a-denmark-loft-zendesks-steady-rise-to-the-top-of-the-helpdesk-heap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UI and UX were important for workflow products</a>, because people live in it.</p>
<p><em>"'Help desk software didn’t sound that exciting and I had no domain knowledge. I was a canary in a coal mine, but I was obsessive about clean design, and as I saw what existed I realized that companies were being underserved,' says Aghassipour. </em></p>
<p><em>Aghassipour saw the opportunity to create something beautiful in a world where design was an afterthought. Aghassipour told Svane that he would help keep the software 'beautifully simple'."</em></p>
<p>The insertion point: build a simpler, easier to use product, and displace legacy workflow vendors.</p>
<p>This was the consumerization of the enterprise wave - which minted many hundred million ARR companies like Zendesk, Slack and Asana.</p>
<p><strong>Red ocean for systems of record and workflow products</strong></p>
<p>The first and second-generation of SaaS products have one thing in common: they are built on top of human interaction. They essentially replace processes that are previously built on top of paper forms.</p>
<p>People have to key in data, or actively use the software to get to their desired outcome.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing -</p>
<p>The market is quickly <a href="https://chiefmartec.com/2020/04/marketing-technology-landscape-2020-martech-5000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting saturated</a> with systems of records and workflow products.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.saleswhale.com/hubfs/martech-landscape-2020-martech5000-slide%20(1).jpg" alt="martech-landscape-2020-martech5000-slide (1)">There are only so many tools that a company wants to standardize on. Only so many disparate systems an employee wants to log into daily.</p>
<p>So, if you are a new horizontal workflow provider - sooner or later, you will have to displace incumbents. Or try to build an end-to-end vertical solution. Or re-segment your market.</p>
<p>However -</p>
<p>If you believe the "<a href="https://bothsidesofthetable.com/your-product-needs-to-be-10x-better-than-the-competition-to-win-here-s-why-6168bab60de7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10X theory of displacement</a>", you will agree that it’s getting harder and harder to build a 10X better product.</p>
<p>Zendesk was able to build a 10X better product than legacy help desk vendors by ruthlessly focusing on UI /UX.</p>
<p>It’s not going to be trivial to invent a help desk product that’s 10X better than Zendesk (essentially 100X better than the original legacy vendors).</p>
<p>UI/UX is becoming table-stakes — it’s not much of a differentiator anymore.</p>
<p>If you want to build a huge SaaS business, like how Salesforce and Zendesk did, you can’t use the same playbook that they used.</p>
<h2>Next Generation of SaaS products</h2>
<p>The next generation of SaaS products are going to be more disruptive.</p>
<p>Instead of providing an interface for human employees to do their work, they seek to reinvent how work is done.</p>
<p>They sit in the background, collect and analyze data, and then shepherd their users towards better outcomes.</p>
<p>For example, revenue intelligence tool Gong sits in the background - and records, transcribes and analyzes sales calls.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.saleswhale.com/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-10-28%20at%208.08.34%20PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-10-28 at 8.08.34 PM">Gong helps sales teams get automated insights to help them close more deals. Competitor mentions, coaching based on high-performing behavior, and suggested next steps.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.saleswhale.com/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-10-28%20at%208.01.13%20PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-10-28 at 8.01.13 PM"></p>
<p>Other than setup and occasional maintenance, these products don’t need human interaction/ intervention along their value chain to get to an outcome.</p>
<p>The next generation of SaaS products unilaterally "finds the insights", and “takes the action” on behalf of users.</p>
<p>I call these software "anti-usage products".</p>
<p><strong>A new paradigm for B2B software</strong></p>
<p>In this paradigm, the software becomes the "expert". The user trusts the software to work (mostly) autonomously.</p>
<p>Anti-usage products do not need you to use the product actively.</p>
<p>Because the products understand the problem, and have expert-level domain expertise to propose / run a solution.</p>
<p><u>This requires the product teams who are building the anti-usage product to have a deep and nuanced understanding of the problem to be solved.</u></p>
<p>Anti-usage products are able to work completely autonomously, and yet, are able to deliver outcomes.</p>
<p>Autonomous + Delivering Outcomes = Anti-usage products.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.saleswhale.com/hubfs/workflow-1@1x%20(1).png" alt="workflow-1@1x (1)">In 5 to 10 years, it’s highly likely that the next wave of billion dollar SaaS companies would be "anti-usage" products.</p>
<p>Here are more examples of up-and-coming "anti-usage" SaaS companies: Zapier, Workato, Tray.io, Metadata.io, People.ai, Segment, and Saleswhale.</p>
<p>Segment just had a 3.2B outcome - <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/twilios-3-2b-segment-acquisition-about-helping-developers-build-data-fueled-apps/">https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/twilios-3-2b-segment-acquisition-about-helping-developers-build-data-fueled-apps/</a><u></u></p>
<p><strong>On Metrics (closing the loop on active users)</strong></p>
<p>Josh Elman said that the only metric that matters is how many people are using the product - <a href="https://news.greylock.com/the-only-metric-that-matters-now-with-fancy-slides-232474cf414c">https://news.greylock.com/the-only-metric-that-matters-now-with-fancy-slides-232474cf414c</a><u></u></p>
<p>This is an old paradigm from 2010 - 2019.</p>
<p>It presupposes that if users keep logging in, and performing a certain action, then they are gaining something of value from the product.</p>
<p>However, we wanted to break this paradigm.</p>
<p>The paradigm of retention = product engagement.</p>
<p>You see -</p>
<p>When a product is able to work fully autonomously, and yet, able to deliver outcomes, user engagement is an <em>anti-pattern</em>.</p>
<p>It’s not something that we want to optimize for.</p>
<p>On the contrary, I tell my product team: if our users are logging in <em>too often</em>, it means that our software isn’t autonomous enough, and we have to work harder to sand down the product.</p>
<p>This is counterintuitive, and requires a leap of faith.</p>
<p>But internalizing this logic helps us to build a better product. A product that is laser focused on solving our customers’ problems, and not faux-engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Choosing the right compass metric for anti-usage products</strong></p>
<p>Wait. Where were we? Right. Metrics.</p>
<p>All the above being said, you can’t drive a business without metrics. We still needed a compass metric to approximate the actual outcome we are driving for our users.</p>
<p>So, what did we decide on?</p>
<p><em>The number of qualified sales meetings we deliver for our customers per week.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://blog.saleswhale.com/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-10-28%20at%209.26.25%20PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-10-28 at 9.26.25 PM">Every product decision is filtered through this lens.</p>
<p>From building high-performing messaging suggestions, to auto-segmentation, to auto re-engagement, we ask ourselves: does this feature help our users get more qualified leads autonomously?</p>
<p>And not,<em> "how can we trick our users to log in more often.. so we can stay top-of-mind and justify their purchase."</em></p>
<p>An example of how far we are willing to go in pursuit of this tenet: using <a href="https://blog.saleswhale.com/anti-usage-products-email-as-an-extension-of-product-interface" rel="noopener" target="_blank">emails as an extension of our product interface</a>, to make sure that our users log in as little as possible.</p>
<p>Ultimately, for anti-usage products like Saleswhale, the only thing that matters is the outcome.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Of course, it’s not all roses and rainbows. The "anti-usage" paradigm does <a href="https://blog.saleswhale.com/anti-usage-products-on-pitfalls" rel="noopener" target="_blank">come with some pitfalls</a> which traditional SaaS products do not have.</p>
<p>In spite of these pitfalls however, anti-usage products are here to stay.</p>
<p>In the next 10 years, more and more SaaS products will:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Run in the background, collecting and analyzing data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not require active user input to deliver value</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimize for outcome metrics over engagement metrics</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Anti-usage products are the herald to a "log in optional" future.</p></span>

    <article>

        

        <section>
            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h4 id="preface">Preface</h4>
<p>This post is a bundle of thoughts on the near future of Augmented Reality implementations, ways of integration, and introducing new layers of cognition. We are going to talk about AR as a way of enabling transhumanism by broadening the human cognitive and sensory toolbox.<br>
We are not going to be concerned with what is and what is not technologically possible at the moment.</p>
<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>Have you ever taken a walk and thought about all the accessible information on animals, plants, objects, or even people? How much information is available on the internet? How many facts have you encountered and already forgotten?</p>
<p>Ancient Greeks put an active effort into training and maintaining their memorizing capabilities, and already at this stage of progress, human memory is shifting – or has shifted from remembering facts to remembering how and where to find facts. We are keeping less and less information hardcoded in our permanent memory and are in turn learning how to<br>
consume, process, and find useful data in an endless stream of information and misinformation.</p>
<p>A technologically proficient user has access to a vast volume and spectrum of data at his/her disposal, sitting right in the pocket. The human approach to holding knowledge is evolving as we speak. Heck, it started evolving with the invention of speech. But another significant<br>
change is on the cusp of happening. Our mobile phone interfaces, while serving all the information we need, are still detached from us, having considerable latency when we need to find, show, or input data. With the introduction of AR, AI, and human-computer interfaces, everything is about to change. AR or human augmentation in general will make that data<br>
more accessible and drastically lessen the latency needed for the interaction, making the tools feel more and more as part of ourselves.</p>
<p>Imagine walking down the street. You look around to observe people on the street and notifications start popping up alongside people’s heads. For one person the message says:<br>
"You have seen this person three times this week already"; for another one it states:<br>
"You have five mutual connections and common interests".<br>
Those notifications could also tell you if the person is willing to make new connections, based on previously shared data or facial microexpression analysis. Maybe we have gone too far down the rabbit hole for now, but you<br>
get the idea.</p>
<h3 id="definingarandtranshumanism">Defining AR and Transhumanism</h3>
<p>Merriam-Webster defines Augmented Reality as "an enhanced version of reality created by the use of technology to overlay digital information on an image of something being viewed through a device (such as a smartphone camera)". For the purposes of this post, I would like us not to limit reality to human vision alone.</p>
<p>Merriam-Webster has no definition for Transhumanism, but Wikipedia defines it as a philosophical movement that advocates for the transformation of the human condition by developing and making widely available sophisticated technologies to greatly enhance human intellect and physiology.</p>
<p>The two are getting more and more intertwined as technology advances, so I would like us to redefine AR, if only for this post, as "any technology that enhances or expands the human experience of reality", or maybe even as "practical transhumanism".</p>
<h3 id="augmentationtechnologymilestones">Augmentation technology milestones</h3>
<p>These are some freely set milestones for AR technology.</p>
<ul>
<li>LVL 0 – environment emulation via VR – for developmental fast-tracking</li>
<li>LVL 1 – external IO devices – headsets, glasses, gloves</li>
<li>LVL 2 – embedded IO devices – lenses, external neural signal readers</li>
<li>LVL 3 – tapping into existing sensory and neural networks</li>
<li>LVL 4 – registering new input/output devices in neural networks</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="degreesofaugmentation">Degrees of augmentation</h3>
<p>For the time being, and at least until we master the LVL 4 milestone described above, we are not creating new sensory or actuation systems, we are only hijacking the existing ones. Hi, Neuralink ;). This means that with every bit of information we gain, we are blocking the bandwidth and use for our existing IO mechanisms.In all fairness, people recovering mobility after a severe head trauma are evidence that the brain could possess enough plasticity to use whatever is thrown at it, given we connect the right dots, have enough time and practice. User age could also be a part of the equation.<br>
Sounds easier than it is, I know.</p>
<p>So, the more we augment our existing senses, the more we obstruct our basic physical-world data flow, the need to set some design restriction guidelines will grow. We still have accidents while using mobile phones or headphones, so the question arises: how could we manage a society full of people that overlap and fully cover their field of vision and hearing?<br>
Some safety rules integrated into the tech would be quite handy. Here is an example of defining degrees of augmentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>No augmentation</li>
<li>Info - can be an overlay, but should not block much sensory bandwidth</li>
<li>Safe communication – headset equivalent</li>
<li>Immersive experience – not safe for driving, safe for outdoors</li>
<li>Fully overlaying sensory input with enabled alerts – public safe zones</li>
<li>Fully overlaying sensory input – only for safe zones at home</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="augmentationusagecategories">Augmentation usage categories</h3>
<h4 id="knowledgemanagement">Knowledge management</h4>
<p>At some point, AR should enable access to data from the internet, which should be retrieved and presented without too much user effort, based on surrounding situations and context. Also, the useful data should be categorized and stored for retrieval at a later time.<br>
The interface should be able to combine relevant data and present solutions, statistics, and probabilities.</p>
<p>This could also enable saving verifiable event recordings, snapshots, and transcripts, real-time language translation, or seeing blueprints and instructions while fixing devices.</p>
<h4 id="extendingsensoryreach">Extending sensory reach</h4>
<p>The human sensory reach is already drastically extended with the use of IoT and the internet in general, but there is so much more of existing tech to be integrated into an AR system to extend human senses. Users could see and feel if their home or possessions are safe, or more generally, sense physical-world information streams in real-time.<br>
For example, physical-world data can be processed in parallel with the user experiencing the immediate surroundings. Thus, the user would, for instance, return home and detect certain objects have been moved, etc.</p>
<h4 id="extendingphysicalactuationactionreach">Extending physical actuation/action reach</h4>
<p>Besides our physical reach, most of us have already experienced controlling or affecting the physical-world at a distance. AR could help make the world around us feel more like an extension of our physical bodies.<br>
We could run automated processes upon visual triggers, i.e. unlock the front door without thinking, or control devices, drones, and robotics with ease.</p>
<h4 id="communicationandindividuality">Communication and individuality</h4>
<p>Communication could also be streamlined. We could have an instant connection with anyone around the world, almost as if standing side by side. Communication could play out on several levels, depending on the level of technological advancement, and could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restrained – messages and recordings with a delay and opportunity for curation</li>
<li>Unrestrained – conservative – real-time audio-visual communication</li>
<li>Unrestrained – progressive – direct thought transfer in a Neuralink-like brain-computer interface manner</li>
</ul>
<p>We could socialize, play games, or work like never before:<br>
imagine coding while sharing your thought process with a colleague, and also having an "AI" assisted IDE.</p>
<h4 id="extendingthecognitiontoolbox">Extending the cognition toolbox</h4>
<p>Given having a portable AR system and a smart enough underlying OS that replicates our surroundings and anticipates our needs OR an efficient enough way of selecting and using computational tools, we could:</p>
<ul>
<li>see object trajectories</li>
<li>have perfect math at our disposal</li>
<li>know objects, plant life, animals, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>AI or General AI could, if available, also be used as an intermediary to the available cognition toolbox, to serve the necessary tools and results to the end-user.</p>
<h4 id="pastimeandentertainment">Pastime and entertainment</h4>
<p>I won’t go into great detail here, VR games are already immersive and fun, but try to imagine what they would be like if some freedom is added to the mix. As games and entertainment are presumably most likely to require as much immersion as possible, it will be necessary to consider immersion safety.</p>
<h5 id="vrgamesandapsfullyoverlayingsensoryinput">VR games and APS - fully overlaying sensory input</h5>
<p>Cars, stairs, sudden drops, and obstacles are here to stay, so for any device that can write over your sensory input, a way to risk mitigation must be in place.</p>
<h5 id="endusersafetyzonecalibration">End user safety zone calibration</h5>
<p>Imagine you want to play a full-on VR game somewhere. How could you stay safe and not trip over something or fall over some curb? It is simple, you could just walk around your playground to define its contours and limits. A certain amount of space can even be taken out of the outer limits of the playground, any obstacles are reproduced in-game so you can navigate past them. You start the game and play, and in case you move to the outer limits, the game simply starts to fade away.</p>
<h5 id="safesurfaces">Safe surfaces</h5>
<p>OK, but where else could you use 100% augmentation opacity in the real world? The first thing that comes to mind as safe would be walls.

<p>If you’re procrastinating on filling out your mail-in ballot or dreading the thought of donning a mask to head to the polls, one national nonprofit might have a solution: free insults, delivered via text message, every day until you vote.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.insultbot.org/" target="_blank">insult bot</a>, a product of <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/" target="_blank">Fight For the Future</a>, a nonpartisan group that advocates for digital rights, launched Wednesday, a mere six days before the Nov. 3 general election. It’s meant specifically as an aggressive last-minute push for procrastinators with a sense of humor who will appreciate—and hopefully be motivated by—a little sarcasm mixed in with frequent reminders to <em>get up and vote already</em>.</p><p>“We wanted to do something that would stand out a bit,” said Caitlin Seeley George, the organization’s campaigns director. “There might be some people out there who really do need this kind of constant, poking reminder to make sure they vote, and we thought that, especially for young people, if we added in some humor and some snark, we might reach them in a different way.”</p><p>The service, free other than standard data and messaging rates, sends periodic texts that “will increase in intensity and aggression through Election Day, until the recipient confirms that they’ve voted," according to a news release. The texts encourage voting in general and do not endorse specific policies or candidates, and their content ranges from name-calling to mild profanity, all peppered with basic voting information (how to look up your local polling place, for example).&nbsp;</p><p>“We’re sending multiple messages per day and trying to splice in some information, but otherwise, it’s a lot of humor,” Seeley George said. “There’s a little bit of cursing, so this is definitely not for people who are uncomfortable with that. We call people lazy, we call them lazy garbage. We call them sea cucumbers.”</p><p>The group, she added, has no specific beef with sea cucumbers.</p><p>“We all love a good sea cucumber,” she said. “But, you know, they’re also slow and lazy.”</p><figure><img alt="" height="800" src="https://www.route-fifty.com/media/ckeditor-uploads/2020/10/28/shutterstock_1307844247.jpg" width="1200">
<figcaption>A sea cucumber, not voting (Shutterstock)</figcaption>
</figure><p>If a recipient never responds or unsubscribes from the messages, the bot will follow up after Election Day to confirm whether they voted. The goal is to increase participation in the election, even if it’s just by a few voters—because sometimes, that’s all it takes to tip a race, Seeley George said.&nbsp;</p><p>“We know that some elections are determined by a handful of votes, so we think it’s worth it if we can get any additional people,” she said. “Our hope is that this catches people’s attention, and a lot of people sign up and share with their friends.”<svg>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div> <p><i>Posted on October 28, 2020</i></p><p>This article isn't about which programming language is better, instead it discusses the most powerful tool set for development of the fastest server-side system software, such as database engines and HTTPS servers. There are several specific properties of this type of software: </p><ul><li>Relatively large code base, 100,000 lines of C or C++ code and more. While it's possible to write particular, the most 'hot' functions, in Assembly language, it's impractical to write the whole program in Assembly. </li><li>Databases and web servers are mission-critical software - we all got used that our Linux systems with MySQL and Nginx processes work for months and years. There are <a href="https://github.com/tempesta-tech/tempesta/wiki/High-availability">simple high availability</a> best practices mitigating the downtime due to possible crashes, but they're the subject for another article. Meantime, it's worth mentioning that if you really-really care about high availability, then you should build you infrastructure with an assumption that any component of your system may crash at any time, just like <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/801871/">Facebook does this</a> -the company deploys the recent versions of the Linux kernel as soon as they're available. </li></ul><p>We've been developing the <a href="http://tempesta-tech.com/c++-services">fastest software in C, C++, and Assembly</a> for ages. It's not a surprise that since Rust is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)">"focused on performance"</a> we're very interested in it. With a bit of skepticism though. Just remember the rise of Java programming language: there were a lot of reports that the JIT compilation produced code faster than C++. Now it's hard to find a case, when C++ is slower than Java, see for example the <a href="https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/java.html">benchmark game</a>. It's also worth mentioning that the memory garbage collection (GC) in Java leads to high tail latencies and it's hard or even impossible to do anything with the problem. Golang can not be considered for high performance programming also due to the GC. </p><h2>C or C++? Or both of them?</h2><p> The C programming language dominates in the system programming. An operating system kernel is an example of one of the most sophisticated system software, not only because it deals with hardware directly, but also due to strict performance requirements. The Linux and FreeBSD kernels are written in C, as well as the other UNIX'es and Windows kernels. Let's start the discussion from this bright example of high-performance system software. </p><h3>C++ for operating systems kernel development</h3><p> FreeBSD <a href="https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/driver-building-in-c.35701/">has been supporting C++ modules</a> for a while. While the Linux kernel never supported C++, there was <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/click:tocs00/paper.pdf">the Click modular router</a> written in C++ and working as a Linux kernel module. If you're interested in C++ applicability for the operating systems kernel development, then you can find quite good discussions in the <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/C++">C++</a> and <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/C++_Bare_Bones">Bare bones</a> articles. However, there are fundamental reasons against using C++ for operating system kernel development: </p><ul><li>You do not have <code>libstdc++</code> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-time_type_information">RTTI</a> and exceptions in the kernel space. Actually, <code>dynamic_cast</code> isn't so frequently used and there are a lot of C++ projects compiled without RTTI. If you need exceptions, then you have to port them into the kernel. <code>libstdc++</code> uses basic C allocations, so it must be significantly reworked for the kernel. </li><li>You can't use the STL and Boost libraries and, in fact, all kernels already have their own libraries. C++ introduces filesystem, threading and networking libraries, which are senseless in an OS kernel. From the other hand, the modern OSes provide advanced synchronization primitives, which are still not available in standard C++ (e.g. there is still no read-write spinlocks in C++). </li><li>The Linux kernel provides number of memory allocators (SLAB, page, <code>vmalloc()</code>, <code>kmalloc()</code>, and so on), thus you have to use <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/new"><code>placement new</code></a> and/or just use the C functions for memory allocation and freeing. Aligned memory is crucial for the performance, but you need to write special wrappers to get aligned memory with <code>new</code>. </li><li>Strong type safety isn't so comfortable for system programming when raw memory pointers are frequently casted to some data structures. This is debatable though: while some people are uncomfortable with frequent <code>reinterpret_cast&lt;Foo *&gt;(ptr)</code> instead of short <code>(Foo *)ptr</code>, the others are good with more typing and more type safety. </li><li>C++ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_mangling">name mangling</a>, required for namespaces and function overloading, makes function hard to call from Assembly, so you need to use <code>extern "C"</code>. </li><li>You have to make special code sections for static objects constructors and destructors, <code>.ctor</code> and <code>.dtor</code> correspondingly. </li><li>C++ exceptions can not cross <i>context</i> boundaries, i.e. you can not throw an exception in one thread and catch it in another. The operating system kernel deals with much more complex context model: there are kernel threads, user space processes entering into the kernel, deferred and hardware interruptions. The contexts can preempt each other in voluntarily or cooperative manner, so exception handling of current context could be preempted by another context. There are also memory management and contexts switching code which could conflict with exception handling code. Just like for RTTI, it's possible to implement the mechanism in kernel, but the current standard library can not be used. </li><li>While Clang and G++ support <code>__restrict__</code> extension, the official C++ standard <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-doesnt-C++-have-an-equivalent-of-Cs-restrict-specifier">does not support</a> it. </li><li>Variable length arrays (VLA) are <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/749064/">discouraged</a> in the Linux kernel, they are still handy in some scenarios, but are <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/comp.std.c++/c/K_4lgA1JYeg?pli=1">completely unavailable in C++</a>. </li></ul><p> Thus, with C++ in the kernel space you basically have only templates, classes inheritance and some syntax sugar like lambda functions. Since system code is quite rarely requires complicated abstractions and inheritances, then does it still have sense to make effort to use C++ in the kernel space? </p><h3>C++ exceptions</h3><p> This is one of the most <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2010/03/13/trip-report-march-2010-iso-c-standards-meeting/">debatable</a> C++ feature and it deserves a separate chapter. For example, the MySQL project, following to the <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Exceptions">Google coding style</a>, <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/dev/mysql-server/latest/PAGE_CODING_GUIDELINES.html">doesn't use exceptions</a>. The Google coding style provides the good lists of pros and cons of using exceptions. Here we focus on performance aspects only. </p><p>Exceptions can improve performance when we have to handle error codes in too may places, e.g. (let the functions be inlined and very small) </p><pre><code>
        if (func_1())
            return -EINVAL;
        if (func_2())
            return -EINVAL;
        ....
        if (func_100())
            return -EINVAL;
    </code></pre><p> The problem with the code is that there are extra conditional jumps. Modern CPU are pretty good with branch prediction, but it still hurts performance. In C++ we can just write </p><pre><code>
        try {
            func_1();
            func_2();
            ...
            func_100();
        } catch (...) {
            return -EINVAL;
        }
    </code></pre><p> , so there are no extra conditions in the <i>hot</i> path. However, this isn't for free: most of the functions in your C++ code have to have extra epilogues with a table of exceptions, which these functions can catch, and an appropriate cleanup table. The function epilogues aren't executed in normal workflow, but they increase the size of code causing extra pollution in the CPU instruction cache. You can find great details about C++ exception handling internals in the <a href="https://monoinfinito.wordpress.com/series/exception-handling-in-c/">Nico Brailovsky's blog</a>. </p><h3>Is C++ still good?</h3><p> Yes, it is. Firstly, not the whole code actually must be as fast as possible and in most of the places we don't need custom memory allocation and don't care about exceptions overhead. The most of the projects are developed in the user space and benefit, especially the new ones, from relatively rich C++ standard and Boost libraries (not so rich as Java's though). </p><p>Secondly, the killing feature of C++ is that <b>it is C</b>. If you don't want to use exceptions or RTTI, then you can just switch the features off. Most of C programs can be just compiled with a C++ compiler with very small changes or without any changes at all. As an example, we need only this trivial change </p><pre><code>
    $ diff -up nbody.c nbody-new.cc
        @@ -112,9 +112,9 @@ static void advance(body bodies[]){
             // ROUNDED_INTERACTIONS_COUNT elements to simplify one of the following
             // loops and to also keep the second and third arrays in position_Deltas
             // aligned properly.
        -    static alignas(__m128d) double
        -      position_Deltas[3][ROUNDED_INTERACTIONS_COUNT],
        -      magnitudes[ROUNDED_INTERACTIONS_COUNT];
        +    static double
        +      position_Deltas[3][ROUNDED_INTERACTIONS_COUNT] __attribute__((aligned(16))),
        +      magnitudes[ROUNDED_INTERACTIONS_COUNT] __attribute__((aligned(16)));

             // Calculate the position_Deltas between the bodies for each interaction.
             for(intnative_t i=0, k=0; i &lt; BODIES_COUNT-1; ++i)
    </code></pre><p> to compile <a href="https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/program/nbody-clang-8.html">the C program</a> with G++ compiler. The modern C++ compilers provide C compatibility extensions like the <code>__restrict__</code> keyword. You always can write the most performance critical code of a C++ program in C style. If you don't like the <a href="https://250bpm.com/blog:8/">STL containers with an overhead</a>, then you can use <a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_74_0/doc/html/intrusive.html">Boost.intrusive</a> or even port a similar container from the Linux kernel or other fast C project -in most of the cases this won't be painful. See for example how a hash table from PostgreSQL, HTrie from <a href="https://github.com/tempesta-tech/tempesta/tree/master/tempesta_db">Tempesta DB</a>, and the Linux kernel read/write spinlocks (all are written in C) were used in a C++ <a href="https://github.com/tempesta-tech/blog/tree/master/htrie">benchmark</a>. </p><p>The last thing which must be mentioned about development of high performance programs in C++ is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_metaprogramming">template metaprogramming</a>. It's very exciting about the modern C++ standards that using templates you can write quite sophisticated logic which is fully computed in the compile time and costs nothing in the run time. </p><h2>GOTO - the power of C</h2> <p><b>A professional tool must allow you to work with it in the most efficient way.</b> The goal of the high-level and high-performance programming languages is to generate the most efficient machine code. Each hardware architecture supports <i>jumps</i>, which means that you can jump to any address by any condition. The closest abstraction for the jumps in the C and C++ programming languages is <code>goto</code> operator. It's not so flexible …</p></div></div></div>

<p>Pittsburgh, PA — This has been a painful journey. After years of impotent performance and correctness checks in the <a href="https://pelotondb.io/">Peloton</a> database project, we found ourselves in a morass of despair and unmaintainable system code. Previous attempts to rectify the many issues with the system proved to be feckless, even with the most brilliant database students and engineers. Rather than continue on with the desiccated husk of a system on life support, we decided to sacrifice our beloved DBMS on the altar of the database gods and start over. It does not help that a certain bike company was able to capture distilled misogyny in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/03/business/peloton-bike-ad-stock.html">30 second commercial</a> and thus forever ruining a good name for a DBMS.</p>
<p>Two years have passed since then. We now find ourselves in a new world plagued by a pestilence that feeds on imbecilic apathy and stupidity. Despite this setback, we have persevered and continue forward with our research fueled by our unwavering desire to pursue science. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://db.cs.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon Database Group</a> is pleased to announce the first page of the <b>NoisePage</b> database management system. This release is still experimental code and thus should <u>not</u> be used in production environments.</p>
<p>There is currently <u>no</u> support for self-driving operations in this release; it does contain the offline <a href="https://github.com/cmu-db/noisepage/tree/master/benchmark/runner">training data collection framework</a> that is needed to train the DBMS’s internal <i>operating unit</i> models.</p>

		<p><b><span size="+1">Introduction</span></b></p>
		<p>It is now 2018, and I really need to rewrite the introduction to this page. I'm currently looking to reduce my reliance at home on vintage hardware, and to lower my electricity bill. I've started using SIMH/VAX heavily, and would love an Alpha emulator for the Apps that I can't move over to SIMH/VAX. Plus from what I'm seeing, current Intel-based systems can emulate an Alpha-Based system faster than the fastest Alpha.</p>
		<p>At this point I don't know why anyone would want to emulate an Alpha.  If you are a hobbyist looking to run OpenVMS, take a look at the <a href="http://www.avanthar.com/healyzh/decemulation/vax.html">VAX</a> emulation available, or buy an inexpensive used Alpha.  Having said this I've been watching the ES40 emulator with great interest as at some point this will no longer be true, and at this point it is the emulator with the greatest promise for Hobbyists.</p>
		<p>If you are a commercial user I would seriously recommend looking at an upgrade to Itanium if your applications will run there.  If not I would recommend looking at one of the newer models of Alpha that are still available.  </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>At Human Jobs, we are obsessed with building skills. Not only is continual learning a key driver for career success, it can also be a source of enormous intellectual satisfaction. There are so many quality resources available online, but today we start with our top 5 online courses for building job skills. They cover a variety of subjects, but all are well-taught and will deliver tangible skills you can use in the real world.</p>
<h4>1. <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-tll-005-how-to-speak-january-iap-2018/index.htm"><em>How to Speak</em> </a>from MIT</h4>
<p>This is a legendary course from MIT focused on public speaking skills for job interviews, lectures, and much more. The professor, Patrick Winston is a charismatic speaker himself – I mean, he ought to be if he is teaching the course. Although geared toward an MIT audience, it is packed with useful tips for people of any educational background.</p>
<p>This “course” is technically just one video, so if you don’t have much free time, an hour with Patrick Winston is an hour well-spent. In his own words: “By the end of the next 60 minutes you will have been exposed to a lot of ideas, some of which you will incorporate into your own repertoire, and they will ensure that you get the maximum opportunity to have your ideas valued and accepted by the people you speak with.” The lectures is freely available on MIT Open Courseware.</p>
<p>Don’t go into another job interview without watching <em>How to Speak </em>first.&nbsp;Check it out <strong><a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-tll-005-how-to-speak-january-iap-2018/index.htm">here.</a></strong></p>
<h4>2. <a href="https://www.startupschool.org/"><em>Startup School</em></a> from Y Combinator</h4>
<p>If you are thinking of starting a business, <em>Startup School</em> from Y Combinator (YC) will give you the skills and frameworks for evaluating and growing your idea. YC is the top startup accelerator in the US, which means they know what it takes for a clever idea to become a successful business.</p>
<p><em>Startup School</em> is a great introduction to entrepreneurship, and business more generally, because it forces you to think critically about why some startups succeed and others fail. For people with little background in this area, the lectures are very accessible, use little jargon, and are a great entry-point into the space. The lecturers are really candid, and I found it very refreshing for some frank and pointed views on the startup world.</p>
<p><em>Startup School</em> is free, so check it out <a href="https://www.startupschool.org/"><strong>here.</strong></a></p>
<h4>3. <a href="https://justiceharvard.org/"><em>Justice</em></a> from Harvard</h4>
<p>Michael Sandel is the professor who turns probing moral inquiry into a thrill-ride. <em>Justice</em> offers a whistle-stop tour of different ethical and moral philosophies ranging from the ancients to contemporary philosophers. The course is honestly addictive and always spurred vigorous debate between me ad my friends while watching.</p>
<p>Sandel is a champion of the Socratic method, and his questioning models the kind of critical thought that is so celebrated by humanities students. If sharpening your reasoning skills isn’t enough, then take <em>Justice</em> to challenge your own moral and ethical convictions. Whether you are targeting writing jobs, tutoring jobs, or a career in finance, you will become more analytically and ethically robust after a few lectures of <em>Justice</em>.</p>
<p>Lectures are free from the course website and on YouTube. Check out the course website <a href="https://justiceharvard.org/"><strong>here.</strong></a></p>
<h4>4. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/excel-2016-essential-training/welcome"><em>Excel Essential Training</em></a> from LinkedIn</h4>
<p>You cannot deny the importance of Excel within the modern economy. Microsoft’s interactive spreadsheet software is everywhere and facility with the program is a huge selling point in job applications. This course from LinkedIn is a thorough introduction to the subjects and it provides a nice interactive format for practicing new techniques. No prior knowledge is necessary, and even people with intermediate Excel skills will benefit.</p>
<p>When I took the course, my Excel skills were reasonably advanced, but I benefitted tremendously from a more detailed understanding of the program. The small tips and best practices I learned have saved me a lot of time and many headaches since finishing the course. Knowledge of Excel will serve you in many different professions, so it is worth committing the hours to become a power user.</p>
<p>Available on LinkedIn Learning <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/excel-2016-essential-training/welcome"><strong>here.</strong></a></p>
<h4>5. <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science"><em>CS50: Introduction to Computer Science</em></a> from Harvard/edX</h4>
<p>If you want to learn to code, CS50 is the place to start. This course from Harvard comes with everything: a dynamic professor, extensive resources, logistical help, problem sets with automatic grading, supplementary lectures from teaching fellows, a user-friendly coding environment, and more.</p>
<p>There is a reason CS50 has a cult following among Harvard undergraduates, many of whom take CS50 as their first computer science course. I took CS50 online and found it absolutely exhilarating. It was challenging, but the course structure and resources made it easy to start. At the outset of a programming course, the number of new tools and concepts is often overwhelming for beginners. In my experience, CS50 does the best job at easing you into the field and building some momentum right from the start.</p>
<p>Knowing how to code is an invaluable skill for anyone on the job market, so it should be high on your list of skills to acquire. If you need to be convinced, we have an entire <strong><a href="https://human-jobs.com/2020/10/07/learn-to-code/">blogpost</a></strong> dedicated to coding for humanities people. Taking CS50 is a commitment, but you will not regret it. Free and paid versions are available from edX, so check it out <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science"><strong>here.</strong></a></p>
<h4>6. Bonus Fun/Learning Resource: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9RM-iSvTu1uPJb8X5yp3EQ">Wendover Productions</a> on YouTube</h4>
<p>This isn’t a course, but rather a YouTube channel that offers super high-quality “mini-documentaries” on really interesting topics. Wendover’s videos are pithy and jam-packed with interesting insights. Ever wonder how overnight shipping works? Check out this <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3qfeoqErtY">video</a></strong>. Curious about how humans conceptualize risk? Wendover has got you covered <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtX-Ibi21tU">here</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I watch Wendover to understand how the world works, and I always come away with a new insight into the unseen forces that shape our lives. Highly recommended for some fun and educational time on YouTube. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9RM-iSvTu1uPJb8X5yp3EQ"><strong>Here</strong></a> is&nbsp;the channel link.</p>
<h3>Never stop learning – build job skills every day</h3>
<p>Learning new things and building skills is a major motivator in my life. I do it for fun, and I do it for the career opportunities that an expanded skillset affords. Tell me in the comments: what skills do you want to build? Do you have any amazing online resources that others should check out?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <blockquote>
<p>This article is in a series of code review articles that take a
deep look at a popular module and discuss its merits, flaws, and
overall fitness for a task.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/axios/axios">Axios</a> is a solid, battle-tested, replacement for the deprecated <code>require.js</code>. I
recommend it despite the imperfections that I have summarized in this article.</p>
<p>The logic in this package is well thought out and meets my standards. Some of
the more complex functions are arduous to read. This makes collaboration from
the development community difficult and undermines the overall effectiveness of
the project.</p>
<p>The interceptor system is a workable solution for extending the package
functions. Personally, I have wrapped request/response to extend error reporting
and the updates felt natural and a seamless transition.</p>
<p>There are two test runners in the project: Mocha (for node.js) and Jasmine/Karma
(for browser testing). This is unnecessary as both test packages can run both
platforms. A large number of the tests are written for jasmine and will not
run, without modification in the mocha test suite. This prevents me from
showing full code coverage without hacking on the tests (more on this later). </p>
<p>Running <code>npm test</code> takes many minutes and fails, by default, if the developer
does not have the Opera browser installed. I can understand that an exhaustive
integration run in a multi-target package is a long process. Fleshing out the
Mocha test suite to run on the command line in a second npm script would
encourage test-driven refactoring and make many of the improvements I outline
much simpler and safer. Iterative, refactoring tests must be fast, sane, and
meaningful. They need not be exhaustive. The exhaustive testing can be saved
for pre-release and proofing pull-requests.</p>
<p>The current version is <code>0.20.0</code>. There is no explicit roadmap for the project;
however, I do not see a reason for the delay in assigning version <code>1.0.0</code> to this
release.</p>

<p>I’m not going to detail all of the audit warnings, they are mostly from the

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://npmjs.com/advisories/534">DDoS Regex</a>.</p>
<p>The first High level security threat is from installing the <code>karma</code> test runner:</p>

<p>I love <code>lodash</code> for the creativity of its codebase, the way the developers

awards <code>lodash</code>‘s prototype pollution (actually polyfills) a <code>High</code> level alert.</p>
<p><code>karma</code> also depends on an old version of <code>chokidar</code>, but <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://paulmillr.com/posts/chokidar-3-save-32tb-of-traffic/">new chokidar is way

<p>We’re very excited to release Pyston v2, a faster and highly compatible implementation of the Python programming language.  Version 2 is 20% faster than stock Python 3.8 on our macrobenchmarks.  More importantly, it is likely to be faster on your code.  Pyston v2 can reduce server costs, reduce user latencies, and improve developer productivity.</p>



<p>Pyston v2 is easy to deploy, so if you’re looking for better Python performance, we encourage you to take five minutes and <a href="#availability">try Pyston</a>. Doing so is one of the easiest ways to speed up your project.</p>



<h2>Performance</h2>



<p>Pyston v2 provides a noticeable speedup on many workloads while having few drawbacks.  Our focus has been on web serving workloads, but Pyston v2 is also faster on other workloads and popular benchmarks.</p>



<p>Our team put together a new <a href="https://github.com/pyston/python-macrobenchmarks/">public Python macrobenchmark suite</a> that measures the performance of several commonly-used Python projects.  The benchmarks in this suite are larger than those found in other Python suites, making them more likely to be representative of real-world applications.  Even though this gives us a lower headline number than other projects, we believe it translates to better speedups for real use cases.  Pyston v2 still shows sped-up performance on microbenchmarks, being twice as fast as standard Python on tests like chaos.py and nbody.py.</p>



<p>Here are our performance results:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>CPython 3.8.5</td><td>Pyston 2.0</td><td>PyPy 7.3.2</td></tr><tr><td>flaskblogging warmup time [1]</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>85s</td></tr><tr><td>flaskblogging mean latency</td><td>5.1ms</td><td>4.1ms</td><td>2.5ms</td></tr><tr><td>flaskblogging p99 latency</td><td>6.3ms</td><td>5.2ms</td><td>5.8ms</td></tr><tr><td>flaskblogging memory usage</td><td>47MB</td><td>54MB</td><td>228MB</td></tr><tr><td>djangocms warmup time [1]</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>105s</td></tr><tr><td>djangocms mean latency</td><td>14.1ms</td><td>11.8ms</td><td>15.9ms</td></tr><tr><td>djangocms p99 latency</td><td>15.0ms</td><td>12.8ms</td><td>179ms</td></tr><tr><td>djangocms memory usage</td><td>84MB</td><td>91MB</td><td>279MB</td></tr><tr><td>Pylint speedup</td><td>1x</td><td>1.16x</td><td>0.50x</td></tr><tr><td>mypy speedup</td><td>1x</td><td>1.07x [2]</td><td>unsupported</td></tr><tr><td>PyTorch speedup</td><td>1x</td><td>1.00x [2]</td><td>unsupported</td></tr><tr><td>PyPy benchmark suite [3]</td><td>1x</td><td>1.36x</td><td>2.48x</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Results were collected on an m5.large EC2 instance running Ubuntu 20.04</figcaption></figure>



<p>[1] Warmup time is defined as time until the benchmark reached 95% of peak performance; if it was not distinguishable from noise it is marked “n/a”.  Only post-warmup behavior is considered for latency measurement.<br>[2] mypy and PyTorch don’t support automatically building their C extensions from source, so these Pyston numbers use our unsafe compatibility mode<br>[3] The PyPy benchmark suite was modified to only run the benchmarks that are compatible with Python 3.8</p>



<h2>Results analysis</h2>



<p>In our targeted benchmarks (djangocms + flaskblogging), Pyston v2 provides an average 1.22x speedup for mean latency and an 1.18x improvement for p99 latency while using a just few more megabytes per process.  We have not yet invested time in optimizing the other benchmarks.</p>



<p>“p99 latency” is the upper 99th percentile of the response-time distribution, and is a common metric used in web serving contexts since it can provide insight into user experience that is lost by taking an average.  PyPy’s high p99 latency on djangocms comes from periodic latency spikes, presumably from garbage collection pauses.  CPython and Pyston both exhibit periodic spikes, presumably from their cycle collectors, but they are both less frequent and much smaller in magnitude.</p>



<p>The mypy and PyTorch benchmarks show a natural boundary of Pyston v2. These benchmarks both do the bulk of their work in C extensions which are unaffected by our Python speedups.  We natively support the C API and do not have an emulation layer, so we are still able to provide a small boost to mypy performance and do not degrade pytorch or numpy performance.  Your benefit will depend on your mix of Python and C extension work.</p>



<h2>Technical approach</h2>



<p>We’re planning on going into more detail in future blog posts, but some of the techniques we use in Pyston v2 include:</p>



<ul><li>A very-low-overhead JIT using <a href="https://luajit.org/dynasm.html">DynASM</a></li><li><a href="https://bugs.python.org/issue14757">Quickening</a></li><li>General CPython optimizations</li><li>Build process improvements</li></ul>



<h2>Compatibility</h2>



<p>Since Pyston is a fork of CPython, we believe it is one of the most compatible alternative Python implementations available today.  It supports all the same features and C API that CPython does.</p>



<p>While Pyston is identically functional in theory, in practice there are some temporary compatibility hurdles for any new Python implementation.  Please see <a href="https://github.com/pyston/pyston/wiki">our wiki</a> for details.</p>



<h2 id="availability">Availability</h2>



<p>Pyston v2.0 is <a href="https://github.com/pyston/pyston/releases">immediately available</a> as a pre-built package.  Currently, we have packages for Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04 x86_64.  If you would like support for a different OS, let us know by filing an issue in our <a href="https://github.com/pyston/pyston/issues">issue tracker</a>.</p>



<p>Trying out Pyston is as simple as installing our package, replacing <code>python3</code> with <code>pyston3</code>, and reinstalling your dependencies with <code>pip-pyston3 install</code> (though see our <a href="https://github.com/pyston/pyston/wiki">wiki</a> for a known issue about setuptools). If you already have an automated build set up, the change should be just a few lines.</p>



<p>Our plan is to open-source the code in the future, but since compiler projects are expensive and we no longer have benevolent corporate sponsorship, it is currently closed-source while we iron out our business model.</p>

<p>We are designing Pyston for developers and love to hear about your needs and experiences.  So, we’ve set up a <a href="https://discord.gg/S7gsqnb">Discord server</a> where you can chat with us.  If you’d like a commercially-supported version of Pyston, please <a href="mailto:business@pyston.org">send us an email</a>.</p>



<p>We’ve optimized Pyston for several use cases but are eager to hear about new ones so that we can make it even more beneficial.  If you run into any problems or instances where Pyston does not help as much as expected, please let us know!</p>



<h2>Background</h2>



<p>We designed Pyston v1 at Dropbox to speed up Python for its web serving workloads.  After the project ended, some of us from the team brainstormed how we would do it differently if we were to do it again.  In early 2020, enough pieces were in place for us to start a company and work on Pyston full-time.</p>



<p>Pyston v2 is inspired by but is technically unrelated to the original Pyston v1 effort.</p>



<h2>Moving forward</h2>



<p>We’re on a mission to make Python faster and have plenty of ideas to do so.  That means we’re actively looking for people to join the team.  <a href="https://discord.gg/S7gsqnb">Let us know</a> if you’d like to get involved.  Otherwise stay tuned for future releases and reach out if you have any questions!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><strong>Mike:</strong>&nbsp;Hello, and welcome to Open Source Underdogs. I’m your host Mike Schwartz, and this is the episode 54, with Justin Borgman, Chairman, CEO, and Co-Founder of Starburst, the company behind the Presto Data Access Project.</p><p>Before we get started, I have a quick request – we all want to help open-source founders and startups. I make the podcast, but I need your&nbsp;<strong>help to get the word out</strong>, so tell your friends, post on LinkedIn, tweet out a link,&nbsp;<strong>post on Hacker News</strong>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nynymike">follow me</a>&nbsp;and share one of my posts on LinkedIn, whatever you think makes sense, go for it. </p><p>One of the themes of Machiavelli’s the Prince is <i>Virtu e Fortuna<i>—<i>virtu</i> meaning excellence in your domain, and <i>fortuna</i> meaning luck, whether good or bad. I really like how the story of Starburst exemplifies this 500-year-old insight.</i></i></p><p><i><i>



<p><br>Justin has a ton of domain <i>virtu</i>. He has deep technical knowledge, but he’s also on the lookout to harness fortuna. He’s one of the few podcast guests to acknowledge it. And Starburst earns its name because it’s one of the most stellar open-source business success stories I’ve heard in the last few years.<br>There’s so many great insights in this episode, a lot to think about. So, without further ado, let’s get on with the interview.</p>



<h3>What Is Presto?</h3>



<p><strong>Mike:</strong> Justin, thanks for
joining the podcast today.</p>



<p><strong>Justin:</strong> Hey, Mike, super glad
to be with you.</p>



<p><strong>Mike:</strong>&nbsp;Before we dive into the business stuff, I find it’s helpful
to talk a little bit about the technology. Can you start by giving a brief
history of the Presto project? What it’s good at, and how the community
coalesced around it?</p>



<div><p><strong>Justin:</strong> It was really back in 2012 for developers at Facebook, Martin, Dain, David, and Eric came together to create a new infrastructure project that would be a faster way of querying data at Facebook. Facebook, of course, collects massive amounts of data, hundreds of petabytes worth of data , and needed a faster alternative to a prior project that they also developed and they called Hive.</p><p> Hive was a SQL engine for Hadoop, and it just wasn’t fast enough. So, Presto was created to be a faster means of accessing that data. But it has one really important differentiation in addition to the speed, which is the ability to access data anywhere. So, it’s like a database without storage – that’s kind of one way to think about it. </p></div>



<p>So, it looks at storage in other systems, which could be Hadoop, it could be S3 and AWS, it could be a traditional database, like Oracle, or Teradata, or Snowflake. And regardless of where that data lives, Presto can reach it, query it, and deliver SQL-based analytics. </p>



<p>So, that’s kind of what makes it special, is the ability to access the data everywhere. And that’s gained particular momentum, I would say more recently, as many large enterprises have data silo problems, where they have data in a bunch of different databases, and are now perhaps moving to the Cloud in some fashion.</p>



<div><p><strong>Mike:</strong> And if I’m not mistaken, high concurrency is one of the areas that make sort of this data access plain different?</p><p> <strong>Justin:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, exactly, it’s very fast, and can support high concurrency. And in a lot of ways, this technology was sort of, I like to say built in reverse, in the sense that it was tested at ridiculous scale from day one. You know, very often, when you start something new, you don’t really know how it’ll work at scale until you get people using it. But because it was really born out of the internet companies, Facebook, and Uber, Airbnb, and Netflix were all early adopters to use the technology, it was really tested, and at scale, and as a result delivers great performance and concurrency.</p></div>



<h3>Origin Story</h3>



<div><p><strong>Mike:</strong>&nbsp;Starburst is not your first company, you are part of a team
at the company called Hadapt that’s sold to Teradata in about three and a half
years, I think.</p><p>

<strong>Justin: </strong>Yep.</p></div>



<p><strong>Mike:</strong> How did that experience lead you to Presto?</p>



<p><strong>Justin:</strong> In a lot of ways, this is really a continuation of that journey that began 10 years ago. So, that was 2010 that I started Hadapt. Hadapt was a spin-out actually from Yale University and the computer science department – there’s some research called HadoopDB, which was pretty pioneering research at the time, in terms of thinking about Hadoop as a data warehousing solution, and being able to deliver fast SQL analytics on top of Hadoop.</p>



<p>So, we spun that out, raised Venture Capital, built that business over nearly four years, as you mentioned, and then sold it to Teradata. We had ups and downs, definitely lessons learned through that experience. And I think, really, my discovery of Presto after arriving at Teradata in 2014 was kind of an exciting opportunity to reimagine the strategy that we had with Hadapt. </p>



<p>So, Hadapt was the SQL engine for Hadoop, Presto is a SQL engine for anything essentially, allows you to access data anywhere.it was an opportunity to basically take all the lessons learned from the first experience and start to apply them over again.</p>



<p>It was actually my team from Hadapt that ended up contributing a tremendous amount of software to Presto, and working with the guys at Facebook, who created it to really make it an enterprise-grade piece of technology. And I think, as we started to see Presto get more and more capable, and see more and more people use it, that was what created the idea in our head that maybe there was a business to be formed around this.</p>



<h3>Community Engagement</h3>



<p><strong>Mike:</strong>&nbsp;It’s a really interesting opportunity, and I can’t actually think of another example like it, but when I’m talking about open source, I sometimes talk about three types of open-source companies. One would be volunteer, where a bunch of guys or girls get together and write some piece of software that they love, but not necessarily for a business.</p>



<p>And then, I talk about corporate open source, where there’s some piece of software, where a company funds it, but it’s not their core business, but then, they realize that makes sense for them to collaborate like Kubernetes, let’s say ,and Google, and these pure-play, open-source companies, where the company behind it is developing it, and they’re the main contributors.</p>



<p><br>And so, lots of great open-source projects come out of this corporate open-source area, the podcast that is mostly focused on pure-play because they were trying to help entrepreneurs and founders start open source, use open source as part of their business model. But you’ve sort of, like, created a very interesting situation, where you have a mix of corporate and pure-play because you’re benefiting from, not just the community, but, really, Facebook is a big contributor to the project to — I heard almost 50/50. So, how’s that really evolved, and how do you continue to encourage this very symbiotic relationship?</p>



<p><br><strong>Justin:</strong> You’re right. Preston has a very interesting history to it, an interesting journey. It started as a small project at Facebook. When we got involved at Teradata, we were able to apply a few million dollars a year of R&amp;D budget into advancing that as well. And then, of course, you’ve got a few other companies contributing also along the way.</p>



<p>And, as a result, all of that kind of accelerates the development of the project. And I think that maybe what’s most unique here is not only that Facebook created great infrastructure software as a byproduct of their business – they’ve certainly done that before – but rather that there was kind of a commercial partner very early on, and myself, and my team at Teradata thinking about the commercial applications of this.</p>



<p>So, you know, back in 2014, Presto was still in its early days, Facebook wasn’t trying to monetize it obviously, that’s not their business, but we were already thinking about how this could be used by Fortune 500 customers, and what difference this could make to their business. And I think that led to its very enterprise-applicable evolution, and set us up really well to eventually commercialize this in 2017, when we left Teradata, the creators of Presto joined us from Facebook. And we went off on our way to build this business.</p>



<h3>Idea Incubation</h3>



<div><p><strong>Mike:</strong>&nbsp;So, you were working on Presto while you’re at Teradata. And did Teradata ask for any equity, or how did that work when you told Teradata, “We want to start this company basically working at Teradata? Like, what was that like?</p><p> <strong>Justin:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, well, what was interesting about that – and I guess just to set the context, I think Teradata, from 2014, when they acquired my company through to probably today, has gone through various iterations of kind of rethinking their overall strategy, in terms of how they evolved into this next generation of sort of Big Data platforms. Because they had great success in the ‘80s, ‘90s, and early 2000s, as this kind of monolithic data warehouse, where you would ingest everything and store it in one place. </p></div>



<p>But obviously that became very expensive over time. And the appliance model, hardware and software combined, wasn’t necessarily set up for this future as people move to the cloud. So, they’ve gone through a lot of iterations. And it was really in that iterative process, where they weren’t really clear where they wanted to go, that they actually felt like Presto is maybe a distraction for them.</p>



<div><p>So, that actually created the opportunity, I think, for us, to say, well, we think it’s a little more than a distraction. And, you know, we’d be happy to sort of take that off your hands and work on this together.</p><p> So, it was a very amicable split – we remain partners, we’re still partners today, where we work together on some customer accounts, the technologies work together, we can access data in Teradata, for example, from Presto. So, that partnership remains. But it was one that I think for them, they viewed us as sort of taking Presto off their hands because there were maybe close to a dozen companies within their customer base that were using Presto. So, we were able to deliver really first-class support to …</p></div></i></i></p></div>

<h2><a href="https://chrisseaton.com/">Chris Seaton</a>, 28 October 2020</h2>


</header>

<p>There’s a proposal to add <em>Software Transactional Memory</em>, or <em>STM</em>, to the Ruby programming language. This is part of a wider effort to add better support for concurrency and parallelism in Ruby, and in particular the idea of <em>ractors</em>. A concept has been <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17261">proposed</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/3652">implemented</a> by Koichi Sasada.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://chrisseaton.com/truffleruby/ruby-stm/testBoard.gif" width="50%">
<figcaption>An animation of the algorithm we're going to use as an example of STM - we'll explain this later on</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This article gives some context on what STM is, how you use it, and why you might want to use it. We’ll show an application which is well-suited to STM and we’ll use this to talk about the benefits, issues, and some open questions.</p>

<p>We’ll finish by setting a challenge for STM in Ruby.</p>

<p>I wrote the first half of my PhD on STM, and the second half on Ruby, so I’ve got quite a bit of experience with both and the idea of their combination is very interesting to me.</p>

<h2 id="why-might-we-want-an-stm">Why might we want an STM?</h2>

<p>Let’s say we’re a bank managing many bank accounts. Each account has a total. We get a never-ending stream of requests to move a sum of money <code>m</code> from an account <code>a</code> to account <code>b</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_next_transfer</span>
  <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-=</span> <span>m</span>
  <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span> <span>+=</span> <span>m</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Something not everyone may know about Ruby is that <code>x += y</code> is equivalent to writing <code>t = x; x = t + y</code>. We’ll write that out in full to make that clear to ourselves.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_next_transfer</span>
  <span>a_balance</span> <span>=</span> <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span>
  <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>a_balance</span> <span>-</span> <span>m</span>
  <span>b_balance</span> <span>=</span> <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span>
  <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>b_balance</span> <span>+</span> <span>m</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ve got a lot of transfers to run through, so we’ll have multiple threads processing these transfers.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>n</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_next_transfer</span>
      <span>a_balance</span> <span>=</span> <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span>
      <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>a_balance</span> <span>-</span> <span>m</span>
      <span>b_balance</span> <span>=</span> <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span>
      <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>b_balance</span> <span>+</span> <span>m</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ve got a few problems here now. With all these threads running at the same time, what happens if two threads are putting money into your account concurrently?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>100</span>

<span># thread 1                        # thread 2</span>
<span>balance</span> <span>=</span> <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span>
  <span># balance = 100</span>
                                  <span>balance</span> <span>=</span> <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span>
                                    <span># balance = 100</span>
<span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>balance</span> <span>+</span> <span>10</span>
  <span># accounts[a] = 110</span>
                                  <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>balance</span> <span>+</span> <span>10</span>
                                    <span># accounts[a] = 110</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The two transfers have run, but your balance is 110. The other 10 has been lost - this is called a <em>lost update</em>, meaning it’s as if the update was never made.</p>

<p>Also consider what happens if the thread crashes after taking money from <code>a</code> but before putting it into <code>b</code>? The transfer would be applied partially and again we’d lose money.</p>

<p>We need to use some kind of <em>synchronization</em> on our accounts. Ruby has <em>mutual exclusion locks</em> or <em>mutexes</em>, so we can try using those.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>n</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_next_transfer</span>
      <span>locks</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>].</span><span>synchronize</span> <span>do</span>
        <span>locks</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>].</span><span>synchronize</span> <span>do</span>
          <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-=</span> <span>m</span>
          <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span> <span>+=</span> <span>m</span>
        <span>end</span>
      <span>end</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Does this work? What if we process a transfer from account 1001 to account 1002 on one thread at the same time as processing a transfer from account 1002 to 1001, so the other way around, at the same time?</p>

<p>The first thread will try to lock 1001 and then 1002. The second thread will try to lock 1002 and then 1001. If the first thread gets as far as locking 1001, and the second as far as locking 1002, then both will be waiting for the opposite lock and will never release the lock they already have. We will be in <em>deadlock</em>.</p>

<p>If we always acquired locks in the same order, by collecting them up first and sorting them, we could fix this.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>n</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_next_transfer</span>
      <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>].</span><span>sort</span>
      <span>locks</span><span>[</span><span>x</span><span>].</span><span>synchronize</span> <span>do</span>
        <span>locks</span><span>[</span><span>y</span><span>].</span><span>synchronize</span> <span>do</span>
          <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-=</span> <span>m</span>
          <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span> <span>+=</span> <span>m</span>
        <span>end</span>
      <span>end</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now in both transfers account 1001 is locked first and 1002 is locked second. That will work.</p>

<p>We have to make up a somewhat artificial requirement to explain the next issue, but consider if for some good reason we wanted to transfer to one account if we had a lot of money, and a different account if we only had a little money. Maybe if we’re rich this month we donate to charity, otherwise we unfortunately need to save for ourselves.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if account balance &gt; 1000
  transfer 10 to charity
else
  transfer 10 to savings
end
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll talk about accounts <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>, now, and a threshold of money <code>t</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>n</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>

<p>It’s starting to get very complicated. And this locks more than it needs to - it locks both <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> but then only uses one of them. If you use <code>b</code> in the end, ideally another thread could be serving a transfer to <code>c</code> at the same time, but you’ve locked it and it can’t. Imagine if instead of two potential accounts it was thousands and you had to lock them all. Imagine if you couldn’t work out at all which account you’d be transferring to until you started the transfer - then you’d never be able to process two transfers at the same time.</p>

<p>At this point as well we’re likely to start to make errors trying to do all this locking and ordering of locks and things.</p>

<p>Stepping back and taking it all in, we can draw up some requirements for what we need.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>atomicity</em> - that all writes in the transfer are applied or none are applied</li>
  <li><em>consistency</em> - meaning that our data structures are always valid - the total sum of money never changes</li>
  <li><em>isolation</em> - meaning one transfer does not interfere with another</li>
  <li><em>durability</em> - meaning that when applied the transfer is available to all subsequent transactions</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally a library or the language could do this all for us. We’d like to be able to write almost what we originally wrote, but with just an annotation to make the code inside a block atomic, consistent, isolated, and the result durable.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>n</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_next_transfer</span>
      <span>atomically</span> <span>do</span>
        <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-=</span> <span>m</span>
        <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span> <span>+=</span> <span>m</span>
      <span>end</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is what a <em>transactional</em> memory can let us do. It will automatically monitor what you read and write inside the <code>atomically</code> block, which is a <em>transaction</em>, and will make sure it is either applied fully or not, that the balance of the whole system is always consistent, that transactions do not see the result of each other partially applied, and that writes appear and stay.</p>

<p>It may be implemented using the code we eventually arrived at ourselves, or it could do something else instead. In practice how it is often implemented is that
reads and writes are stored in a log, then at the end the transaction works out if anyone else has written locations that you’ve read. If they have then the values you read are no longer valid, so your transaction <em>conflicts</em> with another, is <em>aborted</em> and retries, reading the locations again. When it eventually does not conflict with any other transactions it is <em>committed</em> and succeeds. This means you don’t need to lock everything up-front, which means you avoid the problem of what happens if you may potentially need every account. Locking everything up-front is called <em>pessimistic locking</em>. We’re moving to <em>optimistic locking</em></p>

<h2 id="the-proposed-stm">The proposed STM</h2>

<p>Koichi’s <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17261">proposed</a> STM for Ruby, in combination with his proposed <em>ractors</em> (similar to <em>actors</em>) would look like this.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>accounts</span> <span>=</span> <span>9999</span><span>.</span><span>times</span><span>.</span><span>map</span> <span>{</span> <span>Thread</span><span>::</span><span>TVar</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>

<span>n</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Ractor</span><span>.</span><span>new</span> <span>*</span><span>accounts</span> <span>do</span> <span>|*</span><span>accounts</span><span>|</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_next_transfer</span>
      <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>atomically</span> <span>do</span>
        <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>].</span><span>value</span> <span>-=</span> <span>m</span>
        <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>].</span><span>value</span> <span>+=</span> <span>m</span>
      <span>end</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>He’s using a <code>Ractor</code> but you can think of it as a thread for the purposes of this article. Instead of an array of account balances, we now have an array of <code>TVar</code> objects that contain values. A <code>TVar</code> is a <em>transactional variable</em>. Only these variables are transactional - not any other Ruby value you read or write. His design requires that the <code>TVar</code> objects you’re going to use are passed into the <code>Ractor</code>, due to rules about sharing that aren’t relevant for this article.</p>

<p>This looks good, doesn’t it!</p>

<h2 id="a-more-complex-application">A more complex application</h2>

<p>Let’s consider a larger application, in order to illustrate further and to talk about some issues and open questions. The <a href="https://github.com/chrisseaton/ruby-stm-lee-demo">code is available on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s say it’s our job to lay out the wires on a circuit board. We get a board with <em>pads</em> (connections to components mounted on the board) and a list of <em>routes</em> that we need to draw between these pads. There are a great many pads and routes, there isn’t much space on the tiny board, and another catch is that it’s very expensive to have wires crossing each other. Let’s say it’s exponentially more expensive for more deeply stacked wires.</p>

<p>In this minimal example we we can see two routes, and how they have to cross each other.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Most people don’t practice taking ideas seriously. I think it’s because most people don’t know how to. I didn’t either, until I stumbled upon an implication.</p>

<p>For example, what would it mean to take compounding seriously?</p>

<p>Ugh. I can feel your aversion. You’ve already heard so much about compounding, how it works, how it’s the eight wonder of the world, etc. etc.</p>

<p>But, familiarity is not the same as taking it seriously.</p>

<p>Say you start with $100, and every year, make 10% more. This compounds, since the extra money is a function of how much you already have. The more you have, the more you get. It’s a positive loop that keeps on increasing.</p>

<p>That’s the familiar interpretation. The earlier you start, the more money you’ll make.</p>

<p>To take this interpretation seriously would mean investing your earnings for a similar return. <a href="http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reality has a surprising amount of detail</a>, and sometimes assumptions break. You don’t make 10% - which means you need to balance your investments somehow. That makes things complicated. However, this complication is not related to compounding.</p>

<p>Taking compounding seriously means taking it a step further. Your net worth is just one implication. What else compounds?</p>

<p>Your life experiences and knowledge. What would it mean to leverage compounding here?</p>

<p>If you’re taking compounding seriously, you’d learn the skills with the greatest return first. That means learning the broadest applicable skills you’d apply throughout your life first. That means learning how to think well - before learning the new fancy tech you want to learn.</p>

<p>Of course, sometimes you need a medium to learn the skill better. That makes sense: learn to think well via this new tech you wanted to learn. <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/3HyeNiEpvbQQaqeoH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Purposes are fragile</a> though, and it’s easy to get lost in the tool, instead of the overall goal.</p>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/divider.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>What makes this example so good is that you’re probably very familiar with compounding. What else are you familiar with, but haven’t realised you’re not taking seriously?</p>

<p>A good way to practice this is to ask this question: What are the implications of (idea) in (field of interest)?</p>

<p>For example, asking myself What are the implications of compounding for my self-directed knowledge base led to the above insight of learning broader skills first.</p>

                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The blockchain industry is one of the few where the demand exceeds the offer. A couple of years ago, the number of blockchain developers was 171 times smaller than the total number of software developers and the total worth of the blockchain market is expected to reach<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/647231/worldwide-blockchain-technology-market-size/"> $39.7 billion by 2025</a>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is no doubt that the main demand is and will be coming from the financial sector, however, the<a href="https://igniteoutsourcing.com/blockchain/blockchain-use-cases-by-industry/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> diversified applications of the technology</a> in numerous markets (from retail to entertainment, from aviation to insurance) only inflames the need for qualitative blockchain experts in the world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The increased interest in the profession has spiked the salaries in the industry, so beware that a professional blockchain developer will have a 3-digit salary right from the start. When hiring a blockchain developer or a team, there are particular steps in the process that are distinct from the traditional recruitment of a software developer or engineer. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Below you can go through the table of contents with the tips and recommendations on hiring the right blockchain developer for your team. Click on the section, and begin learning the insights of the process.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":764,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<div><figure><img src="https://4irelabs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/hiring-blockchain-developers-1024x646.png" alt="blockchain experts"></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Is there a demand for blockchain developers</strong><strong>?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics<a href="https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/fastest-growing-occupations.htm" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> included developers</a> in the list of the fastest-growing occupations in 2019-2029. LinkedIn said that<a href="https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/blog/trends-and-research/2020/most-in-demand-hard-and-soft-skills" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> blockchain is #1 needed hardskill</a> in 2020.<a href="https://hired.com/state-of-software-engineers#hottest-jobs" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Hired</a> named blockchain engineers the “dark horses” of 2019 and confirmed the increasing demand for these specialists in 2020 as well. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Investors put more and more money into blockchain development, companies like Facebook, Amazon, Oracle, Toyota, Shell, Walt Disney, IBM, and many others have already turned to blockchain for their day-to-day operations in the financial sector. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And if the<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbespr/2020/02/19/forbes-releases-2nd-annual-blockchain-50-list-of-companies-embracing-the-technology-underlying-cryptocurrencies/#1506ebcd17c5" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> top fortune companies</a> turn to this technology setting the trend for the rest of the world, then there is no doubt that the demand for blockchain developers exists, and it continues to rise every year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Where can I find Blockchain developers</strong><strong>?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blockchain developers are not ordinary programmers and you probably won’t find one on Facebook, LinkedIn, or any ordinary job-listing website. Their number is still not enough to satisfy the demand of the existing market so you should not expect an easy hiring process here. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most likely, the search for the developer will look like renting an apartment in Germany: you come with your offer to the developers and they select the most interesting/well-paid/promising offer. And just like future tenants, you can only hope to be selected by the chosen blockchain developer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the situation in 2020 is not as bad as it might seem. To get the right blockchain programmers for a project, you simply need to look in the right places. Below is a list of potential places (online and offline) where good blockchain developers can be found:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Meeting places</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes, all developers and tech people have their own meeting places in the context of a digital forum where like-minded programmers discuss blockchain-related topics. Most often they are similar to<a href="https://github.com/blockchain" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> GitHub</a>,<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Reddit</a>, or<a href="https://www.ieee.org/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> IEEE Blockchain Community</a>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These are platforms, websites, and forums where developers share their ideas, discuss new trends, and test new possibilities. You can get to one of these places and ask a couple of members if they would be interested in your offer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":765,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<div><figure><img src="https://4irelabs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/hiring-experts-1024x646.png" alt="hire experts"></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Conferences</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While due to COVID-19 conferences had to convert into the online format, they still happen. And the interested, progressive, and iconic blockchain developers do attend such events. So you can search for the upcoming events to participate and communicate with its participants. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In-person hiring in this case would go smoother and much easier, yet even while talking online, you still stand a chance to get the right developer for your project or startup. Here is a couple of upcoming events for consideration:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><a href="https://blockchainlive.com/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blockchain Live 2020</a></li><li><a href="https://www.decentralized.com/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Decentralized</a></li><li><a href="https://www.maltablockchainsummit.com/events/general-info/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Annual Malta AI &amp; Blockchain Summit</a></li><li><a href="https://blockchain-expo.com/europe/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blockchain Expo Europe</a></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can also check the up-to-date schedule of the upcoming events in the crypto-world<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-events" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> here</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Schools</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most<a href="https://www.bitrates.com/news/p/the-top-five-universities-offering-blockchain-courses" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> top schools</a> and universities turned to blockchain development because a lot of students in the technological departments wish to become a blockchain developer and earn a fortune,&nbsp; especially when the demand is only rising. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a perfect place for large corporations and startups to find their next employee. Corporations can contact the school and offer to sponsor the best student; as a result, they can get the perfect young mind that will solemnly focus on their needs after graduation. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For startups, schools are the perfect place to get a like-minded genius who will become a part of the young team and will work to get experience, knowledge, and real-life interaction based on the knowledge from school. Here are the best courses for cryptocurrency to get started:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Head-hunting websites for freelancers</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the beginning of this section, we said that usual listing websites are not the place for blockchain experts. Nonetheless, there are blockchain freelance platforms where an individual developer can easily be acquired. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They include<a href="https://www.toptal.com/blockchain?dfh_uid=1" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Toptal</a>,<a href="https://bountyone.io/?dfh_uid=1" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> BountyOne</a>,<a href="https://x-team.com/hire-blockchain-developers/?dfh_uid=1" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> X-Team</a>,<a href="https://www.stackoverflowbusiness.com/talent?dfh_uid=1" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Stack Overflow</a>, or<a href="https://www.codementor.io/blockchain-developers?dfh_uid=1" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> CodementorX</a>. These platforms<strong> </strong>can be of great help if you don’t know where to start your search and what conditions of cooperation to offer your potential developers. Here you can read what developers expect from their employers and so adjust your offer to the market.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Why is the developer in the industry?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now that you know where to look for the blockchain developers, it is essential to understand why they are in business. Most broadly, these experts can be divided into two categories: <em>for the money</em> and <em>for the idea</em>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, it does not mean that developers interested in the idea of cryptocurrencies do not require payment; or that those who came into the industry to earn a living won’t have priceless ideas. The general division is important to ensure that you find your developer and that your goals and values match.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Developers for the Money</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This “definition” is frequently applied to the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> generation of blockchain developers. Those who understood that blockchain is the future and that the field of development is still undercovered in terms of resources. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Developers for the money do a quality job but will go into the project that pays more. So if you have a lucrative offer then you can be sure to get a good mind for the right money. This said, such developers will rarely look into the startup ideas unless they already have investors and lack just one element – a blockchain developer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Developers for the Idea</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Such a description is frequently applied to the first generation of blockchain developers, those who came into this field more than three-four years ago (before the world understood the true value of blockchain technologies). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These experts didn’t raise the questions on how to become a blockchain developer or what should I learn for blockchain developer; they were interested in the idea of developing something new, they were coding for the sake of coding. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, most of these developers now have the top salaries in the industry. However, these people have still a fire in their eyes when they see a new idea. This means that developers for the idea can get into a not-well-paying project if the final product is great. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moreover, there are also students of blockchain that also fall into this category; they will be willing to do the job almost for free only to get experience and understand how it works outside of the school walls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>What skills should the developer have?</strong></h2>

<p>Skillset for a programmer is the simple answer to the question “How can I be a Blockchain developer?” so frequently found on blockchain development for beginners. It is the particular set of skills and amount of knowledge that make a blockchain programmer stand out of the crowd.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In short, every blockchain developer must have a good understanding of blockchains concept, cryptography and cryptocurrencies, decentralized technologies, ledgers, the Ethereum network, ledgers, data security, and different programming languages. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Smart contracts are also considered to be the basic package in this field of development because even though these are related to the financial apps in most cases, understanding of this technology clarifies the general way crypto-world operates so helps with developing the right product.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Below we offer you a more complete answer with the details on every skill or tool a professional blockchain developer should have or know.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Basic programming concepts</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A high-level understanding of JavaScript, Java, Node JS, C and C++, Python, Solidity, and Go is a must (depending on your project specification). Then search for an individual that:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Worked with OOPS </strong>(Object-Oriented Programming Structure) because this structure allows for a quick program update whenever needed.</li><li><strong>Understands languages’ syntax </strong>since experience in working with a particular language and basic knowledge of one makes a difference when it comes to Dapps.</li><li><strong>Able to implement multi-threading</strong> in different types of applications.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Data structure</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The data structure is the foundation of every app regardless of its connection to the blockchain. So choose a developer that knows and has worked with linked lists, hash tables, and acyclic graphs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Encryption and security</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Data security and encryption are among the top skill requirements for blockchain experts because every loss means leakage of information to the competition. In terms of security look for:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>SHA (Secure Hashing …</strong></li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week, <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-boundary">HashiCorp announced the release of Boundary</a>, a game-changing infrastructure access solution aimed at helping developers, operators, and security teams maintain access controls for on-premises and cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>Here at <a href="https://nextlinklabs.com/">NextLink Labs</a>, we couldn't be more excited about this security-minded offering. Being a company located at the heart between <a href="https://nextlinklabs.com/how-we-work">DevOps and Security</a>, we often encounter problems that, up until the release of  Boundary, required much more complicated tools and processes to solve. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/why-we-built-hashicorp-boundary">Boundary is a tool built to make it simple to grant and maintain access to infrastructure</a>. In true HashiCorp fashion, Boundary accomplishes this in a way that can target any sort of infrastructure, including all the major cloud providers, Kubernetes, and on premise infrastructure. </p>
<p>Specifically, this tool enables access from a public user to many types of hosts and services located in a private network, and integrates with many existing Identity Providers such as Okta, Active Directory Federation Services, Active Directory, and more. </p>

<h3>The Challenge: Connecting Public Users to Private Resources Simply</h3>
<p>Most modern systems have resources located on a private network for which are going to need to be accessed by end users on a public network.  Examples are vast but a few simple ones are databases, web service hosts, kubernetes nodes, or something similar. </p>
<p>In order to grant users outside the network access to these resources, three things need to happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>A VPN or Bastion host needs set up as a gateway to bridge connections onto the resources</li>
<li>The connection must be restricted via firewall rules or similar so when you give a user access to the VPN or Bastion host they only have access to the resources they need and not the entire network</li>
<li>Individual credentials for each resource must be shared (DB credentials, ssh keys, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>Doing things this way brings up a few issues with their own challenges that require solving: </p>
<p><strong>Issues with Onboarding and Offboarding Users</strong></p>
<p>Users must be granted a series of credentials and keys at different layers of the system. Not only is this difficult in and of itself, but when you throw in best practices around key rotations, static credentials, and how you handle dynamic infrastructure like auto scaling groups and kubernetes services, it can quickly become too much to handle.</p>
<p><strong>Problematic, Unclear Visibility into Connections</strong></p>
<p>We consider it a security best practice (and oftentimes a compliance requirement) to have visibility into what users and systems are connected where. This sort of access control record needs to be available in logs for security personnel to review.</p>
<p><strong>Difficult Integration and Tooling</strong></p>
<p>Users may need managed in multiple Identity Providers and other systems. Power users who are attempting to use command line tools or other tooling may find it difficult to work within the constraints of the VPN or bastion host setup</p>
<p>Boundary <strong>solves these issues</strong> by abstracting away much of the complexity and changing the way you think about access to system resources.</p>
<h3>How Boundary Makes it Work</h3>
<p>As mentioned previously, HashiCorp Boundary was built to make it easy to grant and maintain access to infrastructure. </p>
<p>So what does that look like in practice? </p>
<p>In initiating a boundary connection, 3 things happen:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Boundary replaces individual Ssh keys and credentials with SSO via OpenID Connect. So the first step is to authenticate a user against an existing IDP (Identity Provider) such as Okta or ADFS.</li>
<li><strong>Authorization:</strong> Boundary checks its list of role based access controls to see if the authenticated user has access to the desired resource.</li>
<li><strong>Connection:</strong> Boundary initiates a connection to this resource. It does so via a client side agent that exposes this connection via localhost. Allowing a seamless experience with existing tools as you can work as if the connection is just a localhost connection. For many types of tools, this can also handle the credentials aspect of using a service so your end user never needs to be shared static credentials that may leak or be exposed.</li>
</ol>

    </span></p>
<p>To the end user, they are able to use boundary in several different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>CLI</li>
<li>SDK</li>
<li>REST API</li>
<li>User Interface</li>
<li>Desktop application <strong>(coming soon!)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>With options for using Boundary that should appeal to both power users and less technical users, Boundary should provide a great user experience that will not only make your operations and security folks happy, but also provide tremendous value to end users.</p>

<h3>The Key Advantages to Boundary</h3>
<p>We think HashiCorp Boundary is a gamechanger for many organizations. </p>
<p>It is truly a tool set up for the future as it’s architecture supports modern cloud architectures. </p>
<p>HashiCorp says that in solving this common problem their users were experiencing (access to resources in a private network from a public network), they fundamentally changed how they think about solving the problem. </p>
<p>Boundary has many advantages over other ways of handling the issue:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access rules</strong> can be setup and handled as code via their <strong>Terraform provider</strong> (provides all the other benefits of Infrastructure as Code)</li>
<li><strong>Policy</strong> is thought of as “which set of users needs access to which set of services” as opposed to IP based access control  - which is brittle, especially in today’s increasingly ephemeral environments</li>
<li><strong>Access to Session Visibility:</strong> Security Administrators are able to monitor and manage privileged sessions and export the session logs into analytics tooling</li>
<li>Promotes a <strong>zero-trust network security model</strong> as it does not trust the private network and does not give unnecessary access to the private network</li>
<li><strong>Makes onboarding and offboarding users a breeze</strong>. You only need to add or remove users to your Identity Provider. You don’t need to set up VPN or SSH access. You don’t need to grant individual user credentials</li>
</ul>
<p>Wrap up</p>
<p>In summary, we believe HashiCorp Boundary to be an excellent addition to many companies' toolchains. It does an excellent job of automating the setup and access of resources, identities, and access controls as code with Boundary’s Terraform Provider, REST API, CLI, and SDK. We think Boundary solves a common problem most organizations have in a way that enables simplicity for its users and operators while keeping security top of mind.</p>

branch, merge, clone, fork, sync, push and pull. Today we're excited
to announce the release of a new optimization in the query planner:
pushing down filters!</p>

<p>Pushdown is a query optimization that moves predicates in the
<code>WHERE</code> clause closer to the tables they refer to ("pushes them down
to the tables") in order to reduce the number of rows that need to be
examined. This is easiest to demonstrate with an example.</p>
<p>Let's say you have two tables that you want to join with a query,
along with some conditions. We'll use states and cities for these
examples.</p>

<span>+</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now let's say you want to join these two tables to find all the cities
that start with 'A' that are in states that start with 'A'. You would
write a query like this:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> c<span>.</span>name <span>AS</span> city_name<span>,</span> s<span>.</span>name <span>AS</span> state_name
    <span>FROM</span> cities c
    <span>JOIN</span> states s <span>ON</span> c<span>.</span>state_id <span>=</span> s<span>.</span>id
    <span>WHERE</span> c<span>.</span>name <span>LIKE</span> <span>'A%'</span> <span>AND</span> s<span>.</span>name <span>LIKE</span> <span>'A%'</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And you would get output like this:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>+</span>
<span>|</span> city_name       <span>|</span> state_name <span>|</span>
<span>+</span>
<span>|</span> Alabaster       <span>|</span> Alabama    <span>|</span>
<span>|</span> Auburn          <span>|</span> Alabama    <span>|</span>
<span>|</span> Anchorage       <span>|</span> Alaska     <span>|</span>
<span>|</span> Akutan          <span>|</span> Alaska     <span>|</span>
<span>|</span> Avondale        <span>|</span> Arizona    <span>|</span>
<span>|</span> Apache Junction <span>|</span> Arizona    <span>|</span>
<span>+</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So far so good! But let's consider the number of rows that our query
has to examine to produce the answer. We can examine the query plan
the engine chose using the <code>EXPLAIN</code> keyword in front of the query. A
naive query planner will produce something like this:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code>pushdown<span>&gt;</span> <span>EXPLAIN</span> <span>SELECT</span> c<span>.</span>name <span>AS</span> city_name<span>,</span> s<span>.</span>name <span>AS</span> state_name

<p>So for this plan, we're examining every city in the <code>cities</code> table,
looking up its state (via an index, great!). Then we take this list,
the entire list of all the cities in the database joined to their
states, and filter it down to just those that start with the letter
A. There are about 20,000 cities and towns in the US, so this means
we'll be reading 20K rows and then doing another 20K index lookups
into the <code>states</code> table. That's not terrible, but we can do better.</p>
<p>Pushdown makes the filter happen before the join for each
table. Here's the same query with pushdown analysis enabled:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>+</span>
<span>|</span> <span>plan</span>                                               <span>|</span>

<span>|</span>      │   └─ TableAlias<span>(</span>c<span>)</span>                          <span>|</span>
<span>|</span>      │       └─ <span>Table</span><span>(</span>cities<span>)</span>                      <span>|</span>
<span>|</span>      └─ Filter<span>(</span>s<span>.</span>name <span>LIKE</span> <span>"A%"</span><span>)</span>                   <span>|</span>
<span>|</span>          └─ TableAlias<span>(</span>s<span>)</span>                          <span>|</span>
<span>|</span>              └─ <span>Table</span><span>(</span>states<span>)</span>                      <span>|</span>
<span>+</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, the predicates in the filter node were pushed down
below the join node, to right above their respective tables. Since all
predicates were sucessfully pushed down, the entire wrapping filter
can be safely discarded.</p>
<p>This optimization has a number of desirable properties:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>We do fewer lookups into the secondary table</strong> in the
join. Instead of doing a lookup for every city in the table, we
only do a lookup for the ones that start with 'A'.</li>
<li><strong>We don't assemble a join row result</strong> if the predicate on the
secondary table doesn't match. Without pushdown, we always assemble
a join row, comprising the concatenation of the rows from each of
the tables, for every row in the primary table. For the example
above, this means we never assemble the thousands of join rows for
cities that start with 'A' in states that start with another
letter. These join rows which will never appear in the final result
set is all memory that must be allocated and later collected, which
slows down the server.</li>
<li><strong>We can more efficiently execute in parallel</strong> on the two sides of
the join. It isn't shown in the above plan, but Dolt is capable of
running independent parts of the query in parallel to get faster
results. The further down the plan we push this parallelization,
the faster it makes the engine.</li>
</ol>
<p>So originally, we were examining about 40K rows (20K for the <code>cities</code>
table, then 20K index lookups into the <code>states</code> table). After
pushdown, we've reduced this by a lot, specifically by the number of
cities that don't begin with A. Let's make up a number: say that 10%
of cities start with A. In that case, we've reduced the number of
index lookups by 90%, but still have to scan all 20K <code>cities</code> rows. So
20K + 2K = 22K rows, a savings of 45%.</p>
<p>If we didn't have indexes to use for the join, we would get even
bigger savings. Without an index we're reduced to a cross join, which
means we're examining 20K * 50 rows, 1M rows total. Pushdown reduces
this to (20k + 50) + (2K * 4), so 28,050 rows total: a savings of
97.2%. (To truly do only 4 lookups on the secondary table we need to
load it entirely into memory during join analysis, which the engine
will do for a table this small).</p>
<p>That's a great start. Can we do better?</p>

<p>If we want this query to be faster, we'll need an index on it. So
let's create a new column for the first letter of the names of cities
and states, and populate it:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code>pushdown<span>&gt;</span> <span>alter</span> <span>table</span> cities <span>add</span> <span>column</span> first_letter <span>char</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

                    <p><a href="https://www.snowflake.com/data-warehousing-glossary/data-enrichment/">Data enrichment</a> is a powerful technique for adding valuable context to your customer data, and it’s simple in theory – given a bit of data about a record (e.g. a user's email or the IP of a web session), tell me more information about it so I can take effective action (e.g. map the email domain to a company or map the IP to a geolocation). In practice, however, it can be difficult to integrate a data enrichment process into an existing ELT pipeline, for a few reasons:</p><ul><li><strong>Maintaining Freshness: </strong>How recent are the results being correlated with my data? This may be a function of how often external datasets are loaded or how up-to-date your third-party data provider’s information is.</li><li><strong>Ensuring Consistency: </strong>Once data is enriched with new attributes, can I easily push those attributes to my warehouse and SaaS tools to maintain a synchronized data model?</li><li><strong>Limiting Resource Usage: </strong>Enrichment processes can be expensive in storage costs (to maintain huge third-party data sets), processing time, and API quota usage for paid enrichment services. And enrichment processes shouldn’t unnecessarily repeat the same work over and over again.</li></ul><p>In this post, I’ll share our recipe for enriching our own customer data at Census using the <a href="https://clearbit.com/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Clearbit</a> API, Snowflake External Functions, and <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/product/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">dbt</a> to enrich data correctly and efficiently over large data sets.</p><p>One note before we begin, if you’re new to data enrichment: there’s a key difference between enriching using a dataset and enriching using an API. Some enrichment pipelines make use of third party datasets that can be purchased in their entirety – you can see many examples of these in the <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/data-marketplace/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Snowflake Data Marketplace</a>. This kind of data can be easier to work with because you can rely on your warehouse to efficiently <code>LEFT JOIN</code> to these datasets and materialize the result on a schedule. However, an enrichment API doesn’t give you the full dataset to work with; it replies to your queries (one at a time or in bulk) in a request-reply style to tell you if the API has additional data for the company or person in question. These are more challenging to work with in a data warehousing context, and we built this pipeline so that we can perform both types of enrichment without leaving the comfort of our warehouse SQL environment.</p><h3 id="snowflake-s-external-functions">Snowflake's External Functions</h3><p>External functions are a recentaddition in modern data warehouses. An external function is like a traditional <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/user-defined-functions.html">user-defined function (UDF)</a>, but it allows you to break free of the database sandbox by calling an external handler to calculate results. For example, Redshift has basic support for <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_CREATE_EXTERNAL_FUNCTION.html" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">external functions</a> that call Lambda functions to compute their results.</p><p>Snowflake's <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/external-functions-introduction.html" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">external functions</a> call out to an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">AWS API Gateway</a> endpoint to retrieve results, which allows us to connect many different handlers, including Lambda functions. Calls from SQL will be batched into JSON HTTP requests and proxied to the configured handler, which needs to unwrap the batch items, calculate appropriate values, and then return a batch of results as JSON. Setting up a gateway and handlers in AWS for the first time isn’t trivial, but the design allows a lot of flexibility. I won't go through that process in this post but you can read about it in Snowflake's <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/external-functions-creating-aws.html" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">documentation</a>. We automate this using a <a href="https://www.terraform.io/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Terraform</a> module, which we hope to open source soon.

<p><em>What follows is a guest post by Christopher Bartel</em>, <em>Professor of Philosophy at Appalachian State University</em></p>



<p>Is it ever morally wrong to commit violent or immoral acts in a video game? Video games are just images, right? No matter what I do in a video game, I am just interacting with images, and harming an image doesn’t cause any real-world harm. So, all of my actions in games must be morally neutral. This is a perfectly reasonable (and common) line of thought. But I think it’s wrong. Here’s why.</p>



<p>Forget about video games for a moment. Let me ask you a different question: is it ever morally wrong to harm a photograph? Photographs are just glossy pieces of paper that share a visual resemblance to people, places, and things. Like video games, photographs are just images.</p>



<p>But it can be morally wrong to harm a photograph. Imagine that a white supremacist burns a photograph of Martin Luther King Jr. Or imagine someone burning a photo of the Pope, or of the Queen of England. Are these actions really morally neutral? I don’t think they are (which I’ve argued for&nbsp;<a href="https://rdcu.be/b7Yli">here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/aesthj/ayx031">here</a>). How we behave toward inanimate objects is not accidental. We have our reasons and our reasons can be morally problematic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A photograph of my grandfather&nbsp;<em>is not</em>&nbsp;my grandfather. It has no feelings and cannot be hurt. It is merely a glossy piece of paper that visually resembles my grandfather. Now, imagine that I burn the photograph. Does my burning the photograph&nbsp;<em>mean</em>&nbsp;anything? In one sense, you might think not. There is nothing morally wrong with burning glossy pieces of paper. And I might have some understandable and morally innocent reason to burn the photograph. Suppose I decide to simplify my life, to get rid of all the stuff cluttering my house packed away in boxes that I never open. I am not a sentimental person after all. So, after binge-watching hours of Marie Kondo, I decide it’s time to get rid of my boxes of old photographs by burning them. It is a purely pragmatic decision to declutter my life. This seems fine because I am merely thinking of the photograph as an image—just another photo tucked away in a box.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, if my reasons for burning the photograph are directed instead toward the subject of the photograph, then something more is going on. Suppose that I harbor some malicious and vindictive animosity toward my grandfather. In this case, my burning of his photograph is potent with meaning. I am not just burning any old photograph, rather it is&nbsp;<em>him</em>&nbsp;that I am fictionally burning. But,&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;do I want to burn his photograph? What are my reasons for defacing his image? Is my animosity toward my grandfather justified? Was he worthy of such animosity? Or am I being unreasonably malicious?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Think of my earlier examples—burning a photograph of Dr. King, or of the Pope, or of the Queen. If my reasons for burning these inanimate objects are directed toward the people depicted in them, then my reasons and my behaviors toward these objects&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;open to moral scrutiny. In these instances, the objects take on some symbolic meaning and my actions become symbolic too. My actions indicate something about my attitudes, values, and respect (or lack of respect) for the subject of the symbolic image. And we can morally criticize people for their attitudes and values just as much as we can criticize someone for their actions.</p>



<p>The important thing to notice here is that the object of moral condemnation in these cases is not the individual’s&nbsp;<em>actions</em>&nbsp;toward a glossy piece of paper. Rather, it is the individual’s&nbsp;<em>attitude</em>&nbsp;toward the person who’s in the photograph that is morally questionable. It is morally wrong to hold malicious attitudes toward other people even when we don’t act on those attitudes and the malicious things we do to photographs (or symbols more generally) reveal something about our attitudes toward those real-world subjects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The same is true of video games. When we interact with a video game, we are merely interacting with images. But it is not the player’s actions toward those images that are morally interesting. It is their attitudes toward the image’s subject that matters morally. Consider a recent controversy over&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>. In one small town in the game, the player can interact with a suffragette who is campaigning for women’s right to vote. Many gamers have posted videos of themselves beating the suffragette unconscious, giving their videos titles like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/nov/07/red-dead-redemption-2-game-criticised-over-killing-of-suffragette">“Beating up annoying feminist”</a>. The player’s actions may be fictional, but their attitudes are non-fictional.</p>

<p>Video games are works of fiction to be sure. What happens in a game is not real and cannot be held to the&nbsp;<em>same </em>moral scrutiny as our real-world actions. But that does not mean that our actions in video games can never be held to&nbsp;<em>any</em>&nbsp;moral scrutiny, as if they were entirely morally neutral. Video games often make use of the depiction of people, events, or scenarios that resonate with us; and by resonating with us, they invoke something of our real-world attitudes toward them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consider a few other examples.&nbsp;<em>Battle Raper</em>&nbsp;is a Japanese erotic game released in 2002 featuring hand-to-hand combat. When the player-character strikes a female opponent, her clothes fall off. After the female opponent is defeated, the player has the option to rape her.&nbsp;<em>Jesus Strikes Back: Judgment Day</em>&nbsp;is a third-person shooter. It was released in 2019. The player can choose to play as Hitler, “Tromp”, or Jesus Christ. The player’s mission is to kill a horde of immigrants, transgender people, and feminists. For the player who is drawn to these games, they are not “just games”. They are effigies. The player acts out symbolic violence on these effigies, which betrays the player’s attitudes toward their real-world counterparts. And attitudes themselves can be open to moral scrutiny.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are many reasons why players commit acts of violence in games, just like there are many reasons why someone might burn a photograph. Some of those reasons are morally innocent—because the violence offers a challenge, is novel, and is aesthetically rich. Indeed, many players engage in violent acts in video games for purely strategic reasons having to do with the competition—enacting violence is how you win. However, there are other reasons why players commit acts of violence in games that are not morally innocent. The moral relevance of our actions toward mere images is dependent on our attitudes and motivations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Perhaps you—dear reader—are still not convinced. I ask you, then, to try this experiment at home. The experiment comes in two stages. Stage One: Take a photograph of someone you love and stab the eyes out. Are you hesitant to do it? Does it make you feel uneasy? Are you unwilling to stab out the eyes? Remember, it’s just a glossy piece of paper. If you can stab the eyes out, then you can move on to Stage Two: leave the maimed photograph in a place where your loved one will find it. When they find it, give them a lecture on the metaphysical status of images and why your actions didn’t mean anything because photographs lack moral status. Good luck!&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>When it comes to development operations (aka DevOps) today, teams are collaborating remotely.</p><p>In fact, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/survey-over-two-thirds-of-companies-work-from-home-forever-2020-6">recent studies</a> highlight that this might be a more permanent setup for a majority of companies.</p><p>Even Stewart Butterfield, CEO of Slack, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90558814/slacks-ceo-on-why-tech-companies-have-to-make-peace-with-permanent-remote-work">predicts</a> that Slack’s future workforce will be 20-30% remote with the majority of employees appearing at work 1-2 days per week for face time with their teams.</p><div><p>As a part of this major shift, you’ll have to familiarize yourself with the many remote developer tools available that you can use to make your remote workflows easier. And if your web development team or client’s central communication platform is Slack, then you’ll be glad to know that it's one of the best remote tools out there.</p><p>So, without further ado, here are 5 ways Slack can help you streamline your software development workflows.</p></div><h2 id="1-bug-trackers">1. Bug Trackers</h2><p>Developing a website doesn’t stop the moment it’s live. As newer software, integrations, and plugins are added to the equation, not to mention factoring in the kind of device(s) your users browse on, you’re bound to encounter bugs. Fortunately, <a href="https://thegeekpage.com/14-best-bug-tracking-software-for-2020/">various bug tracking software</a> is there to automate the monitoring and tracking of bugs. Slack can be integrated with many of these programs, like Usersnap, Jira, and Bugsnag. They ensure that you and your co-developers are automatically notified, allowing everybody to deal with bugs as soon as they appear.</p><h2 id="2-github">2. GitHub</h2><p>As the leading development platform, GitHub has around 50 million web developers reliant on it to get their projects done. <a href="https://slack.github.com/">Slack’s GitHub integration</a> allows you to get link previews for public repositories and create notifications with slash commands to stay on top of your workflow. Some activities you can subscribe to include but are not limited to: commit summaries, pull requests, and deployments.</p><h2 id="3-hubot">3. HuBot</h2><p><a href="https://ops-community.slack.com/apps/A0F7XDU93-hubot">HuBot</a> was developed by developers using CoffeeScript on Node.js — a runtime environment based on JavaScript. People often use a combination of <a href="https://www.altium.com/solution/prototype-board-layout-software">different prototype board layout software</a> to proof design ideas, utilizing circuit components on breadboards to ensure that the end product comes out functional. This helps reduce the guesswork that usually goes into designing. But with HuBot integration, you’ll have access to all the web development tools that you need. Whether you need to create/read files on the server or modify the data in your database, HuBot allows you to do all this and more on Slack.</p><h2 id="4-code-snippets">4. Code Snippets</h2><p>When developing code with the team, sometimes you have to share snippets of your progress, either for checking, reports, or coaching. Slack’s desktop app has a “create and share” <a href="https://slack.com/slack-tips/share-code-snippets">snippet feature</a> that you can use. To the left of the message box, click the lightning bolt icon to access the shortcuts menu. Under “Slack,” look for “Create code or text snippet” and click it. You can either type in your code or upload a file. Click “Create snippet” to post it on your chosen channel. There’s even a keyboard shortcut for it: Shift + Command (Mac) or Ctrl (Windows) + V.</p><h2 id="5-the-ops-platform">5. The Ops Platform</h2><div><p>Need one platform to rule them all for your dev team on Slack? <a href="https://cto.ai/platform">The Ops Platform</a> is a Slack-enabled serverless infrastructure designed for the needs of fast moving development teams who want to measure what the business cares about. The embedded Commands, Pipelines and Services provide all of the tools you need to easily integrate your GitOps and ChatOps workflows, so that you can workflow smarter, not harder.</p><p>In conclusion, Slack has a ton of neat features that make it the ideal collaboration platform for developers. Slack gives you the flexibility that you need to perform your tasks, whether that’s developer tool integration or sharing code.</p><p>Hungry for more? Here are another <a href="https://cto.ai/blog/slack-hacks-14-ideas-for-developer-devops-workflows-slack-aws-twilio-lyft/">14 developer Slack hacks for you to try</a>.</p></div><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><p><em>Ria Jasper is a software developer and technical writer.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><strong>[The following is a guest post from my colleague <a href="https://rws.xoba.com/">Richard Sproat</a>. This should go without saying, but: this post does not represent the opinions of&nbsp;<em>anyone’s</em> employer.]</strong></p>
<p><span>In 2009 a </span><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/324/5931/1165/tab-figures-data"><span>paper</span></a><span> appeared in </span><i><span>Science </span></i><span>by Rajesh Rao and colleagues that claimed to show using “entropic evidence” that the thus far undeciphered Indus Valley symbol system was true writing not, as colleagues and I had </span><a href="https://crossasia-journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/ejvs/article/view/620"><span>argued</span></a><span>, a non-linguistic symbol system. Some other papers from Rao and colleagues followed, and there was also a </span><a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspa.2010.0041"><span>paper</span></a><span> in the </span><i><span>Proceedings of the Royal Society </span></i><span>by Rob Lee and colleagues that used a different “entropic” method to argue that symbols carved on stones by the Picts of Iron Age Scotland also represented language.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I, and others, were deeply skeptical (see e.g. </span><a href="https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2227"><span>here</span></a><span>) that such methods could distinguish between true writing and symbol systems that, while having structure, encoded some sort of non-linguistic information. This skepticism was fed in part by our observation that completely random meaningless “symbol systems” could be shown to fall into the “linguistic” bin according to those measures. What if anything were such methods telling us about the difference between natural language and other systems that convey meaning? My skepticism led to a sequence of presentations and papers, culminating in this </span><a href="https://www.linguisticsociety.org/sites/default/files/archived-documents/Sproat_Lg_90_2.pdf"><span>paper</span></a><span> in </span><i><span>Language</span></i><span>, where I tried a variety of statistical methods, including those of the Rao and Lee teams, in an attempt to distinguish between samples of systems that were known to be true writing, and systems known to be non-linguistic. None of these methods really worked and I concluded that simple extrinsic measures based on the distribution of symbols without knowing </span><i><span>what </span></i><span>the symbols denote, were unlikely to be of much use.</span></p>
<p><span>The upshot of this attempt at debunking Rao’s and Lee’s widely publicized work was that I convinced people who were already convinced and failed to convince those who were not. As icing on the cake, I was accused by Rao and Lee and colleagues of totally misrepresenting their work, which I most certainly had not done: indeed I was careful to consider all possible interpretations of their arguments, the problem being that their own interpretations of what they had done seemed to be rather fluid, changing as the criticisms changed; on the latter point see </span><a href="https://www.linguisticsociety.org/sites/default/files/14e_91.4Sproat.pdf"><span>my reply</span></a><span>, also in </span><i><span>Language</span></i><span>. This experience led me to pretty much give up the debunking business entirely, since people usually end up believing what they want to believe, and it is rare for people to admit they were wrong.</span></p>
<p><span>Still, there are times when one feels inclined to try to set the record straight, and one such instance is this </span><a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/translating-lost-languages-using-machine-learning-1021"><span>recent announcement</span></a><span> from MIT about work from Regina Barzilay and colleagues that purports to provide a machine-learning based system that “aims to help linguists decipher languages that have been lost to history.” The </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11054"><span>paper</span></a><span> this press release is based on (to appear in the </span><em><a href="https://transacl.org/index.php/tacl"><span>Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics</span></a></em><span>) is of course more reserved than what the MIT public relations people produced, but is still misleading in a number of ways.</span></p>
<p><span>Before I get into that though, let me state at the outset that as with the work by Rao et al. and Lee et al. that I had critiqued previously, the issue here is not that Barzilay and colleagues do not have results, but rather what one concludes from their results. And to be fair, this new work is a couple of orders of magnitude more sophisticated than what Rao and his colleagues did.</span></p>
<p><span>In brief summary, Barzilay et al’s approach is to take a text in an unknown ancient script, which may be </span><i><span>unsegmented</span></i><span> into words, along with phonetic transcriptions of a known language. In general the phonetic values of the unknown script are, well, not known, so candidate mappings are generated. (The authors also consider cases where some of the values are known, or can be guessed at, e.g. because the glyphs look like glyphs in known scripts.) The weights on the various mappings are learnable parameters, and the learning is also guided by phonological constraints such as assumed regularity of sound changes and rough preservation of the size of the phonemic inventory as languages change. (Of course, phoneme inventories can change a lot in size and details over a long history: Modern English has quite a different inventory from Proto-Indo-European. Still, since one’s best hope of a decipherment is to find languages that are reasonably closely related to the target, the authors’ assumption here may not be unreasonable.) The objective function for the learning aims to cover as much of the unknown text as possible while optimizing the quality of the extracted cognates. Their training is summarized in the following pseudocode from page 6 of their paper:</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.wellformedness.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0.png" alt="" width="2296" height="632" srcset="https://www.wellformedness.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0.png 2296w, https://www.wellformedness.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-300x83.png 300w, https://www.wellformedness.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-1024x282.png 1024w, https://www.wellformedness.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-768x211.png 768w, https://www.wellformedness.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-1536x423.png 1536w, https://www.wellformedness.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-2048x564.png 2048w, https://www.wellformedness.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-500x138.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 2296px) 100vw, 2296px"></p>
<p><span>One can then compare the results of the algorithm when run with the unknown text, and a </span><i><span>set</span></i><span> of known languages, to see which of the known languages is the best model. The work is thus in many ways similar to earlier </span><a href="https://www.isi.edu/natural-language/mt/decipher06.pdf"><span>work</span></a><span> by Kevin Knight and colleagues, which the present paper also cites.</span></p>
<p><span>In the experiments the authors used three ancient scripts: </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugaritic"><span>Ugaritic</span></a><span> (12th century BCE), a close relative of Hebrew; Gothic, a 4th century CE East Germanic language that is also the earliest preserved Germanic tongue; and Iberian, a heretofore undeciphered script — or more accurately a collection of scripts — of the late pre-Common Era from the Iberian peninsula. (It is worth noting that Iberian was very likely to have been a mixed </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_scripts"><span>alphabetic-syllabic</span></a><span> script, not a purely alphabetic one, which means that one is giving oneself a bit of a leg up if one bases one’s work on a transliteration of those texts into a purely alphabetic form.) The comparison known languages were Proto-Germanic, Old Norse, Old English, Latin, Spanish, Hungarian, Turkish, Basque, Arabic and Hebrew. (I note in passing that Latin and Spanish seem to be assigned by the authors to different language families!)</span></p>
<p><span>For Ugaritic, Hebrew came out as dramatically closer than other languages, and for Gothic, Proto-Germanic. For Iberian, no language was a dramatically better match, though Basque did seem to be somewhat closer. As they argue (p. 9):</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>The picture is quite different for Iberian. No language seems to have a pronounced advantage over others. This seems to accord with the current scholarly understanding that Iberian is a language isolate, with no established kinship with others.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>“Scholarly understanding” may be an overstatement since the most one can say at this point is that there is </span><i><span>scholarly disagreement </span></i><span>on the relationships between the Iberian language(s) and known languages.</span></p>
<p><span>But, in any case, one problem is that since they only perform this experiment for three ancient scripts, two of which they are able to find clear relationships for, and the third not so clearly, it is not obvious what if anything one can conclude from this. The statistical sample is not such as to be overwhelming in its significance. Furthermore, in at least one case there is a serious danger of circularity: the closest match they find for Gothic is with Proto-Germanic, which shows a much better match than the other Germanic languages, Old Norse or Old English. But that is hardly surprising: Proto Germanic reconstructions are heavily informed by Gothic, the earliest recorded example of a Germanic language. Indeed, if Gothic were truly an unknown language, and assuming that we had no access to a reconstructed protolanguage that depends in part on Gothic for its reconstruction, then we would be left with the two known Germanic languages in their set, Old English and Old Norse. This of course would be a more reasonable model in any case for the situation a real decipherer would encounter. But then the situation for Gothic becomes much less clear. Below is their Figure 4, which plots various settings of their coverage threshold hyperparameter </span><i><span>r</span></i><i><span>cov</span></i> <span>against the obtained coverage. The more separated the curve for the language is above the rest, the better the method is able to distinguish the closest matched language from everything else. With this in mind, Hebrew is clearly a lot closer to Ugaritic than anything else. Iberian, as we noted, does not have a language that is obviously closest, though Basque is a contender. For Gothic, Proto-Germanic (PG) is a clear winner, but if one removed that the closest two are now Old English (OE) and Old Norse (ON). Not bad, of course, but just eyeballing the plots, the situation is no longer as dramatic, and not clearly more dramatic than the situation for Iberian.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.wellformedness.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-1.png" alt="" width="2166" height="1782" srcset="https://www.wellformedness.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-1.png 2166w, https://www.wellformedness.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-1-300x247.png 300w, https://www.wellformedness.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-1-1024x842.png 1024w, https://www.wellformedness.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-1-768x632.png 768w, https://www.wellformedness.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-1-1536x1264.png 1536w, https://www.wellformedness.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-1-2048x1685.png 2048w, https://www.wellformedness.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-1-365x300.png 365w" sizes="(max-width: 2166px) 100vw, 2166px"></p>
<p><span>And as for Iberian, again, they note (p. 9) that “Basque somewhat stands out from the rest, which might be attributed to its similar phonological system with Iberian”. But what are they comparing against? Modern Basque is certainly different from its form 2000+ years ago, and indeed if one buys into </span><a href="https://julietteblevins.ws.gc.cuny.edu/proto-basque/"><span>recent work by Juliette Blevins</span></a><span>, then Ancient Basque was phonologically quite a bit different from the modern language. Which in turn leaves one wondering what these results are telling us.</span></p>
<p><span>The abstract of the paper opens with the statement that:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>Most undeciphered lost languages exhibit two characteristics that pose significant decipherment challenges: (1) the scripts are not fully segmented into words; (2) the closest known language is not determined.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Of course this is all perfectly true, but it rather understates the case when it comes to the real challenges faced in most cases of decipherment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To wit:</span></p>
<p><span>Not only is the “closest … language” not usually known, but there may not even</span><i><span> be</span></i><span> a closest language. This appears to be the situation for Linear A where, even though there is a substantial amount of Linear A text, and the syllabary is very similar in appearance and was almost certainly the precursor to the deciphered Linear B, decipherment has remained elusive for 100 years in large measure because we simply do not know anything about the Eteocretan Language. It is also the situation for Etruscan. The authors of course …</span></p></div></div>

ChessCaptcha.</h3>

<p>This is a captcha system where the user either recreates the position of the pieces on the board - <em>non chess savvy users</em> - or she solves a mate-in-one puzzle by putting the piece on the square where it gives the checkmate - <em>chess savvy users only</em>. There is also a no-js fallback that exists mostly as a placeholder for future iterations; don't use it.</p>

          <h3>
Usage.</h3>

<h4>Copy the position mode. - Default</h4>
<p>
  In this mode which happens to be the one where the user needs no chess knowledge at all to use, he simply drags the pieces
  into the board trying to replicate the position shown in the image.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://elioair.github.io/chesscaptcha/images/chesscaptchausage.gif">
</p>
<h4>Mate in One mode</h4>
<p>
  Here the user is given a position and where he has to move a piece to create a mating position on the board.
  Only chess players -and maybe computer engines. cough..!- will be able to solve this. It can be used for example in chess sites
  to determine if the user is really a chess player or a simple spammer.

<h4>Color Tolerance</h4>
<p>
  If needed you can turn on color tolerance. In this case the validation will be color agnostic and for example the white king will be 
  considered equal to the black king.

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="the-collapse-of-political-economy">The Collapse of Political Economy</h2><p><strong>The invention of</strong> the individual is a relatively recent phenomenon. As the modern state’s development accelerated across the 19<sup>th</sup> century due to new technologies of transport and communications, complex social relations in both urban and rural areas collapsed. The response of ideological actors within the state, market, and civil society, was to encourage the creation of the worldview of progressive individualism. This doctrine was a way to socially engineer society for new purposes, namely, transhumanism and man’s escape from the restrictions of biology and nature. In this worldview, only the individual and state were meant to exist and, in a capitalist society, the market would mediate between the two. Because human beings are predisposed to form group feelings with each other this effort was destined to fail. The 14<sup>th</sup> century sociologist Ibn Khaldun termed this sentiment <em>asabiya</em>, meaning group solidarity or tribal feeling.<sup>1</sup> When possessing <em>asabiya</em>, members of an in-group are inclined to subsume any sense of “self-interest” entirely into the interest of the whole. As complex social relations and networks melted away, “society” was meant to substitute the subconscious yearning of the individual to find group feeling in an abstract blob of people.</p><p>The rise of economics, financialization of the economy, collapse of complex social relations, and homogenization of society into a mass of individual consumers combined to bring disaster. America, hoodwinked for decades by an ideology that asserted free trade would bring freedom worldwide, finds itself on the back foot against a calculating actor, China, that eschews economics as an ideology, seeing it merely as a toolkit to advance other, primarily political, interests. In America, society is collapsing. Americans are killing themselves at record rates; drug abuse is at a record high; and ever more young girls find themselves on the Tiktok-to-OnlyFans exploitation conveyor belt. Marriage and fertility rates are collapsing—although divorce isn’t doing too poorly. The coronavirus has brought all of this to a head and revealed just how rotten America’s social base has become. Still, the worst has yet to come. The November election threatens a new wave of social unrest and political polarization. Coronavirus lockdowns have revealed that most of the economy is quite simply fake and non-existent, with millions of people working fake jobs with accreditation rendered increasingly worthless due to inflation.</p><p>This political-economic experiment has failed. Our world has not seen greater justice and equality as a result of the triumph of the individual-market-state nexus. More importantly, the liberal institutions that underpin this nexus have proven unable to update themselves in the face of a rising techno-surveillance society. Liberalism has failed to meet the technology challenge, and it is being dragged into the void left behind by its “creative destruction” of faith and family. Any “new deal” that looks to rebuild communities has to take into account that liberalism is now living on the exhausted fumes of its inheritance. There needs to be a willingness to look at post-liberal solutions. Note that post-liberalism is not a repudiation of liberalism but its evolution, continuing with the good and surgically eliminating the bad—much of which has contributed to the destruction of faith and community, ultimately threatening the existence of the Republic.</p><p>My contribution to this emerging post-liberal framework is to borrow and synthesize it with elements from foreign civilizational frameworks to build a more just political economy. It isn’t good enough to handwave about the common good. We need real creativity and reorganization of communities; we must consider the way political structures interact with and sustain the health of these vital building blocks of civilization. Faiths are the last real nationwide communities left in America’s social hellscape. In particular, the three Abrahamic faiths—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—possess the social technologies necessary to subsist for long periods of time, through rise and decline, prosperity and famine. They are anchors for civilizations in turmoil. It is incumbent we look at how exactly these faiths have survived around the world for such a long time so that we can adopt their traditions, methods, and norms to rebuild the foundations of today’s society.</p><p>I want especially to look at Islamic civilization’s heritage in matters of governance, political economy, and law. This legacy of thought is extensive and has existed in a symbiotic relationship with correspondent European traditions for over a millennium. It is not as alien as it may first appear, even if some wish it to be so. One of the modern state’s main problems, not just in America but worldwide, is that it opposes all forms of territorial autonomy not granted by the state itself. At best, this is bound within some sort of federalist structure. However, most of the thinking done by scholars and activists on autonomy and decentralization has focused on territorial autonomy. The Islamic millet system was a non-territorial form of autonomy that did not threaten the state’s control over its territory. Out-sourcing key functions of governance to communities, it devolved such duties as judiciary, education, and security. The millet system shares many principles with the American federalist system and can be adapted to the American tradition to help rebuild family and community, develop a healthy relationship with the state, and create a more just political economy.</p><p>Milletism is not integralism. Integralism, a political theory that has been in vogue among the Catholic right, entails the subordination of state to church to achieve a moral, common good. Integralism is only made possible by the existence of a centralized institution like the Catholic Church. Unlike the development of state-church relations in Europe, there has never been a centralized religious institution in Islamic civilization. The forefathers of America fled Europe to escape the tyranny and conflict arising between centralized religious and secular power. In doing so, they created a political and social system that at once prevented religious conflict from taking over at the top and ensured a level of decentralization that enabled various faith groups to live in peace. As such, there could be no a priori consideration of a division between the temporal and the divine, as these were not embodied in distinct institutions like the state and church, respectively. The boundaries between the secular (<em>qanun</em>, derived from the Latin “canon”) and the revelation (<em>shar’i</em>) have always been fluid. More importantly, this means the millet model followed a path dependency of development that provided both greater community autonomy alongside the state. It did not threaten political power and incentivized rulers to respect local autonomy. The millet system offers incentives to actors across social strata—except, of course, those whose interests it is to continually atomize and destroy social bonds for the sake of economic rent-seeking or radical political centralization, the road to tyranny.</p><h2 id="the-basis-of-an-alliance-sacr-e-in-the-21st-century"><em>The Basis of an Alliance Sacrée </em>in the 21st Century</h2><p><strong>In introducing Islamicate</strong> ideas of social, political, and economic organization to a western audience who may react with bewilderment if not hostility, it is important to establish a basis of cooperation and dialogue. Especially in times where we see the rise of pedophilia in music and film to the aggressive silencing of our beliefs and traditions, the Abrahamic faiths now need each other more than they oppose each other. Times have changed, and while some still meme about crusades to conquer Jerusalem or jihads to conquer Rome, faith communities are besieged by an incredibly aggressive and totalizing ideology that renders these issues irrelevant.</p><p>In Genesis, God promised Abraham:</p><p><em>And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.</em><sup>2</sup></p><p>Over half of the world’s population belongs to one of the three Abrahamic faiths. Outside of East Asia and India, the Abrahamic faiths predominate. God’s promise to Abraham was fulfilled. The shared blood and history of the children of Isaac and Ismael mean that there are primordial values, applicable across space-time, that characterize the core essence of the Abrahamic worldview. This shared experience distinguishes us, on a planetary scale, from any other group of beliefs, be they Sinic, Indic, or otherwise. These values should operate as the basis of collaboration against the encroaching power of the state and aggressive ideologies. As the beleaguered bearers of a worldview still imbued with the presence of the divine, the Abrahamic faiths’ response to the challenges of modernity has so far been haphazard and poor. Organized collaboration based on shared interests is almost non-existent beyond interfaith conferences and flaccid statements about tolerance and coexistence.</p><p>The English polymath and Islamic scholar Abdul Hakim Murad has repeatedly called for an “<em>alliance sacrée</em>” between the Abrahamic faiths to resist encroaching secularization and its deleterious effects: family breakdown, social atomization, and the rise of ersatz religions turning into bloody revolutions and cults.<sup>3</sup> If the imperative for Abrahamic collaboration is clear, then what are the fundamental principles that would underlie this collaboration? Ismail Royer offers a useful syllogism from the Muslim perspective:<sup>4</sup></p><p><strong>1.</strong> Islam, Christianity, and Judaism are all true in the things they agree on.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Christianity &amp; Judaism are false in the things they disagree on with Islam.</p><p>Point 1 is the basis of …</p></div></div>

One electrode, the anode, is buried inside the soil, while the other, the cathode, is exposed to air on the soil surface.</p><p>Electrigens populate the surface of the anode and as they ‘consume’ the organic compounds present in soil, they generate electrons. These electrons are transferred to the anode and travel to the cathode via the external circuit, generating electricity.</p><p>By building a stack of several SMFCs, and by connecting this to a battery it is possible to harvest and store this energy, and use it to power an electrochemical reactor for water treatment.</p><p>A single SMFC unit costs just a few pounds, which could be further reduced with mass production and with the use of local resources for the electrode fabrication.</p><h2><b>Cheap and sustainable solution for a chlorination problem</b></h2><p>The need for sustainable water purification in the area stems from the fact that the main supply of water is from precipitation, which needs to be chlorinated to be drinkable.</p><p>The technology, installed at the EEF Professora Mizinha of Icapuí primary school, creates a small amount of power, which can be used to purify up to three litres of water in about a day.

October 28, 2020 | https://macwright.com/2020/10/28/if-not-spas.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://macwright.com/2020/10/28/if-not-spas.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few months ago, I <a href="https://macwright.com/2020/05/10/spa-fatigue.html">wrote an article about how the SPA pattern has failed to simplify web development</a>. The <em>SPA pattern</em> (Single-Page Apps), I tried to define, was about the React model, which also covers, to a large extent, the model of Vue, Angular, and other frontend frameworks.</p><p>Like any critique, it begs for a prescription and I didn’t give one, other than gesturing toward server-side frameworks like Rails and Django. But I think there are some trends starting to form. I had queued up some time to <em>really dive into the frameworks</em>, but things like <a href="https://macwright.com/2020/10/12/holly-park.html">walking in parks</a> have taken priority, so here’s just a grand tour.</p><h3 id="opinionated-full-stack-javascript-frameworks">Opinionated full-stack JavaScript frameworks</h3><p>Primarily I’m talking about <a href="https://remix.run/features">Remix</a>, <a href="https://redwoodjs.com/">RedwoodJS</a>, and <a href="https://blitzjs.com/">Blitz.js</a>, though I’m sure there are similar efforts in the non-React world that are relevant. <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> <em>almost</em> falls into this category, but as far as I can tell, it’s still unopinionated about the data layer and most sites that use Next.js are still going to use a separate API stack. But that’s subject to change, because all of these are moving fast.</p><p>It’s interesting to note that Remix, Redwood, and Next are all backed by companies or foundations, and that Blitz is aiming early on to be a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/blitz-js">sponsor-funded project</a>. These projects, I think, are trying to sidestep the “tragedy of the commons” failures of earlier open source, wherein overworked and unpaid maintainers service a large userbase and eventually burn out and abandon the project.</p><p>To take Remix as an example, it re-ties data loading with routes, and then gives the pretty amazing promise of <em>no client side data fetching by default</em>. These frameworks are also <em>opinionated about status codes and caching strategies</em>. RedwoodJS automatically creates an <a href="https://redwoodjs.com/tutorial/side-quest-how-redwood-works-with-data">ORM-like interface using GraphQL and Prisma</a>.</p><p>As context, Remix is backed by the folks from <a href="https://reacttraining.com/">React Training</a>, who are also the folks from <a href="https://reactrouter.com/">React Router</a>, which is as much React pedigree as you can get without joining the team at Facebook. Redwood is run by <a href="https://prestonwernerventures.com/">Preston-Werner Ventures</a>, of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Preston-Werner">Tom Preston-Werner</a>, a GitHub founder. Next.js is sponsored and heavily promoted by <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>, née Zeit.</p><h3 id="turbolinks">Turbolinks</h3><p>It’s worthwhile to just mention <a href="https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks">Turbolinks</a>. I didn’t use it until this year, and apparently there were issues with it before, but the pitch for Turbolinks 5 is: <em>what is the bare minimum you need to do to get the SPA experience without any cooperation from your application?</em></p><p>So it’s a tiny JavaScript library that sits on top of an existing server-rendered application and replaces full pageloads with SPA-like partial pageloads. Instead of loading a page from scratch, pages are loaded with AJAX, page contents are replaced, and client-side navigation updates your URLs. Basically, it prevents the ‘blink’ of real page transitions and saves on all othe sorts of costs of fully loading a new page. Turbolinks was spawned from the <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> project, and works great with Rails but doesn’t require it.</p><p>In terms of power-to-weight for user experience improvements, Turbolinks is a standout: it adds very little complexity and a tiny size impact for a big user experience improvement.</p><h3 id="server-side-state-frameworks">Server-side-state frameworks</h3><p>These are the spiciest new solution. The main contenders are <a href="https://laravel-livewire.com/">Laravel Livewire</a> (in PHP), <a href="https://docs.stimulusreflex.com/">Stimulus Reflex</a> (for Ruby on Rails), and <a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view">Phoenix LiveView</a> (on Phoenix, in Elixir).</p><p>The pitch here is: <em>what if you didn’t have to write any JavaScript?</em> It sort of hearkens back to the critique of JavaScript in <a href="https://vimeo.com/5047563">_why’s ART &amp;&amp; CODE talk</a>, that web development is the only kind where you normally have to write in three (or more) languages. These languages also most remnants of “client-side” logic, putting it all on the server side.</p><p>How do they do this? Well, a lot of WebSockets, in the case of Reflex and LiveView, as well as very tightly coupled server interactions. As you can see in the <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/build-a-real-time-twitter-clone-in-15-minutes-with-live-view-and-phoenix-1-5">LiveView demo</a>, which I highly recommend, these frameworks tend to operate sort of like reactive DOM libraries on the front end – in which the framework figures out minimal steps to transform from one state to another - except those steps are computed on the server side and then generically applied on the client side. They also do a lot more data storage &amp; state management on the server-side, because a lot of those interactions which wouldn’t be persisted to the server are now at least communicated to the server.</p><p>These frameworks are exciting, and also extremely contrarian, because they are the polar opposite of the “frontend plus agnostic API layer” pattern, and they also wholeheartedly embrace the thing everyone tries to avoid: mutable state on the server.</p><h3 id="modest-progressive-enhancement-javascript-frameworks">Modest progressive-enhancement JavaScript frameworks</h3><p>These are typically used “in addition” to the above, but they certainly deserve a shout-out because I think a wide swath of frontend-programming concerns actually only need a tiny hint of JavaScript. But the main caveat is that <em>they assume that you know JavaScript and the DOM</em>, which are not necessarily universal skills anymore. A lot of developers growing up on React have acquired a real blind spot for native browser APIs.</p><p>The main ones I’ve looked at are <a href="https://stimulusjs.org/">Stimulus</a> (out of the Ruby on Rails camp), <a href="https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine/">Alpine</a>, and <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmlx</a>. They’re all tiny, and work great in <em>existing pages</em>. I think – and here come the flames – <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components">Web Components</a> also fit into this sphere of progressive enhancement! If you just use good web components - <a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aweb-components+org%3Agithub&amp;type=Repositories">only ones that GitHub writes is a good rule of thumb</a> - then they can fit the role of just improving an existing static UI. It’s where you start to use Web Components as an apples-to-apples replacement for full-fledged frontend frameworks is where things seem to get dicey.</p><p>These frameworks have the luxury of operating on a deeply improved web stack, one with fundamental components like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">fetch()</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver">MutationObserver</a>. These things were previously at the core of the utility of progressive enhancement frameworks, and now they can just be the utilities that those frameworks build on.</p><hr><p>I’m sure that there are additional patterns out there! But these currents all seem strong right now, and it’s fascinating to see some really divergent and adventurous – and common-sense – approaches start to crop up.</p></div></div>]]>

October 28, 2020 | https://www.swyx.io/svelte-sites-react-apps/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.swyx.io/svelte-sites-react-apps/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In 2020, my personal recommendation to web developers is to use <strong>Svelte for Sites, and React for Apps</strong>. This is, remarkably, a nuanced enough opinion that it pisses off fans of <em>either</em> of them.</p>
<p>I mentioned this in my <a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/432/">Shoptalk Show interview</a> and Chris Coyier encouraged me to blog about it. Let me try to explain.</p>
<section>
  <h2 id="sites-vs-apps"><a href="#sites-vs-apps">Sites vs Apps</a></h2>
  <p>First, I have to make a distinction between (Web) Sites and (Web) Apps. There are serious, intelligent people who insist that there isn't one. They want to build everything on the web with the same tech. Respectfully, <a href="https://macwright.com/2020/08/22/clean-starts-for-the-web.html">they are wrong</a>.</p>
  <p><strong>Web Sites</strong> primarily display content, while interaction is limited. First-load times are paramount since users may bounce and/or their limited data/power/CPU may deprive them of important information (see <a href="https://infrequently.org/2017/10/can-you-afford-it-real-world-web-performance-budgets/">Alex Russell for math on a reasonable baseline</a> but let's say you definitely want &lt;200kb in the critical path). This was the web's original usecase - displaying information - and it is what HTML/CSS/Browsers are great at.</p>
  <p><strong>Web Apps</strong> primarily exist for interaction. CRUD apps, livestream apps, games, whatever. These apps tend to be heavier, which is unfortunate because that affects their performance. But even a 2MB JS app doesn't sound so bad when it is literally competing with a 200MB mobile app, and (let's say) you're developing a B2B app where everyone is on high power and high bandwidth devices anyway. You're typically also keeping apps open longer, so the first-load issue doesn't matter as much (and can be mitigated with service workers). The challenge is even higher once you account for the fact that the Web App must ship with it all the UI components and behaviors for it to work, whereas a typical native app will usually heavily lean on platform-provided components. The web platform still lacks a lot of standard components/APIs and developer experience needed to make writing great Web Apps easy - hence the gap is filled by frameworks.</p>
  <p>I view Sites vs Apps as a spectrum. Of course, if your sites dont need ANY interaction at all, don't use any JS. But most sites have app-like features (login, reactions, comments), and many apps need to perform under site-like constraints.</p>
  <p>You'll notice that most businesses already recognize this - <code>www.mysaas.com</code> is the marketing site, <code>app.mysaas.com</code> is the app. They may start out the same codebase, but due to the vastly different requirements, they eventually split into different codebases and then different teams handling them. It's usually the idealist enthusiasts that try to make the same tech work for these clearly different purposes.</p>

<section>
  <h2 id="react-for-apps"><a href="#react-for-apps">React for Apps</a></h2>
  <p>React has been open sourced for 7 years now. It is used in production at the biggest companies and sites in the world from Apple to Twitter to Amazon to Airbnb to Uber. It has been the most cited technology in Hacker News job postings for <a href="https://www.hntrends.com/2020/may-big-drop-developer-job-postings.html">at least 36 straight months</a>. There are <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1190088019707154432?s=20">between 3-9m React developers</a>, growing <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1024974678337703937?s=20">at least &gt;50% annually</a>. The <a href="https://youtu.be/Qox56z4xH6o">third party ecosystem is vast</a> and attracting instructors, developers, companies and hundreds of millions in corporate and venture funding.</p>
  <p>Based on that <em>alone</em> it is a good tech choice to base your app on already. But these are contingent facts that don't really have anything fundamental to do with React's merits. This is offensive to <a href="https://www.swyx.io/first-principles-approach/">first principles thinkers</a>. So let me offer some <em>core</em> reasons why React is a great choice for apps:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>React Native looked troubled in 2018, but <a href="https://www.reactiflux.com/transcripts/react-native-team-2">the current team</a> seems to be executing well (as far as an outsider like me can tell). <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1301103950066671616?s=20">Flutter may yet give it a run for its money</a> someday, but has the Dart and Google hurdles to overcome. <strong>React Native is the best cross platform (mobile+web+desktop) "Write mostly once, run mostly anywhere" solution</strong> in tech today. If you have the resources to hire platform specialists, <a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/sunsetting-react-native-1868ba28e30a">you won't find this useful</a>. However, if, like the vast majority of companies, you can't afford a dedicated team of specialists per platform, React Native is your best bet.</li>
    <li>React has by far the most experience in abstraction design. <strong>Where React leads, other frameworks follow</strong> (Both Vue's <a href="https://composition-api.vuejs.org/">Composition API</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdNJ3fydeao">Svelte 3's $: API</a> directly credit React for inspiration, as do Swift UI and Jetpack Compose). This isn't to say they always get it right (<em>pop quiz: how many Context APIs are there in React?</em>) but when <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-intro.html">Concurrent Mode</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_d_vaughn/status/1308438105616191496?s=20">React Flight</a> are released, I expect it to be deeply informed by production usage at the biggest websites in the world. Suspense for Data Fetching, still not yet released, has <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/web/facebook-redesign/">been in production at Facebook</a> for over a year. I want to stress how unusual this is - typically in open source, you release something and then hope it gets picked up by a BigCo and tested at scale. With React, Facebook <strong>dogfoods it at scale</strong> before releasing to the general developer community, with <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/15257">many</a> <a href="https://github.com/facebook/prepack/wiki/react-compiler">ideas</a> <a href="https://cdb.reacttraining.com/react-call-return-what-and-why-7e7761f81843">killed</a> before they are publicly blessed, because flaws were found. Judge React as much on what it doesn't ship as you do on what it does ship.</li>
    <li>That brings me to governance. It's not perfect (many people have issues with Facebook, for one thing), but I think <strong>React is one of the best run open source projects in the world</strong>. Normally mundane things like <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-versioning.html">versioning policy</a> to <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/error-decoder.html/">error messages</a> to <a href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/10/22/react-release-channels.html">release channels</a> to <a href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/10/20/react-v17.html#gradual-upgrades">gradual upgrades</a> matter at the scale of React. The team also does a lot of informal collaboration with key ecosystem partners like Gatsby, Apollo and Next.js, including at the browser level with Chrome and the language level with TC39. The team not only deeply cares about technical governance, but also fostering an inclusive and diverse community.</li>
    <li>I hesitated to mention this last point because it technically has to do with adoption, but I cannot separate it from React's merits: it seems to have <strong>the best thinkers on accessibility and interaction design</strong> right now. No other ecosystem has projects like Adobe and Devon Govett's <a href="https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html">React Aria</a> that has extensively thought through and tested for WAI-ARIA so you don't have to. Ditto <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/07/accessible-front-end-application-chakra-ui-nuxtjs/">Segun Adebayo's Chakra UI</a>. Or listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhKglxQT4sU">Rick Hanlon on the Touchable Web</a> and realize how much web apps need to improve for the open web to reverse <a href="https://vimeo.com/364402896">its alarming decline vs. mobile walled gardens</a>.
      <ul>
        <li>Let me be clear - is the React community ACTUALLY good at these things today? Hell to the no. Most of them are still debating whether or not to learn hooks vs class components. BUT React has the best shot because it has the best abstractions that enable the best thinkers to create the web application standard library we all want.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/17004">Selective</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1200111677833973760?s=20">Progressive Hydration</a> are particularly interesting results of the Fiber rewrite. Together with a "full stack" future of React that lets the developer <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1259615888438935556?s=20">easily move code and execution between client and server</a>, the hope for making apps that feel fast without compromising on developer or user experience is extremely strong.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can, of course, use React to make sites. Gatsby and Next.js (and the upcoming <a href="https://remix.run/">Remix</a>) are great static and serverless rendering options (The "greatness" of Gatsby <a href="https://dev.to/richharris/in-defense-of-the-modern-web-2nia">is disputed</a>). <a href="https://docusaurus.io/">Docusaurus</a> is great for docs sites. If you are making sites and are worried about JS weight, you can usually <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1316540904761520129?s=20">swap Preact for React in a few lines of code</a> because you will usually not be running into any of <a href="https://preactjs.com/guide/v8/differences-to-react/">Preact's compromises</a> if you are just making a site.</p>
  <p>So why do I advocate using a different framework for sites?</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Specifically, Svelte for <em>Interactive</em> Sites</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Svelte is <a href="https://twitter.com/SvelteSociety/status/1260209026563858432?s=20">used in production</a>
    from the NY Times (of course) to Square Enix to Apple to Spotify to Google Arts to Alaska Airlines and <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/community/tree/master/who's-using-svelte">hundreds more</a>, with other big dev platforms like Amazon and Microsoft also increasingly featuring it in their content. It has a lively community with the first podcasts, YouTube channels, schools, conferences and newsletters emerging. Svelte 3 has been wildly successful and yet it is still early days.
  </p>
  <p>I'm going to let you in on a little secret: <a href="https://twitter.com/buildsghost/status/1255936971265826816?s=20">Svelte and React aren't that different</a>. Take a look <a href="https://lihautan.com/compile-svelte-in-your-head-part-1/#compile-svelte-in-your-head">under the hood of Svelte compiled output</a>:</p>
  <pre><code><span>function</span><span> </span><span>create_fragment</span><span>(</span><span>ctx</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>  </span><span>// redacted</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>App</span><span> </span><span>extends</span><span> </span><span>SvelteComponent</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>  </span><span>constructor</span><span>(</span><span>options</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>super</span><span>()</span><span>;</span>
<span>    </span><span>init</span><span>(</span><span>this,</span><span> </span><span>options</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>null,</span><span> </span><span>create_fragment</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>safe_not_equal</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>{}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>  </span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
  <p>Wtf? <code>class App extends SvelteComponent</code>?? That looks like React??</p>
  <p>Yes. Wait til you realize that <a href="https://lihautan.com/compile-svelte-in-your-head-part-1/#updating-data"><code>=</code> basically compiles to <code>setState</code></a>, or that yes, it does actually <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/tree/master/src/runtime">ship a runtime</a>, or that yes, it actually has <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/ec0f79c5af3113bedf0a5e9ae1f5f521328fcd30/src/runtime/internal/scheduler.ts">a scheduler</a> too. Like I said, where React leads, other frameworks follow. React proved Components are the right way to go.</p>
  <p>This also means that <a href="https://youtu.be/xgER1OutVvU">most React developers can learn Svelte in <em>hours</em></a> so the switching cost is low.</p>
  <p>The differences are large enough, though, in everything else:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>JS Weight</strong>. Your site might get green Lighthouse scores, but hopefully you agree that you ideally only ship JS that you use, for your users' sake. Svelte sites are often single digit kilobytes. React+React DOM is ~120kb uncompressed. You can of course slash this severely if you can switch to Preact. But Svelte offers <a href="https://twitter.com/SvelteSociety/status/1314255119555338241">the smallest measured runtime footprint</a>. We used to worry about the compiler output overhead exceeding the size of React components (smaller runtime = more boilerplate), but <a href="https://twitter.com/SvelteSociety/status/1297548737091264518?s=20">recent studies have debunked this concern completely</a>.
      <ul>
        <li>But my consideration of JS weight extends beyond just the framework. Anecdotally, the kind of people that are drawn to Svelte seem to be more performance-minded than those in React (see everything that <a href="https://github.com/lukeed/">lukeed</a> makes). This comes from the top - where React devs often import heavy dependencies as long as they kinda fit the usecase, Rich Harris is the kind of stubborn developer that makes his own version of everything because he just needs it to do a smaller job. But also, Svelte is most people's <em>second</em> framework, so they come to it with more of a performance mindset. Collectively, the dependency choices encouraged by the framework's culture also impact the end result of JS weight.</li>

<p>Ian Goodfellow introduced Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) in 2014. It was one of the most beautiful, yet straightforward implementations of Neural Networks, and it involved two Neural Networks competing against each other. <em>Yann LeCun, </em>the founding father of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), described GANs as “<strong>the most interesting idea in the last ten years in Machine Learning</strong>“.</p>



<p>In simple words, the idea behind GANs can be summarized like this:</p>



<ul><li>Two Neural Networks are involved.</li><li>One of the networks, the Generator, starts off with a random data distribution and tries to replicate a particular type of distribution.</li><li>The other network, the Discriminator, through subsequent training, gets better at classifying a forged distribution from a real one.</li><li>Both of these networks play a min-max game where one is trying to outsmart the other.</li></ul>



<p>Easy peasy lemon squeezy… but when you actually try to implement them, they often don’t learn the way you expect them to. One common reason is the overly simplistic<a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/gan/loss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> loss function</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this blog post, we will take a closer look at GANs and <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/gan-objective-functions-gans-and-their-variations-ad77340bce3c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the different variations to their loss functions</a>, so that we can get a better insight into how the GAN works while addressing the unexpected performance issues.&nbsp;</p>






<h2>Standard GAN loss function (min-max GAN loss)</h2>



<p>The standard GAN loss function, also known as the <strong>min-max loss, </strong>was first described in a 2014 paper by Ian Goodfellow et al., titled “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Generative Adversarial Networks</a>“.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/bNCS4HQXVJHa7mAv7CqQWbyJn076w5d5liTpVOV8meRz2tYtjtR-p92opSH9zAb4Yv2qhF0hMAyWvQef3a2EqR4J_dLq3-ZjsJufN38r-FBbSB1cRUjMyd5JrExyUh9JYfOdSQ2e" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>The generator tries to minimize this function while the discriminator tries to maximize it. Looking at it as a min-max game, this formulation of the loss seemed effective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In practice, it saturates for the generator, meaning that the generator quite frequently stops training if it doesn’t catch up with the discriminator.</p>



<p>The Standard GAN loss function can further be categorized into two parts: <strong>Discriminator loss</strong> and <strong>Generator loss</strong>.</p>



<h3><strong>Discriminator loss</strong></h3>



<p>While the discriminator is trained, it classifies both the real data and the fake data from the generator.</p>



<p>It penalizes itself for misclassifying a real instance as fake, or a fake instance (created by the&nbsp; generator) as real, by maximizing the below function.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/yAT4vN1GFT8D0QUDMAReZS0BLD_vi7KZc-AE02RFWI9ZVSQHLqKTTthtgx_BK-DlKOeFDgtkA3byl9VMHPEI0r5ZTn1nKYLbeEflJuspuykXcNMOmEmXomWZzMwdzUBbxf-BlkjJ" alt="" width="566" height="100"></figure></div>



<ul><li><strong>log(D(x)) </strong>refers to the probability that the generator is rightly classifying the real image,</li><li>maximizing <strong>log(1-D(G(z))) </strong>would help it to correctly label the fake image that comes from the generator.</li></ul>



<h3><strong>Generator loss</strong></h3>



<p>While the generator is trained, it samples random noise and produces an output from that noise. The output then goes through the discriminator and gets classified as either “Real” or “Fake” based on the ability of the discriminator to tell one from the other.</p>



<p>The generator loss is then calculated from the discriminator’s classification – it gets rewarded if it successfully fools the discriminator, and gets penalized otherwise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The following equation is minimized to training the generator:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/HELs4L-7j4GKYHus3PNWUuWxd5MhoOiY1Gp0MDB71QHi4_2WueJZYApJE2Emsk6SHEdgSTjd0f_ey9OcYAOY2mfMsQb5m37zHrypxml46_6i510NPKVPxUyfEAdRHuCatnfmeNe_" alt=""></figure></div>






<h2>Non-Saturating GAN Loss</h2>



<p>A subtle variation of the standard loss function is used where the generator maximizes the log of the discriminator probabilities – <strong>log(D(G(z))).&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>This change is inspired by framing the problem from a different perspective, where the generator seeks to maximize the probability of images being real, instead of minimizing the probability of an image being fake.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This avoids generator saturation through a more stable weight update mechanism. In his <a href="https://danieltakeshi.github.io/2017/03/05/understanding-generative-adversarial-networks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog</a>, Daniel Takeshi compares the Non-Saturating GAN Loss along with some other variations.</p>






<h2>Challenges with GAN loss functions</h2>



<p>More often than not, <strong>GANs tend to show some inconsistencies in performance.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Most of these problems <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-code-the-generative-adversarial-network-training-algorithm-and-loss-functions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">are associated with their training</a> and are an active area of research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s look at some of them in detail:</p>



<h3><strong>Mode Collapse</strong></h3>



<p>This issue is on the unpredictable side of things. It wasn’t foreseen until someone noticed that the generator model could only generate one or a small subset of different outcomes or modes.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Usually, we would want our GAN to produce a range of outputs</strong>. We would expect, for example, another face for every random input to the face generator that we design.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, through subsequent training, the network learns to model a particular distribution of data, which gives us a <strong>monotonous output</strong> which is illustrated below.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="284" height="287" src="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/GAN-face-generator.png?resize=284%2C287&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/GAN-face-generator.png?w=284&amp;ssl=1 284w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/GAN-face-generator.png?resize=80%2C80&amp;ssl=1 80w" sizes="(max-width: 284px) 100vw, 284px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>In the process of training, the <strong>generator is always trying to find the one output</strong> that seems most plausible to the discriminator.</p>



<p>Because of that, the <strong>discriminator’s best strategy is always to reject the output </strong>of the generator.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But if the next generation of discriminator gets stuck in a local minimum and doesn’t find its way out by getting its weights even more optimized, it’d get easy for the next generator iteration to find the most plausible output for the current discriminator.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This way, it will keep on repeating the same output and refrain from any further training.</p>



<h3><strong>Vanishing Gradients</strong></h3>



<p>This phenomenon happens when the discriminator performs significantly better than the generator. Either the updates to the discriminator are inaccurate, or they disappear.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the proposed reasons for this is that the generator gets heavily penalized, which leads to saturation in the value post-activation function, and the eventual gradient vanishing.</p>



<h3><strong>Convergence</strong></h3>



<p>Since there are two networks being trained at the same time, the problem of GAN convergence was one of the earliest, and quite possibly one of the most challenging problems since it was created.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The utopian<strong> situation where both networks stabilize and produce a consistent result is hard to achieve in most cases.</strong> One explanation for this problem is that as the generator gets better with next epochs, the discriminator performs worse because the discriminator can’t easily tell the difference between a real and a fake one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the generator succeeds all the time, the discriminator has a 50% accuracy, similar to that of flipping a coin. This poses a threat to the convergence of the GAN as a whole.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This image below shows this problem in particular:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="622" height="459" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/GAN-accuracy.png?resize=622%2C459&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/GAN-accuracy.png?w=622&amp;ssl=1 622w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/GAN-accuracy.png?resize=300%2C221&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>As the discriminator’s feedback loses its meaning over subsequent epochs by giving outputs with equal probability, the generator may deteriorate its own quality if it continues to train on these junk training signals.</p>



<p><a href="https://medium.com/@jonathan_hui/gan-why-it-is-so-hard-to-train-generative-advisory-networks-819a86b3750b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">This </a>medium article by Jonathan Hui takes a comprehensive look at all the aforementioned problems from a mathematical perspective.</p>






<h2>Alternate GAN loss functions</h2>



<p>Several different variations to the original GAN loss have been proposed since its inception. To a certain extent, they addressed the challenges we discussed earlier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will discuss some of the most popular ones which alleviated the issues, or are employed for a specific problem statement:</p>



<h3><strong>Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN)</strong></h3>



<p>This is one of the most powerful alternatives to the original GAN loss. It <strong>tackles the problem of </strong><strong>Mode Collapse</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>Vanishing Gradient</strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>In this implementation, the <strong>activation of the output layer of the discriminator is changed from sigmoid to a linear one</strong>. This simple&nbsp; change influences the discriminator to give out a score instead of a probability associated with data distribution, so the output does not have to be in the range of 0 to 1.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here, the discriminator is called critique instead, because it doesn’t actually classify the data strictly as real or fake, it simply gives them a rating.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following loss functions are used to <strong>train the critique and the discriminator</strong>, respectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The output of the critique and the generator is not in probabilistic terms (between 0 and 1), so the absolute difference between critique and generator outputs is maximized while training the critique network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, the absolute value of the generator function is maximized while training the generator network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The original paper used RMSprop followed by clipping to prevent the weights values to explode:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/2hcD7a2_DBJpiUs9vG6XsmGB35fvtHT-yAEavn1btSmPmMmKtzv7I9tIZ5KbXA3wlt27CqdIIYohdKV9gZEjT1JIj89SmzN4IYxFZ0f_vXgBC9j0RqwxdxGscekiL6s7EX-c7vE1" alt=""></figure></div>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/aoigHuhR13wGzC5tkVMsmvS5ewsQvgWAruu8Il0bPQ10Fj8R2A8Dka8z6twI1FUr25CnLewr-r3c1v-fkzPS0Ov4OwufVrmhNcd-fxl_mBZSy702_lf-zRx-XVirVP3v56J-LwX_" alt=""></figure></div>



<h3><strong>Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN)</strong></h3>



<p>This version of GAN is used to learn a multimodal model. It basically <strong>generates descriptive labels which are the attributes associated with the particular image that was not part of the original training data.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>CGANs are mainly employed in image labelling, where both the generator and the discriminator are fed with some extra information <strong>y</strong> which works as an auxiliary information, such as class labels from or data associated with different modalities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The conditioning is usually done by feeding the information <strong>y</strong> into both the discriminator and the generator, as an additional input layer to it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The following modified loss function plays the same min-max game as in the Standard GAN Loss function. The only difference between them is that a conditional probability is used for both the generator and the discriminator, instead of the regular one.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-2.png?resize=552%2C78&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="552" height="78" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-2.png?w=736&amp;ssl=1 736w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-2.png?resize=300%2C42&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 552px) 100vw, 552px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p><strong>Why conditional probability?</strong> Because we are feeding in some auxiliary information(the green points), which helps in making it a multimodal model, as shown in the diagram below:</p>

<p>This is a good move, especially for people living in countries with <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/07/02/how-and-why-america-was-hit-so-hard-by-covid-19/">inept leadership that failed to address the COVID-19 pandemic</a> and therefore need to conduct their work and schooling remotely through software like Zoom. I enthusiastically applaud them for making this change.</p>

(Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/lynxvsjackalope">Khia</a>.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The end-to-end encryption capability arrives on the heels of their acquisition of <a href="https://keybase.io/">Keybase</a> in earlier this year. Hiring a team of security experts and cryptography engineers seems like a good move overall.</p>



<p>Upon hearing this news, I decided to be a good neighbor and take a look at their source code, with the reasoning, “If so many people’s privacy is going to be dependent on Zoom’s security, I might as well make sure they’re not doing something ridiculously bad.”</p>



<p>Except I couldn’t find their source code anywhere online. But they did publish <a href="https://github.com/zoom/zoom-e2e-whitepaper">a white paper on Github</a>…</p>







<h2>Disclaimers</h2>



<p>What follows is the opinion of some guy on the Internet with a fursona–so whether or not you choose to take it seriously should be informed by this context. It is not the opinion of anyone’s employer, nor is it endorsed by Zoom, etc. Tell your lawyers to calm their nips.</p>



<p>More importantly, I’m not here to hate on Zoom for doing a good thing, nor on the security experts that worked hard on making Zoom better for their users. The responsibility of security professionals is to the users, after all.</p>



<p>Also, these aren’t zero-days, so don’t try to lecture me about “responsible” disclosure. (That term is also <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2015/11/19/responsible-disclosure-is-wrong/">problematic</a>, by the way.)</p>



<p>Got it? Good. Let’s move on.</p>







<h2>Bizarre Design Choices in Version 2.3 of Zoom’s E2E White Paper</h2>



<p>Note: I’ve altered the screenshots to be white text on a black background, since my blog’s color scheme is darker than a typical academic PDF. You can find the source <a href="https://github.com/zoom/zoom-e2e-whitepaper/blob/d3be2a5a3e16be04f1199b92630f180ba79cb51c/zoom_e2e.pdf">here</a>.</p>



<h3>Cryptographic Algorithms</h3>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="1744" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/zoom-e2e-02/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-02.png" data-orig-size="784,652" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="zoom-e2e-02" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-02.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-02.png?w=580" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-02.png" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>It’s a little weird that they’re calculating a signature over SHA256(Context) || SHA256(M), considering Ed25519 uses SHA512 internally.</p>



<p>It would make just as much sense to sign Context || M directly–or, if pre-hashing large streams is needed, SHA512(Context || M).</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="1740" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/zoom-e2e-01/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-01.png" data-orig-size="1039,788" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="zoom-e2e-01" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-01.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-01.png?w=580" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-01.png" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>At the top of this section, it says it uses libsodium’s <code>crypto_box</code> interface. But then they go onto… not actually use it.</p>



<p>Instead, they wrote their own protocol using HKDF, two SHA256 hashes, and XChaCha20-Poly1305.</p>



<p>While secure, this isn’t <em>really</em> using the crypto_box interface.</p>



<p>The only part of the libsodium interface that’s being used is <code><a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/blob/927dfe8e2eaa86160d3ba12a7e3258fbc322909c/src/libsodium/crypto_box/curve25519xsalsa20poly1305/box_curve25519xsalsa20poly1305.c#L35-L46">crypto_box_beforenm()</a></code>, which could easily have been a call to <code>crypto_scalarmult()</code>instead (since they’re passing the output of the scalar multiplication to HKDF anyway).</p>







<p>Also, the SHA256(a) || SHA256(b) pattern returns. Zoom’s engineers must love SHA256 for some reason.</p>



<p>This time, it’s in the additional associated data for the XChaCha20-Poly1305. </p>



<p>Binding the ciphertext and the signature to the same context string is a sensible thing to do, it’s just the concatenation of SHA256 hashes is a bit weird when SHA512 exists.</p>



<h3>Meeting Leader Security Code</h3>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="1746" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/zoom-e2e-03/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-03.png" data-orig-size="760,733" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="zoom-e2e-03" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-03.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-03.png?w=580" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-03.png" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>Here we see Zoom using the a SHA256 of a constant string (“<code>Zoombase-1-ClientOnly-MAC-SecurityCode</code>“) in a construction that tries but fails to be HMAC.</p>



<p>And then they concatenate it with the SHA256 hash of the public key (which is already a 256-bit value), and then they hash the whole thing again.</p>



<p>It’s redundant SHA256 all the way down. The redundancy of “MAC” and “SecurityCode” in their constant string is, at least, consistent with the rest of their design philosophy.</p>



<p>It would be a real shame if double-hashing carried the risk of <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/382">invalidating security proofs</a>, or if <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/papers/kmd5.pdf">the security proof for HMAC</a> required a high Hamming distance of padding constants and this design decision also later <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/684.pdf">saved HMAC from related-key attacks</a>.</p>



<h3>Hiding Personal Details</h3>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1750" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/zoom-e2e-04/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-04.png" data-orig-size="739,603" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="zoom-e2e-04" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-04.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-04.png?w=580" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-04.png?w=739" alt="" srcset="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-04.png 739w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-04.png?w=150 150w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-04.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px"></figure>



<p>Wait, you’re telling me Zoom was aware of HMAC’s existence this whole time?</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="1202" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/soatoktelegrams2020-02/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatoktelegrams2020-02.png" data-orig-size="512,512" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="SoatokTelegrams2020-02" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatoktelegrams2020-02.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatoktelegrams2020-02.png?w=512" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatoktelegrams2020-02.png?w=512" alt="" srcset="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatoktelegrams2020-02.png 512w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatoktelegrams2020-02.png?w=150 150w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatoktelegrams2020-02.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"><figcaption>I give up!</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2>Enough Pointless Dunking, What’s the Takeaway?</h2>



<p>None of the design decisions Zoom made that I’ve criticized here are security vulnerabilities, but they do demonstrate an early lack of cryptography expertise in their product design.</p>



<p>After all, the weirdness is almost entirely contained in section 3 of their white paper, which describes the “Phase I” of their rollout. So what I’ve pointed out here appears to be mostly legacy cruft that wasn’t risky enough to bother changing in their final design.</p>



<p>The rest of their paper is pretty straightforward and pleasant to read. Their design makes sense in general, and each phase includes an “Areas to Improve” section.</p>



<p>All in all, if you’re worried about the security of Zoom’s E2EE feature, the only thing they can really do better is to publish the source code (and link to it from the whitepaper repository for ease-of-discovery) for this feature so independent experts can publicly review it.</p>



<p>However, they seem to be getting a lot of mileage out of the experts on their payroll, so I wouldn’t count on that happening.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><a href="https://www.ego-cms.com/tags/security"><p>Security</p></a><h2>How EGO Performs Security Testing for Risky Functionalities</h2><p>No software can be 100% protected. Yet the harm it might bring can be minimized with a proper approach to app development and testing.</p></div></div><article><div target="_blank"><p>Security breaches are reported almost every day. Data gets stolen so often there are already services like<a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/"> https://haveibeenpwned.com/</a> that monitor those attacks and inform if your credentials have been compromised.</p><p>And while you might have only been reading those reports on the Internet, for us as an app building company it's an everyday threat since we're working in probably the most data-sensitive industries: healthcare and fintech. Compromising such data may lead to everything from digital identity theft to life-threatening situations.</p><p>For instance, just recently, a woman<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/18/world/europe/cyber-attack-germany-ransomeware-death.html"> had died</a> due to a software failure in a German hospital. That failure was caused by a cyber attack and forced doctors to move the patient to another facility, but she died on her way to it.<br></p><h2>Security Testing as an Answer</h2><p>So what's our way to minimize the possibility of such outcomes? (We can only imagine the feelings of those QA guys who – although most probably unintentionally – overlooked that threat in the software and made this attack possible).&nbsp;</p><p>There's a number of techniques that all can be united by one broad term "security testing". Its scope varies from project to project and may include or combine such activities as finding and removing system vulnerabilities and weaknesses, penetration testing, line-by-line code inspection, and others.</p><p>Instead of diving into technical aspects of our work, we'd like to dedicate a few sentences to its importance.</p><p>Often companies tend to save money on or postpone security testing, mainly due to three reasons:</p><ol role="list"><li>Their business is too small/unimportant to be targeted by hackers</li><li>There is no return on investment</li><li>The software can never be perfectly secure OR it's much easier to install some third-party tool for data protection.</li></ol><p>However, that attitude is exactly the reason data breaches happen so often. Yes, databases leak every day, and a single database might be of no significant value. But when they are combined, such new big data provides an enormous amount of information about people, starting with the time they usually come home from work and their most often ordered pizza to the passwords of their email accounts and CVV codes of their credit cards.</p><p>Now, it might seem that security testing is something very vague for a non-technical person. How can you know that your development team is actually working on your product's security?</p><p>Answering this question, any app building company would say something like:</p><blockquote>“– Our QA team finds a unique testing approach for every project, and to do that, they apply experience from the decade of work in this area.”</blockquote><p>Yet in real life, it is only during your interaction with the most reliable teams you'll be getting an answer to that question.&nbsp;</p><p>Most often, you’ll get detailed reports on what vulnerabilities and breaches were found and fixed. But that's not all. Security testing also reveals additional ways to protect user data.<br></p><p>For instance, here is only a couple of things we suggested and developed in our latest projects:&nbsp;</p><ol role="list"><li>In one of the healthcare projects, a user was able to download medical files to their device through the app. We programmed the app to automatically delete those files after some time. Not only it is done because a copy may become outdated. We noticed that files are downloaded for a one-time interaction (or importing into another app for further processing).</li><li>In another project, our software was communicating with the client's proprietary scanners. Initially, we intended to work with those scanners remotely. But we decided to have them delivered to our office to check if the hardware might be tampered with to alter its behavior and how our code can prohibit that.</li><li>When we were making an app for the bank, security testing requires having quite an amount of client data, and resources were invested to fake them. It is OK to suppose we might have a breach possibility on our side too.</li></ol><p>You might also know that all healthcare applications in the US must follow the HIPAA Security Standards. Those include solid requirements for data encryption, user identification, emergency access, and other aspects of such software. To follow them, we implement features like password hashing, biometric identification, automatic logoff, file change logging, and others.</p><p>Sometimes we might go as far as to sending our clients <a href="https://sdn.ego-cms.com/s/52Cdd5djCdsTD4s">cheat sheets like this</a> to implement healthcare security practices all over their organization.</p><h2>How Can You See EGO Pays Attention to Security?</h2><p>Now, the main outcome of the successful security testing might seem to be hardly visible. Your app works as intended, and hacks are either unsuccessful or absent at all.<br></p><p>So here are a few security practices we often turn to when working on software projects having risky functionalities (mainly, those include payment features, file uploading, and personal data processing). Seeing them when interacting with your development team, you may be sure the security aspect is treated seriously on your project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Different environments</h3><p>&nbsp;Most of the applications we maintain or improve already have a real-world userbase.</p><p>To make sure we won't affect their user experience, we create different environments:</p><ul role="list"><li>a demo environment to show new or updated functionality to the client</li><li>A staging environment for smoke testing purposes</li><li>A few QA environments for our internal needs (mostly for testing new features separately from each other)</li></ul><p>Additionally, as in the example earlier, we create fake or seed data for testing purposes.</p><h3>Project Permissions</h3><p>It's very common to build MVPs without paying special attention to the user roles and permissions. However, if the project works with data sensitive enough to have its security taken care of, this is a critical issue to address.</p><p>Who can access the code and user data?</p><p>Who can edit it?</p><p>Who can dump it?</p><p>In teams with people combining various roles and responsibilities, those are questions not obvious at all. And the better is the security policy, the less are the chances of internal data theft, a social engineering attack, or a banal mistake.</p><p>As an example, we get our hands on projects that initially allow us to access user data. Many mobile apps let users sign up, and the APIs implementing this functionality provide the developers with the ability to access, dump, or alter the database of users and their passwords.&nbsp;</p><p>In such cases, we change the app logic and permissions to make such data invisible and inaccessible for developers (at least, by default).&nbsp;</p><h3>Payment testing</h3><p>However appealing might be the software product, if the payment procedure is unclear, or, even worse, goes wrong, that might cause a user not only to refuse using your app but leave a negative review and tell about their experience on social networks.</p><p>To make sure the payment procedure works flawlessly, quality assurance engineers from the EGO app development agency create a sandbox and test credentials (a card number, date, random name, etc. for testing purposes.</p><h2>Where's a fly in the ointment?</h2><p>Although we dropped many more boring technical details – like how we perform penetration testing and security auditing – there will still be a question hanging in the air:</p><p><em>Can EGO guarantee your product's security?</em></p><p>The answer is "No", but also "No, and nobody can".</p><p>In September 2020, another zero-day vulnerability was<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-10-sandbox-activation-enables-zero-day-vulnerability/"> discovered</a> in Windows 10. A zero-day vulnerability means there’s a chance it was found earlier by a trespasser and used for an unknown number of times for an unknown purpose.<br></p><p>Who knows how many more of such vulnerabilities are in the operating system most of our clients use. Clients, who may have access to the code base or the user database of their product. And this is only one of many attack vectors we cannot do anything about.</p><p>And then there are new security testing tools coming out on the market. And new testing approaches. And new people joining our team.&nbsp;</p><p>The growth strategy that our QA team has come up with over the years of their work is finding ways to make better-informed decisions. Decisions on the optimal testing approach for every project, on testing plans and estimates, on testing tools and reports.</p><p>And then, following our decisions, we should never stop paying attention to details. Because if there would be an idiom that would describe the essence of quality assurance, it would be “God is in the detail”.</p><figure><a href="https://www.ego-cms.com/contact-us" target="_blank"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5f6cbccfbb5afc0b752a1448_5d30419c6c4ba507b52124bd_App%20Development.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></a></figure></div></article><section><div><div><p>LIKE THIS ARTICLE?

The team consists of ex-employees of Uber, Airbnb, Slack, Coinbase, and Microsoft, and collaborates with their Slack community of 900+ members.</p><p>Tuomas is co-founder of Linear, an engineer and experienced entrepreneur with a strong passion for UX. He previously worked at Uber and helped scale mobile engineering from 15 to 400 engineers. Today, Tuomas explains why the team chooses to build community-first.</p><h2>At what stage of the company did you start an online community and why?</h2><p>We started our online community very early, right about when we launched a private alpha. <strong>We don’t want to build our product in isolation</strong> but want to make sure that we’re as close and aligned with our users as possible. Our belief is that <strong>everyone in our team should be exposed to feedback from our users</strong>. Therefore it was critical to have as many channels of communication as possible to ensure this.</p><blockquote><p>Without a continuous feedback channel like the Slack community, we would probably build the wrong things.</p></blockquote><p>Without a continuous feedback channel like the Slack community, we would probably build the wrong things. <strong>Most of the direction comes from our customers</strong> and the chats that we have with them. If we wouldn’t have the community, we’d still go through a customer list and have daily calls with them to get an idea of what they need and what they're after. But it would certainly be slower, and you wouldn't be able to get a quick overview of what people want. </p><p>I think that <strong>the Slack community is a very fast</strong>-<strong>paced feedback mechanism</strong> for the entire team to get a grasp on what's going on, what's working, and what’s not.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab27779f-a23c-46aa-9109-aaa453f9aa77_972x485.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab27779f-a23c-46aa-9109-aaa453f9aa77_972x485.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ab27779f-a23c-46aa-9109-aaa453f9aa77_972x485.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:485,&quot;width&quot;:972,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:308918,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></p><h2>What platform do you use to run your online community?</h2><p>We used to run our community on Telegram but quickly switched to Slack. Additionally, a lot of feedback comes from forms within the application and from emails from users, which we manage with Front.&nbsp;</p><p>Slack is a great mechanism for fast-paced feedback and discussions. We also get bug reports and user questions in this way. Glancing over it gives everyone <strong>a good grasp on how our users are using Linear</strong> and what areas we still need to improve on.</p><p>The <strong>real-time and casual feel</strong> of Slack makes it great for the job. Using a forum for instance would probably increase the barrier to connect easily. We do get a lot of repeat questions through our channels, which takes time to answer, but that also tells us that we could do a better job at documenting our functionality.</p><h2>How do people find out about the community?</h2><p>The Slack community is <strong>open for all</strong>, but we don’t really promote it anywhere, except for a mention in our welcome email. We do have a prominent entry point in the main menu inside our application, but we probably should do a bit more to guide users to the community.</p><h2>How do you keep your community lively and positive?</h2><p>Not too long ago, we started with channels where people can <strong>introduce themselves</strong>, <strong>share stories</strong> about how they started using Linear, or learn about <strong>how other companies are using Linear</strong> to drive their software development. Most other channels are about providing feedback and feature requests or asking questions about particular functionality. <strong>Our whole team is active in those channels and we try to respond to each discussion.</strong></p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ef2146b-918e-435e-beff-7d37f00f6bb4_1080x720.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ef2146b-918e-435e-beff-7d37f00f6bb4_1080x720.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5ef2146b-918e-435e-beff-7d37f00f6bb4_1080x720.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:720,&quot;width&quot;:1080,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:650777,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></p><p>So far, the discussion has always remained positive and courteous. If discussions were ever to change to be rude, we would have to think about publishing community guidelines and enforcing them. I do believe that the positivity in the community is tightly coupled with how people experience Linear. If that were to change we would first have to <strong>look at our product and see where we’ve messed up</strong> the user experience.</p><blockquote><p>Any question is literally our problem. If people have to ask how things work, then we haven't done a good job in the product to explain it.</p></blockquote><p>The time it takes to reply to everything is really <strong>the only downside</strong>. Then again, you want to spend time with your customers so I don’t see it as something annoying. Any question is literally our problem. If people have to ask how things work, then we haven't done a good job in the product to explain it.</p><h2>How did engagement change when you grew from the first 50 members to a few hundred members?</h2><p>Nothing much has changed really as we’ve grown. Except for the volume of feedback and questions. As mentioned before, it’s our belief that everybody on the team should be exposed to feedback from our customers. So everybody was just active on the channels and responding to questions. But at some point, we realized that <strong>the team could no longer keep up</strong> with the amount of feedback and that this unstructured approach would not scale much further.</p><p>We did want to continue to provide awesome support, so we started building out a <strong>customer experience function</strong> at Linear. This ensures that all questions get answered quickly. Either directly by our customer experience lead or by someone else on the team who gets looped into the conversation. This helps us to continue learning from our users in a more efficient and controlled manner.</p><h2>How do you involve your community in improving your product?</h2><p>We use the feedback from our community as <strong>signals that help us prioritize</strong> what we’re working on. Receiving a lot of feedback of a certain type will make us re-prioritize our work and look into that particular problem field.</p><p>Often we do get feedback on existing functionality that we feel is just a good improvement (or a straight-up bug report). This kind of feedback we <strong>try to address immediately</strong>, in order to constantly ship smaller improvements to our users.</p><blockquote><p>We try to surprise and delight our users every now and then with a more elegant solution than they could have imagined.</p></blockquote><p>For all the other feedback, it's important to <strong>understand the underlying problem</strong>. It is therefore <strong>necessary to dive deeper</strong> instead of literally building what our users ask. A particular feature request might be an indication of a deeper reaching problem or limitation of our application. Coming up with a solution to that underlying problem might have <strong>further-reaching effects</strong> than implementing individual asks. This way we try to surprise and delight our users every now and then with a more elegant solution than they could have imagined.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb19929c3-8a7c-40d8-9907-fb9147cf468f_2045x1088.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb19929c3-8a7c-40d8-9907-fb9147cf468f_2045x1088.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b19929c3-8a7c-40d8-9907-fb9147cf468f_2045x1088.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:775,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:476511,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></p><p>We usually do quarterly planning on these kinds of high-level directions for the application. The planning makes sure that we’re addressing the needs of our customers with more complicated <strong>long-term projects</strong> as well.</p><p>For substantial additions, we <strong>select a few customers</strong> and invite them to a private Slack channel. We let them try it out and provide feedback before we ship it to the rest of our users. Sometimes we involve our customers very early on to provide feedback already in the design phase. This is all to make sure that we’re <strong>building something that our users want</strong>.</p><h2>One piece of advice you would give to anyone that is building out an early community around a software startup</h2><blockquote><p>You’re building something for your users and not for yourself.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Invest the time as soon as possible</strong>. You will be in a place where you’re rapidly iterating on the product and working very hard. At that point, spending a lot of time to build up and engaging with a community might feel like a distraction, but <strong>it’s well worth it</strong>. After all, you’re building something for your users and not yourself.</p><h2>What are your plans for the future, as a company in general and with your community?</h2><p>We’re focused on building out <strong>the best application for managing software product development</strong>. We’ve started small and are continuously increasing the footprint of what Linear can do and what kind of companies it can support. Our biggest user segment consists of other startup-ups and our plan is to <strong>grow with them</strong>, supporting them with new functionality as they grow. This will require <strong>continuous communications and the building of our community</strong>. It remains to be seen when we’ll outgrow our current community tools and what we’d switch to when that happens.</p><h2>How can we find out more about you and Linear?</h2><p>If you haven’t done so yet, give us a try at <a href="https://linear.app/">https://linear.app</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You didn’t have to be an investor, you just had to be <em>alive</em> over the last few decades to know that the stock market is far from a predictable or even stable thing.&nbsp;<br></p><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dotcom-bubble.asp#:~:text=During%20the%20dotcom%20bubble%2C%20the,the%20years%201995%20and%202000.&amp;text=Even%20the%20share%20prices%20of,than%2080%25%20of%20their%20value." target="_blank">The bursting of the “Dotcom Bubble”</a> saw the Nasdaq index peak and then fall more than 76% from March 2000 to October 2002 thanks to speculative investment in seemingly miraculous new “internet companies” that couldn’t deliver on outlandish expectations.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Hot on the heels of that meltdown came another — <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-recession.asp" target="_blank">the Great Recession of 2008</a>, triggered by a general lack of regulation in several corners of the financial industry.<br></p><p>Which brings us to today and the most unique crisis that most of us will ever experience — COVID-19. Now considered the herald of the COVID-19 recession, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_stock_market_crash" target="_blank">2020 stock market crash, or “Coronavirus Crash,”</a> was a global stock market crash that ran from February 20, 2020, to April 7, 2020, and was the most damaging since the Wall Street Crash of 1929 that kicked off the Great Depression.<br></p><p>If that brief history of economic instability freaked you out a bit, we can’t blame you. But what we <em>can</em> do is help you improve upon one of the few elements of wealth management that you can control — how you choose to allocate your assets to ward off loss through inevitable market fluctuations.&nbsp;<br></p><p>So let’s get started by diving a little deeper into the ins and outs of that term “diversification” that we hear so much about and then explore the alternative investments today’s current or aspiring high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) can turn to in order to protect their portfolios.&nbsp;<br></p><h2>Why Modern Investors Are Diversifying Into Alternative Investments</h2><p>If the past 20 years have taught us anything about wealth management, it’s that absolutely no single asset class is immune to failing. That’s exactly why modern investors are looking to alternative investment sources to diversify their investment portfolios beyond simple stocks and bonds.<br></p><p>But what exactly does that mean, “diversify”?&nbsp;<br></p><p>When it comes to wealth management, <a href="https://www.kubera.com/blog/digital-asset-investment">diversification is the process of investing in different types of assets</a> to shield your portfolio from the losses that come with inevitable ups and downs in the stock market. <br></p><p>Diversification actually works <em>because of</em> these natural fluctuations. While every market will flex, it’s extremely unlikely they’ll all flex the same way at the same time — which puts you at less risk of experiencing dramatic losses and in a good position to catch the gains.<br></p><p>Which leads us to our next point: Effective diversification is done with purpose, not by throwing a dart and picking the first asset you hit.<br></p><div><p>A well-diversified portfolio will contain your own unique selection of assets that align with your risk tolerance which still meeting your goals for growth. If you aren’t sure where you stand with your risk tolerance, <a href="https://personal.vanguard.com/us/FundsInvQuestionnaire" target="_blank">try this quiz from Vanguard to help you decide</a>.</p><p>Ultimately, investors who build long-term, carefully-diversified portfolios have a <em>much</em> easier time generating returns and riding out the losses than the high-stakes gamblers who bet all their money on a single asset and often lose big in the stock market.</p></div><p>Next up: Today’s strongest alternative investment types to look for when building your balanced portfolio.&nbsp;<br></p><h2>Alternative Investments Worth Considering in a Digital-First World</h2><p>Between technological developments and a growing population of <a href="https://www.mx.com/thought-leadership/the-changing-face-of-wealth" target="_blank">adults who are more financially savvy than their predecessors</a>, actively seeking unconventional sources of income, and excited to manage their wealth digitally; we’re witnessing the birth of a new asset class that is changing the investment world.<br></p><p><a href="https://www.kubera.com/blog/digital-asset-investment"><strong>Digital assets are the alternative investment class of the future</strong></a><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;<br></p><p>While the term “digital asset” can be used to describe digital tokens that represent traditional and even physical assets, in this case we’re talking about assets that exist only in the digital realm.&nbsp;<br></p><p>While digital assets are still a new idea for many investors, they’re just as powerful as any traditional investment asset. Just ask the Winklevoss twins — <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/people/083016/who-are-top-5-bitcoin-millionaires.asp" target="_blank">the world’s first Bitcoin billionaires</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And according to a recent survey of almost 800 financial professionals across the U.S. and Europe, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200609005138/en/Growing-Number-Institutional-Investors-Digital-Assets-Part" target="_blank">institutional investors are very interested in digital assets</a>.<br></p><figure id="w-node-931cd4d59614-ac468d02"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ded36b5e942e74b13468d23/5f91241956ac2a548b0f0a9e_01-Image%402x.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The most popular digital asset among these investors? Bitcoin — a type of cryptocurrency.&nbsp;<br></p><p>With that in mind, let’s talk more about cryptocurrency as well as some other popular digital assets you can use to round out your modern investment portfolio.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Cryptocurrencies</h3><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp" target="_blank">Cryptocurrency is digital currency</a> that is secured using cryptography and “backed” by a distributed network of computers. Its decentralized nature means it exists outside the control of any central authority, which increases its transparency but also its general instability (for now).</p><p>Cryptocurrency — often shorted to “crypto” — exists solely in the digital sphere, and it’s leading the way as far as introducing the masses to digital assets.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Fidelity has launched a <a href="http://crypto.marketswiki.com/index.php?title=Fidelity_Digital_Assets" target="_blank">digital assets subsidiary</a>, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/people/083016/who-are-top-5-bitcoin-millionaires.asp" target="_blank">the crypto-focused investment firm</a> Pantera Capital has delivered a 24,000% return to investors, and investment advisory firm <a href="https://medium.com/@HuttCapital/reflecting-on-cambridge-associates-blockchain-investment-research-piece-d06bc3af0469" target="_blank">Cambridge Associates encouraged investors to try digital assets</a> in their report “Cryptoassets: Venture into the Unknown.”<br></p><p>To get started with crypto, do your research and sign up with a credible exchange that enables you to create a crypto “wallet” and start buying and selling coins. But remember, as easy as it is to dive into crypto, it’s also as easy to mess it up. Learn the lingo and get a running start with this overview from Hacker Noon: “<a href="https://hackernoon.com/a-beginners-guide-to-getting-started-with-cryptocurrencies-76027bebb1b1" target="_blank">A beginner’s guide to getting started with cryptocurrencies</a>.”<br></p><h3>Websites&nbsp;</h3><p>There are <em>billions</em> of websites online — which makes websites a <em>huge</em> asset class when you think about them as an alternative investment resource for your portfolio.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If you want to invest in websites without making website management your full-time job, the best approach for you is probably buying, improving (or just holding), and “flipping” — to use real estate lingo — any type of website that generates income. Often, these include blogs, digital publications, and ecommerce stores.&nbsp;<br></p><p>To find established (and, ideally, money-making) websites that are for sale, you’ll want to look at online website marketplaces. <a href="https://flippa.com/websites" target="_blank">Flippa is quite common</a> and a good place to start.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Domain Names&nbsp;</h3><p>A little more specific than websites are the domain names upon which they exist.&nbsp;<br></p><p>A domain name is a unique address people use to access a website. For example, the domain name of the website you’re reading this on is “kubera.com.”<br></p><p>To revisit the real estate metaphor, domain names are kind of like land in the fast-growing city that is the internet. As more people want their own space on the internet, the more valuable domain names become.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For investor Igal Lichtman, for example, <a href="https://www.kubera.com/blog/what-happens-to-your-domains-when-you-die">the value of his domain names would have amounted to almost $75,000</a> for just a handful of some of his smartest investments — <em>if</em> he had properly prepared his beneficiaries to take ownership of his domains (more on that in the next section!).<br></p><p>While there are several ways to generate income from purchasing domain names — developing a website, displaying ads, etc. — the strategy that makes the most sense for someone who’s interested from an investment standpoint is again a buy/hold/sell approach.&nbsp;<br></p><p>GoDaddy, a recognized domain registrar where you can search for and purchase domain names, has a simple guide that will help you start wrapping your head around <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/5-tried-and-true-tips-for-buying-and-selling-domain-names-for-profit/" target="_blank">the process of buying and selling domain names for profit</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><figure id="w-node-52e775ab4ef0-ac468d02"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ded36b5e942e74b13468d23/5f9124f817272fdbe88f5353_02-Image%402x.png" loading="lazy" alt="HNWI interest in digital assets"></p></figure><p>Remember that these are just some of the most popular digital assets for investors who are just diving into the alternative realm. There are plenty of other options, including trademarks, SaaS platforms, revenue-generating social media accounts, and tons more. In fact, KPMG estimates that <a href="https://www.fintechfutures.com/2019/03/wealth-managers-can-adapt-to-digital-assets-and-thrive/" target="_blank">there are more than 2,000 digital assets</a> on the market.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-css-e5dvzf=""><p>On my team at Coinbase, we ask everyone to use the React performance trinity – <code>memo</code>, <code>useMemo</code>, and <code>useCallback</code> – all the time. For some reason, this is controversial. I’m guessing this has something to do with Twitter. This article explains why we do it anyway.</p>
<h3 id="why-we-reactmemo-all-components"><a href="#why-we-reactmemo-all-components" aria-label="why we reactmemo all components permalink"></a>Why We React.memo All Components</h3>
<p>Let’s start with what we can all agree on: in most apps, some components can benefit from being wrapped in <code>React.memo</code>. Maybe because they are expensive to rerender, or maybe they are children of a component that renders much more frequently. Maybe both.</p>
<p>So not using <code>memo</code> at all is not an option. We are left with two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>memo</code> some of the time</li>
<li>Use <code>memo</code> all the time</li>
</ul>
<p>The first option sounds like the most appealing, doesn’t it? Figure out when we can benefit from <code>React.memo</code>, and use it then, and only then. However, before we go that far, we have to remind ourselves that we work on a large team. No matter how diligent we are with education, code review, and profiling, <strong>we are not going to get it right 100% of the time</strong>. So we have to ask ourselves:</p>
<blockquote>What is the cost of getting it wrong?</blockquote>
<p>If we <code>memo</code> a component that doesn’t need to be, all we’re doing is a shallow equality check on the props of that component, on each potential render.</p>
<p>If we don’t <code>memo</code> a component that should be, we are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Running a render function</li>
<li>Allocating all callbacks anew</li>
<li>Allocating all <code>useMemo</code> functions anew</li>
<li>Allocating a bunch of new <span>JSX</span> elements</li>
<li>Repeating 1–4 recursively for all the children</li>
<li>Causing the React reconciler to compare the old tree with the new tree</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’ve ever profiled a React app – even in production mode – you know there is a non-negligible performance impact to every component that renders. By contrast, the props comparison in <code>memo</code> itself hardly ever shows up in profiles.</p>
<p>Wastefully rerendering a component is more expensive than wastefully testing whether props changed. So we want to err on the side of avoiding unnecessary rerenders. Since we are fallible, the only foolproof way to achieve that is <code>memo</code>ing everything by default.</p>
<h3 id="sane-defaults"><a href="#sane-defaults" aria-label="sane defaults permalink"></a>Sane Defaults</h3>
<p>On top of that, leaving the responsibility of deciding when to use <code>memo</code> and when not to places an unnecessary burden on all our engineers. Do we expect everybody to be intimately familiar with the tradeoffs? To profile each component to make the decision? What is the cost in terms of extra mental effort and time to try to get this right? Is it worth it? Why not provide a <em>sane</em> default, and diverge when necessary?</p>
<h3 id="cpu-cost-of-reactmemo"><a href="#cpu-cost-of-reactmemo" aria-label="cpu cost of reactmemo permalink"></a><span>CPU</span> Cost of React.memo</h3>
<p>But, you may be thinking, what if the vast majority of my components are cheap to rerender? Won’t the cost of all these unnecessary <code>memo</code>s add up to more than the possible cost of a wasted expensive rerender?</p>
<p>In my experience, the answer is no. I have never seen <code>memo</code> itself show up in a profile, whereas it’s pretty common to see expensive renders take mega amounts of <span>CPU</span> time. If you see something different, you probably have a bigger problem, like having way too many components mounted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have a legit use case where <code>memo</code> introduces a measurable performance hit, ping me. I’ll be happy to update this post based on new information!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="memory-cost-of-reactmemo"><a href="#memory-cost-of-reactmemo" aria-label="memory cost of reactmemo permalink"></a>Memory Cost of React.memo</h3>
<p>There is a <code>memo</code> meme that’s going around: they say that <code>React.memo</code> has a memory cost, because – like other memoizations – you have to keep around the old values in case you need them again later. Makes sense? Unfortunately, that’s not quite right. Because of how React works, the result of previous renders needs to be kept around anyway – to diff it against subsequent renders. That’s the basis of React’s reconciliation algorithm. It can’t work without it.</p>
<p>Don’t take my word for it. Here’s <a href="https://twitter.com/Vjeux/status/1083902075946205189">Christopher Chedeau on Twitter</a>, responding to one Dan Abramov:</p>
<blockquote>I don’t think that it’s a great analogy. Doing memoize() on every function would be horrible because you’d have to store the state of the input/output for all the calls. In the React case, React already does that for everything, so it’s “free”.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In case you don’t know him, Christopher Chedeau has been on the React Core team at Facebook since 2012, i.e. the very beginning<!--, i.e. much longer than Dan Abramov-->. He created React Native, Prettier, <span>CSS</span>-in-<span>JS</span>, Excalidraw, and Yoga. <!--Dan Abramov, on the other hand, created Redux.--></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="isnt-it-premature-optimization"><a href="#isnt-it-premature-optimization" aria-label="isnt it premature optimization permalink"></a>Isn’t it Premature Optimization?</h3>
<p>Premature optimization is spending time optimizing your code for performance before you know which code needs to be made faster. By asking engineers to make the memo-no-memo choice on every component, we are forcing them to spend more time thinking about performance because we are concerned about the <em>potential</em> performance cost of a <code>memo</code> call. That, in my mind, is premature optimization. Not the other way round.</p>
<h3 id="why-we-reactusecallback-all-callbacks"><a href="#why-we-reactusecallback-all-callbacks" aria-label="why we reactusecallback all callbacks permalink"></a>Why we React.useCallback All Callbacks</h3>
<p>Are we on the same page about <code>React.memo</code>? Good, then this one is going to be easy. In the majority of the cases, callbacks get passed as props to other components. If you don’t wrap them in <code>useCallback</code>, you’re gonna break <code>memo</code>. It’s that simple. Wrap your callbacks in <code>useCallback</code> to make <code>memo</code> work.</p>
<p>What about callbacks that get passed to primitive components? Isn’t <code>useCallback</code> useless in those cases? Yes. But. When the next intern wraps your primitive in another component, are they gonna know to go back and change all the passed in callbacks to wrap them in <code>useCallback</code>? Probably not.</p>
<p>Plus, the arguments above about having sane defaults and not creating an extra burden on our engineers still apply. The <span>CPU</span> and memory cost of <code>useCallback</code> is negligible. Yes, callbacks need to stick around in memory regardless. After all, they may need to be called!</p>
<p>Keep it simple. <code>useCallback</code> all the fns.</p>
<h3 id="why-we-reactusememo-all-the-props--deps"><a href="#why-we-reactusememo-all-the-props--deps" aria-label="why we reactusememo all the props  deps permalink"></a>Why we React.useMemo All the Props &amp; Deps</h3>
<p>The same thing goes for any time we are creating a new object or array. We have to wrap it in <code>useMemo</code> or it’s going to break any component that receives those values as props.</p>
<p>Any data structure that gets recreated on every render can also break downstream <code>useCallback</code>s and <code>useMemo</code>s, by showing up in their list of dependencies. Such ever-changing values are then referenced in other callbacks and derived values, so the breakage spreads – like a coronavirus in a town where only half the people wear masks. If things aren’t <code>memo</code>ed by default, debugging performance issues as they come up is going to involve a long game of whack-a-mole, as you walk back up the chain of dependencies all the way to add memoization at every step.</p>
<h3 id="will-someone-please-think-of-the-children"><a href="#will-someone-please-think-of-the-children" aria-label="will someone please think of the children permalink"></a>Will Someone Please Think of the Children?</h3>
<p>Many people aren’t aware of this: <code>children</code> is a sneaky prop that breaks <code>memo</code>. <span>JSX</span> creates a new data structure on every render. Any time a component rerenders and passes <span>JSX</span> to another component, it’s gonna break the child component’s <code>memo</code>.</p>
<p>How do we deal with this? The same way we deal with all other complex data structures created during render: we <code>useMemo</code> it.</p>
<p>I know what you’re thinking: nobody wraps children in <code>useMemo</code>, and you’re right. I’ll admit that we also don’t often do this in our codebase. It’s just not idiomatic React, and doing this everywhere might be too much to ask. So we live with this compromise. This means we have to be vigilant, and continuously monitor our app for performance issues. The good news is, when we identify one, wrapping a <code>useMemo</code> around a children prop is a lot more straightforward than adding all sorts of optimizations to a complex web of hooks and components that started off with zero optimizations to begin with.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="conclusion permalink"></a>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Using <code>memo</code> and its cousins everywhere is a sane default. It’s like a mask mandate during a coronavirus pandemic. Sure, we could have everybody tested every day and only ask people who are actively contagious to wear a mask. But it’s far cheaper, simpler, and ultimately more effective to ask everybody to wear a mask by default.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://getblock.io/nodes/xzc">Zcoin</a> crypto project implements a zero-knowledge proof technology to maintain anonymity when conducting exchange transactions with cryptocurrencies. Zcoin concept is that there is no direct crypto coins transfer. The anonymity preservation algorithm is RSA-storage.</p>
<h3 id="about-the-coin">About the coin</h3>
<p>The Zcoin crypto coin implements the Zerocoin protocol and it appeared on October 28, 2016. The protocol turned out to be imperfect. It was hacked in February 2017 and as a result, 370,000 fake tokens were created. The developers did not destroy the coins, as the second-largest cryptocurrency platform, Ethereum did after the DAO smart contract software was hacked.</p>
<p>In 2018, a cryptographic error was discovered in the Zerocoin protocol. This error allowed us to create and destroy new Zcoins. The developers highlighted the attacks' high complexity and the low probability for the cybercriminals.</p>
<p>To address the vulnerability of the protocol, the Dandelion protocol was introduced in September 2018, hiding the source IP address without using a Tor router or VPN.</p>
<p>In 2018, Zcoin was successfully tested during the elections in Thailand. In December 2018, Zcoin implemented a mining algorithm with a containment mechanism for ASICs.</p>
<p>A crypto wallet supported by the Binance exchange was added in February 2019.</p>
<p>On July 30, 2019, the Sigma protocol with zero-knowledge proof was adopted instead of Zerocoin. It solved the problem of confidentiality and eliminated the possibility of issuing counterfeit coins.<br>Since August 2019, Zcoin has been added to the OVEX African cryptocurrency exchange. In December 2019, Zcoin introduced a decentralized crowdfunding system.</p>
<h3 id="features-of-the-zcoin-xzc-project">Features of the <a href="https://getblock.io/nodes/xzc">Zcoin (XZC)</a> project.</h3>
<ol>
<li>Wallet Multiple Billing Code [BIP47] RAP. Users share their permanent RAP address publicly while keeping their privacy.</li>
<li>No direct transfer of Zcoin tokens. Tokens are removed from the sender’s wallet and appear in the recipient's wallet, thus, Zcoin digital coins have no history.</li>
<li>Transaction information is hidden:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>anonymous sender and recipient</li>
<li>the transfer amount is disclosed;<br>Zcoin takes up to three seconds.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mining-with-zcoin">Mining with ZCoin</h3>
<p>Zcoin uses the Proof of Work (PoW) protocol using the network computer's power.<br>The creators plan to switch to the MTP algorithm (instead of Lyra2z), which will allow Zcoin to position itself as a secure token, and reduce the time it takes to verify the crypto wallet during transactions.</p>
<p>The MTP algorithm maintains the same prices for one computing unit on all platforms, i.e. the possibility of gaining advantages over other users is eliminated. Attacks by cybercriminals are becoming economically unprofitable.</p>
<p>Zcoin founder rewards have been discontinued since May 2020. Remuneration for the formation of new blocks is 15%. 35% is the block reward for master nodes.<br>The Zcoin reserve fund is $ 100,000.<br>21 million crypto coins are planned for production. The remuneration principle is similar to BTC: the award is halved every 4 years.</p>
<h3 id="halving">Halving</h3>
<p><a href="https://getblock.io/nodes/xzc">Zcoin</a> follows a reward cut schedule every four years. The first halving happened in September-October of 2020.<br>Block rewards will drop from 25 XZC to 12.5 XZC per block. Zcoin's inflation rate is expected to drop from ~ 25% annually to ~ 12%. It will be the largest drop in inflation in the history of Zcoin after the first cut.<br>The next generation Lelantus privacy protocol will be launched in a few weeks.</p>

There's <a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/">Kind</a>, there's <a href="https://microk8s.io/">Microk8s</a>, there's <a href="https://k3s.io/">K3s</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube">Minikube</a>, <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop">Docker for Desktop</a>...? They all kind of copy each other, and there's tons of configurations for each.</p><p><strong>So how do you choose? Are they all the same? Are there any differences?</strong> Does it really matter?!</p><p>Luckily, we’re here to help.</p><p>‍</p><h2>How do I tell them apart?</h2><p>Every cluster needs to solve 3 problems:</p><ul role="list"><li>How do I <strong>build</strong> my app? (builders)</li><li>How do I <strong>store</strong> my app? (registries)</li><li>How do I <strong>run</strong> my app? (runtimes</li></ul><p>Docker for Desktop is one big component that solves all 3 problems. The others let you mix and match.</p><p>The advantage of being a single component is that it’s easier to set up. But it comes with limitations, and when it breaks, the whole things breaks.</p><p>For the others, you can mix and match components, and optimize the different parts to your workflow—this way they can be <strong>more powerful, but it's also more complicated</strong>.</p><p>So what are the components? What you should pay attention to? What are the parts, and can you replace &amp; optimize them?</p><p>‍</p><h2>What should I pay attention to?</h2><h3>Builder </h3><p>This is stuff like <a href="https://github.com/moby/buildkit">buildkit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko">kaniko</a>, <a href="https://github.com/genuinetools/img">img</a>, and so on. What matters here? For example: When building, you don’t wanna build everything from scratch. So how good is the caching in the builder that you're using?</p><p>Something else to consider is that builders are getting better all the time, getting new features and functionality. In your cluster of choice, <strong>will you be stuck with the default builder, or can you try new ones as you please?</strong></p><h3>Registry</h3><p>When developing locally, you shouldn't have to push your container images to DockerHub every single time. Ideally you'll be able to keep them locally, in a local registry. </p><p>But here's the thing: <strong>When using a local cluster, will resetting it</strong> (e.g. when it gets wedged) <strong>going to delete all your storage and all the cached container images</strong> you've already built?</p><h3>Runtime</h3><p>Trust me, you don’t want to have to debug virtual machine drivers, or decide by youself which VM is the <em>mostest optimalest</em> for the hardware you're using.</p><p>But what VM your cluster chooses, and <strong>how lightweight the container runner in that VM is, can have a big impact on the speed and stability of your app.</strong> </p><p>For reference, commonly used container runtimes are <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/container-runtime">Docker</a>, <a href="https://containerd.io/">containerd</a>, and <a href="https://cri-o.io/">CRI-O</a>.</p><p>‍</p><h2>What are the choices?</h2><p>To help us make sense of all the options we have, let’s classify them into three categories: all integrated, customizable, and “kitchen sink.”</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-b7a3e7b107ba-9e408582"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f243bc3e9d7326bfac6867d/5f8f0b004debb4661f25e4f0_categorized.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Docker for Desktop</h3><p><strong>Everything is one component.</strong> It has an amazing virtual machine experience—you often don’t even know you’re running a VM. Even the other clusters below often use Docker to manage the VM part. On the other extreme, we have...</p><h3>Minikube</h3><p><strong>Minikube can be anything you want it to be!</strong> There’s a way to run it like Docker for Desktop, where the builder, registry, and runtime are all a single component. </p><p>And there’s a way to do the absolute opposite, and customize it to your hearts content—beware though that not all the options really make sense, which can make things quite complicated.</p><h3>Kind</h3><p>The name stands for Kubernetes in Docker. It uses Docker to run the virtual machine, and for runtime it uses the generally more stable containerd. </p><p>You can run a separate registry that persists even after you reset the cluster. You can also use whatever builder you want. And <strong>Kind is very stable</strong>, because the Kubernetes project uses Kind to test Kubernetes itself.</p><h3>K3d</h3><p>The name stands for K3s in Docker. It's conceptually similar to Kind, but with <strong>K3s instead of the regular Kubernetes</strong>. K3s is a lighter Kubernetes distribution designed for lightweight, resource-constrained environments.</p><h3>Microk8s</h3><p>Microk8s is Kubernetes in a Snap. Snaps are a sandbox technology that <strong>works really well on Ubuntu</strong> but not necessarily as seamlessly on other distributions and operating systems. It has a registry in the cluster that resets with the cluster, unfortunately. And you can use whatever builder you want.</p><p>‍</p><h2>Recommendations</h2><p>Okay, that was a lot of options, and a whole lot of information. To navigate that, here are some opinions that might help you in making a choice:</p><p><strong>For getting started, Docker for Desktop is really easy and really convenient</strong>—it even has a GUI! </p><p>The problem is that it gets bricked from time to time, and needs to be reset.

  </p>
  
  
  <p><a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/masteringjs/issues/should-you-use-axios-or-fetch-237049">Axios is Mastering JS' offically recommended HTTP client</a>. We occasionally use <a href="http://npmjs.com/package/superagent">superagent</a>, but we almost never use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch"><code>fetch()</code> function</a>. The reason is that Axios drastically reduces the amount of boilerplate you need for your average API request. Here's some reasons why:</p>
<h3 id="axios-is-isomorphic-fetch-is-not">Axios is <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios#features">isomorphic</a>, fetch is not</h3>
<p>The syntax for most basic Axios requests is the same in both Node.js and the browser. Since Node.js does not
have a built-in <code>fetch()</code> function, you need to use a polyfill like <a href="http://npmjs.com/package/node-fetch">node-fetch</a>. And there are several <a href="https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch/blob/master/docs/v3-LIMITS.md">known differences between node-fetch and browser <code>fetch()</code></a>.</p>
<h3 id="axios-throws-an-error-when-a-request-fails">Axios throws an error when a request fails</h3>
<p>One of the most annoying issues with <code>fetch()</code> is that it <a href="https://medium.com/frontend-digest/axios-vs-fetch-which-to-use-in-2019-6678c083c5c">does not throw an error when the server responds with an HTTP error status, like 404 or 500</a>.</p>
<pre><code>fetch(<span>'https://httpbin.org/post'</span>).catch(<span><span>err</span> =&gt;</span> {
  
});

axios.get(<span>'https://httpbin.org/post'</span>).catch(<span><span>err</span> =&gt;</span> {
  err.response.status; 
});</code></pre>
<p>However, <code>fetch()</code> <strong>does</strong> throw an error if it can't reach the server, so you always need two distinct error handling
paths with <code>fetch()</code>. The situation is even worse with <a href="http://thecodebarbarian.com/async-await-error-handling-in-javascript.html">async/await</a>: every <code>fetch()</code> needs an extra <a href="https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/fundamentals/then"><code>then()</code></a> to bubble up errors.</p>
<p><a href="https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/axios/catch">Axios error handling</a> is much easier: just use <code>catch()</code>.</p>
<h3 id="automatic-json-and-form-encoded-serialization-and-parsing">Automatic JSON and Form-Encoded Serialization and Parsing</h3>
<p>Most modern APIs use JSON or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST">form encoding</a> for request bodies. Axios handles JSON and form encoding automatically, as well as automatically <a href="https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/axios/get-query-params">serializing query strings</a>.</p>
<pre><code>
body = <span>JSON</span>.stringify(body);
query = <span>new</span> URLSearchParams(query).toString();

<span>const</span> res = <span>await</span> fetch(<span>'/myendpoint?'</span> + query, {
  <span>method</span>: <span>'POST'</span>,
  <span>headers</span>: {
    <span>'Content-Type'</span>: <span>'application/json'</span>
  },
  body
});


<span>await</span> axios.post(<span>'/myendpoint'</span>, { <span>params</span>: query, body });</code></pre>
<h3 id="framework-features-interceptors-and-instances">Framework Features: <a href="https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/axios/interceptors">Interceptors</a> and <a href="https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/axios/create">Instances</a></h3>
<p>With all these limitations, the unfortunate reality is that <a href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/replace-axios-with-a-simple-custom-fetch-wrapper/">everybody who uses <code>fetch()</code> writes their own wrapper around <code>fetch()</code></a>. It is extremely difficult to build an app using <code>fetch()</code> directly.</p>
<p>Axios lets you go further by providing some framework-like features. You can use interceptors and instances to
<a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/masteringjs/issues/building-an-api-client-library-with-axios-254566">create your own API wrappers using Axios</a>. For example, here's how you can build a Trello API client using
instances and interceptors:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/revue/items/images/006/139/960/mail/48496b778150aefaa29789612cff0777.png"></p><p>So Axios not only eliminates a lot of the boilerplate and rough edges of <code>fetch()</code>, and also makes it easier to
build specific wrappers for different APIs.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>In Southeast Asia alone, Netflix has over 14.5 million subscribers by the year of 2020. Can you imagine how much bigger the number is when we take into account their total subscribers worldwide?&nbsp;</p>
<!--more--><p>How does Netflix maintain the quality of their service by providing high quality videos at minimal buffer time? How do they maintain consistency in giving their users the best user experience regardless of their geographic coordinates?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s put it under a microscope.</p>
<h2><strong>Data Analytics: Netflix’s Recommendation System</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Viewing History</strong></h3>
<p>First things first, as you may or may not have noticed already, Netflix doesn't rely on one-size-fits-all ratings from IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes. Instead, they focus on personalization for users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To provide the best user experience, it is essential to understand that every user is different. Netflix builds its algorithm around your viewing history and ratings. To suit your preferences, It detects patterns in your activity and makes recommendations accordingly.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/recommendation%20system.png?width=600&amp;name=recommendation%20system.png" alt="recommendation system" width="600" srcset="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/recommendation%20system.png?width=300&amp;name=recommendation%20system.png 300w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/recommendation%20system.png?width=600&amp;name=recommendation%20system.png 600w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/recommendation%20system.png?width=900&amp;name=recommendation%20system.png 900w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/recommendation%20system.png?width=1200&amp;name=recommendation%20system.png 1200w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/recommendation%20system.png?width=1500&amp;name=recommendation%20system.png 1500w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/recommendation%20system.png?width=1800&amp;name=recommendation%20system.png 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></p>
<h3><strong>Collaborative Filtering (CF)</strong></h3>
<p>Netflix connects your preferences with other Netflix users. Collaborative filtering functions with the assumption that if two users have similar ratings on a number of shows and movies, they behave similarly.</p>
<p>How does this play out on the app? When you rate a movie highly, Netflix recommends that movie to other users who share similar preferences with you.</p>
<h3><strong>Content Based Filtering (CB)</strong></h3>
<p>Unlike CF, Content Based Filtering (CB) isn’t based on data from other users, but the type of content users have shown interest in. The algorithm captures a user’s specific interests by detecting keywords used to describe the content they interact with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, if a user completes a season of a spanish telenovela, Netflix will recommend other available spanish series. Or, if a user watches a horror film, Netflix will (you guessed it) recommend more of that genre.</p>
<h3><strong>User Profiling</strong></h3>
<p>User profiling is the process of collecting relevant data about the user <span>—</span> from a user’s geographical location and interests to behavioural statistical data like their active time on the app, time spent watching a movie, device, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taking the user’s information into account, Netflix suggests content that is compatible with the user profile.</p>
<h3><strong>Personalized Header Images</strong></h3>
<p>More about personalization <span>—</span> not sure if you’ve noticed before, but there’s a high chance that the headers you see on your account differs from another person’s.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Netflix shows you cover images that would most likely catch your interest. As mentioned before, there are many factors that go into this algorithm. If your activity shows that you’ve frequented action movies, chances are, Netflix is going to show you cover images of high-action blockbusters.</p>
<h2>Direct Content Acquisition</h2>
<p>If you’re subscribed, you probably know about Netflix Originals. It’s a no-brainer that Netflix would have full rights over Netflix Originals, but what about TV shows and movies that aren’t produced by Netflix?</p>
<p>To obtain broadcast rights for content from across the world, there are a few steps Netflix needs to take. First, Netflix would need to source the companies responsible for handling the distribution of a particular content. Oftentimes, a company might have signed a deal with different video services or TV channels at a specific location. When this happens, it’s one of two things <span>— </span>either Netflix won’t be able to obtain rights for the show, or they could, but on a different date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Production houses and studios provide Netflix with high-quality cinema videos, which need to be processed before being made available to viewers on different devices. Considering that Netflix supports up to 2200 devices to this date, they need to take into account the varying video formats each device needs. How is this done?</p>
<h3><strong>Transcoding</strong></h3>
<p>This is where the magic of AWS servers come into play, by converting the original video into numbers of different formats and resolutions to support different screen sizes and devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transcoding is a process by which Netflix breaks down the video into blocks, which with the help of AWS servers, will be converted into different formats across different resolutions like 4k, 1080p and etc. All these copies are then stored on Amazon S3. At the end of the day, one file will work exclusively on an iPhone, one on a Sony TV with Dolby sound, one on an Android tablet, and so on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly, these files are also made with varying video qualities to suit different qualities of network connection. Netflix analyzes the quality and stability of a user’s internet connection and serves content accordingly, to ensure a smooth buffer regardless of network strength.</p>
<h3><strong>Digital Rights Management (DRM)</strong></h3>
<p>To prevent any piracy issues, a technological measure known as digital rights management is implemented, whereby a special code is added into these files to lock them from any possibilities of piracy. That’s why when you try to screenshot a movie you’re watching, you get an image of a black screen.</p>
<h2><strong>Running Microservices for Efficiency</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Monolithic Architecture vs Microservices Architecture</strong></h2>
<p>Monolithic architecture is a model by which all codes and services are run by one application. Using this architecture runs the risk of having to rewrite every other part of the application’s code if one part of it is changed, shutting the entire app down. This could destroy the experience for Netflix’s users.</p>
<p>To change the game, Netflix built a revolutionary architecture known as microservices. In contrast to monolithic, this architecture structures the application as a collection of services. This means that each application or microservices’ code and resources are its very own.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By part of which two applications need to interact with each other, they will use an <strong>Application Programming Interface (API)</strong> <span>—</span> a software intermediary that allows two applications to “talk” to each other. This way, developers can make changes to the application with ease.</p>
<p>There are an estimated amount of 700 microservices used by Netflix <span>—</span> one for storing the content you watch, one for deducting monthly fees from credit cards, and other miscellaneous services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To conclude, microservices architecture is built around business logic and enables flexibility for different needs. If one learns that a system is facing a bottleneck, it can efficiently be altered for scaling and optimization without changing the resources configuration for other services.</p>
<h3><strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS): Cloud-based Choice</strong></h3>
<p>With this huge number of microservices that stores hundreds and thousands of videos, Netflix needs reliable and scalable cloud networks and servers that would let them handle everything to their leverage. With the help of AWS EC2 and S3, Netflix can rapidly improve their services and keep the site stable.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Journey to Zero Buffer Time: Custom Content Delivery Network (CDN)</strong></h2>
<p>First, let’s try to understand how the internet works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you visit a site that requires net access, a request is sent to your internet service provider, which is also known as ISP. This ISP will then forward the request to the dedicated servers that handle the particular website that you’re trying to access. Upon receiving the request, the server provides a response which is navigated back to your computer, enabling your access to the site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a high-volume site like Netflix, a much larger network of servers is needed to maintain its performance. This is made possible with Content Delivery Network (CDN).</p>
<h3><strong>What is Content Delivery Network (CDN)?</strong></h3>
<p>Content Delivery Network is mostly used by giant media websites, like Facebook and Youtube. With CDN, the idea is to place servers as close as possible to users and optimize the network for speed and reliability.</p>
<p>For Netflix, CDN takes the original website and its content, and copies it across hundreds of servers all around the world. This increases speed as it reduces the gap between a request and a response, making loading content really fast regardless of where you are in the world.</p>
<h3><strong>Open Connect: Reaching Out to the Locals</strong></h3>
<p>With a rapidly growing user base, Netflix needed an alternative that will help in reducing cost while increasing quality and scalability. So they made a custom CDN, Open Connect, which is like a fast server assembled from numbers of hard disks and flash drives for storing videos.</p>
<p>Netflix places their open connect boxes with the data centres of ISPs all around the world. They struck a deal with these ISPs and in turn, provided them the fast server at no cost. It’s a win-win situation. ISPs get to install these along with their servers where they can download all of Netflix libraries for their region from the main servers in the United States.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In literal terms, they are like hard drives located around the world that store videos from Netflix. This way, Netflix gets all the benefits of a data centre without having the need to manage them. This strategy is (among other factors) what enables Netflix users to load content fast, as ISPs are located close to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ISPs can submit a request to improve their customer’s experience on Netflix through localizing Netflix traffic, by joining <a href="https://openconnect.netflix.com/"><span>The Netflix Open Connect Program</span></a>.</p>

<p>The book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33517721-the-culture-code">The Culture Code</a> by Daniel Coyle starts out with a fascinating example of a bad apple. Here’s a big quote, but I promise it’s worth it.</p>



<blockquote><p>Meet Nick, a handsome, dark-haired man in his twenties seated comfortably in a wood-paneled conference room in Seattle with three other people. To outward appearances, he is an ordinary participant in an ordinary meeting. This appearance, however, is deceiving. The other people in the room do not know it, but his mission is to sabotage the group’s performance.</p><p>Nick is the key element of an experiment being run by Will Felps, who studies organizational behavior at the University of South Wales in Australia. Felps has brought in Nick to portray three negative archetypes: the Jerk (an aggressive, defiant deviant), the Slacker (a withholder of effort), and the Downer (a depressive Eeyore type). Nick plays these roles inside forty four-person groups tasked with constructing a marketing plan for a start-up. In effect, Felps injects him into the various groups the way a biologist might inject a virus into a body: to see how the system responds. Felps calls it the bad apple experiment.</p><p>Nick is really good at being bad. In almost every group, his behavior reduces the quality of the group’s performance by 30 to 40 percent. The drop-off is consistent whether he plays the Jerk, the Slacker, or the Downer.</p><p>“When Nick is the Downer, everybody comes into the meeting really energized. He acts quiet and tired and at some point puts his head down on his desk,” Felps says. “And then as the time goes by, they all start to behave that way, tired and quiet and low energy. By the end, there are three others with their heads down on their desks like him, all with their arms folded.”</p><p>When Nick plays the Slacker, a similar pattern occurs. “The group quickly picks up on his vibe,” Felps says. “They get done with the project very quickly, and they do a half-assed job. What’s interesting, though, is that when you ask them about it afterward, they’re very positive on the surface. They say, ‘We did a good job, we enjoyed it.’ But it isn’t true. They’d picked up on the attitude that this project really didn’t matter, that it wasn’t worth their time or energy. I’d gone in expecting that someone in the group would get upset with the Slacker or the Downer. But nobody did. They were like, ‘Okay, if that’s how it is, then we’ll be Slackers and Downers too.’ ”</p><cite>Daniel Coyle, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33517721-the-culture-code">The Culture Code</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>This was a lightbulb moment for me because I see it all the time but I’ve never realized it. </p>



<p>I’ve been in upbeat meetings that were cruising until a downer joined. And I’ve seen miserable Eeyore meetings turn around when an excited person hopped on. </p>



<p>It only takes one Nick. One downer, or one jerk, or one slacker (which often manifests by <em>multitasking</em>). I don’t want to be the Nick. I can’t be the person that brings the group down. </p>



<p>The book goes on to describe an outlier group. Nick couldn’t bog this group down, because it had Jonathan. Jonathan was so good at encouraging and jelling the team that Nick didn’t have an effect. Nick even found himself being helpful almost against his will.</p>



<p>My resolution is to either be the Jonathan, or leave the meeting. If I can’t help but be the Nick, then I shouldn’t be there. They’re better off without me. Jonathan or bust!</p>

October 28, 2020 | https://serokell.io/blog/uncaught-exception-handling | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://serokell.io/blog/uncaught-exception-handling">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When your Haskell application’s thread throws an exception that does not get caught, the Haskell runtime system will handle it and print it based on the <code>Show</code> instance.
This is the default behavior that can be customized using the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.0.0/docs/GHC-Conc-Sync.html#v:setUncaughtExceptionHandler"><code>setUncaughtExceptionHandler</code></a> function.</p><p>Personally, I was quite surprised when I noticed that the <code>Show</code> type class is used for rendering.
At the early days of my Haskell development experience, I noticed that the <code>Exception</code> type class had the <code>displayException</code> method and assumed that it’s used for printing of uncaught exceptions.
A few years later, I realized that my assumption was wrong and was quite surprised.
The default uncaught exception handler uses <code>showsPrec</code> from the <code>Show</code> type class, not <code>displayException</code>.
When I shared this information with my colleagues, some of them were surprised as well.
I was inclined to think that <code>displayException</code> is a better default, and it turned out that I was not the only one thinking this way.
Since people were supporting this idea, I decided to do two things:</p><ol>
<li>Raise this topic in the GHC issue tracker.</li>
<li>Create a small library with a function that would carefully modify uncaught exception handling to use <code>displayException</code>.
We already had such a helper in our code base and wanted to extract it into a library.
This function is not entirely trivial because, for example, the <code>ExitCode</code> exception should be handled specially (the program should exit with the appropriate exit code in this case).</li>
</ol><p>I started with researching this topic and discovered that it already had been discussed back in 2014.</p><h2 id="history">History</h2><p>The relevant GHC issue is <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/9822">#9822</a>.
It refers to the <a href="https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/libraries/2014-November/024176.html">e-mail thread</a> where two things were proposed:</p><ol>
<li>The addition of <code>displayException</code> to <code>Exception</code>.</li>
<li>The modification of the default uncaught exception handler to use <code>displayException</code>.</li>
</ol><p>The first thing was accepted and implemented, and the <code>displayException</code> is a part of <code>Exception</code> for many years already.
The second thing, however, appeared to be debatable and there was no consensus regarding it.
You can read the whole thread for details since it’s not so big.
Two essential points from it are:</p><ol>
<li>There is a good reason to use <code>show</code> for uncaught exceptions.
Uncaught exceptions are usually encountered by programmers, so it’s better to format them in “programmer-friendly” way, i. e. using <code>show</code>.
So that should be the default.
However, sometimes one may prefer <code>displayException</code>, so it should be easy to use it instead.</li>
<li>Even though there is <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.0.0/docs/GHC-Conc-Sync.html#v:setUncaughtExceptionHandler"><code>setUncaughtExceptionHandler</code></a>, modifying the uncaught exception handler to use <code>displayException</code> is not easy because:</li>
</ol><ul>
<li>stdout has to be flushed, ignoring any exceptions while doing so;</li>
<li>output has to go to stderr, not stdout;</li>
<li>the <code>ExitCode</code> exception should be handled correctly, and the program should exit with correct exit code.</li>
</ul><p>After that, there was a discussion about adding <code>useDisplayExceptionHandler</code> or <code>displayExceptionHandler</code> that would do “the right thing”, but this discussion quickly moved into another direction and no such function was added.
In 2020, I couldn’t find a function that does “the right thing” on Hackage.</p><p>When I first implemented this helper (before reading this thread), I didn’t take <code>ExitCode</code> into account and had a subtle minor bug.
My program was exiting with non-zero code when launched with <code>--help</code> because <code>optparse-applicative</code> library throws (probably indirectly) <code>ExitSuccess</code> in this case, but I didn’t consider that.</p><h2 id="why-displayexception%3F">Why <code>displayException</code>?</h2><p>The intended difference between <code>displayException</code> and <code>show</code> is that the former should return a “human-friendly” string, while the latter does not say anything about “human-friendliness” and is usually auto-generated to produce “programmer-friendly” strings that reflect the internal structure of the Haskell type.
A good analogy from the aforementioned e-mail thread is <code>str()</code> and <code>repr()</code> functions in Python.</p><p>Based on my experience, I admit that <code>displayException</code> is usually implemented as <code>show</code>, which is the default implementation.
I think there are 3 possible reasons for that:</p><ol>
<li><code>Show</code> is auto-generated and the string produced by it sufficiently human-friendly and custom formatting is not needed.
I believe it’s a rare case because auto-generated <code>show</code> usually looks quite verbose.</li>
<li>A programmer just didn’t bother implementing <code>displayException</code>.
Maybe they forgot to do it (the compiler doesn’t check it), maybe they were lazy, maybe they didn’t even know about this method.</li>
<li>There is a custom <code>Show</code> instance with human-readable pretty formatting.
I think it’s a bad idea because then there is no way to render an exception in “programmer-friendly” way.
“Programmer-friendly” way usually contains Haskell identifiers, so that you can quickly find documentation for the relevant data type.
Also, you should be able to see all values that constitute the exception.
“Human-friendly” way may return a string where some fields are omitted and figuring out which type of exception was thrown can be complicated.</li>
</ol><p>So currently, in many cases it does not really matter which function is called to print an uncaught exception because <code>displayException</code> is often implemented as <code>show</code>.
However, I think that in the ideal world, most of the types with <code>Exception</code> instance should provide a custom definition for <code>displayException</code>, and the topic brought up in this article will matter.</p><p>It’s indeed debatable which function is more appropriate. I think there is no clear winner, so it should be easy to use either of them for uncaught exceptions.
One thought that I have is that <code>displayException</code> is more appropriate for console apps because uncaught exceptions are visible to end users, while <code>show</code> is more appropriate for UI apps because errors in UI apps are hidden from end users.
Anyway, it’s just one thought, and I don’t intend to recommend using <code>displayException</code> for uncaught exceptions, I just want to make it easy to do so if someone wants that.</p><h2 id="uncaught-exception">uncaught-exception</h2><p>Since there was a discussion about providing a function that would change uncaught exception handling to use <code>displayException</code> but no actions were taken, I went ahead and implemented a tiny library for this use case.
The library is called <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/uncaught-exception">uncaught-exception</a>.
You can view its source code on <a href="https://github.com/serokell/uncaught-exception">GitHub</a>.</p><p>The default exception handler is implemented in GHC <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.0.0/docs/src/GHC.Conc.Sync.html#uncaughtExceptionHandler">as follows</a>:</p><pre><code><span>defaultHandler</span> :: <span>SomeException</span> -&gt; <span>IO</span> ()
<span>defaultHandler</span> se@(<span>SomeException</span> ex) = <span>do</span>
   (hFlush stdout) `catchAny` (\ _ -&gt; return ())
   <span>let</span> msg = <span>case</span> cast ex <span>of</span>
         <span>Just</span> <span>Deadlock</span> -&gt; <span>"no threads to run:  infinite loop or deadlock?"</span>
         _                  -&gt; showsPrec <span>0</span> se <span>""</span>
   withCString <span>"%s"</span> $ \cfmt -&gt;
    withCString msg $ \cmsg -&gt;
      errorBelch cfmt cmsg



<span>foreign</span> <span>import</span> <span>ccall</span> <span>unsafe</span> <span>"HsBase.h errorBelch2"</span>
   errorBelch :: <span>CString</span> -&gt; <span>CString</span> -&gt; <span>IO</span> ()
</code></pre><p>I could have implemented a similar handler myself, but decided not to do it because I don’t entirely understand this definition.
Specifically:</p><ol>
<li>How is <code>ExitCode</code> handled and how does a Haskell program determine which code it should exit with?
Is it handled by <code>errorBelch</code>? Probably no because <code>errorBelch</code> only takes two strings.
So perhaps it’s handled outside of this helper.</li>
<li>What does <code>errorBelch</code> do, and why is it implemented in a foreign language (most likely C/C++)?
Can’t it be implemented in Haskell?
Should I use FFI in my handler as well?</li>
</ol><p>I guess I could find out answers to these questions, but I picked a simpler way, actually two ways.
If this default handler is ever updated in GHC, I will not have to do anything in my library.
I define the following wrapper:</p><pre><code>



<span><span>newtype</span> <span>DisplayExceptionInShow</span> = <span>DisplayExceptionInShow</span> <span>SomeException</span></span>
<span>
<span>instance</span> <span>Show</span> <span>DisplayExceptionInShow</span> <span>where</span></span>
  show (<span>DisplayExceptionInShow</span> se) = displayException se
<span>
<span>instance</span> <span>Exception</span> <span>DisplayExceptionInShow</span>
</span></code></pre><p>along with the <code>wrapException :: SomeException -&gt; SomeException</code> function that wraps exceptions into this wrapper.
And define two functions:</p><pre><code><span>displayUncaughtException</span> :: <span>IO</span> a -&gt; <span>IO</span> a
<span>displayUncaughtException</span> = handle (throwIO . wrapException)

<span>withDisplayExceptionHandler</span> :: <span>IO</span> a -&gt; <span>IO</span> a
<span>withDisplayExceptionHandler</span> action = <span>do</span>
  handler &lt;- getUncaughtExceptionHandler
  setUncaughtExceptionHandler (handler . wrapException)
  action &lt;* setUncaughtExceptionHandler handler
</code></pre><p>They serve the same purpose, but I am not sure which one is better, hence I provide both.
If you have a good argument in favor of one of these functions, please let me know.</p><p>In the first version, we don’t touch the default handler at all.
In the second version, we only update it to wrap its argument into <code>DisplayExceptionInShow</code> and then apply as is.
Also, there is <code>setDisplayExceptionHandler</code>, which updates the handler the same way as <code>withDisplayExceptionHandler</code> but doesn’t restore it in the end.
In all cases, all concerns should be handled.</p><p>All but one: if we wrap <code>ExitCode</code> into <code>DisplayExceptionInShow</code>, we will break functions like <code>exitSuccess</code> because they work by throwing an <code>ExitCode</code> exception and we change its type.
So we implement <code>wrapException</code> carefully to ignore <code>ExitCode</code>:</p><pre><code><span>wrapException</span> :: <span>SomeException</span> -&gt; <span>SomeException</span>
<span>wrapException</span> e
  | isSyncException e
  , <span>Nothing</span> &lt;- fromException @<span>Deadlock</span> e
  , <span>Nothing</span> &lt;- fromException @<span>ExitCode</span> e =
      toException $ <span>DisplayExceptionInShow</span> e
  | otherwise = e
  <span>where</span>
    isSyncException :: <span>SomeException</span> -&gt; <span>Bool</span>
    isSyncException = isNothing . fromException @<span>SomeAsyncException</span>
</code></pre><p>Notice that we also ignore exceptions that can be cast to <code>SomeAsyncException</code>.
The reason is twofold:</p><ol>
<li>There are not many such exceptions, and their <code>show</code> representation should be more or less human-friendly.</li>
<li>I am afraid that by wrapping them into <code>DisplayExceptionInShow</code>, we may break something the same way as we break when we wrap <code>ExitCode</code>.</li>
</ol><p>We also ignore <code>Deadlock</code> because it’s specifically handled by <code>defaultHandler</code>.</p><p>Notice that there is an essential difference in case an uncaught exception occurs in a thread other than the one where one of these functions was used.
<code>displayUncaughtException</code> only affects the thread where it’s called, all other threads are unaffected (and use <code>Show</code> for printing by default).
<code>withDisplayExceptionHandler</code> updates …</p></div></div>

<p><code>dry-python/returns@0.15</code> is <a href="https://github.com/dry-python/returns/releases/tag/0.15.0">released</a>! And it means that now anyone can use our Higher Kinded Types emulation in their projects.</p>

<p>In this post I will explain:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What Higher Kinded Types (HKTs) are and why they are useful</li>
  <li>How they are implemented and what limitations there are</li>
  <li>How can you use them in your own projects</li>
</ul>

<p>Without further ado, let’s talk about typing!</p>


      <h2 id="simple-types">
        
        <a href="#simple-types">Simple types</a>
        
      </h2>

<p>Typing is layered. Like a good cake. There are at least three layers that we are going to cover.</p>

<p>Simple (or flat) typing, like <code>x: int = 1</code>. This allows us to express simple types and their transformations. Like <code>int -&gt; str</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>stringify</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>str</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A lot of languages like <code>go</code> and <code>php</code> do not go beyond this line. And they still work pretty well! These types are also sometimes called <code>*</code>-kinded. It can be understood as “a place for just a single type argument”.</p>


    
      <h2 id="generic">
        
        <a href="#generic">Generic</a>
        
      </h2>

<p>Generic level is required to express “nested” types. For example, you have a list of integers. In Python we annotate it as <code>List[int]</code> or <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0585/"><code>list[int]</code></a> in Python <code>3.9</code>. This allows us to have types with other types as arguments. <code>List</code> can receive <code>int</code> or <code>str</code> or even another <code>List</code> as the type argument. This way we can nest type and types start to have their own structure.</p>

<p>Generics are much more interesting than simple types. And they can have multiple type arguments:</p>
<ul>
  <li>List has one: for values, so it has a kind of <code>* -&gt; *</code>. It can be understood as a type transformation <code>List -&gt; T = List[T]</code></li>
  <li>Dict has two: for keys and values, so it has a kind of <code>* -&gt; * -&gt; *</code>. It can be understood as a type transformation <code>Dict -&gt; K -&gt; V = Dict[K, V]</code></li>
  <li>And so on!</li>
</ul>

<p>This would be very helpful for us in the future, I promise.</p>

<p>We can also write transformations for generic types:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>stringify_list_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>List</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>[</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>arg</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But, that is where things begin to be quite complicated.</p>

<p>How can this function work with other iterables like <code>set</code>, <code>frozenset</code>, <code>tuple</code>?
We can express this in Python as easy as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>type</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>arg</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But the typing part would be quite challenging. Let’s try several things.</p>


    
      <h3 id="common-interface">
        
        <a href="#common-interface">Common interface</a>
        
      </h3>

<p>The first obvious thing to try is <code>Iterable</code> protocol. It is builtin into Python and does what we need.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Iterable</span>

<span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>Iterable</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Iterable</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>type</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>arg</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s try it out:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>]))</span>
<span># Revealed type is 'typing.Iterable[builtins.str]'
</span>
<span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>({</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>}))</span>
<span>#  Revealed type is 'typing.Iterable[builtins.str]'
</span>
<span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>((</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)))</span>
<span>#  Revealed type is 'typing.Iterable[builtins.str]'
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can see that a part of our typing information is lost. We pass <code>List</code> or <code>Set</code> or <code>Tuple</code> and always get the <code>Iterable</code> back.</p>

<p>Sometimes - this is ok. But, in some cases, this is not enough. Let’s try some other technique!</p>


    
      <h3 id="methods">
        
        <a href="#methods">Methods</a>
        
      </h3>

<p>One can say: we are all using Object-Oriented Programming! Why cannot we just create a new method for each type we need? And specify the exact return type there!</p>

<p>Well, it is a possible solution. But, there are some reasonable problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You cannot add methods to existing types and extend them with this approach. Only create new ones, probably via subtyping, and add new methods there. In our example you would have to create your own versions of <code>List</code>, <code>Set</code>, and <code>Tuple</code>. Which is not desirable in most situations</li>
  <li>It really starts to be messy if you have a lot of methods to add. A type with more than <code>X</code> (choose the number yourself) methods starts to be really complex to read, understand, and use. Instead, using separate functions is much easier, because we don’t have to put everything into a single namespace</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s try something else.</p>


    
      <h3 id="overloads">
        
        <a href="#overloads">overloads</a>
        
      </h3>

<p>Another solution that might solve our problem is using the <code>@overload</code> decorator with proper types for each required case.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>List</span><span>,</span> <span>Set</span><span>,</span> <span>overload</span>

<span>@</span><span>overload</span>
<span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>List</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>...</span>

<span>@</span><span>overload</span>
<span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>Set</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Set</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>...</span>

<span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>type</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>arg</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s test it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>]))</span>
<span># Revealed type is 'builtins.list[builtins.str]'
</span>
<span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>({</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>}))</span>
<span># Revealed type is 'builtins.set[builtins.str]'
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Awesome! Looks like we’ve achieved our goal, haven’t we? But, there’s a new problem. We have to manually list all possible cases in a function’s signature. This works for cases when all possible arguments and outcomes are known in advance. But, not in this case. In Python <code>Iterable</code> is a protocol. We can use this function with any type with <code>__iter__</code> method defined: with both builtin and custom types. So, the number of possible arguments and outcomes is endless.</p>

<p>To illusrate the problem, let’s see what happens for <code>Tuple</code> which is not listed in the function’s overloads:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>((</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)))</span>
<span># error: No overload variant of "stringify_iterable_items" matches argument type "Tuple[int, int, int]"
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We, in <code>dry-python</code> <a href="https://github.com/dry-python/returns/blob/0.14.0/returns/_generated/converters/flatten.pyi">used this technique</a> with <code>@overload</code> decorator for our previous versions. This allowed us to write correct definitions of functions working with generic types. But, they were limited to the pre-defined set of our own types. And we wanted to allow our users to create their custom types based on our interfaces. With the full existing code reuse.</p>


    
      <h2 id="higher-kinded-types">
        
        <a href="#higher-kinded-types">Higher Kinded Types</a>
        
      </h2>

<p>That’s where the idea of Higher Kinded Types becomes useful. We need HKTs when we want to change the inner structure of generics with full type information preserving and openness to the extension. In theory, you can write something like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Iterable</span>

<span>T</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'T'</span><span>,</span> <span>bound</span><span>=</span><span>Iterable</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>type</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>arg</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And this would solve our problem! What happens here is that we abstract away the <code>Iterable</code> type itself. And then ask <code>mypy</code> to figure this out for us.</p>

<p>This way we can potentially have <code>stringify_iterable_items</code> working for any <code>Iterable</code> type, but with the exact same type returned back without any information lost. And it would work for all types.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>]))</span>
<span># Revealed type is 'builtins.list[builtins.str]'
</span>
<span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>({</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>}))</span>
<span># Revealed type is 'builtins.set[builtins.str]'
</span>
<span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>MyCustomIterable</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)))</span>
<span># Revealed type is 'my_module.MyCustomIterable[builtins.str]'
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://github.com/python/typing/issues/548">it is not supported</a> at the moment.</p>


    
      <h3 id="emulation">
        
        <a href="#emulation">Emulation</a>
        
      </h3>

<p>Turns out we are not alone in this situation. There are multiple languages where Higher Kinded Types are not natively supported yet. But, they can be emulated:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts/blob/master/docs/guides/HKT.md">TypeScript</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://bow-swift.io/docs/fp-concepts/higher-kinded-types/">Swift</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://arrow-kt.io/docs/0.10/patterns/glossary/#higher-kinds">Kotlin</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And now with <a href="https://returns.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/hkt.html">Python</a> too!</p>

<p>There’s also <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jdy22/papers/lightweight-higher-kinded-polymorphism.pdf">an original whitepaper</a> for ones who are interested.</p>

<p>The core idea of HKT emulation is that we can write types the other way around: not like <code>T[int]</code>, but rather like <code>Kind[T, int]</code> (which is absolutely the same thing).</p>

<p>This way we can transform the inner structure of generics, but maintain the simple context without reinventing <code>TypeVar</code> with type arguments. And our function’s type signature will look like: <code>Kind[T, int] -&gt; Kind[T, str]</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s see the implementation.</p>


    
      <h2 id="implementation">
        
        <a href="#implementation">Implementation</a>
        
      </h2>

<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: here’s <a href="https://gist.github.com/sobolevn/7f8ffd885aec70e55dd47928a1fb3e61">the final working code</a> with all the logic, all the hacks, and everything. In this article, we going to write and explain it step by step.</p>

<p>We would need a better example to test our implementation. Let’s build two types: a <code>Box</code> and a <code>Bag</code>. <code>Box</code> is defined by its size, while a <code>Bag</code> is an item of fashion: it has a brand name and a model name (I have a wife, I know this stuff!).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>dataclasses</span> <span>import</span> <span>dataclass</span>
<span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Callable</span><span>,</span> <span>Generic</span><span>,</span> <span>TypeVar</span>

<span>_ValueType</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_ValueType'</span><span>)</span>
<span>_NewValueType</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_NewValueType'</span><span>)</span>

<span>@</span><span>dataclass</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Box</span><span>(</span><span>Generic</span><span>[</span><span>_ValueType</span><span>]):</span>
    <span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>_ValueType</span>
    <span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span>
    <span>width</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span>
    <span>height</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span>

<span>@</span><span>dataclass</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Bag</span><span>(</span><span>Generic</span><span>[</span><span>_ValueType</span><span>]):</span>
    <span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>_ValueType</span>
    <span>brand</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span>
    <span>model</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And we can create <code>Box</code>es and <code>Bag</code>s of different types, because we can put different things inside them:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>box</span> <span>=</span> <span>Box</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>=</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>length</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>width</span><span>=</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>height</span><span>=</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>  <span># Box[int]
</span><span>bag</span> <span>=</span> <span>Bag</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>=</span><span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>brand</span><span>=</span><span>'Fancy'</span><span>,</span> <span>model</span><span>=</span><span>'Baggy'</span><span>)</span>  <span># Bag[int]
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, we need a function with a type transformation. Let’s say we want to apply a function to the value inside boxes and bags. Let’s use fake <code>BoxOrBag</code> type for now to illustrate our intent:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Callable</span>

<span>_NewValueType</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_NewValueType'</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>apply_function</span><span>(</span>
    <span>instance</span><span>:</span> <span>BoxOrBag</span><span>[</span><span>_ValueType</span><span>],</span>  <span># fake type for now
</span>    <span>callback</span><span>:</span> <span>Callable</span><span>[[</span><span>_ValueType</span><span>],</span> <span>_NewValueType</span><span>],</span>
<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>BoxOrBag</span><span>[</span><span>_NewValueType</span><span>]:</span>  <span># fake type for now
</span>    <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It is going to work like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>assert</span> <span>apply_function</span><span>(</span><span>box</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>Box</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>=</span><span>'10'</span><span>,</span> <span>length</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>width</span><span>=</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>height</span><span>=</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>apply_function</span><span>(</span><span>bag</span><span>,</span> <span>bool</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>Bag</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>,</span> <span>brand</span><span>=</span><span>'Fancy'</span><span>,</span> <span>model</span><span>=</span><span>'Baggy'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We only need to change current fake <code>BoxOrBag</code> type to a real HKT. We would need to define a new <code>Kind</code> type to make the emulation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>_InstanceType</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_InstanceType'</span><span>,</span> <span>covariant</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>
<span>_FirstTypeArgType</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_FirstTypeArgType'</span><span>,</span> <span>covariant</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Kind</span><span>(</span><span>Generic</span><span>[</span><span>_InstanceType</span><span>,</span> <span>_FirstTypeArgType</span><span>]):</span>
    <span>"""Used for HKT emulation."""</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One pro-tip about <code>Kind</code>: it won’t not exist during runtime. Only during type-checking.</p>

<p>Now, let’s change <code>apply_function</code> to use <code>Kind</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>_InstanceKind</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_InstanceKind'</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>apply_function</span><span>(</span>
    <span>instance</span><span>:</span> <span>Kind</span><span>[</span><span>_InstanceKind</span><span>,</span> <span>_ValueType</span><span>],</span>
    <span>callback</span><span>:</span> <span>Callable</span>…</code></pre></div></div></div></div>

<p>When building a prediction model, you take into account its predictive power by calculating <a href="https://neptune.ai/blog/evaluation-metrics-binary-classification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">different evaluation metrics</a>. Some of them are common, like accuracy and precision. But others, like the Brier score in the weather forecasting model above, are often neglected.</p>



<p>In this tutorial you’ll get a simple, introductory explanation of <strong>Brier Score and calibration – one of the most important concepts used to evaluate prediction performance in statistics.</strong></p>






<h2>What is the Brier Score?</h2>



<p>Brier Score evaluates the accuracy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">probabilistic predictions</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Say we have two models that correctly predicted the sunny weather. One with the probability of 0.51 and the other with 0.93. They are both correct and have the same accuracy (assuming 0.5 threshold) but the second model feels better right? That is where Brier score comes in.</p>



<p>It is particularly useful when we are working with variables that can only take a finite number of values (we can call them categories or labels too).&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, level of emergency (which takes four values: green, yellow, orange, and red), or whether tomorrow will be a rainy, cloudy or sunny day, or whether a threshold will be exceeded.</p>



<p><strong>The Brier Score is more like a cost function.</strong> A lower value implies accurate predictions and vice versa. The primary goal of dealing with this concept is to decrease it.</p>



<p>The mathematical formulation of the Brier Score depends on the type of predicted variable. If we are developing a binary prediction, the score is given by:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Q4p2F5bge5_hnyvs0JG_YUp7392F2FgSdWTYsI51aRrTbYIuqAV33KKzmEka4tU8pK0tQgLpVzAkVNNcS4Y-XWVdiOp2Z_lppmv9Po3ZuWHPMfaIv-U7QkB58ND1NGOt8E8X2AN6" alt="equation" width="238" height="73"></figure></div>



<p>Where p is the prediction probability of occurrence of the event, and the term oi is equal to 1 if the event occurred and 0 if not.</p>



<div>

</div>



<div>
<p>Let’s take a very quick example to assimilate this concept. Let’s consider the event <strong>A=”Tomorrow is a sunny day”</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you predict that the event A will occur with a probability of 100%, and the event occurs (the next is sunny which means o=1), the Brier score is equal to:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ac266s-ucUPAcK6S2azMNSR6Gi7uvRShCgyZ3ZAjjXtcucryr5iZyiWFXUO85uHYbB_MuBN2NAvsgcN3QhDVO3-4Grm9p9_E5ro7bhbSAip9z4QOTWT-L-98oLhcdRQAGL-YyGJ7" alt="(1-1)^2=0" width="142" height="33"></figure></div>
</div>
</div>



<p>This is the lowest value possible. In other words: the best case we can achieve.</p>



<p>If we predicted the same event with the same probability, but the event doesn’t occur, the Brier score in this case is:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/nEZ-Uzx_T2Tf-ugHrqGouKkodSNQba7B1_Nd9W39TshxDdGJ6P8pp_2k2OfH0pVJpI7wcjZ_uiaAnN33qArqYNxMfFus0HwSItr4iAwZyKAD8jNzyLLppGlW8f_kvjxG-pqGoxJy" alt="equation" width="142" height="33"></figure></div>



<p>Say you predicted that the event A will occur with another probability, let’s say 60%. In case the event doesn’t occur in reality, the Brier Score will be:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JPUF_ydWbPK01Rp4Ja-uHZeJ9TwQ3E6eo7k89N1ebVGHu0ayxtfifuuYSt2xAudQ_KavEfWzKBjoVAMYEKNDnolZkDN-NyCwomNrcltQognR3R-ZQf18_oXlFL7XRUXQ-C48IwfC" alt="equation" width="198" height="33"></figure></div>



<p>As you may have noticed, the Brier score is a distance in the probability domain. Which means: <strong>the lower the value of this score, the better the prediction.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>A perfect prediction will get a score of 0. The worst score is 1. It’s a synthetic criterion that provides combined information on the accuracy, robustness, and interpretability of the prediction model.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Brier-score.jpg?resize=768%2C431&amp;ssl=1" alt="brier score prediction" width="768" height="431" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Brier-score.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Brier-score.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Brier-score.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Brier-score.jpg?w=1366&amp;ssl=1 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>



<p><strong>Dotted lines represent the worst cases</strong> (if the event occurs, the circle is equal to 1).</p>






<h2>What is probability calibration?</h2>



<p>Probability calibration is the post-processing of a model to improve its <a href="https://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/niatt_labmanual/Chapters/traveldemandforecasting/professionalpractice/ModelCalibrationAndValidation.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">probability estimate</a>. It helps us compare two models that have the same accuracy or other standard evaluation metrics.</p>



<p><strong>We say that a model is well calibrated when a prediction of a class with confidence p is correct 100p % of the time. </strong>To illustrate this calibration effect, let’s consider that you have a model that predicts cancer with a score of 70% for each patient out of 100. If your model is well calibrated, we would have 70 patients with cancer, if it is ill-calibrated, we will have more (or less).<strong> </strong>Therefore, the difference between these two models:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>A model has an accuracy of 70% with 0.7 confidence in each prediction = well calibrated.</li><li>A model who has an accuracy of 70% with 0.9 confidence in each prediction = ill-calibrated.</li></ul>



<p>For a perfect calibration, the relationship between the predicted probability and the fraction of positives follows the given:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="386" height="278" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/perfect-calibration.png?resize=386%2C278&amp;ssl=1" alt="perfect calibration" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/perfect-calibration.png?w=386&amp;ssl=1 386w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/perfect-calibration.png?resize=300%2C216&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/perfect-calibration.png?resize=370%2C265&amp;ssl=1 370w" sizes="(max-width: 386px) 100vw, 386px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>The expression of this relationship is given by:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Q2F0Woa7z9QD1HHWY6UCfCcn98CrT-weUWQiebvxHjGle3D1dfoZQtLnVW1KznaLUAN2zhuwLfNfoW3zzZfYbG-tcuCoy9qwncDJ3mlZ0vJiAkmhjjLz4vceil-01z-yYPefK9wZ" alt="equation" width="275" height="36"></figure></div>



<p>The figure above represents the <strong>reliability diagram of a model</strong>. We can plot it using scikit-learn as below:</p>



<pre><span>import</span> sklearn 
<span>from</span> sklearn.calibration <span>import</span> calibration_curve
<span>import</span> matplotlib.lines <span>as</span> line
<span>import</span> matplotlib.pyplot <span>as</span> plt 

x, y=calibration_curve(y_true, y_prob)

plt.plot(x,y)
ref = line.Line2D([<span>0</span>, <span>1</span>], [<span>0</span>, <span>1</span>], color=<span>'black'</span>)
transform = ax.transAxes
line.set_transform(transform)
ax.add_line(line)
fig.suptitle(<span>'Calibration – Neptune.ai'</span>)
ax.set_xlabel(<span>'Predicted probability'</span>)
ax.set_ylabel(<span>'Fraction of positive'</span>)
plt.legend()
plt.show()
</pre>



<p><strong>Plotting the reliability curve for multiple models allows us to choose the best model not only based on its accuracy, but on its calibration too</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the figure below, we can eliminate the SVC (0.163) model because it is far from being well calibrated.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/calibration-plots.png?resize=768%2C494&amp;ssl=1" alt="calibration plots" width="768" height="494" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/calibration-plots.png?resize=1024%2C659&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/calibration-plots.png?resize=300%2C193&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/calibration-plots.png?resize=768%2C494&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/calibration-plots.png?w=1212&amp;ssl=1 1212w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>

<p>If we want a numeric value to check the calibration of our models, we can use the calibration error given theoretically by:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/4l2TYtb5DJJh03TIJrENrxsyx2OJr58kZtQJ9FWa-kDDXDgWZfSYCIHlDaPqNpmliLgicPwZ6lwqDwAtJBxmKRfAdE3oyP_UBEkFyMBIvq5HtY9y9FXCD0pkaDyqM9JkFrxZOT-J" alt="equation" width="307" height="50"></figure></div>






<h2>When should you use the Brier score?</h2>



<p>Evaluating the performance of a machine learning model is important, but it’s not enough to evaluate the <a href="https://timvangelder.com/2015/05/18/brier-score-composition-a-mini-tutorial/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">real-world application</a> predictions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We often worry about:</p>



<ul><li>the model’s confidence in its predictions,&nbsp;</li><li>its error distribution,&nbsp;</li><li>and how probability estimates are made.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>In such cases, we need to use other performance factors. Brier score is an example.</p>



<p>This type of performance score is <strong>specifically used in high-risk applications</strong>. This score allows us to not treat the model results as real probabilities, but instead go beyond the raw results and check the model calibration, which is important for avoiding bad decision making or false interpretation.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Example of needing well-calibrated probabilities/model calibration</strong></h3>



<p>Let’s consider that you want to build a model that shows news pages to users by the chance of clicking on them. If the chance of the user clicking on a suggested item is high, the item is shown on the main page. Else, we show another item with a higher chance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this kind of problem, we don’t really care about how much the exact chance of clicking is, but only which item has the highest chance between all of the existing items. <strong>The model calibration is not really crucial here</strong>. What matters is which one of them has the highest probability (chance) of being clicked.</p>



<p>On the other hand, consider a problem in which we build a model that predicts the probability of contracting a specific disease based on the output of some analysis. The exact value of the probability is crucial here because it affects the decision of the doctor and the health of the patient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Generally, calibration is used to improve a model when the results show that it has mistakes with high probabilities (or prediction score when the model doesn’t output the probability estimate e.g. random forest).</p>



<p>Of course, you can also look at other metrics that take prediction scores as input, like <a href="https://neptune.ai/blog/f1-score-accuracy-roc-auc-pr-auc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ROC AUC score</a>, but they usually don’t focus on correctly calibrated probabilities. For example, ROC AUC focuses on ranking predictions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ok, now we can tell when the model is not well calibrated, but what can we do about it? How can we calibrate it?</p>






<h2>Probability calibration methods</h2>



<p>People use a lot of <a href="https://medium.com/@kingsubham27/calibration-techniques-and-its-importance-in-machine-learning-71bec997b661" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">calibration methods</a>. We will focus on the two most popular approaches:&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Platt Scaling</strong></h3>



<p>Platt Scaling is often used to calibrate a model that we have already built. The principle of this method is based on the transformation of the outputs of our classification model into probability distribution.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Our model will not only give a categorical result (label or class), but also a degree of certainty about the result itself</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead of returning the class 1 as a result, it will return the probability of the correctness of this class prediction. Unfortunately, some classification models (like SVM) do not return probability values, or give poor probability estimates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why we use specific transformations to calibrate our model and convert the results into probability.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="321" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Brier-score-2-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C321&amp;ssl=1" alt="plat scalling" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Brier-score-2-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C321&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Brier-score-2-1.jpg?resize=300%2C94&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Brier-score-2-1.jpg?resize=768%2C241&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Brier-score-2-1.jpg?w=1366&amp;ssl=1 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>



<p><strong>To use the Platt scaling method</strong>, we train our model normally, and then train the parameters of an additional sigmoid function to map the model outputs into probabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can do it using Logistic Regression fitted on the output of the model.&nbsp;</p>



<pre><span>from</span> sklearn.linear_model <span>import</span> LinearRegression

model=LinearRegression()
model.fit(p_out, y_out)
calib_p=model.predict(p_test)[:,<span>1</span>]
</pre>



<h3><strong>Isotonic Regression</strong></h3>



<p>Isotonic Regression does the same thing as Platt Scaling – they both transform model output into probability, and therefore calibrate it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s the difference?</p>



<p><strong>Platt Scaling uses a sigmoid shape to calibrate the model</strong>, which implies a sigmoid-shaped distortion in our probability distribution.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Isotonic Regression</strong> is a more powerful calibration method that can correct any monotonic distortion. It <strong>projects a non parametric function into a set of increasing functions</strong> (monotonic).&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>It is not recommended to use the isotonic regression if you have a small dataset,</strong> because it can easily&nbsp;overfit.</p>



<p>To implement this approach, we will again use sklearn (we assume you have already built and trained your “uncalibrated model”):</p>



<pre><span>from</span> sklearn.linear_model <span>import</span> IsotonicRegression

model=IsotonicRegression()
model.fit(p_out, y_out)
calib_p=model.transform(p_test)
</pre>






<h2>Using model calibration on a real example</h2>



<p>Let’s get some practice!</p>



<p>In order to keep it unique, we will generate two classes using <code>make_classification</code> from sklearn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After that, we will train and fit an SVM classifier on the dataset.</p>



<pre><span>from</span> sklearn.datasets <span>import</span> make_classification
<span>from</span> sklearn.model_selection <span>import</span> train_test_split
<span>from</span> sklearn.svm <span>import</span> SVC

X, y = make_classification(n_samples=<span>2500</span>, n_classes=<span>2</span>)
X_train, X_test, …</pre></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Exposing internal data structures are bound to lead to a messy situation.
When a method caller knows too much about an underlying system, there is a nasty kind of coupling.
This dependency issue is also known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter">Law of Demeter</a>.
Some people call it â€œtoo many dots syndromeâ€� because it leads to <code>code.accessing.attributes.very.deeply</code>.
The whole point is that the caller should not have knowledge of the deep attribute.</p>

<p>I recently worked on a project that dealt with parsing numbers.
Lots of projects do this, right?
Another common use-case is to provide some error messages based on the type of incorrect input.
Unfortunately, as the business requirements grew, our code lagged behind.
This technical debt slowed future velocity and introduced some errors.
Eww.</p>

<p>The data structure began something like this:</p>



<p>The above structure represents what a user might have in their shopping cart for checkout.
It does feel like <code>quantity</code> isnâ€™t actually part of a product and that it should be normalized somehow.
Regardless, this was the structure that the team came to a consensus on.</p>

<p>As it turns out, the quantity attribute needs to be a little more complicated.
You see, a user might want to input a quantity in a text box.
So at this point you might be saying: â€œWell just make quantity a stringâ€�.
Sounds good, right?
Letâ€™s go ahead and roll with it.</p>



<p>Now the user is able to edit the quantity.
However, changing the type from a number to a string leads to an issue.
Now we cannot calculate the total as easily anymore.
So at this point you might be saying: â€œJust parse the numberâ€�.
<em>Hmmâ€¦ thereâ€™s a little voice in the back of my head warning me</em>.
Eh, whatever.
Letâ€™s go ahead and throw this change in too.</p>



<p>Youâ€™ll also notice that we are adding some scope in.
We are fetching the total by parsing the quantity and multiplying by the price.
I think now the little voice is speaking up:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>â€œShould it be the job of the caller to calculate the price?â€�</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If two product attributes are being exclusively accessed, maybe we should have a separate module to encapsulate this logic.
The module could be named <code>Product</code>, and it could hold a function called <code>getTotal()</code>.</p>

<p>In the favor of moving fast, we ended up <em>not</em> creating a module dedicated to product operations.
I would say that this was the first substantial warning sign that went unnoticed.</p>

<p>Alright, so now what happens when the user inputs garbage like â€œasdfâ€� into the text box?</p>



<p>Itâ€™s not the best UX to be displaying NaN as a product total.
Itâ€™s probably a good call to add a little more safety around quantity.
This will allow us to report to the user that theyâ€™ve made a mistake.</p>



<p>The <code>const total</code> assignment is getting larger.
This doesnâ€™t look too good.</p>

<p>At this point, the total calculation was abstracted away into a function, but it still was not apart of a module specific to a product.
This lead to several places in the codebase with similar quantity parsing.
As a result, we still <em>did not have a single source of truth</em>.</p>

<p>In the meantime, thereâ€™s an edge case that we didnâ€™t cover yet.
Can you find it?
Itâ€™s not quite possible to purchase negative vacuum cleaners.
Additionally, there are only so many vacuum cleaners in stock.
Therefore, there needs to be some kind of minimum/maximum validation.
As a result, we added a validation object to quantity.</p>



<p>I am omitting the actual validation logic, but we can pretend that the <code>errMessage</code> will be populated with the expected value.
As we can see, our data structure is nowhere near as simple as it once was.</p>

<p>This is where things started breaking.
The attribute <code>product.quantity.isValid</code> has now moved to <code>product.quantity.validation.isValid</code>.
I believe we had about 10-15 callers trusting the integrity of the product data structure.
This is where the lesson is learned.</p>

<p><strong>Never trust the integrity of a data structure.</strong></p>

<p>This Law of Demeter violation could be pretty easily patched with a module dedicated to the product.
By having a module along side the complex data structure, we can derive a productâ€™s attributes without requiring knowledge of the underlying implementation.</p>

<p>Furthermore, by following the Single Responsibility Principle, a product can be further split into a couple of concepts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Product (as before)</li>
  <li>Quantity</li>
  <li>Validator</li>
</ul>

<p>The first step would be to define some interfaces representing these concepts.
The interface ought to be unchanging â€“ serving as a contract.
This will ensure stability for the 10-15 areas which utilize this code.</p>



<p>Take a peek and notice <code>Quantity.isValid()</code>.
From an implementation standpoint, Quantity would just defer to <code>validation.isValid()</code>.
In the case that business requirements become more difficult, additional logic can be added as necessary.</p>

<p>As a result, the 10-15 function calls can let out a sigh of relief.
They no longer need to know how exactly a quantity is being validated.
All the need to know is <code>product.getQuantity().isValid()</code>.
Easy right?</p>

<p>One other thing worth noting, we now have a <code>getTotal()</code> on Product!
Now there is a single source of truth for computing a price. :D</p>

<p>Why is encapsulation so powerful?
It is adaptive to change.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Product might one day substitute the <code>name</code> attribute for an <code>InternationalizedString</code> object. This would add support for different languages.</li>
  <li>The Product might one day change <code>price</code> to a <code>CurrencyAmount</code>. This would add support for formatting price strings in different currencies.</li>
</ul>

<p>All the while, each of the 10-15 callers would be none-the-wiser on how these attributes are computed!
The interface remains a steadfast contract!</p>

<p>So next time you see <code>code.accessing.attributes.very.deeply</code>, letâ€™s stop for a moment to refactor.
Encapsulation is a quick win.
Yes it might be a little more verbose, but you will thank yourself down the road.</p>

<p>At first, learn programming can be scary as fuck, you can think about maths and complex operations, but actually, programming is as simple as talking with a computer, is like learning English or French, but you use programming languages to communicate with the machines.</p>
<p>When you start learning programming, you will feel overwhelmed by the number of resources you will find. I won’t cover where to find resources in this post (TODO: write a post about that), but you can find some interesting things in <a href="https://pixo.sh/starting-in-programming-as-a-self-taught-developer/" target="_blank" aria-label="this article (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">this article</a>, instead, I will share some tips I used (and I still use), and how they helped me to improve my learning curve</p>

<h2>Tip 1: Consistency is key</h2>
<p>I’m a genious right? nobody though about this. Actually this is very important, and is the base of every habit you will try to build by yourself</p>
<p>When you learn something new, your brain will be trained based on two things: frequency and recency</p>
<p>Consistency here means that you should try to learn on a regular basis, try to stablish a time during your day where you can stick your ass in a chair with a relaxing mood and without being disturbed.</p>

<h2>Tip 2: Write a glossary</h2>
<p>You will find A LOT of things that you don’t understand, write them in a glossary and explain them in a way you can understand, this is for you, use whatever technique you want to explain the concepts, frogs? frogs then, amount of apples in a basked? amount of apples in a basket.</p>
<p>When I learn new things I use this technique: Scan – Learn – Read</p>
<ol><li>I scan the information and identify concepts that I don’t understand, I write them in a simple .txt file in my editor</li><li>I learn every concept, I tend to use practical examples, they allow me to assimilate knowledge easily</li><li>Now I can understand everything I read, so I can read everything in a fluent way without stopping because I don’t understand something</li></ol>
<h2>Tip 3: Learn to deal with the frustration</h2>
<p>Frustration will come, and that’s something every one of us should learn to deal with.</p>
<p>Sometimes you will feel frustrated because you don’t understand <a aria-label="what's a thread (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what’s a thread</a> (this took me some time to understand), or a determinated concept, but you know what, THAT’S TOTALLY OK, you don’t need to understand everything at first. It can demotivate you, make you want to give up, but the truth is that is only a stone in your path.</p>
<p>People has several ways to deal with frustration, but my main advice is to step away from your source of frustration for a while, and try to think in other things, when you arrive to the problem next time, you will see it with other eyes</p>
<p>What to do vs what not to do when you are frustrated while you are learning programming:</p>
<h3>DON’T</h3>
<ul><li>Don’t keep trying to solve the problem, it will frustrate you even more</li><li>Don’t try to learn other programming things immediately, you will keep thinking about that thing that is frustrating you</li><li>Don’t rush things, even if you solve this problem, you will face more in the future, improve the way you deal with them</li></ul>
<h3>DO</h3>
<ul><li>Do things not related to programming, cooking, videogames, do some exercises, for example, I like to watch youtube videos about restorations, I recommend you <a aria-label="this channel (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsCCifMby57qV_UmrYGladQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this channel</a> if you want to try, they are really satisfying and relaxing</li><li>Ask for help, there are a lot of people on the internet who probably stepped into the same problem before and are more than happy to help you, but remember, their time is valuable, be polite and respectful.</li></ul>

<p>I hope this post helps people in their programming journey, is directly extracted from my professional journey and these are some of the things that worked for me</p>

<![CDATA[The On-Demand Communication Fallacy]]>

October 28, 2020 | https://curvedlayer.com/2020/10/20/internal-communication.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://curvedlayer.com/2020/10/20/internal-communication.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Well established communication is the most critical factor for the team to work. Without sharing information, we can’t get anything done.</p>

<p>Poorly designed communication brings more harm than any other inefficient process. Let’s take Slack as an example. Slack made it effortless to ask anyone in the team at your convenience. You don’t know the date of the next release? You’re one question away from knowing it.</p>

<p>Although this is a powerful concept, there are numerous downsides to it. Instead of surfacing relevant information, we “actively query” knowledge from humans on-demand.</p>

<h3 id="problems-with-on-demand-communication">Problems with on-demand communication</h3>
<p>Active Information Seeking is commonly used in social media. With algorithms forming the feed, new and engaging content is always there for you. No matter when you open the app.</p>

<p>Real-time chat apps are using a similar model. Except in the team environment, you don’t need “engaging” content. All you need is painless access to your colleagues.</p>

<h4 id="1--remote-teams">#1 – Remote Teams</h4>
<p>Having the team spread around the world immediately breaks an on-demand information querying model. You can’t rely on people being available whenever you are. You no longer have the luxury to ask people anytime.</p>

<p>A lot of US companies embraced Remote work but only within the US. <span>Limiting communication to a time zone doesn’t solve the fundamental problem. It just removes some symptoms.</span></p>

<p>In the remote environment, communication flow should not depend on individuals. It decreases the overall resilience of the team and slows everyone down.</p>

<h4 id="2--idle-time">#2 – Idle Time</h4>
<p>The time you spend asking people is the time that could be invested better. The time you wait for their response is even more precious. If you value time and speed, on-demand communication should not even be the option.</p>

<p>I’m not even talking about the effects of this model on other people in the team. Every message (information query) sent could break someone else’s flow. And coming back to the flow state would require additional effort + time.</p>

<h4 id="3--pressure--anxiety">#3 – Pressure &amp; Anxiety</h4>
<p>Heavy reliance on real-time communication brings additional emotional pressure. It is especially true for remote teams. There’s no way to know what the person on the other end feels. What might seem like a “friendly question” could be a distraction for others.</p>

<h3 id="passive-consumption--active-seeking">Passive Consumption &gt; Active Seeking</h3>
<p>The opposite of active on-demand communication is passive information consumption. With heavy reliance on systems, passive consumption guarantees relevant information is distributed to the right people at the right time. Setting up passive consumption for a team requires you to look at overall operations on the meta-level. Define who needs what and when.</p>

<p>The marketing team might need to know about the new feature release at least three weeks in advance. Or support engineers might need to know about bug fix deployment right away.</p>

<p>This way, you can set up processes to let relevant information come to people. Instead of people searching for relevant information themselves.</p>

<p>There are a few tools based on this model. For example, <a href="https://mailbrew.com/">Mailbrew</a> and <a href="http://mailmanhq.com/">Mailman</a> allow choosing the terms for receiving relevant information. No matter when this information became available.</p>

<h3 id="fundamentals-of-information-logistics">Fundamentals of Information Logistics</h3>
<p>The idea of passive information consumption is based on information distribution rules. There are five core principles for information logistics. Each piece of circulating information needs to be examined against them.</p>

<p>It’s important to mention these concepts below aren’t isolated from each other. That means each of them defines the others.</p>

<h4 id="what-kind-of-information">What kind of Information?</h4>
<p>First, it’s important to define the actual knowledge you want to distribute. It can be the date of the upcoming release or feedback from customers, bug reports, etc. Not everything has to be delivered passively.</p>

<h4 id="who-needs-the-information">Who needs the Information?</h4>
<p>When the type of information is defined, it’s time to understand who needs to get it. How to select those people? A good approximation would be answering those questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How motivated are they to get the information?</li>
  <li>How much their duty depends on the information?</li>
  <li>What difference would it make if they won’t get the information?</li>
</ul>

<p>For passive consumption to work, you have to clearly define recipients. But it’s also important not to make the information fully exclusive. There might be other motivated people in the team that you didn’t include.</p>

<h4 id="when-information-is-needed">When Information is needed?</h4>
<p>You have “what” and “who” the next piece is “when”. Different kinds of information should be delivered at different times, depending on the recipient. For example, deploy of the critical bug fix could be delivered instantly. While information about upcoming releases can be delivered in weekly batches.</p>

<p>Determining the right time ensures that the recipient will consume the information. One of the reasons on-demand communication doesn’t work is because the time when the question is asked isn’t comfortable for the person answering.</p>

<h4 id="whats-the-right-form-of-information">What’s the right form of Information?</h4>
<p>The form in which you deliver information plays an important role too. Some people prefer information presented visually, while others like long text messages. The same information can be presented as a presentation, visual diagram, text message, charts, etc. It’s another step to ensure the content you share is consumed.</p>

<p>Because sending the long document hoping people read it doesn’t guaranty anything. You can have all the information in the world in one Google Doc, but it would be impossible to read.</p>

<h4 id="what-delivery-channel-to-use">What delivery channel to use?</h4>
<p>Just like the form of information ensures readability, the channel you use to deliver knowledge ensures receivability. Some people prefer Slack messages, emails, or even Issues on GitHub as information delivery channels. It’s up to the recipient to determine which channel would work best for them.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-setup-passive-consumption">How to setup Passive Consumption?</h3>
<p>You can automate pretty much everything with tools like <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> and recently launched <a href="https://www.ahoyteam.com/">AhoyTeam</a>. Including information distribution at the right time and through comfortable channels.</p>

<p>Actual technical implementation depends a lot on the tools your team uses. For example, do you host your code on GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab? Are you using Slack, Twist, or Microsoft Teams? What do you use for Task Management?</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>Passive information consumption has many upsides compared to on-demand communication. If you noticed, with the on-demand communication model, there is little or no consideration of other people’s preferences. While in passive consumption, other people’s preference is the only thing that makes the system work.</p>

<p>It takes time to set up, analyze the information flow, define interested people, etc. But the gain is a calmer, more efficient workplace where people do not bother each other for no reason.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are many fields in programming. Each field contains many topics. We can't learn and know all of them. </p>
<p>As a developer, I want to learn new frameworks and libraries. But there are many frameworks and libraries created every day. Learning all of them is impossible.</p>
<p>When I started learning web development, I wanted to learn all tools that I was suggested, from programming languages to libraries. Because I thought I would become a professional developer. This made me feel nervous because I can't keep up with the releasing pace. </p>
<p>After I joined a tech company as an intern, I was assigned to a PHP project. Although I worked with PHP, I also wanted to learn other programming languages and tools my company was using. I thought I could be fired if I couldn't use them. </p>
<p>Fortunately, I got the developer job and continued working on this project for almost 1 year. I was also assigned to some PHP projects. Some of them had been written 3 - 4 years ago. I only maintained and updated some minor features. It made me realize that although the technology changed rapidly, the projects did not. Companies didn't want to upgrade to the latest versions of technologies. If the project was working well, there is no reason to change.</p>
<p>At that time, I also knew about Node.js. It was really interesting. You can write Javascript on both front-end and back-end. I decided I would stick with it and be a full-stack Javascript developer. Because I was tired and lazy. I was tired because I try to learn so many things but not use them much. I was lazy because the time was not enough for me. So I wanted to focus on only one thing. This was better.</p>
<p>Now I don't rush to learn new technologies as I did. I am not afraid of being obsolete. I learn new technologies due to being curious. If I want to create something, I will learn a library. I only learn the fundamental and non-technical topics. I love it.</p>
<p>If you just start learning web development or being a professional developer, you don't need to learn all of the latest technologies. Just learn the fundamentals and master them. You should also learn soft-skill. It is important. Although technologies change every day, companies don't change that much. I hear that some projects were written over the decades but still using old technologies.</p>
<p>You don't become a professional developer if you learn all technologies. You also don't become obsolete if you don't learn new technologies. Pick something you want to learn and stick with it. As long as you know the fundamentals, there are many opportunities for you. </p>
<p>It's OKAY to not know everything. Be patient and enjoy learning.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p>One of the more interesting things that I've learnt from <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/doing-personal-experiments/">personal experimentation</a> — but that I have long struggled to express — is some notion of ‘don’t think at the wrong level of abstraction’. </p><p>For a number of years now, I’ve noticed that certain ideas that are true and right when applied to higher levels of abstractions <em>don’t</em> apply to lower ones. Conversely, ideas that might apply to lower levels of abstractions don’t apply cleanly to the higher levels.</p><p>This all seems a little abstract and weird, so here's a trivial example: the rules governing neural networks in the human brain do not apply to human psychology, even though human psychology rests on top of the complex interplay between neurons. Similarly — but from the opposite end — the rules that govern a market economy do not apply to the businesses that <em>make up</em> that market economy, in much the same way that the rules that govern an ecosystem do not apply to the social interactions within a particular species.</p><p>I think this idea is broadly generalisable. For this post, however, I want to talk about a very specific instance of the principle: when attempting to get good at some skill, it is not as useful to think about or even talk about neuroplasticity.</p><p>First: neuroplasticity is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity">real thing</a> — it is the observation that the human brain is able to reorganise synaptic functions and neural connections in order to adapt to learning, practice, or even brain trauma.</p><p>Neuroplasticity is a nice concept to know, if you’re curious about the brain. The idea very often shows up in books or blog posts about expertise and expert performance. K. Anders Ericsson, for example, dedicates an entire chapter to plasticity in his popular science book <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/peak-book-summary/"><em>Peak</em></a>; he uses it to argue that ‘hey, when you learn, your brain changes in response to it!’</p><p>So far so good. But as an idea, neuroplasticity is not particularly useful when you’re attempting to improve in some skill. It is patently ridiculous to say “Oh, I went on a neuroplasticity binge over the weekend, I worked with my coach to improve my chess openings” — you’re essentially saying “I practiced with a coach in order to change my brain.” Good on you!</p><p>What’s the point?</p><p>Neuroplasticity simply tells us that the brain changes in response to learning. It doesn’t tell us <em>how</em> to learn better, or what pedagogical techniques work best for effective learning. And the research around neuroplasticity — that the brain can adapt to trauma, that physical therapy after a stroke works because it depends on the brain’s ability to reconfigure neural connections — isn’t as useful for practice as you might think; it doesn’t tell you anything <em>instrumentally actionable</em> that you may incorporate into your practice.</p><p>In other words, neuroplasticity operates at the <em>wrong level of abstraction for learning</em>. It describes what happens to your neural connections when you’re engaged in practice, but neuroscience isn’t the right level to mine for pedagogical insight. For that, you’ll have to go one level up — to the realm of cognitive science, or psychology. You’ll want to know things like:</p><ul><li>You have two kinds of memory: working memory and long-term memory. How your brain implements these two types of memories is of little concern to you; you merely need to know how to facilitate the transfer of information from working memory to long-term memory, and to improve your ability to recall that information.</li><li>Your brain processes visual and linguistic information using two different subsystems. You don’t need to know where those two subsystems live in your brain; you merely need to understand that presenting complementary visual and linguistic information together (e.g. pictures accompanied by words) strengthens recall of that information.</li><li>And of course, once you begin to learn these ideas, you’ll quickly realise that you should focus on cognitive <em>systems</em>, not neurological facts; this should lead you to the <a href="https://www.learningscientists.org/downloadable-materials">Six Strategies of Effective Learning</a> (<a href="https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:individual-strategies">longer explanation</a>) and also to things like the <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-human-learning-and-memory-retention/#-recall-short-term-memory-overload">7±2 rule</a>.</li></ul><p>This seems like a specific principle: if you’re a practitioner looking for better cognitive techniques, do not reach for neuroscience to explain what might be adequately handled by psychology, or cognitive science.</p><p>In other words, look for things at the right level of abstraction.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-url="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/okrs-vs-kpis-explanation-with-examples-for-engineering-teams" data-title="OKRs vs. KPIs: explanation with examples for Engineering Teams.">
<p><em>OKRs vs. KPIs, what are the differences?</em> That’s a common question I hear from managers of Engineering Teams. KPIs are more straightforward to explain than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR">OKRs</a>, which can be tricky and more complex. They don’t mean the same, although they are connected.</p>



<h2>What are KPIs?</h2>



<p><strong>KPI stands for Key Performance Indicators.</strong> In other words, KPIs are a set of metrics that should give you an overview of the area or team’s performance. They need to be measurable and comparable.</p>



<p>If you look at many KPIs, they’re not fulfilling their purpose. Organizations should select as few as possible so that tracking the progress is possible. Besides, all the significant changes in process and company goals should impact the numbers.</p>



<p>Then, managing an area or a team becomes more tangible: when the KPIs show poor performance, it’s time to act. The actions taken should reflect better numbers; otherwise, managers need to find another strategy and act differently.</p>



<h2>What are OKRs?</h2>



<p><strong>OKRs stands for Objective Key Results</strong>. It’s a managing methodology that is popular in Silicon Valey. It’s been widely adopted by companies and startups at scale. It’s also seen as an alternative or complement for strategic planning.</p>



<p>OKRs’ primary purpose is to define Objectives that must align with the business and a set of Key Results. Each Key Result needs to have a measurable number as the goal and a limit date. The limit date means that the goal should be achieved within that time frame.</p>



<h2>What’s the difference between KPIs and OKRs?</h2>



<p><strong>KPIs provide an overview of the area or team for managers, whereas OKRs must focus on its future.</strong> That said, it becomes clear that KPIs are a controlling tool, and OKRs intend to change an organization’s status quo and keep track of its progress by periodic assessment meetings.</p>



<p>It’s crucial to have that in mind when choosing the KPIs and the OKRs. Otherwise, they become useless and can even play against business goals. Let’s see some examples of them</p>



<h2>Examples of OKRs and KPIs for Engineering Teams</h2>



<p>Below there is a list of KPIs examples. However, you can find more examples in my article&nbsp;<a href="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/software-engineering-kpis-how-to-choose-the-best-fitting-metrics">Software Engineering KPIs: how to choose the best fitting metrics</a>.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Deploy Frequency</strong>: it’s a sum of the <a href="https://thenewstack.io/measuring-engineering-velocity-deploy-frequency-as-a-vital-sign-of-devops-health/">number of deploys made by day</a>, week, or month, depending on the organization’s need.&nbsp;<em>It shows how frequently the team — or area — delivers value to the final user</em>.</li><li><strong>Time to Merge</strong>: it measures the number of days a Pull Request remains open or under review. You can find an average or, as I prefer, see the 75th percentile of all pull requests closed in a given period.&nbsp;<em>It shows how performant is the team</em>.</li><li><strong>Time to Recover</strong>: how much time does the application is inaccessible after an error?&nbsp;<em>This metric tells a lot about how engineering teams respond to failures.</em></li></ul>



<p>When thinking of OKRs, Engineering Teams may consider Objectives such as:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Improving the Time to Market of new features</strong></li><li><strong>Lessen the Churn rate of the product</strong></li></ul>



<p>Here are some possible Key Results for&nbsp;<strong>Improving the Time to Market of new features</strong>:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Increase the Deploy Frequency to 37/week until &lt;insert the date&gt;</strong>. Assuming you deploy less than 37 times a week currently, increasing the frequency means you’re delivering more. Delivering more is crucial to achieving a more competitive Time to Market.</li><li><strong>Reduce the 75th percentile of Time to Merge to 3 days until &lt;insert the date&gt;</strong>. Instead of the Median or Average, I prefer using the 75th percentile for Key Results. In other words, it means that 75% of the Pull Requests must be merged up to 3 days after they were opened. The team can achieve it by opening lighter pull requests or engaging in collaborators’ pull requests instead of working on a new work item.</li></ul>



<p>For the second object,&nbsp;<strong>Lessen the Churn rate of the product</strong>, let’s assume you know the primary source of churn comes due to a high number of errors in the application. Then, the Key Results could include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Reduce the number of Technical Debts to 15 until &lt;insert the date&gt;</strong>. Let’s say you have 30 Technical Debts currently. It’s a 50% improvement. There are many chances that improving the codebase will positively affect the churn rate and help in the KR of the previous Objective. The cleaner the code, the better it embraces the changes. It means you can reduce the churn and also achieve better Time to Market by gardening your codebase.</li><li><strong>Reduce the Mean Time to Recover to Recover (MTTR) to 3 minutes until &lt;insert the date&gt;</strong>. The team needs to monitor application outages, connectivity problems, 503 errors, and other failures to ensure end-users’ experience is not impacted with more than 3 minutes of instability.</li></ul>



<h2>In short,</h2>



<p>KPIs and OKRs are not the same. They have different purposes. KPIs aim to give managers an overview of how the team or area is working, whereas OKRs focus on providing the team a direction and then tracking its progress.</p>



<p>I presented some examples of KPIs and OKRs for Engineering Teams to illustrate the difference. SourceLevel provides lots of metrics, which may include your KPIs.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<div>
  <main>
      <article>
  
  <div>
        <p>For the past few months I’ve been thinking about how to persuade some of the top philanthropists, investors and thinkers to work on an idea alongside me.</p><p>These ideas aren’t focused on problems that I’ve typically tried to tackle in the past. They’re focused on some of the most significant problems facing the world today: carbon removal, longevity, artificial intelligence, biotech, battery technology... to name a few.</p><h2 id="why-these-challenges">Why these challenges?</h2><p>Now in my early thirties, I want to focus on what I believe are some of the biggest challenges facing the world today. Using everything that I’ve learned over the past decade of launching startups, building machine learning algorithms, and connecting with people that are much smarter than me.</p><p>Seeing initiatives such as the <a href="https://earthshotprize.org/">Earthshot Prize</a>, <a href="https://schmidtfutures.com/">Schmidt Futures</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1284531841651752960?s=21">Chamath’s ‘climate action’ call</a>, I feel there’s never been a better time to focus on the biggest challenges we face as humanity.</p><p>Over the next few months I’ve set myself the challenge of scoping out a solution to these challenges that is worth exploring, then to partner with a domain expert, and start to raise funding.</p><p>So how should I go about building a compelling case?</p><h2 id="creating-good-ideas-clear-thinking-is-clear-writing">Creating good ideas: clear thinking is clear writing</h2><p>You might have seen my <a href="https://st.im/what-i-learned-reading-every-amazon-shareholder-letter/">recent post</a> on how I read every one of Amazon's shareholder letters.</p><p>I chose Amazon for a reason.</p><p>Founder &amp; CEO, Jeff Bezos, is an excellent storyteller. His writing is concise, articulate and authentic. It's rare to find someone who can convey their thinking, mission and vision as articulately as Bezos can. And he places a high level of importance on the skill at Amazon.</p><p>Bezos has been able to instil, defend and evolve his company's thinking and behaviour for two decades, ever since its founding. The only ideas that can survive for that long are the ones that are packaged memorably enough -- and memorably packaging ideas in just a few choice words has long been one of Bezos' strengths.</p><p>One of the most important takeaways I found whilst reading through his shareholder letters was Amazon's use of 'six-page narratives', alongside their 'no PowerPoint' rule.</p><blockquote><em>We don’t do PowerPoint (or any other slide-oriented) presentations at Amazon. Instead, we write narratively structured six-page memos. We silently read one at the beginning of each meeting in a kind of “study hall.” Not surprisingly, the quality of these memos varies widely. Some have the clarity of angels singing. They are brilliant and thoughtful and set up the meeting for high-quality discussion. Sometimes they come in at the other end of the spectrum.</em></blockquote><p>Bezos goes onto explain what makes a good memo:</p><blockquote>Here’s what we’ve figured out. Often, when a memo isn’t great, it’s not the writer’s inability to recognize the high standard, but instead a wrong expectation on scope: they mistakenly believe a high-standards, six-page memo can be written in one or two days or even a few hours, when really it might take a week or more! They’re trying to perfect a handstand in just two weeks, and we’re not coaching them right. The great memos are written and re-written, shared with colleagues who are asked to improve the work, set aside for a couple of days, and then edited again with a fresh mind. They simply can’t be done in a day or two. The key point here is that you can improve results through the simple act of teaching scope – that a great memo probably should take a week or more.</blockquote><p>Writing these narratives, or stories, forces those at Amazon to think through their ideas in high-resolution detail. Instead of wasting time with impromptu brainstorming sessions, writing memos ensures that group discussion is based on the critical review of the relevant ideas, not on hypotheticals.</p><p>Most importantly, it makes it impossible to hide any logical inconsistencies in the ideas that people put out there. By imposing a rigorous, standardised template on the process of idea generation at Amazon, Jeff Bezos raises the bar and raises the quality of his team's thinking.</p><h2 id="stories-have-long-been-fundamental-to-the-human-experience">Stories have long been fundamental to the human experience</h2><p>Stories are vivid, coherent and memorable – and are crucial to how we interact with the world. Although the term ‘story’ conjures images of fairy tales and myths, there is little that occurs in our lives around which we do not attempt to weave a narrative. Stories cater to our need for sense-making and our desire to observe causality. In one form or another, they underpin most human decisions.</p><p>One particular model of decision-making – explanation-based theory – emphasises that in certain conditions, individuals start their decision process by developing a causal model to explain the available evidence. To rationalise it, in other words, and put otherwise potentially abstract data into context. In this model, the story that has been created informs the ultimate decision as much as the standalone evidence.</p><p>Trial jurors are more likely to be persuaded by evidence if it is presented in the order of a logical story than if the same evidence is shown in random order. What’s more, the story each individual develops around the evidence will be unique and dependent on their own characteristics, beliefs and experience.</p><p>The juror example is useful when considering the role of narratives in investment decision making. Explanation-based theory is particularly applicable when decisions are large and complex, as investment decisions often tend to be. In fact, investment decision-making is a domain in which stories assume a particular importance in driving, informing and justifying conclusions.</p><p>There are two key reasons for this:</p><p>Complexity: narratives aid our comprehension There is intricacy and complication even in the simplest of investments, and if we start to consider the innovation and product proliferation that have come to define the industry, many investments can be fairly considered unfathomable. Stories are important in allowing investors to both simplify and justify decisions. </p><p>Uncertainty: startups, by definition, are risky. There are many things founders simply can’t plan for. Our surest means of coping with the discomfort is to manufacture meaning by forging a relationship between the data and an explanation – a story, in other words – of why the data is what it is and how it got that way.</p><p>Most investors won’t make a decision without it being supported by some form of story, and that’s understandable; stories are effective and can be very valuable. Now with the pandemic meaning in-person meetings are on hold, crafting a narrative -- with clear supporting evidence -- seems to be the best way for me to forge a connection with any potential investor.</p><p>Using Amazon’s narrative format, I'm sharing some ‘six-pagers’ that will hopefully start to lay the foundations for the next chapter of my life.</p><p>If you’ve read this blog before, you’ll know I'm a fan of networked thought, using <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> on a daily basis.</p><p>They've just rolled out a new feature, Obsidian Publish; which, in essence, is a public notebook. I thought it would probably make most sense to share my own <a href="http://publish.obsidian.md/stim">six-page narratives</a> on there.</p><p>I'm still working on them as we speak, so you're getting a pretty raw insight into my thinking, as well as how I formulate or tackle problems.</p><p>I hope you’ll follow me as I start out on this new journey.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1603826118326/xmu8PEoSf.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div><div><div><p>Subscribe to <!-- -->my<!-- --> newsletter and never miss <!-- -->my<!-- --> upcoming articles</p></div></div></div><div itemprop="text"><p>I just recently started my graduate role 🥳 at  <a target="_blank" href="https://ampersandcommerce.com/">Ampersand UK</a> and it's been amazing, (PS. That is why I have been MIA from blogging) however, prior to that I was involved in a few extracurricular activities before starting my job. Today I want to talk about a few facts I appreciate knowing before starting my tech career. </p>
<blockquote>
<p> <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/ox8sJtZb5lw">Listen to me</a>  read the post to you</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Fact number 1</strong>, there is a tech community, that is generous, willing and happy to help, or share their ideas and expertise in a wide variety of non-technical and technical topics. If you are like me and have been under a rock, doing things by yourself and not quite finding a community to encourage you in your journey. This would be particularly relieving to know, because, I don't know what it is about seeing people in positions I aspire to be? But for me, it gives me a sense of hope that I can achieve what I set out to do. It's great to know that I am not in this alone! In irony, I was never 😃, I just decided to stick my head out a little and it's paid off tremendously. </p>

<p><strong>Fact number 2</strong>, Mentors are important! For the most part of my journey, I have had what I would refer to as <em>online mentors</em>. People who I haven't met, but I have spent time with their work. Engaging with it and taking away little gems that have helped me one way or the other. But do you know what would have even been more helpful? Having a physical mentor, that I could have both formal and informal conversations with. Someone who is a friend and mentor, who has way more life and work experience than I have. I really do believe having this sort of relationship in your life is mutually beneficial to both mentor and mentee. If you have one atm you are very lucky!</p>

<p><strong>Okay fact number 3</strong> I did mention at the start that I was involved in some extracurricular activities before I started my job. These included</p>
<ul>
<li>Volunteering to teach kids how to code</li>
<li>Contributing to open source projects </li>
<li>Starting a  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mycodinghabits/">technical page</a>  on Instagram </li>
<li>Mentoring and</li>
<li>Technical writing as seen on this blog etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>I actually enjoyed doing all of these extracurricular activities, because It was fulfilling. I was spreading knowledge that was extremely helpful to people that needed the help, support, general information or source of inspiration. It felt purposeful, knowing I was serving others in a way that added value.</p>

<p><strong>Fact number 4</strong> is a bit of a debatable fact! Some say to prove yourself in the workplace you have to go <em> <strong>'Above and beyond'</strong></em>  to impress both your colleagues and employer. Others say it's a <strong><em>9-5 no more no less</em></strong>, I am sure you have also heard <strong><em>work smart not hard</em></strong>, and the debate goes on. I was still on the fence on this one until I read an article by <a href="https://hashnode.com/@victoria">Victoria Lo</a> on <a target="_blank" href="https://lo-victoria.com/become-a-better-developer-with-self-care">self-care tips</a>  for developers. And I had an <em>Aha moment</em> 🤓, it made sense. The keyword with the whole idea of work-life balance is the word <strong><em>BALANCE</em></strong>. I believe there are grey areas with this concept and it can't be a sharp contrast between managing both your life and work because sometimes one might require more attention than the other. And as professionals we have to adhere to the different demands accordingly, but in this case do it acknowledging the human also needs to be taken care of in order to perform at their most optimal level.</p>

<p><strong> Finally the money fact </strong> I bet a good number of us did not negotiate the salary offer for your first job? 🙋🏾‍♀️ I didn't as well, not necessarily a bad thing, I bet given better knowledge, circumstance, experience or understanding you could have. But what's great about this fact is I can start doing specific things that would help my chances of getting a raise on the job or better feedback. Someone once said if you don't document it, it never happened, and if it never happened there would not be any strong basis for negotiation or solid feedback that is essential for my growth. So a few things I now know to implement towards this fact is</p>
<ul>
<li>To document my progress on the job and how my work might be improving the business or even helping my team in general.</li>
<li>By doing this, scheduled 1:1s with my team lead would be more practical and intentional. This way, asking for feedback or opportunity for growth would be easier.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the reasons I love where I work is that, this practice of documenting and organizing 1:1s is done using a platform called  <a target="_blank" href="https://lattice.com/">Lattice</a>. With a tool like this, there is a lot of transparency, and its good practice not only for negotiating your salary, but for adding to your career growth, and also appreciating other peoples work in and outside your team.</p>
<p>Is there any other <strong>fact/advise you would like to share with me?</strong> Please write them in the comment section. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong> Engage with my post </strong> ==&gt; I promise you it cost nothing</li>
<li><strong> Comment below your thoughts </strong> ==&gt; I would really like to hear them</li>
<li><strong> Share with others </strong> ==&gt; lol don't be stingy!</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you!</p>

          <div data-article-id="38" id="article-body">
            <p>Software is eating the world, and community is eating software</p>

<p>In no particular order, a few predictions for community in the 2020s.</p>

<p>💪 <strong>Community will continue to be a broad term</strong>, but finally people and companies will fully grasp that an audience does not mean the same thing as a community.</p>

<p>🪑 <strong>Community will finally get a seat at the table</strong>, following in the footsteps of customer success from a decade ago. Community will become its own department within orgs, leading to more Heads of Community, Chief Community Officers, and other community leadership roles.</p>

<p>✨ <strong>Continued specialization of roles in community.</strong> Community Manager will turn into Community Engagement, Community Marketing, Community Support, Community Success, etc.</p>

<p>🙋 <strong>And then we’ll see other roles start to merge under community.</strong> Community, customer support, and customer success will overlap and start to blend together. Traditional CS roles will still exist, but more ‘low-level’ support will be offloaded to communities and community teams.</p>

<p>📈 <strong>More and more companies will invest in community early</strong>, hiring their first community roles in their first 10 or 20 employees. Community will be standard for startups started in the 2020s.</p>

<p>💼 <strong>The unbundling of LinkedIn.</strong> What Dribbble is to designers, we’ll see for nurses, marketers, community managers, and every other career vertical, providing community, ‘portfolios’, and better job hunting experiences tailored to the specific type.</p>

<p>🎁 <strong>The unbundling of Reddit.</strong> Every subreddit will get its own dedicated community app, built specifically to serve the unique needs of that vertical. Vertical specificity will win out over general community platforms.</p>

<p>🚗 <strong>Community-driven versions of existing products</strong> and services will continue to be built, eventually taking over those who built without community. See Public vs Robinhood.</p>

<p>📣 <strong>Interactive audio and audio communities</strong> will continue to grow. Spotify will enter the market with their own offering, or acquire an existing player similarly to when they initially entered podcasting.</p>

<p>🕺 <strong>We’ll see innovation in the community platform space.</strong> Everything right now looks like some form of forum or ‘Slack for community’. We’ll see platforms that rethink the idea of community from the ground up, in less structured ways than ‘forums’.</p>

<p>🌍 The explosion of remote work will continue to drive <strong>a greater need for community at every level, online and offline</strong>, locally and globally. Expect more companies to build verticals in Nextdoor’s space.</p>

<p>🤑 <strong>Companies will continue to acquire communities</strong> as starting points for their own. See Outreach + Saleshacker, Stripe + Indiehackers, and DigitalOcean + Scotch.</p>

<p>💡 <strong>More and more companies will build communities of interest</strong>, rather than just customer &amp; support communities. This will enable their communities to reach a wider audience, and ultimately be seen as revenue generators rather than cost centers.</p>

<p>💬 <strong>A number of independent communities will turn into full-fledged businesses</strong> and media ‘empires’ as they grow beyond the community they started with.</p>

<p>🛠 <strong>Consolidation of tools.</strong> We’re currently in a golden age of community, engagement and event tools, but over the next decade we’ll see major players start to lead, acquire competitors, and ultimately ‘win’. We’ll also see existing companies (Salesforce, Slack, etc) invest more in community by acquiring companies that are being built right now.</p>

<p>🙊 <strong>Increased innovation will occur in the moderation space.</strong> As community gets elevated in organizations, companies will finally want to invest in tools to help make moderation easier and less dependent on pure manpower.</p>

<p>🏢 <strong>Companies will treat their internal teams more like communities</strong>, and there will be an expansion of internal community teams, especially at cos with 1,000+ employees. Remote-first companies will set this trend, needing to be more intentional about fostering internal community.</p>

<p>👋 <strong>Continued normalization of internet friends</strong>, people that you met in online communities rather than in-person. This has been normal for a decade or more in the gaming world, but it will bleed over to professional friends and relationships.</p>

<p>🏃‍♀️ <strong>In-person events will come back quickly post-Covid</strong>, but they will be smaller and more intimate, focusing on genuine connection. It will be a while before we see large 500+ person events and conferences again.</p>

<p>📆 <strong>Companies will continue to invest in online events</strong> and engagement as they realize how much larger of a reach they can achieve for lower cost and overhead. In-person conferences will adopt hybrid models, offering virtual access in addition to their physical locations.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-4802" role="main"><div><div><div><p>The Dutch company <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.pal-v.com/en/" target="_blank">PAL-V</a> today announced that its Liberty flying car <a href="https://www.pal-v.com/en/press/worlds-first-flying-car-hits-the-road" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has received permission</a> from the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.rdw.nl/over-rdw/information-in-english" target="_blank">Netherlands Vehicle Authority</a>&nbsp;to drive on public roads.<span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-3"></span></p><p>The PAL-V Liberty, the flying car’s full name, is a gyro-copter.&nbsp;The rotor can be folded so that the vehicle can also drive on the road like a regular car.&nbsp;</p><p>It needs a runway of between 180 – 330 meters for takeoff, but only 30 meters for landings.&nbsp;Both in the air and on the road, its maximum speed is 180 km/hour (112 mph). Converting from road to air mode (or vice versa) takes between five and ten minutes.</p><p>The Liberty runs on normal gasoline, and has a range of 1315 km (817 miles) on the road. In the air, it can fly 400 – 500 km (250 – 310 milles), and can remain airborne for 4.3 hours.</p><p>The PAL-V Liberty weighs 664 kg (1464 lbs) when empty. Its fuel tank holds 100 liters. The tank of a Honda Accord, just by way of comparison, holds about 53 liters.<span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p><h2>Already 30 orders for this Dutch flying car</h2><p>According to the company, about thirty Dutch residents have already ordered and paid for the Liberty. The list price is just under €500,000 ($587,000).</p><p>At the moment, the granted permission is only for a single vehicle. That means PAL-V cannot yet put their car into full production.&nbsp;The Netherlands Vehicle Authority first needs to ensure that the company can produce every vehicle according to the same quality standards.</p><p>PAL-V has been working on the Liberty since 2007. The European Aviation Safety Agency is still examining the company’s request to have the vehicles certified to fly. The company expects this permission to arrive in 2022.</p><p>The US state of New Hampshire <a href="https://www.timesnownews.com/auto/features/article/this-is-the-first-state-in-us-to-allow-flying-cars-on-public-roads/634621" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made it legal to drive flying cars on public roads</a> in August of this year.<span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-box-4"></span></p><p>See a video of the PAL-V Liberty driving <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://youtu.be/yIjSaEeO2l0" target="_blank">here</a>, and flying (briefly) <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://youtu.be/fFW_0C7yFCI" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Flying-Car-PAL-V-Liberty-1024x512.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Flying-Car-PAL-V-Liberty-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Flying-Car-PAL-V-Liberty-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Flying-Car-PAL-V-Liberty-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Flying-Car-PAL-V-Liberty-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Flying-Car-PAL-V-Liberty-360x180.jpg 360w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Flying-Car-PAL-V-Liberty-1320x660.jpg 1320w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Flying-Car-PAL-V-Liberty.jpg 1560w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="537" src="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-flying-car-1024x537.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-flying-car-1024x537.jpg 1024w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-flying-car-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-flying-car-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-flying-car-360x189.jpg 360w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-flying-car-1320x693.jpg 1320w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-flying-car.jpg 1408w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-fying-car-interior-1-1024x538.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-fying-car-interior-1-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-fying-car-interior-1-300x158.jpg 300w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-fying-car-interior-1-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-fying-car-interior-1-360x189.jpg 360w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-fying-car-interior-1.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>For a weekly summary of the latest psychology news, subscribe to our <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/the-psych-news-weekly-newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Psych News Weekly newsletter</a>.</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Global warming is quite possibly the greatest challenge we have ever faced.</p><p>A solution involves not only understanding most branches of science, but economics, politics and, more generally, human behaviour. </p><p>To date, even with our advanced technologies, planet earth's climate seems to remain beyond our control.</p><p><a href="https://st.im/six-page-narratives-tackling-worlds-biggest-challenges/">Last week I wrote</a> about the fact that I’ve started to spend a lot of time thinking about some of the biggest challenges we face as humanity. My goal being to narrow these challenges and dedicate the next decade of my life toward realising some of the potential solutions. </p><p>To help me kickstart, I’m publicly writing a series of Amazon-style <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/stim/Public+Obsidian/Six-pagers">six-page memos</a> that I will send to investors, philanthropists and potential co-founders with the ultimate goal of seeing if they’d like to partner, and tackle one of these challenges alongside me.</p><p>So how do I go about it? It won’t be easy, especially in fields where I have limited ‘applied’ or academic experience. I’m using these memos as a stepping stone toward real world experiments, hopefully validating some of my hypotheses.</p><p>Today, there’s an abundance of free information. What remains scarce is insight. Choose any non-trivial topic X, and a cursory Google search will give you evidence for both X and NOT (X). </p><p>So how do you find out what’s really true in the world of climate change? </p><p>That’s where <a href="https://fs.blog/2018/04/first-principles/">thinking from first principles</a> comes in. The basic idea behind this is to break down complicated problems into basic elements and then reassemble them from the ground up. I’ve found it to be one of the best ways to learn to think for myself, unlock creative potential, and move from linear to non-linear results.</p><p>Over the years there’s been so much fake news from vested interests, and well-meaning but conflicting reports about climate change. Couple this with the fact that attempting to solve it is hugely complex, with many interdependencies. Crafting a meaningful solution will mean not only exploring and understanding most branches of science, but economics, politics and, more generally, human behaviour. </p><p>By breaking each of these down to their basic elements it should help me understand them more thoroughly. Allowing me to build my own ground truths, and focus on the right stuff.</p><p>Why have I <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/stim/Public+Obsidian/Climate+Change">started</a> with climate change? </p><p>Simple: time, and the lack of it. </p><p>Scientists are telling us that on current trends by the middle of this century, vast swathes of the world will be experiencing uninhabitable temperatures for weeks on end. In essence, making them no-go zones. &nbsp;This means the next decade is make or break. </p><p>Thankfully, climate change is starting to gain some real attention. </p><p>People are increasingly paying attention to the fact that:</p><ol><li>We’re experiencing unprecedented lethal <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/heatwaves#tab=tab_1">heat waves</a>. It’s simply getting too hot and too humid for humans to be able to survive in many places.</li><li>Our largest physical structures; ice caps, coral reefs, and rainforests are disappearing before our eyes. Sea levels are rising, literally making the habitable world smaller.</li><li>There will be an <a href="https://www.climateforesight.eu/migrations-inequalities/environmental-migrants-up-to-1-billion-by-2050/">estimated 200 million - 1 billion</a> climate refugees in this century alone. This number of people on the move will be hugely destabilising.</li><li>When you factor in the cost of the environmental damage caused by our continued use of fossil fuels, &nbsp;it makes no economic sense to generate power in the way we have historically. The price of a solar panel, for example, has fallen 90 percent.</li></ol><p>The climate sector has also grown dramatically over the last few years. </p><p><a href="https://lowercarboncapital.com/">LowerCarbon Capital</a>, <a href="https://www.primeimpactfund.com/">Prime Impact</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.palebluedotventures.com/">PaleBlueDot</a> all launched. And several corporates have also announced their corporate venture funds tackling decarbonisation. Many more made net zero commitments.</p><p>Initiatives such as the <a href="https://earthshotprize.org/">Earthshot Prize</a> are attracting some of the world’s smartest thinkers. Chamath Palihapitiya also <a href="https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1284531841651752960?s=21">announced</a> the allocation of a “few billion” to solve the problem. He <a href="https://fs.blog/knowledge-project/chamath-palihapitiya/">said recently</a> that he believes the world’s first trillionaire will be someone involved in developing technologies to combat climate change.</p><p>When it comes to philanthropy, there is no one better versed than Bill Gates in understanding how to prioritise dollar impact to maximise lives improved or saved. He’s <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/How-to-Avoid-a-Climate-Disaster">just announced</a> a new book ‘<em>How to Avoid a Climate Disaster: The Solutions We Have and the Breakthroughs We Need’</em>. </p><p>So the foundation of a meaningful climate change ecosystem is already here.</p><p>This enables the “crazy ones”, or “the ones who see things different” to innovate, to think outside of the box, and to find the support and freedom to dedicate themselves to discovering solutions. </p><p>There’s going to be quite a few footnotes in this post. A lot of people who are much smarter than me have spent a lot of time figuring stuff out. I’m hoping that I’ll be able to stand on the shoulders of these giants. With a set of fresh eyes, and the ignorance that only someone new to the space can have. </p><p>Let’s see if I can connect some dots, and pull together a plan. </p><p>In the remainder of this post, I’m going to cover the basics of climate change, as well as how I’m thinking of approaching it — with scenario planning and probabilistic forecasting. Finally we’ll look at the most promising areas of research in 2020. </p><p>If you're interested, I'd recommend bookmarking the <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/stim/Public+Obsidian/Climate+Change">climate change six-pager</a> —over the next couple of weeks I'll be working on it. With the goal of sending it as soon as possible. </p><h2 id="what-factors-determine-earth-s-climate">What factors determine Earth’s climate?</h2><p>The Royal Society has done a <a href="https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/climate-change-evidence-causes/basics-of-climate-change/">great job</a> of introducing the topic, and much of what is written below is learned from their resources.</p><p>The Sun is the primary energy source for Earth’s climate. </p><p>Some of this sunlight is reflected back into space, predominantly by bright surfaces (e.g. ice and clouds) the rest is absorbed by the surface and the atmosphere. </p><p>Much of this absorbed solar energy is re-emitted as heat. The atmosphere in turn absorbs and re-radiates heat, some of which escapes to space. Any disturbance to this balance of incoming and outgoing energy affects the climate. Small changes in the output of energy from the Sun will change this balance.</p><p>If all the heat energy emitted from the surface passed through the atmosphere directly into space, Earth’s average surface temperature would be significantly colder than today. </p><p>Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, including water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, act to make the surface much warmer than this because they absorb and emit heat energy in all directions, keeping Earth’s surface and lower atmosphere warm. </p><p>Without this greenhouse effect, life as we know it could not have evolved on our planet. Adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere makes it even more effective at preventing heat from escaping into space. When the energy leaving is less than the energy entering, Earth warms until a new balance is established.</p><p>Greenhouse gases emitted by human activities alter Earth’s energy balance and thus its climate. We affect climate by changing the nature of the land surfaces; for example, by clearing forests for farming. The emission of pollutants also affect the amount and type of particles in the atmosphere.</p><p>Scientists have determined that, when all human and natural factors are considered, Earth’s climate balance has been altered towards warming, with the biggest contributor being increases in CO2.</p><h2 id="human-activities-have-added-greenhouse-gases-to-the-atmosphere">Human activities have added greenhouse gases to the atmosphere</h2><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide have increased significantly since the Industrial Revolution began. </p><p>In the case of carbon dioxide, the average concentration measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii has risen from 316 parts per million (ppm) in 1959 (the first full year of data available) to more than 411 ppm in 2019. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The same rates of increase have since been recorded at numerous other stations worldwide. Since preindustrial times, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 has increased by over 40%, methane has increased by more than 150%, and nitrous oxide has increased by roughly 20%.</p><p>More than half of the increase in CO2 has occurred since 1970. Increases in all three gases contribute to warming of Earth, with the increase in CO2 playing the largest role. </p><p>Scientists have examined greenhouse gases from the past — by examining air trapped inside ice in Antarctica, we now know that the CO2 concentration began to increase significantly in the 19th century. This is after it had stayed in the range of 260 - 280 ppm for the previous 10,000 years. Ice core records extending back 800,000 years show that during that time, CO2 concentrations remained within the range of 170 to 300 ppm throughout many “ice age” cycles - and no concentration above 300 ppm is seen in ice core records until the past 200 years.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>This should already be setting off alarm bells. The change in the last 200 years compared to the past 800,000 years. And the impact from humans. Crazy. </p><p>Measurements of the forms of carbon in the modern atmosphere show a clear fingerprint of the addition of “old” carbon coming from the combustion of fossil fuels, as opposed to “newer” carbon coming from living systems. </p><p>Furthermore, it is known that human activities, excluding land use change, currently emit an estimated 10 billion tonnes of carbon each year, mostly by burning fossil fuels, which is more than enough to explain the observed increase in concentration. </p><p><strong>These and other lines of evidence point conclusively to the fact that the elevated CO2 concentration in our atmosphere is the result of human activities.</strong></p><h2 id="climate-records-show-a-warming-trend">Climate records show a warming trend</h2><p>Estimating global average surface air temperature increase requires careful analysis of millions of measurements from around the world, including from land stations, ships, and satellites. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Despite the difficulty in collating the data, quite a few independent teams concluded separately (and unanimously) that global average surface air temperature has risen by about 1 degree celsius since 1900. </p><p>Although the record shows several pauses and …</p></div></div>

            <p>How to create a calendar template in LibreOffice Calc that can be updated dynamically with any year or month. The tutorial includes a calendar template(.ods).</p>
<p>In this post I will show you how to make an editable calendar template for LibreOffice Calc in which you can simply change the month or the year and the entire calendar gets updated.<span id="more-4"></span></p>
<p>To those who are only looking for a <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a> calendar template that they wish to print, simply download one of the .ods files below:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/LibreOffice-calendar-template-US-letter.ods">LibreOffice Calendar Template US Letter</a></li>
<li><a href="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/LibreOffice-calendar-template-A4.ods">LibreOffice Calendar Template A4</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For more styles and designs check out these <a href="https://calendaroptions.com/">printable calendars (PDF)</a>.</p>
<p>Before we begin, allow me to show you the end result:</p>
<p><a title="Calendar template US letter" href="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/calendar-template.png"><img src="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/calendar-template.png" alt="Calendar template US letter"></a></p>
<p>Let’s start by making a new spreadsheet. From the menu select <strong>File</strong> -&gt; <strong>New</strong> -&gt; <strong>Spreadsheet</strong>.</p>
<p>Because we intend to make this template be printable we have to setup the printable area. In the menu go to <strong>Format</strong> -&gt; <strong>Page…</strong></p>
<p>In the “Page” tab choose the format of the paper. I went for US Letter, but you can choose another one, A4, for example, depending on which format is the most popular where you live. Next, select “Landscape” for orientation.</p>
<p>A little bit lower, you can set the margins. You can leave the default values but I opted for some more rounded values. See the following image:</p>
<p><a title="LibreOffice page settings" href="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/LibreOffice-page-settings.png"><img src="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/LibreOffice-page-settings.png" alt="LibreOffice page settings"></a></p>
<p>Once you click OK you should see some dashed lines in your spreadsheet. Those define the print area. We’ll come back to this later when we need to style the calendar.</p>
<p>Now let’s rename the existing sheet in our spreadsheet to “Month Calendar”. You can do that by double clicking on the tab “Sheet1”. Additionally, create a new sheet called “Settings”, similarly to what you see in the image below.</p>
<p><a title="Rename new sheet in LibreOffice Calc" href="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/LibreOffice-rename-new-sheet.png"><img src="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/LibreOffice-rename-new-sheet.png" alt="Rename new sheet in LibreOffice Calc"></a></p>
<p>Considering this is a dynamic template, and to avoid typos, we should define the month names. LibreOffice doesn’t have a list of month names, so we’ll need to make our own. This also means you can have the month names in another language. I’ll use English, but you can experiment with something else.</p>
<p>If you’re not in the “Settings” sheet, switch to it. In the first column start writing the month names, one below the other.</p>
<p><a title="Sheet with month names" href="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/month-names-sheet.png"><img src="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/month-names-sheet.png" alt="Sheet with month names"></a></p>
<p>Next, we’ll use this list as a drop-down. For this, select the first cell(A1) in the “Month Calendar” sheet. Then from the menu choose <strong>Data</strong> -&gt; <strong>Validity…</strong></p>
<p>In the “Validity” panel, under the “Criteria” tab, select “Cell Range” from the options for the “Allow” section. Then in the “Source” field we are going to define the range. This will be <code><strong>$Settings.$A$1:$A$12</strong></code>. Simple translation: get the cell range starting from A1 to A12 in the “Settings” sheet.</p>
<p><a title="Validity cell range in LibreOffice Calc" href="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/LibreOffice-validity-cell-range.png"><img src="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/LibreOffice-validity-cell-range.png" alt="Validity cell range in LibreOffice Calc"></a></p>
<p>After clicking OK you should see a button with an arrow pointing down next to the first cell. Clicking on that button should reveal the drop-down list with all the months, like in the image below.</p>
<p><a title="LibreOffice drop-down list" href="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/LibreOffice-drop-down-list.png"><img src="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/LibreOffice-drop-down-list.png" alt="LibreOffice drop-down list" loading="lazy"></a></p>
<p>Although it complicates things, we’ll have to start styling things. First, the month has to be larger. Choose a font you like and a size. I went with the default font, size 40. I also merged the top 3 cells to give the month more space.</p>
<p><a title="Merge cells in LibreOffice" href="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/LibreOffice-merge-cells.png"><img src="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/LibreOffice-merge-cells.png" alt="Merge cells in LibreOffice" loading="lazy"></a></p>
<p>Now, it’s time for a bit of math. We need to calculate the width of a day, in our case, the width of a column. So given that there are 7 days in a week we’ll use 7 columns for our calendar. This means we’ll have to divide the width of our page to 7. Let’s have a look back at our page settings. From the menu choose <strong>Format</strong> -&gt; <strong>Page…</strong></p>
<p><a title="LibreOffice page settings" href="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/LibreOffice-page-settings.png"><img src="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/LibreOffice-page-settings.png" alt="LibreOffice page settings" loading="lazy"></a></p>
<p>Open your calculator application. For me it’s <code><strong>(11-2*0.75)/7=1.3571</strong></code>. Note: only use the first 2 decimals, LibreOffice will round the number anyway.</p>
<p>In order to resize the columns select the first 7, and right click on the header choosing “Column Width…”. Put in the result you have from the earlier calculation (for me it was 1.35″) and hit OK.</p>
<p>Ideally, after this you should see the dashed line (print are side) after column G. To check how the document looks to the printer, you can preview it by choosing <strong>File</strong> -&gt; <strong>Print Preview</strong> from the menu.</p>
<p>Tip: click on the “Margins” item in the toolbar to see the margins of the page.</p>
<p><a title="Print preview LibreOffice" href="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/LibreOffice-print-preview.png"><img src="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/LibreOffice-print-preview.png" alt="Print preview LibreOffice" loading="lazy"></a></p>
<p>You might notice there is some text at the top and bottom of the page. The header and footer of the document. To remove them first exit the “Print Preview” window by pressing the Escape key or click on “Close Preview” in the toolbar. Once you are back in the spreadsheet window, go to <strong>Format</strong> -&gt; <strong>Page</strong> and then in the “Header” tab uncheck “Header on”. Do the same for the Footer.</p>
<p><a title="Hide the header in LibreOffice" href="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/LibreOffice-disable-header.png"><img src="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/LibreOffice-disable-header.png" alt="Hide the header in LibreOffice" loading="lazy"></a></p>
<p>According to the design of the calendar, the year is placed on the right side, at the top. So in the G1 cell write the year you want, or if you want to have the current year dynamically use this formula instead: <code><strong>=YEAR(TODAY())</strong></code>. Don’t forget to use the same font and size for the year as you did for the month.</p>
<p><a title="Current year formula in LibreOffice" href="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/LibreOffice-current-year-formula.png"><img src="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/LibreOffice-current-year-formula.png" alt="Current year formula in LibreOffice" loading="lazy"></a></p>
<p>We continue by writing the days of the week in the row below the month and year. In my case, the week starts on Sunday. For an example with the week starting on Monday have a look at the A4 calendar template.</p>
<p><a title="Days of the week" href="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/days-of-the-week.png"><img src="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/days-of-the-week.png" alt="Days of the week" loading="lazy"></a></p>
<p>Now that we have the top part ready, let’s get on with the rest. For that, we need to know what is the first date in our calendar. It’s not the 1st of the current month, most of the time, but one of the last days in the previous month. Once we establish that date, we simply add 1(day) to that value until we have six rows. I’ll explain why 6 rows, a bit later.</p>
<p>Let’s get back to how we’re going to get that first date. In the A3 cell we’ll start by getting the first day of the month. This is the formula I used <code><strong>=DATE(G1,MATCH(A1,$Settings.A1:A12,0),1)</strong></code>.</p>
<p>The <code><a href="https://help.libreoffice.org/7.0/en-US/text/scalc/01/func_date.html?DbPAR=CALC#bm_id3155511"><strong>DATE</strong></a></code> function has 3 parameters: year, month and day. The year we can get from G1. The month has to be a number, but all we have is January, February and so on which LibreOffice does not understand. The trick is to try and find the position of the word “January” in the month list in the “Settings” sheet. Luckily, there’s a function for that, <code><a href="https://help.libreoffice.org/7.0/en-US/text/scalc/01/04060109.html?DbPAR=CALC#bm_id3158407"><strong>MATCH</strong></a></code>, which needs the value you’re looking for(A1 in my case) and the cell range where to look for it(A1:A12 in Settings). The last parameter needs to be “0” in order to only match exact values, using “1” will give you strange results for certain months.</p>
<p><a title="First day of the month spreadsheet formula" href="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/first-day-of-the-month-formula.png"><img src="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/first-day-of-the-month-formula.png" alt="First day of the month spreadsheet formula" loading="lazy"></a></p>
<p>But putting the first day of the month in the first cell is not correct, as most months do not start on a Sunday. But it makes a good starting point.</p>
<p>By knowing the first day of the month we can get the day of the week. In my example it’s a Wednesday. The function that returns the day of week from a date is <code><a href="https://help.libreoffice.org/7.0/en-US/text/scalc/01/func_weekday.html?DbPAR=CALC#bm_id3154925"><strong>WEEKDAY</strong></a></code>. The formula is <code><strong>=WEEKDAY(DATE(G1,MATCH(A1,$Settings.A1:A12,0),1))</strong></code>. You should get a number from 1 to 7. If you don’t change the “Number Format” from “Date” to “General”.</p>
<p><a title="Day of the week spreadsheet formula" href="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/day-of-the-week-formula.png"><img src="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/day-of-the-week-formula.png" alt="Day of the week spreadsheet formula" loading="lazy"></a></p>
<p>But why do we need the weekday? The easiest way to explain it is by using a real example. In my case the first day of the month is a Wednesday. The week in my example starts on Sunday, making Wednesday the 4th day of the week. So if January 1st is a Wednesday(the 4th day), Sunday would be 3 days before(the 29th of December). Eventually, we just need to subtract 3 days from the date which is the 1st of the month. This way the formula becomes: <code><strong>=DATE(G1,MATCH(A1,$Settings.A1:A12,0),1) - (WEEKDAY(DATE(G1,MATCH(A1,$Settings.A1:A12,0),1)) - 1)</strong></code>. In practical numbers my example is 01/01 – (4 – 1).</p>
<p><a title="First day of the week spreadsheet formula" href="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/first-day-of-the-week-formula.png"><img src="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/first-day-of-the-week-formula.png" alt="First day of the week spreadsheet formula" loading="lazy"></a></p>
<p>Like mentioned earlier now we only need to add one to the previous row cell. So B3 becomes <code><strong>=A3+1</strong></code>, C3 becomes <code><strong>=B3+1</strong></code> and so on until the end of the week.</p>
<p><a title="First week" href="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/first-week.png"><img src="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/first-week.png" alt="First week" loading="lazy"></a></p>
<p>Next, we skip the 4th row. If you look at the final design, we’ll need the rows in between to leave as editable spaces. So the next cell will be A5 and we simply need to add 7 days to A3, resulting in <code><strong>=A3+7</strong></code>, <code><strong>=B3+7</strong></code> and so on until the end of the second week. Continuing with that logic, we skip the 6th, 8th, 10th and 12th rows. Also A7 will be <code><strong>=A5+7</strong></code>, B7 <code><strong>=B5+7</strong></code>… A13 <code><strong>=A11+7</strong></code>… you get it.</p>
<p>Tip: if you copy the 5th row and paste it onto the 7th row, LibreOffice will do all the work and you won’t have to type as much.</p>
<p><a title="Full month" href="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/full-month.png"><img src="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/full-month.png" alt="Full month" loading="lazy"></a></p>
<p>Things are starting to look better, but we don’t want the full date for each day. So select all the date cells and right-click on one of them. From the context menu(right-click menu) choose “<strong>Format Cells…</strong>”.</p>
<p><a title="Formatting cells in LibreOffice" href="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/LibreOffice-format-cells.png"><img src="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/LibreOffice-format-cells.png" alt="Formatting cells in LibreOffice" loading="lazy"></a></p>
<p>In the “Format Cells” panel, make sure the Date category is selected, it normally should be, automatically. Then in the “Format Code” text field replace the default code(MM/DD/YY) with the letter “D”(it stands for “day”). Click on the green check mark and then on OK.</p>
<p><a title="Add new format in LibreOffice" href="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/LibreOffice-add-format.png"><img src="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/LibreOffice-add-format.png" alt="Add new format in LibreOffice" loading="lazy"></a></p>
<p>The next step in styling requires a bit of basic math again. Just the way we had to make sure the 7 columns fit in the print area horizontally, we also need to space the rows to fit in the page vertically.</p>
<p>But before that let’s increase the font size of the days. I bumped it up to 12 and made it bold.</p>
<p>Back to the row height issue, let’s find out how tall is each row that’s not empty. To see the actual height of a row, right-click on the left header where the number is. From the context menu select “<code><strong>Row Height...</strong></code>”.</p>
<p><a title="Set row height LibreOffice" href="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/LibreOffice-row-height.png"><img src="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/LibreOffice-row-height.png" alt="Set row height LibreOffice" loading="lazy"></a></p>
<p>Get the height values of each row that’s not empty and add them up. For me it’s 2,28″. The page height is 8.5″. And the top and bottom margins are 0.75″ each, so 1.5″. So 8.5 – 1.5 – 2.28 = 4.72.</p>
<p>Why do we care about this number? If you take a look at the final calendar design, you’ll notice that each day number has a space below it where events can be added. So we need to calculate how tall those cells can be. We have 6 rows for the days which means we’ll have 6 rows for the events. Dividing 4.72 to 6 gives me 0.786. Given that LibreOffice only uses the first two decimals, I will settle for 0.78″ for the height of the event rows.</p>
<p><a title="Calendar without borders" href="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/calendar-no-borders.png"><img src="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/calendar-no-borders.png" alt="Calendar without borders" loading="lazy"></a></p>
<p>Things are looking much better, but we still need some borders. Select the cells like you see in the image below:</p>
<p><a title="Selected cells" href="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/selected-cells.png"><img src="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/selected-cells.png" alt="Selected cells" loading="lazy"></a></p>
<p>Then for applying a border to these cells, right-click the selection and choose “<strong>Format Cells…</strong>” from the context menu. A panel should open where the “Borders” tab is active. Pick the settings in the following screenshot:</p>
<p><a title="Setting borders in LibreOffice" href="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/LibreOffice-set-borders.png"><img src="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/LibreOffice-set-borders.png" alt="Setting borders in LibreOffice" loading="lazy"></a></p>
<p>The “Print Preview” result looks like this:</p>
<p><a title="Calendar Print Preview" href="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/calendar-print-preview.png"><img src="https://calendartricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/calendar-print-preview.png" alt="Calendar Print Preview" loading="lazy"></a></p>
<p>You can leave it like this if it’s good for you, but by setting the bottom border to “none” for the days and the same for the top border for events you get a more accurate …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>The other day I had a bit of a crisis, I was worried that I was starting to have trouble with my memory. Something had to be wrong! I started to notice (increasingly!) my inability to recall trivial things; for example, the action points from a Zoom call, or a quote from a book that I had read a couple of months ago. Surely this can’t be normal?</p><p>Before calling the doctor’s office I did what any decent hypochondriac would do, and started googling. After clicking through a few pages, I began to feel a bit better. It was normal. Short term (or working) memory <em>is</em> inefficient, and unless I revisit the thing I’m trying to remember a few times, I’m most likely going to forget it. And no, it’s not a side effect of turning thirty. Phew.</p><p>It’s a “feature, not a bug” of how our memory systems are designed. </p><p>Our memory is made up of not one, nor two, but three components: 1) a sensory register, 2) working memory, and 3) long-term memory.</p><p>When I look back at my childhood or I remember some basic words from French, I'm drawing on portions of my brain involved in long-term memory. But when I'm trying to hold a few ideas in mind to connect them together so I can understand a concept or solve a problem, I'm using my working memory.</p><p>With my health crisis averted, I got thinking about technology and its impact (positive and negative) on the way the brain, and memory, function. With all the knowledge I could ever need at my fingertips, alongside note taking apps and the smartphones that are now an extension of our physical being -- am I being lazy or efficient, or a mixture of the two? Much like our overactive fight-or-flight response, has evolution not had a chance to adapt or catch-up with the mind of today versus our ancestors’? </p><h3 id="four-chunks-of-information">Four chunks of information</h3><p>We ‘can’t remember’ things because there is a limit to what we can hold in our working memory. Researchers used to think that it could hold around seven items or chunks, but now it’s widely believed that the working memory only holds about four chunks of information.</p><p>If you’re anything like me you’ll have to repeat something to yourself until you have a chance to write it down. Repetitions are needed so that natural dissipating processes don’t suck the memories away. How many times have you found yourself shutting your eyes to keep other things from intruding into the limited slots of your working memory as you concentrate?</p><p>I believe that we need to offload from our working memory as soon as possible.</p><p>With the goal historically being, before computers, to move it to long-term memory. If this didn’t happen -- you’d essentially be waving goodbye to that memory. </p><p>Moving a memory from ‘working’ to ‘long-term’ takes time and practice. </p><p>There’s a steep drop in what you remember, anyway. The ‘forgetting curve’, as it’s called, is steepest during the first twenty-four hours after you learn something. Exactly how much you forget, percentage-wise, varies, but unless you review the material, much of it slips down the drain. What you remember after day one has a good chance of still being retained after thirty. </p><h3 id="spaced-repetition">Spaced repetition</h3><p>To improve retention, spaced repetition is typically used. This technique involves repeating what you're trying to retain, ensuring to space the repetition out. Repeating a new vocabulary word or a problem solving technique for example over a number of days.</p><p>The good news is, our long-term memory has room for billions of items. In fact there can be so many items they can bury each other. It can be difficult for you to find the information you need unless you practice and repeat at least a few times. This allows the synoptic connections in the brain to form and strengthen into a lasting structure.</p><p>Long-term memory is important because it's where you store fundamental concepts and techniques that are often involved in whatever you're learning about.</p><p>Having strong foundations in your long-term memory also makes the working memory more efficient, and able to connect dots from wider, more abstract, fields. It gives our thinking ‘richness’ and ‘associative access’. </p><p>Richness refers to the theory that a large number of things we have apparently forgotten all about are still there, somewhere, and add depth to our thinking. Associative access means that your thoughts can be accessed in a number of different ways by semantic or perceptual associations  — memories can be triggered by related words, by category names, by a smell, an old song or photograph, or even seemingly random neural firings that bring them up to consciousness.</p><h3 id="offloading-memory">Offloading memory</h3><p>But now, of course, we don’t bother to do all of the hard work of committing many things to our long-term memory. We have devices -- and the internet -- to remember stuff for us.</p><p>When I think back to when I started journaling on my iPad and laptop, as well as using apps like <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> that are focused on ‘<a href="https://st.im/ive-become-obsessed-with-networked-thought/">networked thought</a>’, it is interesting<strong> </strong>to hypothesise how they have potentially impacted the fundamental chemistry or feedback loops in my brain. </p><p>For me, they have helped reduce my cognitive load by letting me off-load much of what goes on in my brain to an external entity. In this day and age, this recall memory has become less necessary. Recognition memory is more important (i.e. the ability to judge that a currently present object, person, place, or event, has previously been encountered or experienced).</p><p>Research has shown that the internet functions as a sort of externalised memory. “When people expect to have future access to information, they have lower rates of recall of the information itself,” <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21764755">as one study puts it</a>. </p><p>If you know that you ‘know’ something, and you know how to retrieve it (thank you Google) that performs pretty much the same function as having a brain stuffed with lots of long-term memories. And the new ‘networked thought’ apps allow us to make interesting connections between these various bits of stored knowledge in much the same way that a well-stocked memory does.</p><h3 id="using-our-second-brain">Using our second brain </h3><p>So I wouldn’t say we are losing our ability to remember, as I posed at the start of this post. I think people (me included) just don’t do enough work to move stuff from our working memory into our long-term memory. </p><p>Our decreased reliance on recall memory and our &nbsp;ever-decreasing attention spans may not be the disaster that I first feared.</p><p>I think that the internet and apps focused on network thinking do assist us. They do act as a second brain. And I think that &nbsp;makes us more efficient.</p><hr><p>Cover photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@sarandywestfall_photo?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Sarandy Westfall</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/memory?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a><br>Thanks to <a href="https://jonathangifford.com/">Jonathan</a> for reading through early drafts of this post.<br>For discussion, check out this post on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24917721">Hacker News</a>. &nbsp;</p>

      <p><span>
        Thu 10 Jun 2004 by <a href="mailto:mskala@ansuz.sooke.bc.ca" title="">mskala</a>
        Tags used:  <a rel="tag" href="https://ansuz.sooke.bc.ca/tag/colour" title="Tag: colour">colour</a>, <a rel="tag" href="https://ansuz.sooke.bc.ca/tag/copyright" title="Tag: copyright">copyright</a>, <a rel="tag" href="https://ansuz.sooke.bc.ca/tag/philosophy" title="Tag: philosophy">philosophy</a>
      </span></p><p>There's a classic adventure game called <a href="http://www.paranoia-rpg.com/players/intro.php">Paranoia</a> which is
set in an extremely <s>repressive</s> Utopian futuristic world
run by The Computer, who
is Your Friend.&nbsp; Looking at a recent <a href="http://research.yale.edu/lawmeme/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1487">LawMeme
posting</a> and related discussion, it occurred to me that the concept of
colour-coded security clearances in Paranoia provides a good metaphor for
a lot of copyright and intellectual freedom issues, and it may illuminate
why we sometimes have difficulty communicating and understanding the
ideologies in these areas.</p>

<p><i>An article based on this one and its follow-ups, by me, Brett Bonfield,
and Mary Fran Torpey, appeared in the 15 February 2008 issue of
<a href="http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6529387.html">LJ, Library
Journal</a>.</i></p>

<p>In Paranoia, everything has a colour-coded security level (from Infrared
up to Ultraviolet) and everybody has a clearance on the same scale.&nbsp; You
are not allowed to touch, or have any dealings with, anything that exceeds
your clearance.&nbsp; If you're a Red Troubleshooter, you're not allowed to
walk through an Orange door.&nbsp; Formally, you're not really supposed to even
know about the existence of anything above your clearance.&nbsp; Anyone who
breaks the rules is a Commie Mutant Traitor, subject to the death penalty.</p>

<p>Much of the game revolves around the consequences of the security levels.&nbsp;
For instance, Friend Computer might assign a team of Red Troubleshooters
to re-paint a hallway that ought to be Orange but was painted Yellow by
<s>mistake</s> the Commie Mutant Traitors.&nbsp; It's quite likely in
such a case that the Troubleshooters will all end up shooting each other
for treason against Friend Computer, since none of them are allowed to
touch the paint, go near the hallway, or talk about their mission, and
they're all charged with enforcing the rules on one another.</p>

<p>In intellectual property and some other fields we're very interested in
information, data, artistic works, a whole lot of things that I'll
summarize with the term "bits".&nbsp; Bits are all the things you can (at
least in principle) represent with binary ones and zeroes.&nbsp; And very much
of intellectual property law comes down to rules regarding intangible
attributes of bits - Who created the bits?&nbsp; Where did they come from?&nbsp;

Where are they going?&nbsp; Are they copies of other bits?&nbsp; Those questions are
perhaps answerable by "metadata", but metadata suggests to me additional
bits attached to the bits in question, and I'd like to emphasize that I'm
talking here about something that is not properly captured by bits at all
and actually cannot be, ever.&nbsp; Let's call it "Colour", because it turns
out to behave a lot like the colour-coded security clearances of the
Paranoia universe.</p>

<p>Bits do not naturally have Colour.&nbsp; Colour, in this sense, is not part of
the natural universe.&nbsp; Most importantly, you cannot look at bits and
observe what Colour they are.&nbsp; I encountered an amusing example of bit
Colour recently:&nbsp; one of my friends was talking about how he'd
performed John Cage's famous silent musical composition <i>4'33"</i> for
MP3.&nbsp; Okay, we said, (paraphrasing the conversation here) so you took an
appropriate-sized file of zeroes out of /dev/zero and compressed that with
an MP3 compressor?&nbsp; No, no, he said.&nbsp; If I did that, it wouldn't really be

<i>4'33"</i> because to perform the composition, you have to make the
silence in a certain way, according to the rules laid down by the
composer.&nbsp; It's not just four minutes and thirty-three seconds of any old
silence.</p>

<p>My friend had gone through an elaborate process that basically amounted to
performing some other piece of music four minutes and thirty-three seconds
long, with a software synthesizer and the volume set to zero.&nbsp; The result
was an appropriate-sized file of zeroes - which he compressed with an MP3
compressor.&nbsp; The MP3 file was bit-for-bit identical to one that would have
been produced by compressing /dev/zero...&nbsp; but this file was (he claimed)
legitimately a recording of <i>4'33"</i> and the other one wouldn't have
been.&nbsp; The difference was the Colour of the bits.&nbsp; He was asserting
that the bits in his copy of 433.mp3 had a different Colour from those
in a copy of 433.mp3 I might make by means of the /dev/zero procedure,
even though the two files would contain exactly the same bits.</p>

<p>Now, the preceding paragraph is basically nonsense to computer scientists
or anyone with a mathematical background.&nbsp; (My friend is one; he'd done
this as a sort of elaborate joke.)  Numbers are numbers, right?&nbsp;
If I add 39 plus 3 and get 42, and you do the same thing, there is no way
that "my" 42 can be said to be different from "your" 42.&nbsp; Given two
bit-for-bit identical MP3 files, there is no meaningful (to a computer
scientist) way to say that one is a recording of the Cage composition and
the other one isn't.&nbsp; There would be no way to test one of the files and
see which one it was, because they are actually the same file.&nbsp; Having
identical bits means by definition that there can be no difference.&nbsp; Bits
don't have Colour; computer scientists, like computers, are Colour-blind.&nbsp;
That is not a mistake or deficiency on our part:&nbsp; rather, we have worked
hard to become so.&nbsp; Colour-blindness on the part of computer scientists
helps us understand the fact that computers are also Colour-blind, and we
need to be intimately familiar with that fact in order to do our jobs.</p>

<p>The trouble is, human beings are not in general Colour-blind.&nbsp; The law is
not Colour-blind.&nbsp; It makes a difference not only what bits you have, but
where they came from.&nbsp; There's a very interesting Web page illustrating
the Coloured nature of bits in law <a href="http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/lawyers.html">on the US Naval
Observatory Web site</a>.&nbsp; They provide information on that site about
when the Sun rises and sets and so on...&nbsp; but they also provide it under a
disclaimer saying that this information is not suitable for use in court.&nbsp;
If you need to know when the Sun rose or set for use in a court case, then
you need an expert witness - because you don't actually just need the bits
that say when the Sun rose.&nbsp; You need those bits to be Coloured with the
Colour that allows them to be admissible in court, and the USNO doesn't
provide that.&nbsp; It's not just a question of accuracy - we all know
perfectly well that the USNO's numbers are good.&nbsp; It's a question of where
the numbers came from.&nbsp; It makes perfect sense to a lawyer that where the
information came from is important, in fact maybe more important than the
information itself.&nbsp; The law sees Colour.</p>

<p>Suppose you publish an article that happens to contain a sentence
identical to one from this article, like "The law sees Colour."  That's
just four words, all of them common, and it might well occur by random
chance.&nbsp; Maybe you were thinking about similar ideas to mine and happened
to put the words together in a similar way.&nbsp; If so, fine.&nbsp; But maybe you
wrote "your" article by cutting and pasting from "mine" - in that case,
the words have the Colour that obligates you to follow quotation
procedures and worry about "derivative work" status under copyright law
and so on.&nbsp; Exactly the same words - represented on a computer by the same
bits - can vary in Colour and have differing consequences.&nbsp; When you
use those words without quotation marks, either you're an author or a
plagiarist depending on where you got them, even though they are the
same words.&nbsp; It matters where the bits came from.</p>

<p>I think Colour is what the designers of <a href="http://monolith.sourceforge.net/">Monolith</a> are trying to
challenge, although I'm afraid I think their understanding of the
issues is superficial on both the legal and computer-science sides.&nbsp; The
idea of Monolith is that it will mathematically combine two files with the
exclusive-or operation.&nbsp; You take a file to which someone claims
copyright, mix it up with a public file, and then the result, which is
mixed-up garbage supposedly containing no information, is supposedly free
of copyright claims even though someone else can later undo the mixing
operation and produce a copy of the copyright-encumbered file you started
with.&nbsp; Oh, happy day!&nbsp; The lawyers will just have to all go away now,
because we've demonstrated the absurdity of intellectual property!</p>

<p>The fallacy of Monolith is that it's playing fast and loose with Colour,
attempting to use legal rules one moment and math rules another moment as
convenient.&nbsp; When you have a copyrighted file at the start, that file
clearly has the "covered by copyright" Colour, and you're not cleared for
it, Citizen.&nbsp; When it's scrambled by Monolith, the claim is that the
resulting file has no Colour - how could it have the copyright Colour?&nbsp;
It's just random bits!&nbsp; Then when it's descrambled, it still can't have
the copyright Colour because it came from public inputs.&nbsp; The problem is
that there are two conflicting sets of rules there.&nbsp; Under the lawyer's
rules, Colour is not a mathematical function of the bits that you can
determine by examining the bits.&nbsp; <i>It matters where the bits came
from.</i> The scrambled file still has the copyright Colour because it
came from the copyrighted input file.&nbsp; It doesn't matter that it looks
like, or maybe even is bit-for-bit identical with, some other file that
you could get from a random number generator.&nbsp; It happens that you didn't
get it from a random number generator.&nbsp; You got it from copyrighted
material; it is copyrighted.&nbsp; The randomly-generated file, even if
bit-for-bit identical, would have a different Colour.&nbsp; The Colour inherits
through all scrambling and descrambling operations and you're distributing
a copyrighted work, you Commie Mutant Traitor.</p>

<p>To a computer scientist, on the other hand, bits are bits are bits and it
is absolutely fundamental that two identical chunks of bits cannot be
distinguished.&nbsp; Colour does not exist.&nbsp; I've seen computer people claim
(indeed, one did this to me just today in the very discussion that
inspired this posting) that copyright law …</p></div></div></div>

</p>
<p>There’s a popular book called “JavaScript: The Good Parts.” And there’s a common meme around the relative size of that book versus “JavaScript: The Definitive Guide.”</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wIf3EJh.jpg"></p><p>Haskell is in my opinion a far more well designed and coherent language than JavaScript. However, it’s also an old language with some historical baggage. And in many ways it’s a bleeding edge research language that sometimes includes… half-baked features. And due to an inconsistent set of rules around backwards compatibility, it sometimes will break code every six months, and sometimes keep strange decisions around for decades.</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>True mastery of Haskell comes down to knowing which things in core libraries should be avoided like the plague.</p><p>* foldl<br>* sum/product<br>* Data.Text.IO<br>* Control.Exception.bracket (use unliftio instead, handles interruptible correctly)</p><p>Just as some examples</p></div>— Michael Snoyman (@snoyberg) <a href="https://twitter.com/snoyberg/status/1321049221697544193?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<p>After a request and some tongue-in-cheek comments in that thread, I decided a longer form blog post was in order. I’m going to start off by expanding on the four examples I gave in that tweet. But there are many, many more examples out there. If there’s more interest in seeing a continuation of this series, please let me know. And if you have pet peeves you’d like me to address, input will be very welcome.</p>
<h2>What is a “bad part”</h2>
<p>Very rarely is there such a thing as a language feature, function, type, or library that is so egregiously bad that it should never, ever be used. Null is of course the billion dollar mistake, but it’s still incredibly useful in some cases. So when I say that something is a “bad part” of Haskell, I mean something along these lines:</p>
<ul>
<li>A rarely-useful feature has been promoted to a position of prominence</li>
<li>A function has major downsides that are not documented</li>
<li>There’s an unexpected performance implication</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s a large tendency in the Haskell community to be overly literal in responding to blog posts. Feel free to do that to your heart’s content. But this caveat serves as a word of warning: I’m not going to caveat each one of these with an explanation of “yes, but there’s this one corner case where it’s actually useful.”</p>
<h2>Why attack Haskell?</h2>
<p>Since I’m a Haskeller and advocate of the language, you may be wondering: why am I attacking Haskell? I don’t see this as an attack. I <em>do</em> wish we could fix these issues, and I think it’s a fair thing to say that the problems I’m listing are warts on the language. But every language has warts. I’m writing this because I’ve seen these kinds of things break real world projects. I’ve seen these failures manifest at runtime, defeating yet again the false claim that “if it compiles it works.” I’ve seen these become nefarious time bombs that disincentivize people from ever working with Haskell in the future.</p>
<p>I hope by calling these out publicly, I can help raise awareness of these problems. And then, either we can fix the problems at their source or, more likely, get more widespread awareness of the issue.</p>
<p>Also, because it feels appropriate, I’m going to take a more jovial tone below. I personally find it easier to beat up on a language I love like that.</p>
<h2>foldl</h2>
<p>Duncan Coutts <a href="https://www.well-typed.com/blog/2014/04/fixing-foldl/">already did this one</a>. <code>foldl</code> is broken. It’s a bad function. Left folds are supposed to be strict, not lazy. End of story. Goodbye. Too many space leaks have been caused by this function. We should gut it out entirely.</p>
<p>But wait! A lazy left fold makes perfect sense for a <code>Vector</code>! Yeah, no one ever meant that. And the problem isn’t the fact that this function exists. It’s the <strong>name</strong>. It has taken the hallowed spot of the One True Left Fold. I’m sorry, the One True Left Fold is strict.</p>
<p>Also, side note: we can’t raise linked lists to a position of supreme power within our ecosystem and then pretend like we actually care about vectors. We don’t, we just pay lip service to them. Until we fix the wart which is overuse of lists, <code>foldl</code> is only ever used on lists.</p>
<p>OK, back to this bad left fold. This is all made worse by the fact that the true left fold, <code>foldl'</code>, is not even exported by the <code>Prelude</code>. We Haskellers are a lazy bunch. And if you make me type in <code>import Data.List (foldl')</code>, I just won’t. I’d rather have a space leak than waste precious time typing in those characters.</p>
<p>Alright, so what should you do? Use an alternative prelude that doesn’t export a bad function, and does export a good function. If you really, really want a lazy left fold: add a comment, or use a function named <code>foldlButLazyIReallyMeanIt</code>. Otherwise I’m going to fix your code during my code review.</p>
<h2>sum/product</h2>
<p>The <code>sum</code> and <code>product</code> functions are implemented in terms of <code>foldr</code>. Well, actually <code>foldMap</code>, but list’s <code>foldMap</code> is implemented in terms of <code>foldr</code>, and lists are the only data structure that exist in Haskell. “Oh, but <code>foldr</code> is the good function, right?” Only if you’re folding a function which is lazy in its second argument. <code>+</code> and <code>*</code> are both strict in both of their arguments.</p>
<p>If you’re not aware of that terminology: “strict in both arguments” means “in order to evaluate the result of this function/operator, I need to evaluate both of its arguments.” I can’t evaluate <code>x + y</code> without knowing what <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are. On the other hand, <code>:</code> (list cons) is lazy in its second argument. Evaluating <code>x : y</code> doesn’t require evaluating <code>y</code> (or, for that matter, <code>x</code>). (For more information, see <a href="https://www.fpcomplete.com/haskell/tutorial/all-about-strictness/">all about strictness</a>.)</p>
<p>“But wait!” you say. “What if I have a custom data type with a custom typeclass instance of <code>Num</code> that has a custom <code>+</code> and/or <code>*</code> that is in fact lazy in the second argument! Then <code>sum</code> and <code>product</code> are perfect as they are!”</p>
<p>That’s true. Now go off and write your own <code>lazySum</code> and <code>lazyProduct</code>. 99 times out of 100, or more likely 999,999 times out of 1,000,000, we want the fully strict version.</p>
<p>“But it doesn’t matter, GHC will optimize this away.” Maybe. Maybe not. Stop relying on GHC’s optimizer to convert horribly inefficient code into not efficient code. (But I digress, we’ll talk about why the <code>vector</code> package is bad another time.)</p>
<h2>Data.Text.IO</h2>
<p>I’ve already covered this one once before when I told everyone to <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2016/12/beware-of-readfile">beware of <code>readFile</code></a>. In that blog post, I talk about a bunch of <code>String</code> based I/O functions, especially the titular <code>readFile</code>, which is obnoxiously exported by <code>Prelude</code>. Those are bad, and I’ll reiterate why in a second. But <code>Data.Text.IO</code> is arguably far worse. The reason is that there’s pretty good awareness in the community that <code>String</code>-based I/O is bad. Even though the <code>String</code> part is the least of our worries, it does a good job of scaring away the uninitiated.</p>
<p>But <code>Data.Text.IO</code> is a wolf in sheep’s clothing. We’re all told by people who think they can tell people how to write their Haskell code (<em>cough</em> me <em>cough</em>) that we should exorcise <code>String</code> from our codebases and replace it in all cases with <code>Text</code>. Attacking the <code>Text</code> type is a topic for another time. But the problem is that by cloaking itself in the warm embrace of <code>Text</code>, this module claims more legitimacy than it deserves.</p>
<p>The only module worse in this regard is <code>Data.Text.Lazy.IO</code>, which should be buried even deeper.</p>
<p>OK, what exactly am I on about? Locale sensitive file decoding. It’s possible that this has been the number one example of a Haskell bug in the wild I’ve encountered in my entire career. Not the spooky memory leak. Partial functions like <code>head</code> randomly throwing exceptions are up there, but don’t quite rise to prominence.</p>
<p>You see, when you are dealing with file formats, there is typically an actual, defined format. YAML, XML, JSON, and many others give a lot of information about how to serialize data, including character data, into raw bytes. We want to be consistent. We want to write a file in one run of the program, and have it read in a separate run. We want to write the file on a Windows machine and read it on a Linux machine. Or we want to interact with programs in other languages that read or write data in a consistent format.</p>
<p>Locale sensitive file encoding and decoding laughs in our face. When you use <code>Data.Text.IO.readFile</code>, it plays a mind reading game of trying to deduce from clues you don’t care about which character encoding to use. These days, on the vast majority of systems used by native English speakers, this turns out to be UTF-8. So using <code>readFile</code> and <code>writeFile</code> typically “just works.” Using functions from <code>Data.Text.IO</code> looks safe, and can easily get hidden in a large PR or a library dependency.</p>
<p>That’s when all hell breaks loose. You ship this code. You run it in a Docker container. “Oops, you forgot to set the <code>LANG</code> env var, Imma crash.” But it’s worse than that. Typically things will work well for weeks or months, because it can often be a long time before someone tries to encode a non-ASCII character.</p>
<p>The same kind of thing happens regularly to Stack. Someone adds a new feature that writes and reads a file. The code passes all integration tests. And then someone in Russia with a weird Windows code page set and a Cyrillic character in their name files a bug report 2 years later about how they can’t build anything, and we sheepishly tell them to run <code>chcp 65001</code> or build in <code>c:\</code>.</p>
<p>Friends don’t let friends use <code>Data.Text.IO</code>.</p>
<p>“Oh, but <code>putStrLn</code> is fine!” Yeah, maybe. It’s also potentially slow. And it will throw a runtime exception due to character encoding mismatches. Just use a good logging library. That’s why we have one in <code>rio</code>.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Since so many people have asked: instead of <code>readFile</code>, I recommend using <a href="https://www.stackage.org/haddock/lts-16.20/rio-0.1.19.0/RIO.html#v:readFileUtf8"><code>readFileUtf8</code></a>, which is available from <a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/rio"><code>rio</code></a>.</p>
<h2>Control.Exception.bracket</h2>
<p>This is by far the least objectionable of the bad things in this list. I included it because the entire original tweet was inspired by a coworker telling me about a bug he ran into because of this function.</p>
<p>Async exceptions are subtle. Very, very subtle. Like, super duper subtle. I’ve devoted a large percentage to my Haskell teaching career towards them. Async exceptions are a concept that don’t truly exist in most other languages. They require rewiring the way your brain works for …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>There are only a few apps I use every day and shell — ZSH — is one of the most used. It’s been that way since the beginning of the ’00s and back then I spent a lot of time configuring my prompt to be a good balance between compact/readable and useful. I found that I dislike fancy two-line prompts, information on a right-hand side (because of its awkward behavior), and stuff like that. So the result looks like that:</p>
<pre><code>piranha@rigel ~&gt; █
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>█</code> is a cursor. It shows username, <code>@</code> to separate it from hostname - or <span><code>#</code></span> if this is uid 0 shell, then hostname, and a home-abbreviated path. One of the fancy things is that space before the cursor is Unicode glyph <code>\u00A0</code> - non-breaking space - which is bound in ZLE to delete everything to the beginning of a line. Unfortunately, this does not work with Terminal.app, so it just sits there waiting for a better time. This setup along with colors had no changes for over a decade.</p>
<p>But a week ago a saw a <a href="https://twitter.com/thingskatedid/status/1316081732467081217">tweet</a> with an idea to change prompt’s prompt (the <code>&gt;</code> thingie) to a red color when previous command exited with an error status. This motivated me to cleanup and update my prompt to a newer conventions. This is a result:</p>
<p><img alt="prompt screenshot" src="https://solovyov.net/media/prompt.jpg" height="60px" width="127px"></p>
<p>You can see I removed my username since it really gives me no information, no reason to spend space on that. I also really like white background, but if you don’t, changing colors is easy — I’ll explain how everything works.</p>
<p>Let’s break down it bit by bit. The prompt syntax is a little hard on the eyes - in case if you have ideas on how to write this so next time I won’t have to dig deep into ZSH documentation, I’ll be glad to listen.</p>
<pre><code>p_at='%(!.%F{red}%B#%b%f.@)'
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, few things are interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>%(x.if-true.if-false)</code> construct (documented <a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Prompt-Expansion.html#Conditional-Substrings-in-Prompts">here</a>) shows either <code>@</code> if I’m a normal user or a red <span><code>#</code></span> if I’m a root.</li>
<li><code>!</code> there means “True if the shell is running with privileges”.</li>
<li>You can clearly see <code>@</code> after the second dot, but what does <code>%F{red}%B#%b%f</code> mean? <code>%B</code> means “start bold”, <code>%b</code> means “end bold”.</li>
<li><code>%F</code>/<code>%f</code> duo is “start/stop color” - it can either accept old-style color numbers (where 1 is red) or color names, which is easier to understand.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>p_host='%F{blue}%m%f'
p_path='%F{blue}%~%f'
</code></pre>
<p>Those are easy to understand, just refer to <a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Prompt-Expansion.html">documentation</a> — <code>%m</code> is a hostname before the first dot, <code>%~</code> is a path where <code>$HOME</code> is abbreviated to <code>~</code>.</p>
<pre><code>p_pr='%(?.%F{blue}.%F{red})&gt;%f'
</code></pre>
<p>This is a new part. <code>?</code> means “True if exit status of the last command was 0”. So if a command exited nicely (with a status code 0), then it’s going to be blue <span><code>&gt;</code></span>, in other case it’s going to be red <span><code>&gt;</code></span>. Voila! :-)</p>
<p>End result looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>p_at='%(!.%F{red}%B#%b%f.@)'
p_host='%F{blue}%m%f'
p_path='%F{blue}%~%f'
p_pr='%(?.%F{blue}.%F{red})&gt;%f'

PS1="$p_at$p_host $p_path$p_pr "
unset p_at p_host p_path p_pr
</code></pre>
<p>You can see I’m unsetting color in every variable and unset those variables — cleaning up after yourself is a valuable habit, especially with a shell. :-)</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure the same could be done for bash (or tclsh, or whatever), but I’m not using it so… If anybody wants to contribute a similar configuration for other shells, I’ll gladly link to a post or add it here.</p>

    <em>How to create a Dependency Injection-friendly software framework.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    It seems to me that every time a development organisation wants to add 'Dependency Injection support' to a framework, all too often, the result is a <a href="https://blog.ploeh.dk/2014/05/19/conforming-container">Conforming Container</a>. In this article I wish to describe good alternatives to this anti-pattern.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a previous article I covered <a href="https://blog.ploeh.dk/2014/05/19/di-friendly-library">how to design a Dependency Injection-friendly library</a>; in this article, I will deal with frameworks. The <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/2190658/126014">distinction I usually make</a> is:
    </p><ul>
      <li>A <strong>Library</strong> is a reusable set of types or functions you can use from a wide variety of applications. The application code initiates communication with the library and invokes it.</li>
      <li>A <strong>Framework</strong> consists of one or more libraries, but the difference is that <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/3227404/126014">Inversion of Control</a> applies. The application registers with the framework (often by implementing one or more interfaces), and the framework calls into the application, which may call back into the framework. A framework often exists to address a particular general-purpose Domain (such as web applications, mobile apps, workflows, etc.).</li>
    </ul><p>
    In my article about the <a href="https://blog.ploeh.dk/2014/05/19/conforming-container">Conforming Container anti-pattern</a>, I already covered some general reason why attempting to create an abstraction over DI Containers is a bad idea, but when it comes to frameworks, some extra concerns arise.
  </p>
  <h3 id="15b8d9b2820a4ad698061c92d42f0ddd">
    The composition challenge <a href="#15b8d9b2820a4ad698061c92d42f0ddd" title="permalink">#</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    One of the most challenging aspects of writing a framework is that the framework designers can't predict what users will want to do. Often, a framework defines a way for you to interact with it:
    </p><ul>
      <li>Implement an interface</li>
      <li>Derive from a base class</li>
      <li>Adorn your classes or methods with a particular attribute</li>
      <li>Name your classes according to some naming convention</li>
    </ul><p>
    Common for all these approaches is, however, that the user of the framework develops some classes, and the framework then has to create instances of those classes. Obviously, the framework doesn't know anything about custom user classes, so it'll need some way of creating those instances.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://blog.ploeh.dk/content/binary/framework-sequence-diagram.png" alt="Framework sequence diagram">
  </p>
  <p>
    Once the framework has an instance of the custom user class, it can easily start using it by invoking methods defined by the interface the class implements, etc. The difficult part is creating the instance. By default, most frameworks require that a custom class has a default (parameterless) constructor, but <a href="https://blog.ploeh.dk/2011/05/30/DesignSmellDefaultConstructor">that may be a design smell</a>, and doesn't fit with the Constructor Injection pattern. Such a requirement is a sensible default, but isn't Dependency Injection-friendly; in fact, it's an example of the Constrained Construction anti-pattern, which you can read about in <a href="http://amzn.to/12p90MG">my book</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most framework designers realize this and resolve to add Dependency Injection support to the framework. Often, in the first few iterations, they get it right!
  </p>
  <h3 id="e7496d9d45cd4140a8fd60729068cef4">
    Abstractions and ownership <a href="#e7496d9d45cd4140a8fd60729068cef4" title="permalink">#</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    If you examine the sequence diagram above, you should realize one thing: the framework is the <em>client</em> of the custom user code; the custom user code provides the services for the framework. In most cases, the custom user code exposes itself as a service to the framework. Some examples may be in order:
    </p><ul>
      <li>In ASP.NET MVC, user code implements the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.mvc.icontroller.aspx">IController</a> interface, although this is most commonly done by deriving from the abstract <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.mvc.controller.aspx">Controller</a> base class.</li>
      <li>In ASP.NET Web API, user code implements the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.http.controllers.ihttpcontroller.aspx">IHttpController</a> interface, although this is most commonly done by deriving from the abstract <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.http.apicontroller.aspx">ApiController</a> class.</li>
      <li>In Windows Presentation Foundation, user code derives from the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us//library/System.Windows.Window.aspx">Window</a> class.</li>
    </ul><p>
    The framework code doesn't know anything about custom user classes, but when they implement the appropriate interface, the framework talks to those interfaces.
  </p>
  <p>
    There's an extremely important point hidden here: although it looks like a framework has to deal with the unknown, all the <em>requirements</em> of the framework are known:
    </p><ul>
      <li>The <em>framework</em> defines the interface or base class</li>
      <li>The <em>framework</em> creates instances of the custom user classes</li>
      <li>The <em>framework</em> invokes methods on the custom user objects</li>
    </ul><p>
    The <em>framework</em> is the client, and the framework defines the interface. That's exactly how it should be. In <a href="http://amzn.to/19W4JHk">Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices</a>, Robert C. Martin defines interface ownership as
    </p><blockquote>
      "clients [...] own the abstract interfaces"
    </blockquote><p>
    This is a quote from chapter 11, which is about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle">Dependency Inversion Principle</a>, so it all fits.
  </p>
  <p>
    Notice what the framework <em>does</em> in the list above. Not only does it <em>use</em> the custom user objects, it also <em>creates</em> instances of the custom user classes. This is the tricky part, where many framework designers have a hard time seeing past the fact that the custom user code is unknown. However, from the perspective of the framework, the concrete type of a custom user class is irrelevant; it just needs to create an instance of it, but treat it as the well-known interface it implements.
    </p><ul>
      <li>The client owns the interface</li>
      <li>The <em>framework</em> is the client</li>
      <li>The framework knows what <em>it</em> needs, not what user code needs</li>
      <li>Thus, framework interfaces should be defined by what the framework needs, not as a general-purpose interface to deal with user code</li>
      <li>Users know much better what user code needs than the framework can ever hope to do</li>
    </ul><p>
    The framework owns the interface for creating those objects, and it shouldn't be complicated; in essence, it should look like this:
  </p>
  <pre><span>public</span>&nbsp;<span>interface</span>&nbsp;<span>IFrameworkControllerFactory</span>
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>IFrameworkController</span>&nbsp;Create(<span>Type</span>&nbsp;controllerType);
}</pre>
  
  <p>
    assuming that the interface that the user code must implement is called IFrameworkController.
  </p>
  <p>
    The custom user class may contain one or more disposable objects, so in order to prevent resource leaks, the framework must also provide a hook for decommissioning:
  </p>
  <pre><span>public</span>&nbsp;<span>interface</span>&nbsp;<span>IFrameworkControllerFactory</span>
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>IFrameworkController</span>&nbsp;Create(<span>Type</span>&nbsp;controllerType);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>void</span>&nbsp;Release(<span>IFrameworkController</span>&nbsp;controller);
}</pre>
  
  <p>
    In this expanded iteration of the Abstract Factory, the contract is that the framework will invoke the Release method when it's finished with a particular IFrameworkController instance.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://blog.ploeh.dk/content/binary/framework-sequence-diagram-with-release-hook.png" alt="Framework sequence diagram with release hook">
  </p>
  <p>
    Some framework designers attempt to introduce a 'more sophisticated' lifetime model, but there's no reason for that. This Create/Release design is simple, easy to understand, works very well, and fits perfectly into the <a href="https://blog.ploeh.dk/2010/09/29/TheRegisterResolveReleasepattern">Register Resolve Release</a> pattern, since it provides hooks for the Resolve and Release phases.
  </p>
  <p>
    ASP.NET MVC 1 and 2 provided <em>flawless</em> examples of such Abstract Factories in the form of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.mvc.icontrollerfactory(v=vs.100).aspx">IControllerFactory</a> interface:
  </p>
  <pre><span>public</span>&nbsp;<span>interface</span>&nbsp;<span>IControllerFactory</span>
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>IController</span>&nbsp;CreateController(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>RequestContext</span>&nbsp;requestContext,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>string</span>&nbsp;controllerName);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>void</span>&nbsp;ReleaseController(<span>IController</span>&nbsp;controller);
}</pre>
  
  <p>
    Unfortunately, in ASP.NET MVC 3, a completely unrelated third method was added to that interface; it's still useful, but not as clean as before.
  </p>
  <p>
    Framework designers ought to stop here. With such an Abstract Factory, they have <em>perfect</em> Dependency Injection support. If a user wants to hand-code the composition, he or she can implement the Abstract Factory interface. Here's an ASP.NET 1 example:
  </p>
  <pre><span>public</span>&nbsp;<span>class</span>&nbsp;<span>PoorMansCompositionRoot</span>&nbsp;:&nbsp;<span>DefaultControllerFactory</span>
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>private</span>&nbsp;<span>readonly</span>&nbsp;<span>Dictionary</span>&lt;<span>IController</span>,&nbsp;<span>IEnumerable</span>&lt;<span>IDisposable</span>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;disposables;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>private</span>&nbsp;<span>readonly</span>&nbsp;<span>object</span>&nbsp;syncRoot;
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>public</span>&nbsp;PoorMansCompositionRoot()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>this</span>.syncRoot&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span>new</span>&nbsp;<span>object</span>();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>this</span>.disposables&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span>new</span>&nbsp;<span>Dictionary</span>&lt;<span>IController</span>,&nbsp;<span>IEnumerable</span>&lt;<span>IDisposable</span>&gt;&gt;();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>protected</span>&nbsp;<span>override</span>&nbsp;<span>IController</span>&nbsp;GetControllerInstance(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>RequestContext</span>&nbsp;requestContext,&nbsp;<span>Type</span>&nbsp;controllerType)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>if</span>&nbsp;(controllerType&nbsp;==&nbsp;<span>typeof</span>(<span>HomeController</span>))
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>var</span>&nbsp;connStr&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span>ConfigurationManager</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.ConnectionStrings[<span>"postings"</span>].ConnectionString;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>var</span>&nbsp;ctx&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span>new</span>&nbsp;<span>PostingContext</span>(connStr);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>var</span>&nbsp;sqlChannel&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span>new</span>&nbsp;<span>SqlPostingChannel</span>(ctx);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>var</span>&nbsp;sqlReader&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span>new</span>&nbsp;<span>SqlPostingReader</span>(ctx);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>var</span>&nbsp;validator&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span>new</span>&nbsp;<span>DefaultPostingValidator</span>();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>var</span>&nbsp;validatingChannel&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span>new</span>&nbsp;<span>ValidatingPostingChannel</span>(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;validator,&nbsp;sqlChannel);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>var</span>&nbsp;controller&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span>new</span>&nbsp;<span>HomeController</span>(sqlReader,&nbsp;validatingChannel);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>lock</span>&nbsp;(<span>this</span>.syncRoot)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>this</span>.disposables.Add(controller,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>new</span>&nbsp;<span>IDisposable</span>[]&nbsp;{&nbsp;sqlChannel,&nbsp;sqlReader&nbsp;});
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>return</span>&nbsp;controller;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>return</span>&nbsp;<span>base</span>.GetControllerInstance(requestContext,&nbsp;controllerType);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>public</span>&nbsp;<span>override</span>&nbsp;<span>void</span>&nbsp;ReleaseController(<span>IController</span>&nbsp;controller)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>lock</span>&nbsp;(<span>this</span>.syncRoot)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>foreach</span>&nbsp;(<span>var</span>&nbsp;d&nbsp;<span>in</span>&nbsp;<span>this</span>.disposables[controller])
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.Dispose();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}</pre>
  
  <p>
    In this example, I derive from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.mvc.defaultcontrollerfactory(v=vs.100).aspx">DefaultControllerFactory</a>, which implements the IControllerFactory interface - it's a little bit easier than implementing the interface directly.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this example, the Composition Root only handles a single user Controller type (HomeController), but I'm sure you can extrapolate from the example.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a developer rather prefers using a DI Container, that's also perfectly possible with the Abstract Factory approach. Here's another ASP.NET 1 example, this time with Castle Windsor:
  </p>
  <pre><span>public</span>&nbsp;<span>class</span>&nbsp;<span>WindsorCompositionRoot</span>&nbsp;:&nbsp;<span>DefaultControllerFactory</span>
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>private</span>&nbsp;<span>readonly</span>&nbsp;<span>IWindsorContainer</span>&nbsp;container;
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>public</span>&nbsp;WindsorCompositionRoot(<span>IWindsorContainer</span>&nbsp;container)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>if</span>&nbsp;(container&nbsp;==&nbsp;<span>null</span>)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>throw</span>&nbsp;<span>new</span>&nbsp;<span>ArgumentNullException</span>(<span>"container"</span>);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>this</span>.container&nbsp;=&nbsp;container;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>protected</span>&nbsp;<span>override</span>&nbsp;<span>IController</span>&nbsp;GetControllerInstance(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>RequestContext</span>&nbsp;requestContext,&nbsp;<span>Type</span>&nbsp;controllerType)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>return</span>&nbsp;(<span>IController</span>)<span>this</span>.container.Resolve(controllerType);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}

<b>Abstract:</b>
We present a massively parallel vector graphics rendering
pipeline that is divided into two components. The
preprocessing component builds a novel adaptive acceleration
data structure, the <em>shortcut tree</em>. Tree construction
is efficient and parallel at the segment level, enabling
dynamic vector graphics. The tree allows efficient random
access to the color of individual samples, so the graphics
can be warped for special effects. The rendering component
processes all samples and pixels in parallel. It was
optimized for wide antialiasing filters and a large number
of samples per pixel to generate sharp, noise-free images.
Our <em>sample scheduler</em> allows pixels with overlapping
antialiasing filters to share samples. It groups together
samples that can be computed with the same vector operations
using little memory or bandwidth.  The pipeline is
feature-rich,
supporting multiple layers of filled paths, each defined by
curved outlines (with linear, rational quadratic, and
integral cubic Bézier segments), clipped against other
paths, and painted with semi-transparent colors, gradients,
or textures.  We demonstrate renderings of complex vector
graphics in state-of-the-art quality and performance.
Finally, we provide full source-code for our implementation
as well as the input data used in the paper.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><b>Louis:</b><span> Bonjour, bonjour and welcome to another episode of Everyone Hates Marketers.com. The no fluff, actionable marketing podcast, for people sick of shady, aggressive marketing.</span></p>
<p><span>I’m your host, Louis Grenier. In today’s episode, you learn how to test different value propositions for whatever you’re offering your product or service, and pick which one you’d like to resonate the most with your audience.</span></p>
<p><span>My guest today you probably know him. He’s the co-founder and the CEO of FYI, a solution to have all of your documents in one place, and is the co-owner of Crazy Egg as well. He’s a serial entrepreneur, founded multiple software companies over the last 20 years or so. And I’m super happy to have him on board because.. obviously I believe that customer feedback and truly understanding your customer is the first step towards success, towards building something that people would care about. So that’s why I’m super happy to have you Hitan Shah onboard. Welcome.</span></p>
<p><b>Hiten:</b><span>Thanks for having me</span></p>
<p><b>Louis:</b><span> Let’s get started straight away. How do you define what a value proposition is, you have extensive experience launching products, dating them side projects, et cetera. But how do you define what a value proposition is?</span></p>
<p><b>Hiten:</b><span> Yeah. In short, I think it’s what, one sort of entity, if you want to call it, that can do for another.</span></p>
<p><span>And that it’s very simple. and the reason I would put it that way is because a value proposition can exist between any, basically two entities. So it could be an individual and an organization. It could be an organization or an organization. It could be an individual and an individual.</span></p>
<p><span>And it’s basically the value that one entity delivers to another. And the value proposition is how that sort of quantified, communicated, realized, et cetera. And the typical way people think about this is your business has a value proposition for its customers. The way I think about it is that.</span></p>
<p><span>Your value proposition for a business, a service, one human to another is what they’re getting from you, that is of value to them. And when you think about it that way, I think it really defines, it defines what this means and what it means is that it’s not up to you. Who’s giving the value, whether it’s an organization or individual to the other person to be like, Oh, here’s my value proposition for you.</span></p>
<p><span>It actually more works the other way around where that person or that company organization, group of individuals is like, this is what that other entity, organization, person does for me. And this is why it’s valuable. And I think that’s the basis of the value proposition is this idea that it’s in someone else’s mind. It’s not in your mind. The one who’s delivering the value. It’s the other party’s mind.</span></p>
<p><span>So it’s generous, it’s a way to think about it. Generously thinking about your people first, what do they want? And you provide that to them. You don’t start with your, with you being self centered and then think of your product.</span></p>
<p><b>Louis:</b><span> And now, what is our value proposition? Then let’s find people who would care about it. It’s really the opposite. You think of those people first, what they care about because it’s, that’s what they care about is themselves, right?</span></p>
<p><b>Hiten:</b><span> Yeah. if you don’t do that, then whatever value proposition you come up with, you’re throwing darts against the wall and hoping something just sticks and it’s probably not going to hit the bullseye for sure.</span></p>
<p><span>So you, you think of it the other way, and you think about these people and what their needs are and, I don’t know, I’ve seen that in every single, basically business I’ve started or business I’ve talked to somebody about it. It doesn’t even matter what it is. It’s that there’s this sort of effect where no matter what I say I’m doing for you, if you don’t agree, I don’t get to have your business.</span></p>
<p><span>I don’t get to be in that relationship with you. And you could go all the way to dating. You could go to marriage, you could go to any type of business. This will work. Because the value, the whole idea of a value proposition is it’s for somebody else. It’s not for the person who’s delivering the value.</span></p>
<p><span>And what I mean by that is like my understanding of it as a person, delivering value is only valuable if it relates to how I’m delivering value to somebody else. Or some other organization or whatever, and this is why this method works. No matter what industry you’re in. Like I said, it boils down to even relationships.</span></p>
<p><span>I think relationships are a set of value propositions to each other, And like when they fall apart, it’s usually because value is not met. Some expectation of that value is not delivered on and that’s it.</span></p>
<p><b>Louis:</b><span> Yeah. That’s when you’re diving very deep into a topic when you see it everywhere, when you go back to first principles, fundamental truth. Which is the way I like to think. So it’s great to hear. So before we actually go through a step by step on how to actually test value propositions, if you have a few in mind and how maybe how to come up with them in the first place. Based on your experience, you said you have funded multiple, very successful companies, you’ve probably advised a lot as well, being in touch with a lot of people. What do you think are the top two other mistakes folks are doing when it comes to value proposition? Besides the main one you described there?</span></p>
<p><b>Hiten:</b><span> Yeah. Let me even give you an example from right now, if I may. So you said, I said, certain things about the businesses I started. In reality, you said it, I didn’t say it. So in a way, it’s really like what people get wrong is they don’t pay attention to basically this idea that, look you said it, not me. And if you said it’s in your mind. So for example, you said that the businesses I’ve started have been successful.</span></p>
<p><span>I didn’t say that. You didn’t even ask me if they have been, right? Because if you would’ve asked me, I would have said successful? I don’t really know what that means. I think I tried my best, the teams did, and we got where we got, and here we are. Like whether that big thing is over or the thing is still going, that eye of the beholder is not me. The eye of the beholder is you, so thank you for saying that. I think there’s some level of credibility, maybe I have as a result of what’s in other people’s minds, but in my mind, I don’t know. Cause it doesn’t matter. So I think what people get wrong is they try to make up the value propositions, in their own heads about what they’re doing.</span></p>
<p><span>Oftentimes, because what they’re doing is something that they want to see exist in the world. And they haven’t really thought about whether it should exist to other people. I know this might sound like what I just said, you know what we’ve been talking about, but it is a second point. The second point is it doesn’t matter what you think.</span></p>
<p><span>Like it just doesn’t. so a lot of times people will come up with things and it’s just wrong because their whole idea of a value proposition is based on what they think about it. So if you asked me about my businesses, I would go into a lot of detail, about them and what happened, but I would never use the word successful, but you did.</span></p>
<p><span>So that means that I’m not saying I should, but it’s just information for me, regardless of what I think. And I think that there’s a resistance oftentimes to what other people think about something of yours and that resistance. Yeah.</span></p>
<p><b>Louis:</b><span> Let’s, sorry to cut through there, but I think you’re about to touch on it.</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s talk about this resistance. Where do you think it’s mainly coming from?</span></p>
<p><b>Hiten:</b><span> A lot of places. I think it usually comes from some form of a reaction that you have to what you just heard and whether that reaction is positive or negative. That’s really what sort of shapes your own ability to deal with what you’re hearing, this is one of the biggest problems with value propositions, which is when you don’t personally agree with what you’re hearing.</span></p>
<p><span>And then you bias yourself towards what you actually want something to be when it won’t be that, because nobody’s saying it. So I don’t think if I said my businesses have been successful, that would be as powerful or accurate as someone else saying it, because my definition of it, because it’s mine is going to be different than yours.</span></p>
<p><span>But what I really care about is your definition of it, not mine. And I think there’s a lot of aversion there to being able to see the truth about yourself or the truth about what you’re doing. And the main reason is you get invested in it. So the reason this happens is usually a really strong, emotional investment in what you’re doing and what you want it to be versus the ability to I like to call it, you go where the wind blows.</span></p>
<p><span>So the wind is blowing a certain way, you go there. So a good example of this is like a lawyer who’s really good at, let’s say like trademark law, and yet they want to do, I don’t know, some kind of M&amp;A, yeah. They want to be an M&amp;A lawyer. That’s very different from trademarks, but they happen to be really good at trademarks.</span></p>
<p><span>And everybody knows them as a lawyer. That’s all about trademarks. But they want to do M&amp;A. So think about how much effort they’re going to have to put in to become known and good at being an M&amp;A lawyer and known for it compared to the thing that’s the path of least resistance where the wind is already blowing, which is other people consider them a great trademark lawyer.</span></p>
<p><span>And it’s not to say that they shouldn’t be an M&amp;A lawyer or anything like that. It’s just to say that, like you have a position in people’s minds. And I don’t think you can talk about value propositions without thinking about positioning and positioning to me, is really like when a good service person, human being, whatever has carved out a place in your brain, and that positioning is what I’m really trying to figure out constantly what, when I’m presented with a problem where we need to like, figure out the value proposition.</span></p>
<p><b>Louis:</b><span> They are always though too, when you have 10, like tens of …</span></p></div></div>

<p>NASA and the Germany space agency’s airborne SOFIA telescope has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-sofia-discovers-water-on-sunlit-surface-of-moon/">detected water</a>&nbsp;on the Moon’s surface. There are many misconceptions floating around this discovery so I’d like to clarify the nature of the findings and what it means for lunar science and exploration.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/nasa-sofia-water-cover.jpg?resize=819%2C819&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="819" height="819" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/nasa-sofia-water-cover.jpg?w=985&amp;ssl=1 985w, https://i1.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/nasa-sofia-water-cover.jpg?resize=200%2C200&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i1.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/nasa-sofia-water-cover.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/nasa-sofia-water-cover.jpg?resize=800%2C800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i1.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/nasa-sofia-water-cover.jpg?resize=400%2C400&amp;ssl=1 400w" sizes="(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>This illustration highlights the Moon’s Clavius crater with an illustration depicting water trapped in its lunar soil, along with an image of NASA’s airborne SOFIA telescope that found such water. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-sofia-discovers-water-on-sunlit-surface-of-moon/">Credits: NASA/Daniel Rutter</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<h2>Different from Chandrayaan 1</h2>



<p>SOFIA detected water on the Moon’s non-polar regions, and in areas of sunlight, making it different from ISRO Chandrayaan 1’s&nbsp;<a href="https://jatan.space/how-nasa-and-chandrayaan-discovered-water-on-the-moon/">discovery of water ice</a>&nbsp;inside dark, cold craters on the lunar poles.</p>



<p>The water SOFIA found is locked in the lunar soil and rocks. Interestingly, NASA’s M3 instrument on Chandrayaan 1 had&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120929095219/http://lunarscience.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/38_Klima_NLSI_2012.pdf">seen hints</a>&nbsp;of such trapped water in non-polar regions, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/topics/moonmars/features/clark1.html">as did Cassini</a>. But unlike SOFIA, those missions couldn’t tell if what they had detected was water or just hydroxyl groups (H2O vs OH).</p>



<p>Chandrayaan 1 dropped an impact probe on the Moon 12 years ago and did&nbsp;<a href="http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2010/2430.html">find water</a>, as in H2O. But it too is different from SOFIA’s findings because the probe detected water in the Moon’s thin atmosphere, not on the surface.</p>



<h2>Scientific not exploratory importance</h2>



<p>NASA PR spinned the announcement as the water being a promising source for future missions in creating sustainable habitats. But that’s not the case since this trapped water is in trace amounts, less than even the driest deserts on Earth. However, finding out where this water comes from or how it’s created has implications for understanding&nbsp;<a href="https://jatan.space/apollo-moon-origin/">the Moon’s origin</a>, which itself is tied to Earth’s.</p>



<p>The one area where the results have some exploratory relevance is understanding how water is transported on the Moon, so as to get a better handle on where on the Moon such resources are deposited. But the substantially more water ice present on the lunar poles continue to be the prime target for enabling sustainable human presence on the Moon.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="675" src="https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3cc0f-water-ice-moon-map-m3.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Illustration showing water ice in eternally dark craters on the Moon’s south pole (left) and north pole (right) as discovered by ISRO’s Chandrayaan 1 spacecraft.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7218">Credit: NASA</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Alongside the SOFIA findings, NASA mentioned&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-020-1198-9#_blank">another result</a>&nbsp;that does have exploratory significance. Researchers using data from NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter have identified several craters smaller than a kilometer which are eternally dark polar and can thus host water ice. The sheer number of such small craters increases the expected amount of water ice on the Moon.</p>



<p>As per previous observations by the Chandrayaan 1 orbiter and the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, scientists estimated the Moon’s poles to host&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/Mini-RF/multimedia/feature_ice_like_deposits.html">more than 600 billion kg</a>&nbsp;of water ice, enough to fill at least 240,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. As the next logical step, Chandrayaan 2 orbiter is&nbsp;<a href="https://jatan.space/chandrayaan-2-is-creating-the-highest-resolution-map-of-the-moon/">quantifying the amount of water ice</a>&nbsp;on the lunar poles and mapping it as we speak, and its findings should include these smaller craters.</p>



<p>Once we have such data, these smaller, dark craters will likely be better targets for future missions as they’d be easier to explore and extract water from than large craters like Shackleton.</p>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo">Markov chain Monte Carlo</a> (MCMC) is a powerful class of methods to sample from probability distributions known only up to an (unknown) normalization constant. But before we dive into MCMC, let’s consider why you might want to do sampling in the first place.</p>
<p>The answer to that is: whenever you’re either interested in the samples themselves (for example, inferring unknown parameters in Bayesian inference) or you need them to approximate expected values of functions w.r.t. to a probability distribution (for example, calculating thermodynamic quantities from the distribution of microstates in statistical physics).
Sometimes, only the mode of a probability distribution is of primary interest. In this case, it’s obtained by numerical optimization so full sampling is not necessary.</p>
<p>It turns out that sampling from any but the most basic probability distributions is a difficult task.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_transform_sampling">Inverse transform sampling</a> is an elementary method to sample from probability distributions, but requires the cumulative distribution function, which in turn requires knowledge of the, generally unknown, normalization constant.
Now in principle, you could just obtain the normalization constant by numerical integration, but this quickly gets infeasible with an increasing number of dimensions.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejection_sampling">Rejection sampling</a> does not require a normalized distribution, but efficiently implementing it requires a good deal of knowledge about the distribution of interest, and it suffers strongly from the curse of dimension, meaning that its efficiency decreases rapidly with an increasing number of variables.
That’s when you need a smart way to obtain representative samples from your distribution which doesn’t require knowledge of the normalization constant.</p>
<p>MCMC algorithms are a class of methods which do exactly that.
These methods date back to a <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7b3d/c9438227f747e770a6fb6d7d7c01d98725d6.pdf">seminal paper by Metropolis et al.</a>, who developed the first MCMC algorithm, correspondingly called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis%E2%80%93Hastings_algorithm">Metropolis algorithm</a>, to calculate the equation of state of a two-dimensional system of hard spheres. In reality, they were looking for a general method to calculate expected values occurring in statistical physics.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I introduce the basics of MCMC sampling; in subsequent posts I’ll cover several important, increasingly complex and powerful MCMC algorithms, which all address different difficulties one frequently faces when using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Along the way, you will gain a solid understanding of these challenges and how to address them.
Also, this serves as a reference for MCMC methods in the context of the <a href="https://www.tweag.io/posts/2019-09-20-monad-bayes-1.html">monad-bayes</a> series.
Furthermore, I hope the provided notebooks will not only spark your interest in exploring the behavior of MCMC algorithms for various parameters/probability distributions, but also serve as a basis for implementing and understanding useful extensions of the basic versions of the algorithms I present.</p>
<h2>Markov chains</h2>
<p>Now that we know why we want to sample, let’s get to the heart of MCMC: Markov chains.
What is a Markov chain? Without all the technical details, a Markov chain is a random sequence of states in some state space in which the probability of picking a certain state next depends only on the current state in the chain and not on the previous history: it is memory-less.
Under certain conditions, a Markov chain has a unique stationary distribution of states to which it converges after a certain number of states. From that number on, states in the Markov chain are distributed according to the invariant distribution.</p>

<p>For didactic purposes, let’s for now consider both a discrete state space and discrete “time”.
The key quantity characterizing a Markov chain is the transition operator <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T(x_{i+1}|x_i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> which gives you the probability of being in state <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x_{i+1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> at time <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">i+1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> given that the chain is in state <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x_i</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> at time <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>i</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">i</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p>Now just for fun (and for illustration), let’s quickly whip up a Markov chain which has a unique stationary distribution.
We’ll start with some imports and settings for the plots:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>%</span>matplotlib notebook
<span>%</span>matplotlib inline
<span>import</span> numpy <span>as</span> np
<span>import</span> matplotlib<span>.</span>pyplot <span>as</span> plt
plt<span>.</span>rcParams<span>[</span><span>'figure.figsize'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>]</span>
np<span>.</span>random<span>.</span>seed<span>(</span><span>42</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The Markov chain will hop around on a discrete state space which is made up from three weather states:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>state_space <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>"sunny"</span><span>,</span> <span>"cloudy"</span><span>,</span> <span>"rainy"</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In a discrete state space, the transition operator is just a matrix.
Columns and rows correspond, in our case, to sunny, cloudy, and rainy weather.
We pick more or less sensible values for all transition probabilities:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>transition_matrix <span>=</span> np<span>.</span>array<span>(</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>0.6</span><span>,</span> <span>0.3</span><span>,</span> <span>0.1</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
                              <span>(</span><span>0.3</span><span>,</span> <span>0.4</span><span>,</span> <span>0.3</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
                              <span>(</span><span>0.2</span><span>,</span> <span>0.3</span><span>,</span> <span>0.5</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The rows indicate the states the chain might currently be in and the columns the states the chains might transition to.
If we take one “time” step of the Markov chain as one hour, then, if it’s sunny, there’s a 60% chance it stays sunny in the next hour, a 30% chance that in the next hour we will have cloudy weather, and only a 10% chance of rain immediately after it had been sunny before.
This also means that each row has to sum up to one.</p>
<p>Let’s run our Markov chain for a while:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>n_steps <span>=</span> <span>20000</span>
states <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span>
<span>for</span> i <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span>n_steps<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    states<span>.</span>append<span>(</span>np<span>.</span>random<span>.</span>choice<span>(</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> p<span>=</span>transition_matrix<span>[</span>states<span>[</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
states <span>=</span> np<span>.</span>array<span>(</span>states<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can monitor the convergence of our Markov chain to its stationary distribution by calculating the empirical probability for each of the states as a function of chain length:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>despine</span><span>(</span>ax<span>,</span> spines<span>=</span><span>(</span><span>'top'</span><span>,</span> <span>'left'</span><span>,</span> <span>'right'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>:</span>

<h2>The mother of all MCMC algorithms: Metropolis-Hastings</h2>
<p>So that’s lots of fun, but back to sampling an arbitrary probability distribution <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.
It could either be discrete, in which case we would keep talking about a transition matrix <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, or be continuous, in which case <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> would be a transition <em>kernel</em>.
From now on, we’re considering continuous distributions, but all concepts presented here transfer to the discrete case.</p>
<p>If we could design the transition kernel in such a way that the next state is already drawn from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, we would be done, as our Markov chain would… well… immediately sample from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.
Unfortunately, to do this, we need to be able to sample from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, which we can’t.
Otherwise you wouldn’t be reading this, right?</p>
<p>A way around this is to split the transition kernel <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T(x_{i+1}|x_i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> into two parts:
a proposal step and an acceptance/rejection step.
The proposal step features a proposal distribution <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>q</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">q(x_{i+1}|x_i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, from which we can sample possible next states of the chain.
In addition to being able to sample from it, we can choose this distribution arbitrarily. But, one should strive to design it such that samples from it are both as little correlated with the current state as possible and have a good chance of being accepted in the acceptance step.
Said acceptance/rejection step is the second part of the transition kernel and corrects for the error introduced by proposal states drawn from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>q</mi><mo mathvariant="normal">≠</mo><mi>π</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">q \neq \pi</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.
It involves calculating an acceptance probability <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>p</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">c</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">c</mi></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p_\mathrm{acc}(x_{i+1}|x_i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and accepting the proposal <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x_{i+1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> with that probability as the next state in the chain.
Drawing the next state <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x_{i+1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T(x_{i+1}|x_i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is then done as follows:
first, a proposal state <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x_{i+1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is drawn from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>q</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">q(x_{i+1}|x_i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.
It is then accepted as the next state with probability <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>p</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">c</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">c</mi></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p_\mathrm{acc}(x_{i+1}|x_i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> or rejected with probability <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>−</mo><msub><mi>p</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">c</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">c</mi></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">_</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1-p_\mathrm{acc}(x\_{i+1}|x_i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, in which case the current state is copied as the next state.</p>
<p>We thus have</p>

Transition kernels of most MCMC algorithms satisfy this condition.</p>
<p>For the two-part transition kernel to obey detailed balance, we need to choose <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>p</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">c</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">c</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p_\mathrm{acc}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> correctly, meaning that is has to correct for any asymmetries in probability flow from / to <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x_{i+1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> or <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x_i</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.

<p>All right, now that we know how Metropolis-Hastings works, let’s go ahead and implement it.
First, we set the log-probability of the distribution we want to sample from—without normalization constants, as we pretend we don’t know them. Let’s work for now with a standard normal distribution:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>There is an important, under appreciated group at every company who are never content no matter how much success they or the company has had. There is a set of people who care so deeply about the company and its products that they take any shortcomings personally. They are offended by bad products and angered by cultural deficiencies. They write passionate notes that nobody asked for and rally people on comment threads in groups they aren’t required to be a part of. They speak truth to power because they are righteous and speak for those who might otherwise have no voice. They aren’t afraid to rock the boat no matter how much the people around them value stability and they can’t be bothered to do it politely. Adam Grant calls these people “<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/adam_grant_are_you_a_giver_or_a_taker#t-113064">Disagreeable Givers</a>.” I call these people malcontents. And I am one of them.</p>
<p>We malcontents are often confused with <a href="http://boz.com/articles/ownership-and-entitlement.html">entitled whiners</a> but that’s a mistake. Whiners and Malcontents may share the same disagreeable tactics when it comes to complaining, but whiners have poor motivation whereas we malcontents have the best intentions. Whiners want to change the establishment for their own benefit. We malcontents want the establishment to change for its own benefit. Unlike whiners, we malcontents often make personal sacrifices to effect positive change (even if we would rather not be forced to). We often do valuable, unsexy, and sometimes underappreciated work like fixing bugs, improving tools or processes, and helping others. When you see large shifts in culture, organizations, or technology not driven by extrinsic or top down forces there is usually a malcontent behind the scenes or leading the charge.</p>
<p>The fate of malcontents is proof that good intentions and good work simply aren’t enough. Evaluating them exclusively on the impact of their work they are invariably promoted more slowly than their more polite peers. They get feedback constantly that they are doing good work but need to figure out how to do it without frustrating so many people. They are told they need to learn how to influence more effectively. To them it just feels like oppressive politics slowing them and the whole company down. I watched at Facebook as my peer group was consistently promoted a year or two ahead of me. I recall telling my manager at one point after a disappointing review that “this company is going to nice itself to death.” But niceness wasn’t hurting the company. I was. For every person who made me feel good about myself by clicking like on something inflammatory that I wrote there were ten people who quietly wrote me off. Not only did that erode my <a href="http://boz.com/articles/influence-over-authority.html">influence</a> over time it also didn’t help me advance my agenda on whatever issue I was raising.</p>
<p>For the malcontents out there: my advice is to stop and listen to the feedback you are getting. Your team needs you to highlight the opportunities around them and I don’t want you to stop advocating for change but I can tell you from personal experience that your impact is being diluted by your approach. You’re loudly trying to make a change but the tactics you use are costly and only marginally effective. If people think are you are emotional or biased, they will dismiss you. If they think your mind is closed, they will close their own. If they think you are attacking them, they will defend. If you take too much of their time or energy relative to the size of the issue, they will avoid you in the future. Do not fall for the Golden Rule — “Treat others as you wish to be treated” — because nobody else wants to be treated as bluntly as you do. If you do that, you will end up frustrated and marginalized. Instead go for the Platinum Rule: <em>Treat others as they wish to be treated</em>. It is only in expressing your passion through openness, empathy, and relationship building that you can really start to create change at scale.</p>
<p>Instead of just fighting the establishment, you must co-opt it. Find things the people involved care about and frame your concerns in those terms. You can change what the organization cares about by degrees over time, not dramatically overnight. As Richard Hamming said : “By realizing you have to use the system and studying how to get the system to do your work, you learn how to adapt the system to your desires. Or you can fight it steadily, as a small undeclared war, for the whole of your life.”</p>
<p>For those interacting with malcontents: embrace them. Nobody will care more or work harder on behalf of the people who use your product. Make space for them to raise all the concerns they have in an environment where it can be productive and recognize them for the value they bring in doing so when others are too polite to ask hard questions. And when necessary, try to make the cost of their clumsy communication as tangible a possible. Remind them of what their goal is in communicating and then show them how their approach was ineffective and coach them on a more effective approach.</p>
<p>I’m no less personally offended today by bad products or bad practices as I was years ago, but I’m much more effective at turning those emotions into impact. I’m not perfect at it and it isn’t hard to find examples where I’ve missed the mark, but now that I see how effective it can be to communicate more respectfully I find it much easier to do most of the time. I will always be grateful to Facebook for all the critical feedback and patience that got me to where I am. So today I try to pay it forward by identifying malcontents and giving them a little extra space and a lot of extra help.</p></section></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Last week, one of my peers asked me to explain what I meant by "Data Intuition",
and I realized I really didn't have a good definition.
That's a problem! I refer to data intuition all the time!</p>
<p>Data intuition is one of the three skills I interview new data scientists for
(along with statistics and technical skills).
In fact, I just spent the first nine months of 2020
building Mozilla's data intuition.
I'm really surprised to realize I can't point to
a good explanation of what I'm trying to cultivate.</p>
<p>So - I'll make one up. I propose the following definition for Data Intuition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Data Intuition is a resilience to misleading data and analyses.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, it's harder to mislead someone with data
if they have strong data intuition.
Think of this as <strong>a defense against the dark data arts</strong>.</p>
<p>So what does that look like in practice?</p>
<h2>Data Stink</h2>
<p>Someone with strong data intuition can quickly spot "data-stink"
(a close cousin to "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell">code smell</a>").
These are data issues that don't necessarily invalidate an analysis,
but certainly draw suspicion on the results.
For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>An analysis prominently reports a seemingly <strong>arbitrary metric</strong> -
  4-day retention increased by 0.5%!
  Where did 4-day retention come from? Don't we usually track 7-day retention?
  This needs more attention before I trust the results.</li>
<li>An analysis reports <strong>extraordinary results</strong> where nominal results are expected -
  this feature increased retention by 10%!
  But, past efforts were trying to increase retention by 0.5% - 
  and isn't retention already 90%? How'd we get and increase of 10%?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are extreme examples. 
Usually the problems are more subtle
and result in a general sense of uneasiness with the results
(that's why it's called "intuition").</p>
<p>It's clear to me that data intuition is <em>related</em> to product intuition,
though these <em>are</em> different skills.
Product intuition can contextualize our results
and make it easier to identify extraordinary claims in analyses.
To know a 10% gain in retention is ridiculous
we need to know that users retain pretty well already.</p>
<h2>Methods issues</h2>
<p>Strong data intuition can also help you 
spot issues with how the analysis was designed.
Things like: how did the author collect data? Is it a representative sample?
Do they need to have an experiment to establish causation?</p>
<p>Here's an example -
say an analysis reports that Firefox users who create a Firefox account
retain 10% higher than users who don't.
By default, a lot of folks interpret this to mean that
if we invest some time in helping users open accounts
we'll see an increase in retention.
Folks with stronger data intuition will instead 
recognize these results are just correlational (not causational).</p>
<p>Users who use the product a lot tend to stick around longer.
Users who open an account are more active users, thus they retain better.
Users who <em>crash</em> Firefox are more active users, and also retain <em>better</em>.</p>
<p>I think this intuition is more than just understanding statistics well.
A strong stats background can help me identify issues
when reading the <em>methods section of a white paper</em>.
Strong data intuition helps me determine how much I trust
results I hear about in a <em>news headline</em>.
Data intuition helps me establish whether results are
<a href="https://blog.harterrt.com/pub-true.html">true-enough</a>.</p>
<h2>More than Skepticism</h2>
<p>I almost defined data intuition as a type of skepticism,
but I think this is a bad characterization.
Skepticism over-focuses on disregarding results.</p>
<p>Intuition is more than being skeptical.
It's <strong>incorporating new data as part of a body of existing knowledge</strong>.
A lot of times, that means deciding new incoming data are inconsistent
and need more investigating before we can trust them.
But other times, it means changing our opinions in the face of new data
that are more authoritative than our existing body of knowledge.</p>
<h2>What do you think?</h2>
<p>I want to hear your thoughts on this.
I'm posting this definition publicly in part because I want to invoke
<a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cunningham%27s_Law">Cunningham's Law</a>.
The best way to get to the right answer is to post the wrong answer!</p>
<p>Does this definition for data intuition resonate with you?
Am I missing something important? Let me know! 
My email is at the bottom of this page.</p>
<p>I'm spending the next few month building some self-service trainings
to help non-data people at Mozilla build data intuition.
I'd rather be wrong now than next year!</p>

<![CDATA[Emerging JavaScript pattern: multiple return values]]>

October 28, 2020 | https://loige.co/emerging-javascript-pattern-multiple-return-values | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://loige.co/emerging-javascript-pattern-multiple-return-values">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>In this article, I want to explore an interesting pattern that I am seeing more and more in JavaScript code which allows you to return multiple values from a function.</p>
<p>You probably know already that JavaScript does not support multiple return values natively, so this article will actually explore some ways to “simulate” this behavior.</p>
<p>One of the most famous usages of this pattern I have seen recently is within <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html">React Hooks</a>, but before delving into that, let’s see what I mean with “multiple return values” by exploring this concept in other languages.</p>
<h2 id="multiple-return-values-in-other-languages"><a href="#multiple-return-values-in-other-languages" aria-label="multiple return values in other languages permalink"></a>Multiple return values in other languages</h2>
<p>Two languages that come to my mind which natively support multiple return values are Lua and Go. Let’s implement a simple <em>integer division</em> function that returns both the <em>quotient</em> and the <em>remainder</em>.</p>
<h3 id="lua"><a href="#lua" aria-label="lua permalink"></a>Lua</h3>
<p>Let’s start with a simple implementation in Lua. It’s definitely worth mentioning that <a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/5.1.html">Lua’s official documentation</a> defines multiple return values as <em>“An unconventional, but quite convenient feature”</em>:</p>
<div data-language="lua"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>intDiv</span> <span>(</span>dividend<span>,</span> divisor<span>)</span>
  <span>local</span> quotient <span>=</span> math<span>.</span><span>floor</span><span>(</span>dividend <span>/</span> divisor<span>)</span>
  <span>local</span> remainder <span>=</span> dividend <span>%</span> divisor
  <span>return</span> quotient<span>,</span> remainder
<span>end</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>intDiv</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<h3 id="go"><a href="#go" aria-label="go permalink"></a>Go</h3>
<p>Here’s some equivalent code in Go:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>package</span> main

<span>import</span> <span>"fmt"</span>

<span>func</span> <span>intDiv</span><span>(</span>dividend<span>,</span> divisor <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  quotient <span>:=</span> dividend <span>/</span> divisor
  remainder <span>:=</span> dividend <span>%</span> divisor
  <span>return</span> quotient<span>,</span> remainder
<span>}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  fmt<span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>intDiv</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> 
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see in these 2 code snippets, functions can return more than 1 value and this can be very convenient in cases where you logically have produce multiple outputs in a computation.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: a more realistic implementation in Go, would take into account errors (e.g. division by 0) and add an extra return value to propagate potential errors. We shouldn’t worry too much about this for the sake of this article, but it is definitely worth mentioning that multiple return values in Go shine when it comes to error propagation and error handling. We will touch a bit more on this later in this article to see how this idea can be applied to JavaScript as well, especially in the context of Async/Await.</p>
<h2 id="simulating-multiple-return-values-in-javascript"><a href="#simulating-multiple-return-values-in-javascript" aria-label="simulating multiple return values in javascript permalink"></a>Simulating multiple return values in JavaScript</h2>
<p>So, as we said early on, JavaScript does not natively support a syntax to return more than one value from a function. We can workaround this limitation by using <em>composite values</em> like arrays or objects.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-return-values-with-arrays"><a href="#multiple-return-values-with-arrays" aria-label="multiple return values with arrays permalink"></a>Multiple return values with arrays</h3>
<p>Let’s implement our <code>intDiv</code> in JavaScript by using arrays as return types:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>intDiv</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>dividend<span>,</span> divisor</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> quotient <span>=</span> Math<span>.</span><span>floor</span><span>(</span>dividend <span>/</span> divisor<span>)</span>
  <span>const</span> remainder <span>=</span> dividend <span>%</span> divisor
  <span>return</span> <span>[</span>quotient<span>,</span> remainder<span>]</span>
<span>}</span>

console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>intDiv</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>Here we are just printing the result of a division, but let’s assume we want to handle the two return values individually, how do we <em>reference</em> those?</p>
<p>Well, the return value is an array so we can simply access the two elements in the array using the indices <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> result <span>=</span> <span>intDiv</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>const</span> quotient <span>=</span> result<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span>
<span>const</span> remainder <span>=</span> result<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span>
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Quotient = </span><span><span>${</span>quotient<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span> 
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Remainder = </span><span><span>${</span>remainder<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>This syntax is arguably verbose and definitely not very elegant. Thankfully, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment">ES2015 array destructuring assignment</a> can help us here:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>[</span>quotient<span>,</span> remainder<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>intDiv</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span>
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Quotient = </span><span><span>${</span>quotient<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span> 
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Remainder = </span><span><span>${</span>remainder<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>This is much nicer to read and we also trimmed away 2 out 3 lines of code, big win!</p>
<p>As nice as it is, this implementation has an important shortcoming: return values are positional, so you need to be careful and respect the order while destructuring.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-return-values-with-objects"><a href="#multiple-return-values-with-objects" aria-label="multiple return values with objects permalink"></a>Multiple return values with objects</h3>
<p>An alternative implementation could use objects as return value, let’s see how:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>intDiv</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>dividend<span>,</span> divisor</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> quotient <span>=</span> Math<span>.</span><span>floor</span><span>(</span>dividend <span>/</span> divisor<span>)</span>
  <span>const</span> remainder <span>=</span> dividend <span>%</span> divisor
  <span>return</span> <span>{</span> quotient<span>,</span> remainder <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that here we are using another syntactic sugar from ES2015 (Enhanced object literal syntax) that allows us to define objects very concisely. Prior to ES2015, we would have defined the return statement as <code>{quotient: quotient, remainder: remainder}</code>.</p>
<p>With this approach we will be able to use our <code>intDiv</code> function as follows:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> result <span>=</span> <span>intDiv</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>const</span> quotient <span>=</span> result<span>.</span>quotient
<span>const</span> remainder <span>=</span> result<span>.</span>remainder
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Quotient = </span><span><span>${</span>quotient<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span> 
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Remainder = </span><span><span>${</span>remainder<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>Again, this is a bit too verbose and ES2015 has another fantastic syntactic sugar to make this nicer:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>{</span> quotient<span>,</span> remainder <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>intDiv</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span>
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Quotient = </span><span><span>${</span>quotient<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span> 
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Remainder = </span><span><span>${</span>remainder<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>This syntactic sugar is called <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#Object_destructuring">Object Destructuring Assignment</a>. With this approach we are now independent from the position of return values (we can swap the position of <code>quotient</code> and <code>remainder</code> without side effects). This syntax also lets you rename the destructured variables, which can very useful to avoid name collisions with other local variables, or just to make variable names shorter or more descriptive as we please. Let’s see how this works:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>{</span> remainder<span>:</span> r<span>,</span> quotient<span>:</span> q <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>intDiv</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span>
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Quotient = </span><span><span>${</span>q<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span> 
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Remainder = </span><span><span>${</span>r<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>Here we are not dependent by values position, but by their names in the returned object. If you are designing an API with multiple return values, it’s up to you to figure out which trade off will be the best to guarantee a proper developer experience.</p>
<p>Ok, now you should have a good idea on how to simulate multiple return values in JavaScript. In the next section we will see some more realistic examples that take advantage of this pattern.</p>
<h2 id="some-more-realistic-use-cases"><a href="#some-more-realistic-use-cases" aria-label="some more realistic use cases permalink"></a>Some more realistic use cases</h2>
<p>As mentioned early on, this technique has been recently popularized by React hooks, so we are gonna explore this use case first. Later we will see other two cases related to Async/Await.</p>
<h3 id="react-hooks"><a href="#react-hooks" aria-label="react hooks permalink"></a>React Hooks</h3>
<p>React hooks are a <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html">new feature proposal</a> available from <em>React v16.7.0-alpha</em> that lets you use state and other React features without having to write a class.</p>
<p>The first and most famous React hook present is called <strong>State Hook</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s see how it works with an example, let’s build a CSS color viewer component.</p>
<p>Here’s how our component is going to look like:</p>
<p><img src="https://loige.co/content/4c8fe2a31135971902611822ca2f3df2/css-color-viewer-demo.gif" alt="CssColorViewer React component demo"></p>
<p>And here’s the code used to implement this:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> useState <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'react'</span>

<span>function</span> <span>CssColorViewer</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>cssColor<span>,</span> setCssColor<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>'Blue'</span><span>)</span>
  

  <span>const</span> <span>onCssColorChange</span> <span>=</span> <span>e</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>setCssColor</span><span>(</span>e<span>.</span>target<span>.</span>value<span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>&lt;</span>div<span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span>input value<span>=</span><span>{</span>cssColor<span>}</span> onChange<span>=</span><span>{</span>onCssColorChange<span>}</span> <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span>div
        style<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>{</span>
          width<span>:</span> <span>100</span><span>,</span>
          height<span>:</span> <span>100</span><span>,</span>
          background<span>:</span> cssColor<span>,</span>
        <span>}</span><span>}</span>
      <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>div<span>&gt;</span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can see this component in action and play with the code on <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/9lzyov54lr">CodeSandbox</a>.</p>
<p>For the sake of this article, we are going to focus only on the <code>useState</code> call, but if you are curious to understand better how the hook itself works internally I really recommend you read the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html">official State Hook documentation</a>. I was personally curious to understand how multiple <code>useState</code> calls could maintain the relationship with the specific state attribute (since there’s no explicit labelling or reference). If you are curious about that too, well you should read the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#how-does-react-associate-hook-calls-with-components">Hooks FAQ</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/making-sense-of-react-hooks-fdbde8803889">Dan Abramov’s recent article about Hooks</a>.</p>
<p>Back to the <code>useState</code> call in our example, now!</p>
<p>The <code>useState</code> hook acts like a factory: given a default value for the state property (<code>'Blue'</code> in our case), it will need to instantiate for you 2 things:</p>
<ul>
<li>the current value for the specific state property (<code>cssColor</code> in our case)</li>
<li>a function that allows you to alter the specific property (<code>setCssColor</code> in our case)</li>
</ul>
<p>React developers decided to handle this requirement by simulating multiple return values with an array.</p>
<p>Combining this with array destructuring and proper variable naming, the result is an API that is very nice to read and to use.</p>
<p>This React feature is still very experimental and subject to change at the time of writing, but it already sounds like a big deal for the React community to make the code more expressive and reduce the barrier to entry to start adopting React.</p>
<p>The point I want to make is that, in this specific case, the multiple return values pattern plays a big role towards this goal.</p>
<h3 id="converting-callbacks-api-to-asyncawait"><a href="#converting-callbacks-api-to-asyncawait" aria-label="converting callbacks api to asyncawait permalink"></a>Converting callbacks API to Async/Await</h3>
<p>Recently I found another great use case for the multiple return values pattern while trying to convert a callback oriented API into an equivalent Async/Await API.</p>
<p>To make this part clear, I am going to explain very quickly an approach I use to convert callback based APIs into functions that I can use with Async/Await.</p>
<p>Let’s take this generic example:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>doSomething</span><span>(</span><span>input<span>,</span> callback</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  
  
  
  <span>callback</span><span>(</span>error<span>,</span> response<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To convert this function into something that can be used with Async/Await we have to essentially <a href="https://loige.co/to-promise-or-to-callback-that-is-the-question/"><em>promisify</em></a> it. There are libraries to do it and, if you are using Node.js you can even use the builtin <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_promisify_original"><code>util.promisify</code></a>, but that’s something we can do ourselves by just creating a <em>wrapper</em> function like the following one:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>doSomethingPromise</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>input</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>new</span> <span>Promise</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>resolve<span>,</span> reject</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>doSomething</span><span>(</span>input<span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>error response</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>error<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>reject</span><span>(</span>error<span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>resolve</span><span>(</span>response<span>)</span>
  <span>}</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In short, our wrapper function <code>doSomethingPromise</code> is immediately returning a <code>Promise</code>. Inside the body of the promise we are invoking the original <code>doSomething</code> function with a callback that will be resolving or rejecting the promise based on whether there’s an <code>error</code> or not.</p>
<p>Now we can finally take advantage of Async/Await:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>
<span>const</span> response <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>doSomethingPromise</span><span>(</span>input<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: this will throw in case of error, so make sure you have it in a <code>try/catch</code> block to handle the error correctly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are curious about <em>promisifying</em> callback-based functions, I have <a href="https://loige.co/to-promise-or-to-callback-that-is-the-question/">an entire article</a> dedicated to this topic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my specific use case, I was using a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitter">twitter client</a> library that follows this conventions:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>
client<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'statuses/user_timeline'</span><span>,</span> params<span>,</span> <span>function</span> <span>callback</span>…</code></pre></div></article></div>

  <p>Summer 2020 saw the first completely remote YC batch in history.  My co-founder Peter and I were fortunate enough to participate with our company <a href="https://plummail.co/">Plum Mail</a> and we did so entirely remotely from our homes in South West England.</p>

<p>What was it like you ask?  Essentially, it was like taking an e-learning course. This had a number of benefits for us as a team, which are totally valid, but a number of disadvantages surface as you progress through the process.</p>

<p>The whole YC team did a genuinely amazing job of making the experience hugely valuable, exciting and accessible.  As a founder, your challenge is to step up to the plate and embrace the process if you want to get the most out of it.  Being aware of the disadvantages of the remote batch means you can come up with creative ways to get around them.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this blog will help you feel ready to embrace a remote YC batch, so here’s what doing a remote YC batch is really like.</p>

<h2 id="1-the-interview">1. The Interview</h2>

<p>This is your first remote YC experience.  It’s on a Zoom call that will last around fifteen minutes.  You’re probably feeling nervous and it may be a very weird time of day depending on your time zone.  For us, the interview was at 5pm BST / 9am PST so I had all day to get worked up about it!</p>

<p>For some of our batchmates, calls were at even less convenient times (try midnight) although YC are sensitive to this and will try to accommodate speaking to you at a time that suits everyone on the call.</p>

<p>This combination of timezone conflict and the usual pre-interview nerves are kinda toxic on a video call. You have to work hard to come across as calm, confident and competent.</p>

<p>It felt like sitting in a TV studio waiting to go on air. There is no time for pleasantries as you might expect in person. There is no time for technical errors either. In fact, my internet dropped out at the very end of the call but I only missed a few seconds of the conversation.</p>

<p>I wish deeply that I had gotten used to doing video calls before the interview. Weird as that sounds mid-pandemic, before Covid I had barely done 10 video calls my entire life and now I was doing arguably the most valuable Zoom call I might ever do.</p>

<p>All in all it was quite a stressful experience that I could have aced with some simple steps. Having said that, we were accepted into the batch so it can’t have been that bad.</p>

<h3 id="yc-interview-takeaways">YC Interview Takeaways</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Get comfortable on video calls.  Take a moment to figure out where best for a clean background.  Sit or stand facing a window or other source of light so you don’t look like a shawdow puppet.  Aim for getting your whole head, shoulders and upper body into the shot roughly square on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chill before the call.  The interviewer just wants to have a chat with you about you and your product.  Nervous people tend to ramble.  If you can come across as calm and confident you’ll have a more natural, authentic conversation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Smile. Be yourself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the interview slot is at 2am local time ask them to consider re-arranging it.  No one is their best at 2am, unless you are your best at 2am in which case, I guess 2am is fine. Don’t be afraid to ask nicely if the interview time is massively inconvenient for you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Jazz up your internet connection.  You’ll be doing a lot of video calls if you get into the batch and at remote demo day, a sturdy, fast internet connection is essential so why not start now and have a decent connection for the interview too.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="2-your-remote-working-arrangements">2. Your remote working arrangements</h2>

<p>Peter and I are used to working remote with meetings every so often. However, local restrictions meant we couldn’t always meet up when we needed to.  This definitely created issues for us in terms of communication.  We would try to use instant messenger but found this quickly descended into hours of wasted typing when a phone call or meeting would have been much faster.</p>

<p>Working remote for me also equalled working alone most of the day.  I started out with great focus but would often go astray as my thoughts outpaced my ability to deliver.</p>

<p>This process was compounded during the batch because of the pressure to deliver impressive progress. During the batch you are expected to pull out all the stops to get progress made and I think this is reasonable and exciting.  YC is a once (sometimes twice, rarely three times) in a lifetime opportunity.</p>

<p>Overtime, we got good at working remotely in an efficient and productive way but it took a couple of tries to get it right.</p>

<p>What works for us is a daily catch up call at the same time every day. There is always plenty to talk about and it’s something to hold onto if you’re feeling adrift.  Every Friday we travel and get together (assuming local restrictions allow it) for a strategy day.</p>

<p>Time-boxing strategy talk to Fridays is a very efficient way to timebox ‘big chat’ so that the other four days a week your focus is on actions.</p>

<p>This aspect of the batch experience is probably the most different to an in-person batch where you’re living in a flat with your founders and you eat, sleep, breathe your company.</p>

<p>I’d say it’s totally worth optimising your remote working arrangements so you can make the most of the productive time you have during the batch. The more progress you make, the more you’ll be able to leverage out of the process as the weeks go by.</p>

<h2 id="3-bootcamp">3. Bootcamp</h2>

<p>The first two weeks of remote YC are intense.  Somehow it seemed more intense from the comfort of my own home.  Bootcamp introduces you to an almost overwhelming number of talks and presentations that cover pretty much every aspect of running a startup.</p>

<p>It’s really exciting!  It’s also all on-screen.  Pretty much everything is on video call from here on in.</p>

<p>Each day of bootcamp typically starts with a rousing introduction by a YC partner followed by a series of talks by YC Alum, well-known entrepreneurs or investors and after all of that you are thrust into a video call with a random selection of batchmates to discuss what you just heard.</p>

<p>It all takes around three hours.</p>

<p>The content was all hugely valuable.  Somehow it felt harder to access the value remotely. When you’re watching someone speak live it’s somehow more immersive, over video call I felt disconnected and at times distracted.</p>

<p>However, it is much easier to make notes if you’re sat at a desk listening to the talk rather than trying to jot onto a notepad perched on your knee in a lecture theatre.</p>

<p>And that’s what made the remote bootcamp awesome for me.  I started each talk with a plan to make notes throughout.  This gave me a task to do to keep me interested and the output remains a valuable resource on which to draw.</p>

<p>Some of the insights you pick up might not seem relevant at the time but six months in they suddenly make perfect sense.</p>

<p>If you’re in a non Pacific time zone, like I was, be kind to yourself and take a little time off-screen before the video calls kick in.  Bootcamp will be much easier if you’re feeling fresh and don’t have eye-strain already from an 8 hour day coding.</p>

<p>For me, bootcamp started at 5pm BST so I typically took an hour or so from 4pm away from the computer to get some air, a little food and exercise before the talks began.  A few times I worked through and hopped into bootcamp last minute.  That’s when I felt least engaged largely because I was through with working for the day before the bootcamp had even started.</p>

<h2 id="4-serendipity">4. Serendipity</h2>

<p>It’s not what you know, it’s who you know.  This is true as far as I’m concerned and to be candid, a remote YC batch does not lend itself to chance-encounters and lunch-queue friendships.</p>

<p>Those ‘water cooler moments’ obviously don’t happen so, YC tried to create virtual equivalents of this magic sauce.  This is so important because your batchmates are potential customers, employees, introducers, a shoulder to cry on and someone to celebrate with.</p>

<p>After bootcamp and dinner talks, YC hosts video calls with up to seven participants in each one and you’re dropped randomly into one.  What you get are seven people who don’t know each other but have two things in common: 1, they are a company founder in your batch and 2, they just watched the same talk as you.</p>

<p>At times these were extremely awkward with no one speaking or maybe one person dominating the conversation completely.  However, some of the calls were really engaging and it’s a good chance to get to know a few folks.   Soon enough you make friends and you’ll be setting up video calls for virtual coffee before you can say pumpkin latte.</p>

<p>YC also invited us to participate in random founder pairings in which two founders were randomly introduced to each other and invited to have a 30 minute call.  This resulted in some awesome friendships that continue to add value on a personal and professional level.</p>

<p>These moments of serendipity aren’t really serendipitous at all, they are forced, however, they do a good job of replacing the serendipity where it just isn’t practical to have 400 people in the same room at the moment.</p>

<p>So, embrace it.  Yes it’s slightly forced but approach it with an open mind and an open heart and you’ll be pleasantly surprised.</p>

<h2 id="5-office-hours">5. Office Hours</h2>

<p>Every two weeks we were invited to participate in a video call always with the same group of people for what YC call Group Office Hours.  It’s like group therapy.  You get to know the folks in your group probably more intimately than any of your other batchmates.</p>

<p>Since you’ll be spending a lot of time with these guys on video calls, I would definitely reach out to them outside of office hours to say hello and to allow yourself time to get to know each other.</p>

<p>This really helped me get more out of the office hours.  We’re all probably a little shy around new people but if you get to know everyone better, you’ll be able to access more value from the process faster.  It just requires more effort remotely because you can’t read people so easily.</p>

<h2 id="6-success-and-failure">6. Success and Failure</h2>

<p>Any startup journey is a rollercoaster.  When we enjoyed success …</p></div>

        <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>There’s a reason why change aversion in users is so often spoken about in the world of digital consumerism <span>— </span>human beings love their comfort zones. In the grand scheme of things, we seek out what is familiar to us for a sense of security.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Keeping your software product updated is important, but it’s also important to make sure the perfective changes you make are within the bounds of what your users are familiar and comfortable with.</p>
<p>Now, what kinds of changes might we be referring to?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The types of changes that can be introduced in a software product are changes in infrastructure, functionality, and interface. Among them, interface changes incite the biggest reactions from users. That’s because it’s the most forefront part of a product that they see and interact with <span>— layout, tabs, fonts, colors, buttons, animation, etc</span>.</p>
<p><span>When introducing changes in this aspect of your product, both psychology and history say you should take it slow.</span></p>
<h2><strong>What Psychology Tells Us&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>To discuss why sudden and major UI changes backfire from a psychological point of view, we have to address change aversion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There have been many cases where consumers refused to adapt to a new product, even if it was objectively “better”. One good example would be the introduction of the <a href="https://www.dvorak-keyboard.com/"><span>Dvorak keyboard</span></a> in the 1930s.</p>
<p>Even&nbsp;though the Dvorak keyboard promoted objectively better physical ergonomics, people refused to move from the QWERTY keyboard <span>—</span> simply because they were used to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<h3><strong>Users Want to Feel Smart</strong></h3>
<p>It’s widely taught by UIUX experts like Rohan Puri and Robert Youmans, that users are aversive to change because “change makes them feel dumb”. When using your product, users want to feel in control, like they know what they’re doing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Especially for neurodivergent users, big and sudden changes in UI can be disorienting. When you change things around all at once, you’re also making your users relearn what they’d previously mastered before <span>— and that takes time and energy. In other words, you’re giving them work to do.</span></p>
<p>If you’re an app or web developer, always remember that your users aren’t sitting next to you, watching you iterate and develop from scratch. Your interface may seem simple to you because you’ve familiarized with it as you worked on it, but that’s not the case for them.</p>
<h3><strong>Value is Invisible</strong></h3>
<p>Confirming many real-life cases, a study by Rosman et al on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262411663_On_user_behaviour_adaptation_under_interface_change"><span>user behaviour adaptation under interface change</span></a> found that it takes many tries for a user to feel comfortable enough with an interface that was initially unfamiliar to them, before they “conﬁdently choose it and realise the potential beneﬁts”.</p>
<p>Because the bulk of your revamp’s value is neither visible nor instantly detectable, more impatient users might poorly estimate the efﬁciency of your improved UI and “prematurely abandon it” in that particular time frame.</p>
<p>After all, if they don’t see an increase in value, why would they like that you changed what was already working for them?</p>
<h2><strong>What History Tells Us</strong></h2>
<p>Negative feedback from a large number of users can spread like wildfire on social media. Needless to say, that can be really detrimental to your brand and product.</p>
<p>If you’re a startup just starting out with a small user base, you have more leeway for major UI redesigns while you figure out your brand and voice. As your product grows, however, so does the need to prioritize your users’ preferences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some companies with really big user bases learned the hard way so we don’t have to.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>What Happened with Digg</strong></h3>
<p>In 2010, Digg, a news aggregate site very much like reddit, launched a redesign that caused them to lose 35% of their users nearly instantly.</p>
<p>In the Digg v4 update, the site was heavily revamped visually and functionally. Among many of the sudden changes, the downvote button was removed, users could no longer save posts to favorites or posts videos,&nbsp; their Upcoming page was gone, and the overall focus was shifted from user-submitted content to publisher-submitted content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This major change didn’t just disorient their users. It took control away from them. With the new system, posts by publishers and sponsors flooded the front page, while posts by regular users were practically invisible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The result of this? A mass exodus. Users either flooded the site with protest links (many of which were links to Reddit, their biggest competitor) or immediately migrated to Reddit.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>What Happened with eBay</strong></h3>
<p>Once, eBay decided to change the background color of many of their site’s pages from bright yellow to white. Even though this change may seem like an obvious aesthetic choice today, it caused a ruckus on the internet (and in the team’s mailbox) when it first happened, forcing them to revert to yellow.</p>
<p>eBay didn’t give up on their vision, though. They came up with a strategy to go subtle, and designed an algorithm that faded the background from yellow to white, one shade at a time, over a few months. This time, the internet was still. The change was taking place so gradually that their users didn’t notice it was happening.</p>
<h2><strong>How Do You Safely Revamp?</strong></h2>
<p>Now that storytime is over, let’s talk about what we can learn from them. How can you revamp your product while being wary of change aversion?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously, getting complaints from users doesn’t mean you should stop updating your app or website. <span>M</span>aintenance is necessary for your product to thrive and continue thriving.<span> The secret lies in </span><em><span>how</span></em><span> you execute it.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Change Little and Often</strong></h3>
<p>Instead of giving your users a whole new interface to relearn at one go, introduce a little change at a time. Habits take time to unlearn. Giving users one small redirection at a time is a lot less disorienting and burdensome for them.</p>
<h3><strong>Give Users a Heads-up&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>Before you launch your redesign, give users time to prepare for it. This will dampen the impact of the launch and reduce the risk of shocking them into frustration with your product.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Spell Out the Values</strong></h3>
<p>As mentioned before, values are invisible. Users don’t always immediately see the benefits of your new interface when they first try it. Instead of waiting for them to figure the maze out on their own, give them the lowdown on how the changes you’ve implemented are designed to solve the problems they face.</p>
<h3><strong>Provide Guidance</strong></h3>
<p>Part of spelling out the values of your redesign is by easing your users’ transition to your new interface. When you provide tutorials and demonstratives, you’re also teaching them how the new design improves their experience on your app or website.</p>
<h3><strong>Provide Options</strong></h3>
<p>It’s always good to give your users the option to switch back to the old interface. Provide them a toggle switch or button to revert to the old version, and place it somewhere easily accessible.</p>
<h3><strong>Welcome Feedback</strong></h3>
<p>Give your users an outlet or channel through which they can directly communicate with your team. Whether it’s a form on your website, or simply an email address they can write to specifically for complaints and feedback, it’s always good to let your users know that you’re listening.</p>

	<p>Earlier this year I tried to create my own tablet operating system by installing Debian GNU/Linux on a Microsoft Surface Go tablet. I learned a great deal about what I like about tablets. But I still preferred my iPad Pro, mainly because of its polished user experience. This time I set out to refine my tablet software to replace my iPad.</p>

Apparently, many of you are looking for an alternative for the locked down operating systems that are usually installed on tablets (like iPadOS, Android or Windows 10S). </p><h4>Microsoft Surface hardware and Linux</h4><p>As history is full of sweet irony, it’s Microsoft that actually makes some pretty handsome hardware that works well with Linux. Their Surface line-up includes different laptops and tablets. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SurfaceLinux/" title="“SurfaceLinux”" target="_blank">“SurfaceLinux”</a> reddit page is is full of interesting user stories worth checking out.

In order to make things<i> really</i> simple, you need to seamlessly integrate hardware and software. Apple does this well, iPad Pro provides a great user experience because:</p><ul><li><b>continue where you’ve left</b>: it saves everything when you put it in a <a href="https://willem.com/blog/2018-12-22_business-in-a-bag/" title="bag" target="_blank">bag</a>, being (instantly) ready to continue when you take it out.

My first tablet OS required a lot of manual interaction and was therefore cumbersome in comparison to iPad Pro. </p><h3>Second attempt: Surface Go 2</h3><p>Microsoft released a new Surface Go tablet this year, the Surface Go 2. It has a faster processor (up to 64%!), thinner bezels and an improved screen. It is a very descent upgrade that puts the Surface Go 2 much more on par with the 11-inch iPad Pro in hardware terms.

I know that the conventional PC concept of managing distinct application Windows doesn’t provide the best user experience on a small tablet computer. Therefore I decided to try a tiling window manager: <a href="https://i3wm.org/" title="i3wm" target="_blank">i3wm</a>.</p><h4>Tiling window manager</h4><p>The principle of a tiling window manager is simple: apps take up as much space as there is available. This means that if you run just one app, it will be full screen. Two apps run split screen, etc, etc. You can define rules that automate the arrangement of apps. Using keyboard shortcuts you can quickly switch between apps.

This enables many different combinations of apps. This is really where the i3wm window manager is<i> much</i> better than iPadOS’s take on multi tasking. </p><p>The i3wm window manager supports external monitors very well, using the same concept of a workspace. You simply designate one or multiple workspaces to be shown on the extra/external screen. This works well with the Surface Dock and USB-C-to-HDMI accessories for Surface. Multi monitor support is really great. </p><a name="Three finger swipe to switch workspaces - a trick from macOS - using fusuma you can use multi touch gestures in i3wm" title="Three finger swipe to switch workspaces - a trick from macOS - using fusuma you can use multi touch gestures in i3wm" href="https://willem.com/blog/2020-09-28_refining-my-tablet-os-experience/images/i_07_Three-finger-swipe-to-switch-workspaces-a-trick-from-macOS-using-fusuma-you-can-use-multi-touch-gestures-in-i3wm_3000px.jpg"><figure><img alt="Three finger swipe to switch workspaces - a trick from macOS - using fusuma you can use multi touch gestures in i3wm" src="https://willem.com/blog/2020-09-28_refining-my-tablet-os-experience/images/i_07_Three-finger-swipe-to-switch-workspaces-a-trick-from-macOS-using-fusuma-you-can-use-multi-touch-gestures-in-i3wm_500px.jpg" srcset="https://willem.com/blog/2020-09-28_refining-my-tablet-os-experience/images/i_07_Three-finger-swipe-to-switch-workspaces-a-trick-from-macOS-using-fusuma-you-can-use-multi-touch-gestures-in-i3wm_500px.jpg 500w,

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
    
        <div><p><b>Stockholm - October 28, 2020</b> – Starting today, customers across Sweden can visit Amazon.se to shop from a selection of over 150m products, with the benefit of everyday low prices and reliable free delivery for eligible orders above SEK 229. Amazon.se features a vast selection of products across more than 30 categories, such as Books, Consumer Electronics, Sports and Outdoor, Tools and Home Improvement, Toys and Baby, including products from thousands of European and local Swedish businesses.</p><p>“We are thrilled to launch Amazon.se and to be able to offer Swedish customers a selection of more than 150 million products, including tens of thousands of products from local Swedish businesses,” said Alex Ootes, Vice President, European Expansion for Amazon. “Today is only the start of Amazon.se. We will continue to work hard to earn the trust of Swedish customers by growing our product range, ensuring low prices, and providing a convenient and trusted shopping experience.”</p><p>Swedish customers can conveniently shop from anywhere, any time with no-hassle returns and Swedish customer service through the Amazon Shopping app and desktop and mobile browsers. All customers shopping on Amazon.se enjoy free delivery for millions of items on eligible orders over SEK 229. Customers can easily browse the growing selection, read customer reviews, view personalized recommendations, create wish lists and track their orders.</p><p>Amazon is offering a wide variety of products from local Swedish brands, as well as big brand favorites. Customers can find great prices on products offered by Swedish brands like Electrolux, Lagerhaus, OBH Nordica, Ellos, BRIO, Bonnierförlagen and Ifö, as well as international brands like ASUS, Mattel, Hasbro, LEGO and Bosch.</p><p><b><em>Amazon.se offers growth opportunities for Swedish businesses – big and small</em></b><br>With the launch of Amazon.se, it will be easier for Swedish businesses to sell their products on Amazon, reach more customers and expand. Amazon has invested billions of dollars in infrastructure and technical services that help small and medium-sized businesses reach new customers across Sweden and around the world, including simple listing tools that support all seven European Amazon stores, enabling easy expansion within Europe, as well as 24/7 online Selling Partner support, open and transparent selling conditions and pricing, and reports and analytics tools to help them grow. As a result of this investment there are now 1.7 million small and medium-sized businesses around the world selling in Amazon’s stores, with more than 200,000 entrepreneurs worldwide who surpassed $100,000 in sales on Amazon in 2019.</p><p>“Today, thousands of European and local selling partners are offering their products on Amazon.se and on our other Amazon stores across the EU as well as in the US. We are excited for our international customers to experience and enjoy this Swedish selection and help grow these businesses with every purchase they make”, says Alex Ootes. “Small and medium sized companies selling in Amazon stores created an estimate 1.6 million jobs worldwide and we hope to see Swedish companies prosper in the same way.”</p><p>Pierre Magnusson, Head of E-commerce at N!CK’S, the Swedish healthy snack business, said: “The opportunities on Amazon are enormous. Amazon has grown to become our most important channel for exports, and within the first months of working with Amazon we were cash flow positive. N!CK'S continues to grow and has become one of the best-selling brands within our category, and we are still seeing 50% year-on-year growth in the EU Amazon stores alone. I would definitely recommend more Swedish companies start selling on Amazon.”</p><p>Elisabet Sandström, CEO of Miss Mary of Sweden AB, a manufacturer of high quality lingerie, said: “Amazon is an important channel for our expansion in Europe and the US, and we now look forward to selling through the Swedish Store when Amazon opens in our home country. Our sales on Amazon have increased steadily by over 50% per year, and Amazon is our fastest growing channel. Germany is currently Miss Mary’s largest customer base, and when we entered Amazon.de we noticed an immediate sales increase. We now appreciate the opportunity to reach new Swedish customers and make them happy.”</p><p><b><em>Investment in Sweden for a Sustainable Future</em></b><br>The launch of Amazon.se comes weeks after Amazon announced its largest investment in renewable energy outside of the US, with the launch (10/15) of the 91-megawatt Bäckhammar project in Western Sweden. It will support Amazon Web Services (AWS) data centers in the country, as well as the expanding Amazon retail business, and is expected to deliver 280,000-megawatt hours of clean energy annually into the Swedish grid - the equivalent of powering 29,000 average homes in Sweden. The Bäckhammar project is<em> </em>the first of two Amazon renewable energy projects to come online in Sweden. The second, a 122-megawatt onshore windfarm in Västernorrland, currently in construction, is expected to commence operations in 2022. In total, these projects will add 213 megawatts of new clean energy to the Swedish grid.</p><p>These launches takes Amazon one step closer to meeting its <span><span><a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/about/the-climate-pledge#section-nav-id-1" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">Climate Pledge commitments</a></span></span> of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2040, ten years ahead of the Paris Agreement. This will be achieved through powering its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025, making all Amazon shipments net zero carbon through Shipment Zero, with 50% of all shipments net zero carbon by 2030; ordering over 100,000 electric delivery vehicles; and investing $2 billion to support the development of technologies and services that reduce carbon emissions and help preserve the natural world.</p><p><b><em>About Amazon</em></b><br>Amazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations, Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, and Alexa are some of the products and services pioneered by Amazon.

<p>I remember writing software in the period roughly between 2005 and 2015 where sometimes it could feel like every week something new was thrown at us. We were transitioning from desktop to the web and then cloud and mobile. We were just getting good at Object-oriented programming when a shift towards Functional Programming required us to rethink our mental models around our code. Cloud scale computing brought us from solely using SQL databases to study and use NoSQL databases. We went from embracing XML and SOAP to transitioning to JSON.</p>
<div><p><h3>Focus on your customers, on business value and the developer experience. Do more, and keep things simple.</h3></p></div>

<p>Looking at JavaScript alone there was also a lot of turmoil. The language started almost as a toy language to glue together simple elements on a web page. Then it slowly but steadily grew into becoming the most widely used programming language on the web. It even moved on beyond the browser and started to conquer the server with Node.js. A realm where Java and .NET were dominant before, now had to create some room for people starting to use JavaScript on the server.</p>
<p>On the web, framework after framework was becoming popular. Much to the point where they are still being refactored away ten years later. I remember moving from jQuery to Backbone or Knockout. I used Ember a bit and then also Angular. All of these seemed to offer some improvements over what was previously there. There were still enough rough edges however. It was clear we were not there yet.</p>
<div id="enter-the-calm-and-how-we-used-the-sjgar-stack-for-the-first-time"><h3><a href="#enter-the-calm-and-how-we-used-the-sjgar-stack-for-the-first-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="enter the calm and how we used the sjgar stack for the first time permalink"></a>Enter the Calm and how we used the SJGAR stack for the first time.</h3></div>
<p>In 2015, I got the chance to work on a corporate startup project that was completely greenfield. We set out to create a platform with web and mobile apps with state-of-the-art user experience, and we wanted to fail or succeed fast. This meant we had to ensure a short time to market. We had to focus on developer experience and productivity. After having tried some pieces of technology on smaller projects, this was the perfect chance to put them together and figure out if they would play nicely together. In theory, it should all work, but previous experience had shown that you really need to start using them for a decent amount of time to figure out if the new advantages will really outweigh the drawbacks.</p>
<div><p><h3>It worked. It really worked.</h3></p></div>
<p>We built a web application using React and an accompanying mobile app using React Native. The backend was built using AWS Serverless technologies. We used DynamoDB as the single source of truth for data. The built-in event triggering system was used to run some Node.js code in a Lambda to stream this data to a managed Elasticsearch cluster, so we could support the search and query capabilities we needed. We created a GraphQL API using the reference server implementation graphql-js (Apollo Server and Client weren't a thing back then). Again this was run in Lambda. To make sure the web application was performant enough for our end users we used a Lambda to implement Server Side Rendering (Gatsby and Next.js also weren't a thing back then). We also used the Serverless framework, a bit shaky at that time, to write our infra as code.</p>
<p>With a handful of full stack engineers we were able to deliver this project successfully to production. We could deliver new versions of our microservices independently, and we would do this multiple times a day.</p>
<p>It worked. It really worked.</p>
<p>We started with almost zero costs for infrastructure. The most expensive service was the Elasticsearch service. The other services would easily service our first customers on the free tier. I think we never spent over 100 euros a month. Without Elasticsearch it would probably not have been higher than 10 euros a month. We launched and started running ad campaigns to lure customers to our new offering. For these ad campaigns we were spending over a thousand euros per month. It was clear that we now could go to the business and tell them we could do innovation projects with IT running costs of close to zero.</p>
<p>I remember we were able to move some logic from the web app to the authentication provider (we used Auth0 back then since Cognito was still a bit too new) by just copying some JavaScript code. Similarly, we were able to move code from frontend to backend. More generally we were able to take what we learned in a certain context, and apply it to a different one. JavaScript allowed us to learn a single programming language and write code for the Web, Mobile and Cloud. React allowed us to use a single framework to structure applications and do the state management for both Web and Mobile. Using Flexbox we could even apply the same UI layout system in these apps. With the complex and time-consuming nature of layout work, it was great that we were able to reuse our knowledge and tools to enjoy a great productivity boost.</p>
<p>Going Serverless meant we did not have to spend time on managing servers. The code and the system would just work. No disks filling up, no security patches to be applied, no certificates to be updated. AWS had given us a platform with great performance and stability. Everything would just run.</p>
<p>After running this project in 2015 and 2016, in the end it was shuttered because it did not align with our business goals. Only later I came to realize this set of technologies would stand the test of time, and would do so pretty well.</p>
<div id="okay-this-thing-needs-a-name"><h3><a href="#okay-this-thing-needs-a-name" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="okay this thing needs a name permalink"></a>Okay. This Thing Needs A Name.</h3></div>
<p>Fast-forward a bit to when I joined my current team and company early 2019. We formed a new innovation department and dreamed of a future where we helped turn our 175-year-old financial company into a fintech. Teaming up with the department that was our business counterpart, in the first year we built and delivered a total of fourteen projects with a relatively common two pizza team. In the previous nineteen years of my career I had never witnessed anything like this. We built smaller projects like landing pages, but also large ones like a new platform to sell houses using data and AI. We also built a fairly complex API to serve as the backend for an IoT driven car insurance. We even managed to surprise ourselves and win a hackathon in our first year with a mobile app for planting trees.</p>
<div><p><h3>Five years after having first used this set of technologies it was clear that they still were around. Not only were they still around, they had become even stronger with a bigger community supporting them.</h3></p></div>
<p>Many things fell into place to make this a success. For one, it were the amazing people we joined. I consider myself lucky to this day that we met them and were able to make all of these things happen. It was almost as if we started in a performing phase as a team, skipping the forming, norming and storming phases altogether.</p>
<p>Besides the people the technology played an important role here. Five years after having first used this set of technologies it was clear that they still were around. Not only were they still around, they had become even stronger with a bigger community supporting them.</p>
<p>What was really cool was that we were able to deliver all these different types of applications using basically the same architecture. For the IoT insurance, the API we delivered we implemented a lightweight event sourced system using mainly DynamoDB and Lambda. We later added a future event system where we combined DynamoTTL and Step Functions to combine high and low resolution timers, all of which were inspired by a set of blog posts and a tweet we found on the web.</p>
<p>For the housing platform we combined Cognito, Azure AD, DynamoDB, Lambda, AppSync, S3 and CloudFront to deliver a platform that was highly performant. Gatsby helped us leverage React’s power to build statically rendered, SEO-friendly pages, hosted on S3 and made available to the wide internet using CloudFront and Route53. On the backend we created a GraphQL API to, on the one hand, power the build-time data requirements. On the other hand it also powered the real-time admin panel we needed for providing customers support.</p>
<p>There were many more projects that used very similar architectures. Five years after first having used these technologies we were still able to use them to build modern applications. In our hiring process I remember seeing the smiles on the faces of the engineers when we would mention our tech stack.</p>
<div><p><h3>Which parts are going to be successful for at least the next five years?</h3></p></div>
<p>There was this one thing I noticed though. Whenever I wanted to explain our technology stack, I was summing up this combination of technologies one by one. Time after time saying things like “Our stack is JavaScript based, uses the React ecosystem and runs on AWS Serverless... And oh yeah we use GraphQL as a BFF for our apps.” A couple of days later I would say something like “We build apps using React and use JavaScript/TypeScript. Our APIs are running on AWS Lambda using NodeJS.”. And then many more variations of these sentences.</p>
<p>Okay. This thing needs a name.</p>
<p>Back in the days we had the LAMP stack, and some time after that there was the MEAN stack. Acronyms that became part of our vocabulary to help explain the stack we were using, or even inspired greenfield projects to combine these technologies. People would think, hey, I recently have been hearing a lot of buzz around the MEAN …</p></div></div></div>

<![CDATA[Using an AWS ECR Image as a GitHub Action Container]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
        <h2 id="moving-from-docker-hub-to-ecr">Moving from Docker Hub to ECR</h2>

<p><a href="https://pubstack.io/">Pubstack</a>, my current client decided to migrate all its docker images to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/">ECR</a>.</p>

<p>With the recent <a href="https://www.docker.com/pricing/resource-consumption-updates">announcement</a> about rate limiting on Docker Hub, maybe we will not be the only ones moving away.</p>

<p>For our <strong>CI/CD</strong> pipelines we use both <a href="https://circleci.com/">CircleCI</a> and <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>.</p>

<p>Using an <strong>ECR</strong> image is a really simple task in <strong>CircleCI</strong>, it consists of adding the <code>aws_auth</code> to the image configuration.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  <span>docker</span><span>:</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>image</span><span>:</span> <span>ACCOUNT.dkr.ecr.REGION.amazonaws.com/IMAGE:VERSION</span>
      <span>aws_auth</span><span>:</span>
        <span>aws_access_key_id</span><span>:</span> <span>$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</span>
        <span>aws_secret_access_key</span><span>:</span> <span>$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On the other hand, using <strong>ECR</strong> images in <strong>GitHub Actions</strong> was a bit more tricky.</p>

<p>The problem is, you could only use images from private registries in job and service containers since <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2020-09-24-github-actions-private-registry-support-for-job-and-service-containers/">late september</a>, and they only did the “credentials” implementation.
It means something like this is expected:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>jobs</span><span>:</span>
  <span>test</span><span>:</span>
    <span>runs-on</span><span>:</span> <span>ubuntu-latest</span>
    <span>container</span><span>:</span>
      <span>image</span><span>:</span> <span>ACCOUNT.dkr.ecr.REGION.amazonaws.com/IMAGE:VERSION</span>
      <span>credentials</span><span>:</span>
        <span>username</span><span>:</span> <span>AWS</span>
        <span>password</span><span>:</span> <span>${{ secrets.ECR_PASSWORD }}</span>
    <span>steps</span><span>:</span>
      <span>-</span> <span>run</span><span>:</span> <span>echo "inside an ecr container"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With aws, you can get a password with <code>aws ecr get-login-password</code>, and it is valid 12 hours.</p>

<p>You can manually set the GitGub secret “ECR_PASSWORD” every 12 hours, but that’s not really convenient.</p>

<p>After a little digging, I found an <a href="https://github.community/t/github-actions-new-pulling-from-private-docker-repositories/16089/28">answer</a> on a GitHub community thread explaining what seems like a good solution.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Basically what we will do is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Retrieve <strong>ECR</strong> password from aws</li>
  <li>Store it as a <strong>GitHub</strong> secret name <code>ECR_PASSWORD</code></li>
</ol>

<p>All that inside a <strong>GitHub</strong> action scheduled to run every 6 hours.</p>

<p>It was not really as simple as I first thought, so here is all I had to do.
I hope it can help you.</p>

<p>First, I created some aws credentials (ie. a couple <code>aws_access_key_id</code> and <code>aws_secret_access_key</code> with enough right to pull from ECR)
I put them as secrets inside the <strong>GitHub</strong> project, let’s call them <code>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</code> and <code>AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</code>.
Then I generated a personal access token (the “provided by default” <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> doest not have sufficient rights), let’s call it <code>GH_API_ACCESS_TOKEN</code>.</p>

<p>The complete <strong>GitHub</strong> workflow:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>ecr-login</span>
<span>on</span><span>:</span>
  <span># Every 6 hours, the password validity is 12 hours</span>
  <span>schedule</span><span>:</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>cron</span><span>:</span>  <span>'</span><span>0</span><span> </span><span>*/6</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>*'</span>

      <p>Oct 27, 2020</p>

      <p>
	In my <a href="https://zinascii.com/2020/the-amd64-fbt-handler.html">previous
	post</a> I described how FBT intercepts function calls and
	vectors them into the DTrace framework. That laid the
	foundation for what I want to dicuss in this post: the
	implementation of the <code>stack()</code> action and
	built-in <code>arg</code> variables. These features rely on
	the precise layout of the stack, the details of which I
	touched on previously. In this post I hope to illuminate those
	details a bit more with the help of some visuals, and then
	guide you through the implentation of these two DTrace
	features as they relate to the FBT provider.
      </p>

      <h2>A Correction</h2>

      <p>
	But first I must make a correction to my last post. It turns
	out the FBT handler <b>does not</b> execute on the IST stack.
	It runs on either the thread’s stack or the CPU’s high-level
	interrupt stack depending on the context of the kernel
	function call, but never on the IST.
	Rather, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_page-table_isolation">KPTI</a>
	uses the IST stack as a scratch space to perform its
	trampoline into the real handler. This little detail is
	important. Functions like <code>dtrace_getpcstack()</code>
	have zero chance of working if run with the IST stack, for
	reasons which become obvious later. This also explains why the
	AMD64 handler pulls down the stack
	during <code>pushq&nbsp;%RBP</code> emulation: if it’s working
	on the same stack as the thread/interrupt, then it must make
	room for <code>RBP</code>. I can explain better with a visual.
	First, the diagram from the last post.
      </p>

      <figure>
	  
	  <figcaption><a name="fig1-int3-pre-handler">Figure 1. INT3 thread/interrupt state pre-handler</a></figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
	On the left we have a kernel thread, interrupt thread, or
	high-level interrupt running on CPU. On the right we have the
	“interrupt context” of the breakpoint exception, using the
	IST. The image is correct in that there are two different
	stacks in play, but what’s running on the right-hand side is
	not the <code>brktrap</code> handler. The right-hand side is
	running the KPTI trampoline, ensuring a CR3 switch when moving
	between the user/kernel boundary. The trampoline also provides
	a facsimile of the processor frame to the interrupted thread’s
	stack, making it none the wiser that KPTI was ever on the
	scene. So all the action happens on the left side, but what
	does the stack look like as we transition through the #BP
	handler on our way to <code>dtrace_invop()</code>?
      </p>

      <figure>
	  
	  <figcaption><a name="fig2-pre-fbt-stack">Figure 2. stack state from #BP to pre dtrace_invop()</a></figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
	In phase ① <code>mac_provider_tx()</code> is
	calling <code>mac_ring_tx()</code> while it is under FBT entry
	instrumentation. The last thing on the thread’s stack is the
	return address, and the CPU is about to execute
	the <code>int3</code> instruction.
      </p>

      <p>
	Phase ② is immediately after the CPU has finished execution of
	the <code>int3</code> instruction. The processor (via the
	spectre of the KPTI trampoline) has pushed a 16-byte aligned
	processor frame on the stack and has vectored into
	the <code>brktrap()</code> handler.
      </p>

      <p>
	Phase ③ is after some amount of execution of
	the <code>brktrp()</code> and <code>invoptrap()</code>
	handlers—remember, the #BP handler for DTrace mimics a #UD.
	This last phase shows the state just before the call
	to <code>dtrace_invop()</code>. At this point we’ve grown an
	entire <code>regs</code> structure on the stack and stashed a
	copy of the return address on top of this. The later used to
	populate <code>cpu_dtrace_caller</code>, a variable which
	becomes important later.
      </p>

      <h2>The stack() Action</h2>

      <p>
	The separation of probes and actions is a vital aspect of
	DTrace’s architecture. A firm boundary between these two makes
	DTrace more powerful than it ever could be if they were
	tightly coupled. Think about it, I can ask for the call stack
	in any probe, not just the probes that deem that information
	useful. The probes give you access to a context, and the
	actions give you access to data in that context. To limit the
	execution of actions to specific probes would limit the
	questions you can ask about the system. With this design the
	number of questions you can ask is virtually endless. And it
	turns out one of the more useful questions to ask is: “what
	the hell is running on my CPU”?
      </p>

      <p>
	The <code>stack()</code> action allows you to record the call
	stack that lead to the probe site. In the context of FBT this
	will record the call stack of the kernel thread or interrupt
	executing an entry or return from this kernel function. You
	can also access the userland stack of a thread
	via <code>ustack()</code>, but I don’t cover that here.
      </p>

      <p>
	The <code>stack()</code> action is implemented by
	the <code>dtrace_getpcstack()</code> function. To get there
	from <code>dtrace_invop()</code> requires a couple of more
	calls in the DTrace framework. Ultimately, the call stack to
	get there looks like this.
      </p>

      <p>
	The implementation of <code>stack()</code> really starts
	with <code>DTRACEACT_STACK</code> inside
	of <code>dtrace_probe()</code>.

      <p>
	The first argument is the address of the array used to store
	program counter values (aka function pointers). This array
	starts at some offset into the current DTrace buffer. The
	second argument if the size of that array. The third argument
	is the number of “artificial frames” on the stack, more on
	this later. The fourth argument is used to determine if the
	first (topmost) program counter in the call stack is the value
	passed in <code>arg0</code> to <code>dtrace_probe()</code>. An
	“anchored” probe is one that has a function name specified
	when calling <code>dtrace_probe_create()</code>. For example,
	the FBT provider uses the name of the kernel function as the
	probe’s function name, thus it is anchored on the kernel
	function. The profile provider, however, specifies no probe
	function name; it is not anchored and is a bit of a special
	case. I address this at the end of the post.
      </p>

      <p>
	This brings us to the <code>dtrace_getpcstack()</code>
	function. But first I’ll expand
	on <a href="#fig2-pre-fbt-stack">figure 2</a> to show our
	stack state as of source line 60 of the function.

      <p>
	To build the call stack we first need to be able to walk the
	stack. Luckily, illumos keeps frame pointers in the kernel,
	making this easy. But in this particular situation there is
	more to consider. First, we might have two stacks in play: the
	high-level interrupt’s stack as well as the stack of the
	thread it interrupted. Second, the DTrace framework and FBT
	provider have put their own frames between this code and the
	function that tripped this probe; we must exclude these
	“artificial” frames from the result. Finally, we need to make
	sure not to walk off the stack and into space, both for
	correctness and safety. Speaking of the stack,
	the <code>stacktop</code> variable is pointing to the “top” of
	the stack in terms of memory (on x86 stacks grow downwards).
	Logically speaking, <code>stacktop</code> is the bottom of the
	stack and the <code>dtrace_getpcstack()</code> frame is the
	top.

	The main loop walks the call stack and fills in program
	counters as long as there are slots remaining in
	<code>pcstack</code>. If we were in the context of a
	high-level interrupt and we’ve walked off its stack, then hop
	to the thread stack. Otherwise, we’ve walked off the thread
	stack, leaving just this last frame to record.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/riaa-blitz-takes-down-18-github-projects-used-for-downloading-youtube-videos/">GitHub took down the repository</a> for the youtube-dl project. This came in response to a request from the RIAA—the recording industry’s lobbying and harassment body. youtube-dl is a tool for downloading videos. The RIAA argued that this violates the anticircumvention protections of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). While GitHub taking down the repository and its forks is true to the principle of minimizing corporate risk, it’s the wrong choice.</p>



<p> Microsoft—currently the world’s second-most valuable company with a market capitalization of $1.64 trillion—owns GitHub. If anyone is in a position to fight back on this, it’s Microsoft. Microsoft’s lawyers should have a one word answer to the RIAA’s request: “no”. <em>(full disclosure: I own a small number of shares of Microsoft)</em></p>



<h2>The procedural argument</h2>



<p>The first reason to tell the RIAA where to stick it is procedural. The RIAA isn’t arguing that youtube-dl is infringing its copyrights or circumventing its protections. It is arguing that youtube-dl infringes YouTube’s protections. So even if it is, that’s YouTube’s problem, not the RIAA’s.</p>



<h2>The factual argument</h2>



<p>I have some sympathy for the anticircumvention argument. I’m not familiar with the specifics of how youtube-dl works, but it’s at least possible that youtube-dl circumvents YouTube’s copy protection. This would be a reasonable basis for YouTube to take action. Again, YouTube, not the RIAA.</p>



<p>I have less sympathy for the infringement argument. youtube-dl doesn’t induce infringement more than a web browser or screen recorder does. There are a variety of uses for youtube-dl that are not infringing. Foremost is the fact that some YouTube videos are under a license that explicitly allows sharing and remixing. Archivers use it to archive content. Some people who have time-variable Internet billing use it to download videos overnight.</p>



<p>So, yes, youtube-dl can be used to infringe the RIAA’s copyrights. It can also be used for non-infringing purposes. The code itself does not infringe. There’s nothing about it that gives the RIAA a justification to take it down.</p>



<h2>youtube-dl isn’t the whole story</h2>



<p>youtube-dl provides a focal point, but there’s more to it. Copyright law is now used to suppress instead of promote creative works. The DMCA, in particular, favors the large rightsholders over smaller developers and creators. It essentially forces sites to act on a “guilty until proven innocent” model. Companies in a position to push back have an obligation to do so. Microsoft has become a supporter of open source, now it’s time to show they mean it.</p>



<p>We should also consider the risks of consolidation. git is a decentralized system. GitHub has essentially centralized it. Sure, many competitors exist, but GitHub has become the default place to host open source code projects. The fact that GitHub’s code is proprietary is immaterial to this point. A FOSS service would pose the same risk if it became the centralized service.</p>



<p>I saw a quote on this discussion (which I can’t find now) that said “code is free, infrastructure is not.” And while projects self-hosting their code repository, issue tracker, etc may be philosophically appealing, that’s not realistic. Software-as-a-Service has lowered the barrier for starting projects, which is a good thing. But it doesn’t come without risk, which we are now seeing.</p>



<p>I don’t know what the right answer is for this. I know the answer won’t be easy. But both this specific case and the general issues they highlight are important for us to think about.</p>

				<h3 id="pants-2-0-0-the-first-stable-release-of-the-pants-v2-open-source-build-system-is-out-now-">Pants 2.0.0, the first stable release of the Pants v2 open-source build system, is out now!</h3><p>There are so many tools in the Python development ecosystem. You might use <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/">pip</a> to resolve dependencies, <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/">pytest</a> to run tests, <a href="https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/">flake8</a> and <a href="https://www.pylint.org/">pylint</a> for lint checks, <a href="https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">black</a> and <a href="https://pycqa.github.io/isort/">isort</a> for auto-formatting, <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a> for type checking, <a href="https://ipython.org/">IPython</a> or <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> for interactive sessions, <a href="https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">setuptools</a>, <a href="https://pex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">pex</a> or <a href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a> for packaging, <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">protocol buffers</a> for code generation, and many more. Not to mention any custom tooling you've built for your repo. </p><p>Installing, configuring and orchestrating the invocation of these tools<strong>—</strong>all while not re-executing work unnecessarily<strong>—</strong>is a hard problem, especially as your codebase grows. The lack of a robust, scalable build system for Python has been a problem for a long time, and this has become even more acute in recent years, with Python codebases increasing in size and complexity. </p><p>Fortunately, there is now a tailor-made (pun intended) solution: <strong>Pants v2</strong>!</p><p><a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/">Pants v2</a> is designed from the ground-up for fast, consistent builds. Some noteworthy features include:</p><ul><li>Minimal metadata and boilerplate</li><li>Fine-grained workflow</li><li>Shared result caching</li><li>Concurrent execution</li><li>A responsive, scalable UI</li><li>Unified interface for multiple tools and languages</li><li>Extensibility and customizability via a plugin API</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.pantsbuild.org/content/images/2020/10/render1603750306032.gif" alt=""><figcaption>Pants running multiple linters in parallel</figcaption></figure><p>Read on to learn more about Pants v2, and what it means for your Python codebase.</p><hr><h2 id="a-little-history">A little history</h2><p>We started the original open-source Pants project back in 2011. At the time, we were frustrated by slow, flaky Scala builds. The leading strategy for scaling was to hand each developer a RAM stick and a screwdriver... Surely this was a problem we could tackle with software! Thus Pants v1 was born. </p><p>Pants v1 was quite successful, and was adopted at cutting-edge tech companies such as Twitter, Foursquare, Square and others. But we still weren't satisfied: The APIs were clunkier than we would have liked, the UI was overly chatty, caching was hard to get right, and concurrent execution had to be special-cased. We knew there were plenty of performance and stability improvements to be had, if we could only unlock them. </p><p>We learned a lot from our years of work on Pants v1, and knew that we could design something new and better, leaning on our experience with v1 while addressing the drawbacks of that system. Luckily, at the same time as we began thinking about this hypothetical next system, a new motivating problem emerged: Python builds.</p><h2 id="python-builds-today">Python builds today</h2><p>As you probably know, Python has skyrocketed in popularity in recent years. Not only is it used to build a wide variety of server applications, via frameworks such as <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a>, but it's also the language of choice for data scientists, thanks to powerful libraries and tools such as <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a>, <a href="https://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a>, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> and <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a>. </p><p>Python hits a sweet spot of simplicity and power, but there is a big problem - there is no truly great scalable build tool for Python, and this is becoming a real pain point as Python repos grow like never before. &nbsp;</p><p>Python builds today involve manually invoking a wide variety of tools. Each tool has to be installed, configured and invoked in just the right way, often while sequencing the output of one tool into input of another. Knowing how to use each tool in a given scenario is complicated and burdensome. </p><p>Sure, you can hack around the problem for a while with some combination of shell scripts, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html">Makefiles</a>, <a href="https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">tox</a>, and <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">poetry</a>. But even a small code change might require you to run a huge amount of sequential build work. Re-executing the same processes with the same inputs over and over again is a frustrating waste of time and resources. &nbsp;And these solutions start to break down as your codebase grows.</p><p>Perhaps you experimented with more complex build systems, such as <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a> or <a href="https://v1.pantsbuild.org/">Pants v1</a>. &nbsp;But it's laborious to maintain all that BUILD metadata, all for a sub-par experience not optimized for Python. Not to mention the difficulty of implementing your own custom build logic. </p><p>Alternatively, maybe you've been tempted to split up your codebase into multiple interdependent repos, each with their own "smaller" builds. But that creates an even thornier problem, namely how to manage those interdependencies. Having to propagate changes across codebase boundaries can slow development down to a crawl, and leave you with the worst of both worlds - slower processes and a fragmented, unmanageable codebase.</p><p>A great build system for repos - of all sizes - that include Python code would support fine-grained invalidation and caching, so that it only executes the build work actually affected by a change. It would support concurrent local and even remote execution, to greatly speed up work by using all available CPU. It would be easy to adopt in a small repo, but would scale up as your codebase grows. It wouldn't require huge amounts of boilerplate metadata, and it would be easy to extend with custom build logic. </p><p>Well, Pants v2 is that system! </p><h2 id="introducing-pants-v2">Introducing Pants v2</h2><p><a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/">Pants v2</a> is a completely new open-source build system, inspired by our work on Pants v1. &nbsp;We've been developing and testing it for the last couple of years, and it's finally ready for prime time!</p><p>A key factor in the design of Pants v2 was a set of lessons we learned from Pants v1 and other existing systems, such as Bazel. Among them: that ease of use and performance matter, boilerplate is annoying, concurrency and caching require hard design work, and most people will need custom logic at some point.</p><h3 id="lesson-1-ease-of-use-and-performance-both-matter">Lesson #1: Ease of use and performance both matter</h3><p>When designing software you often find yourself making tradeoffs between ease of use and performance. But in a build system, both are vital. The Pants v2 execution engine - which is the performance-critical heart of the system - is written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, for raw speed. And the domain-specific build logic is written in familiar, easy to work with, type-annotated Python 3. This helps make Pants v2 easy to extend, without compromising performance. </p><p>Pants v2 also runs a daemon that memoizes fine-grained build state in memory, for even faster performance. This daemon watches for changes to your source files and precisely invalidates its state on the fly to ensure that the minimum amount of work happens the next time you build.</p><h3 id="lesson-2-writing-build-metadata-is-a-real-drag">Lesson #2: Writing build metadata is a real drag</h3><p>Some build tools are slow because they don't have enough information about the structure of your code to intelligently perform incremental work. Others have gone too far in the other direction, requiring a huge amount of metadata and boilerplate in BUILD files, especially relating to your code's dependencies. </p><p>Pants v2 offers the best of both worlds - intelligent, fine-grained incremental work, without the boilerplate. It does so by assuming sensible, magic-free defaults, inferring dependencies from the import statements in your code, and supporting plugins for custom inference logic. Stay tuned for an upcoming post on exactly how Pants achieves this!</p><h3 id="lesson-3-design-for-caching-concurrency-and-remoting">Lesson #3: Design for caching, concurrency and remoting </h3><p>Writing build logic that can be cached and executed concurrently and remotely is very hard. You have to be very careful about not producing or consuming side-effects, and it's extremely difficult to tack that on later. And unless you design your APIs with care, supporting these kinds of features often places severe restrictions on what your build logic may safely do. </p><p>In Pants v2, build logic is composed of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">pure</a> Python 3 <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html">async coroutines</a>. So a build rule can depend not only on its inputs, but can also await on new data at runtime - all of which is precisely tracked for invalidation and caching. This gives us the best of both worlds: logic that is properly isolated from side-effects, and is therefore amenable to caching, concurrent execution and remoting, while still allowing the use of natural control flow.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pantsbuild.org/content/images/2020/10/caching.gif" alt=""><figcaption>We run both tests, then add a syntax error to one test and rerun; the unmodified test uses the cache and is isolated from the syntax error.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="lesson-4-almost-everyone-needs-to-customize-their-builds">Lesson #4: Almost everyone needs to customize their builds</h3><p>Most teams have custom build steps, so extensibility is a key feature in any build system. Pants v2 is built around a <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/plugins-overview">plugin architecture</a>. You can write your own rules using the same API as the built-in functionality. So your custom build logic will enjoy the same fine-grained invalidation, caching, concurrency and remote execution abilities as the core Pants code.</p><h2 id="pants-2-0-0-is-out-now-">Pants 2.0.0 is out now!</h2><p>All this leads me to the happy announcement that <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pantsbuild.pants/2.0.0/">Pants 2.0.0</a>, the first stable release of Pants v2, is out now! 2.0.0 is the culmination of years of design and development work, and many months of beta testing at several organizations. So we're really happy, proud (and relieved…) to finally have it ready for general use. </p><p>You can see what Python tools Pants currently supports <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/python">here</a>. There are also commands for querying and understanding your dependency graph, and a robust help system. &nbsp;We're adding support for additional tools and features all the time, and it's straightforward to implement your own. Beta users have already written their own logic for Cython and docker, for example. </p><p>Now is a great time to adopt Pants 2.0.0! The team that developed Pants v2 is <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/community">ready to help you</a> onboard, answer any questions, and even pair with you to help you write any custom build logic. We're also eager to get feedback, bug reports and suggestions for what features we should focus on in the next weeks and months of development.</p><p>Pants v2 is developed by a helpful open source community, is funded by a 501(c)6 non-profit, and has excellent support available. If you have a growing Python codebase, and want to take Pants 2.0.0 for a spin, <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/community">let us know</a>. We'd love to fit you with some new Pants today!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>A frequently recurring staple of Hacker News is the <em>personal computing rant</em>: modern computers are black boxes, far too locked down.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> We long for our desktop computers, the early-2000s computing paradigm, and we want to take back control of our data.</p> <p>I sympathize greatly with this view. For the past five years, I have exclusively run Arch Linux. I love the early-2000s style of personal computing: text-heavy interfaces, words rather than icons, uniform keyboard shortcuts everywhere. I do nearly all my computing in emacs. It is feature rich, and no product manager is ever going to change the experience, interface, or shortcuts. My workspace allows me to be <em>fast</em>. Contrary to much modern software, emacs responds instantaneously to my keystrokes. Every action has an immediate effect, clear on the page, with no background process ambiguity. This is enormously satisfying. I would characterize this computing environment as a spiritual descendant of the typewriter: on its own, it is a dumb machine, but when you command it, it becomes a powerful extension of you. The user experience is given by speed, smoothness, reliability, and nothing else.</p> <p>On the other hand, you’ve got iPhones and iPads. These are not machines that you command – on the contrary, you might argue that all their notifications command you. With touch interfaces, facial recognition, and voice control, these are machines that are meant to merge with you. Instead of becoming an <em>extension</em> of you, it becomes <em>part</em> of you. Instead of you commanding it, it is meant to anticipate your commands. Where is the data? How does it work? Who knows. They’re total black boxes, effectively indistinguishable from magic, whereas your Linux Desktop is a DIYable simple machine.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p> <p>Many contemporary writers think of personal computing as one paradigm that is gradually evolving. I disagree: I think there are two, deeply different paradigms of personal computing, reflecting deeply different desires.</p> <ul> <li>Machine as extension of the self (your Windows XP Desktop).</li> <li>Machine as part of the self (your iPhone).</li> </ul> <p>Plenty of devices exist in the space in-between. Android phones try to give you some control back over your device, by which they necessarily preclude themselves from truly being <em>part</em> of you. Modern versions of OS X, with the touchbar, Siri, and integrations into all your other Apple devices, are starting to make the leap from extending the self to being part of the self.</p> <p>As a genre, the personal computing rant comes out of the correct view that these are all forms of personal computing, but it fails to recognize that within this broad umbrella, we’ve seen paradigms arise that differ in both intent and the human desire they’re meant to meet. It’s not that one class of devices is replacing the other. They are fundamentally different, and one paradigm succeeds where the other falls short of meeting the consumers’ needs. The terminal never met the needs of those who want Amazon Alexa, and vice-versa.</p> <p>I live in the in-between. I happily imagine a world where my Apple Watch monitors my glucose and blood oxygen, my Eight Sleep quantifies my rest, I mark up documents on giant touchscreens, but I sit on a clacky IBM keyboard to write code and blog posts in a terminal that hasn’t changed in twenty years. While your iPhone might meld with your mind by quantifying and anticipating your every need, my terminal melds with my mind by being fast, constant, and <em>always</em> correct. Each has its place, and I would never trade one for the other.</p>  <hr>  <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

<p>Firearms (guns) are one of the hot button issues in the United States and globally. I’m sure it is understandable why — pull the trigger and something dies. Killing is the primary purpose of a firearm. Naturally, this leads many to be fearful of firearms, but should people be fearful?</p>
<p>When I started writing this, I wanted to answer:</p>
<blockquote><p>Are firearms inherently unsafe?</p>
<p>Should firearms be banned, as many believe?</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s quite ambitious. One may believe you can just find an answer on a website / paper somewhere or is obvious. Unfortunately, the reality is far more complicated and has turned this into my longest article to date.</p>
<p>It’s been said,</p>
<blockquote><p>Guns don’t kill people, people kill people. <em>– unknown</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Many agree and many others strongly disagree. That divisiveness has made firearms a political issue, leading to a plethora of bias studies, inaccurate analysis, and more. Thus, to answer these questions I had to go through the data myself; I pulled <a href="#Data_Tooling">data from the CDC, FBI, RAND, Census and others</a> and completed my own analysis.</p>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Due to the nature of this analysis, it is important to highlight some items upfront.</p>
<p>1. The United States is often the focus throughout the analysis. This is because the United States has an abundance of firearms, a relatively uniform society and the most available &amp; accurate records.</p>
<p>2. This analysis focuses on general trends. Specific situations vary wildly, even in the same region: country, state, county, city, and neighborhood situations vary. As such, I caution making detailed / specific inference, beyond what the data explicitly shows (in the general case).</p>
<p>3. Some important data is lacking, such as socioeconomic status associated with crimes. This makes it very difficult to isolate confounding factors and leads to confusion / lack of definitive answer(s).</p>
<p>The goal of this analysis was to analyze available (and unbiased) data as in-depth as enabled, with no particular outcome in mind. <em>If new data comes in that materially changes what can be inferred, I’ll attempt to update the analysis.</em> With that in mind, I want to highlight that I dive into demographic information and I found some surprises. Politics seems to stifle this topic and in fact the truth. Instead I went to the data, I hope you can find it as interesting as I do.</p>
<blockquote><p>The truth is not for all men, but only for those who seek it.<br>
– Ayn Rand</p></blockquote>

<p>Globally, firearms are highly controlled, particularly in the Europe and Asia. In contrast, the United States has more firearms held by it’s citizens than the rest of the world combined.<a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country.png" alt="" width="1107" height="687" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country.png 1107w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country-300x186.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country-1024x635.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country-768x477.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1107px) 100vw, 1107px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country.png 1107w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country-300x186.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country-1024x635.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country-768x477.png 768w"></a>The real question — do the number of firearms really matter? From the graph above, it’s clear China, Russia and Iran have a high number of military firearms when compared civilian held firearms (and I suspect most civilian held firearms are former military, in countries such as China, Russia ,Iran, India, etc). In contrast, the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_World" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free world</a>” has an order of magnitude more civilian firearms, when compared to military firearms.</p>
<p>Clearly, what matters to “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">second world</a>” is having a large military arsenal, when compared to civilian held firearms.</p>
<p>It can be argued an unarmed society allows the military to impose their will, allowing countries to maintain the status quo and avoiding violent revolutions overthrowing the government.</p>
<h2><span id="Homicides_Firearms_Globally"></span>Homicides &amp; Firearms Globally<span></span></h2>
<p>In the “free world,” the main concern surrounding firearms are homicides &amp; suicides, with homicides being the most concerning. Below is a comparison of homicides by firearm deaths per 100,000 people across the globe.</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2.png" alt="" width="1228" height="677" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2.png 1228w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2-300x165.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2-1024x565.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2-768x423.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1228px) 100vw, 1228px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2.png 1228w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2-300x165.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2-1024x565.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2-768x423.png 768w"></a>When we compare the world, a few things become clear:</p>
<ol>
<li>The America’s, Caribbean and Africa have a much higher firearm homicide rate</li>
<li>The United States has the highest firearm homicide rate of a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first world</a>” country</li>
<li>Europe has the lowest firearm homicide rate globally</li>
</ol>
<p>What’s not clear, is whether or not firearms are really leading the increased firearm homicide rate.</p>
<p>Are homicides just naturally higher in these regions?</p>
<h2><span id="Firearm_Death_Rate_per_Firearm"></span>Firearm Death Rate per Firearm<span></span></h2>
<p>Below is an argument from the Amnesty International’s website:</p>
<blockquote><p>governments [with] poor regulation of the possession and use of <strong>guns lead to violence</strong> and that they must tackle this now through strict controls on guns and effective interventions in communities suffering high levels of gun violence.</p>
<p>– <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/arms-control/gun-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amnesty International</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The key statement is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Guns lead to violence</p></blockquote>
<p>The statement above implies a couple of things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gun volume and violence are correlated</li>
<li>As the number of guns increase, violence increases</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a few ways to invalidate / validate this statement. The clearest method is to simply compare firearm deaths per firearm. If firearms lead to more violence, we should see the ratio of firearm deaths to firearms (firearm deaths / firearms) staying constant (or growing at a constant rate). This ratio should stay or grow at a constant rate because as the firearm count increases, the firearm homicides should increase (keeping the ratio constant). We could also assume a direct correlation if “guns lead to violence” as it would probably occur at some constant rate.</p>
<p>Below you can see the comparison between firearm deaths and firearms:</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5.png" alt="" width="1313" height="687" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5.png 1313w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5-300x157.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5-1024x536.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5-768x402.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1313px) 100vw, 1313px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5.png 1313w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5-300x157.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5-1024x536.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5-768x402.png 768w"></a>As seen in the chart, the Caribbean, South America, Africa have a high number of firearm deaths per firearm, Columbia having one death per five hundred firearms. In contrast, “First World” (Europe and the United States) has a much lower number of fatalities per firearm, the United States having only one death per ten thousand firearms.</p>
<h3><span id="Firearms_vs_Homicide_Rate"></span>Firearms vs Homicide Rate<span></span></h3>
<p>For further evidence firearms aren’t correlated with violence, it’s possible to directly compare the number of firearms vs homicides:<a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5.png" alt="" width="1107" height="687" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5.png 1107w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5-300x186.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5-1024x635.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5-768x477.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1107px) 100vw, 1107px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5.png 1107w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5-300x186.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5-1024x635.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5-768x477.png 768w"></a>Across the bottom of the chart you can see all the countries with high homicide rates. The United States stands out clearly, if firearms were correlated with homicides we’d expect the U.S. to have many more homicides than it currently does. It does not appear more firearms are correlated with more homicides, in fact the trend line shows the opposite to be true (more firearms are correlated to less homicides).</p>
<p>For a final validation, we can compare firearms against homicides and firearm homicides against total homicides. Both should have a similar growth rate, if there was a correlation.</p>

<p>It’s important to note the graph is a logarithmic comparison for homicides and homicides by firearm (firearms per 100k Inhabitants are not logarithmic). The trend line comparison of Total Homicides and Homicides by Firearm is linear, but because the comparison is logarithmic, it appears exponential on the chart.</p>
<p>It is clear as homicides increase, homicides by firearm increase (blue data points). In contrast, when there are more firearms, homicides by firearm remain flat (purple data points), implying more firearms do not cause increase the number of homicides involving a firearm.</p>
<p>Further, you can see the blue star representing the United States homicide rate to homicide firearm deaths is right where it is expected. However, the purple star, representing the United States homicide rate to firearms per 100k inhabitants, is way outside the norm.</p>
<p>To summarize,</p>
<blockquote><p>Globally, as the firearm homicide rate increases, the total homicide rate increases; as the prevalence of firearms increase, the homicide rate <span>does not increase</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>The United States is clearly the largest holder of firearms in the world, most states have more firearms than entire countries. Fun fact:</p>
<blockquote><p>Texans and the Chinese military have the same number of firearms.</p></blockquote>
<p>Clearly, there’s a culture of gun ownership in the United States. When the United States was formed it had just fought a war of independence and regularly combated Native Americans, settling North America by force. Even today, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Guard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">United States National Guard</a> is one of the largest militias in the world.</p>
<blockquote><p>A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.<br>
–<a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-2/"> Constitution of the United States</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Without diving into politics, the constitution &amp; culture has enabled the United States to be relatively unique. Firearms are regulated, but just barely. Generally, citizens can do everything from carrying a firearms in public to purchasing assault rifles, flamethrowers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minigun" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">miniguns</a>, rocket launcher(s), etc. Often the only requirement is obtaining permit to own weapons, after that you can regularly purchase as many firearms as you’d like.</p>
<p>As seen in the previous section, the United States does have a higher (on average) number of firearm deaths. However, this doesn’t necessarily tell the whole story. In the prior section, we focused on the homicide rate. In the following sections, the focus will expand as uniform data collection, similar social norms and a widespread framework for law makes comparisons much easier.</p>
<p>Some topics we will explore here are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suicide vs homicide vs accidental rates</li>
<li>The type of weapons used in homicides</li>
<li>How demographics impact firearm fatalities</li>
<li>How firearm fatalities compare to other fatalities</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="Suicides_Homicides_in_the_United_States"></span>Suicides &amp; Homicides in the United States<span></span></h2>
<p>First, it is also important to highlight just how small the number of firearm related homicides really are, when compared to all deaths. On average, the total (suicide, homicide &amp; accidental) number of firearm related fatalities account for about 1.33% of all deaths in the United States (firearm related homicides account for ~0.44% of all deaths) and it varies wildly between states.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important item to discuss is that this is the “<em>firearm fatality rate</em>“, often conflated with the “<em>firearm homicide rate</em>” by political pundits. While all fatalities are unfortunate, most American’s would argue there is a different between <em>suicides</em> and <em>homicides</em>. Some states, such as Washington, support medically assisted suicides (for the terminally ill).</p>

  <p>
    Recent work by Dabney et al. suggests that the brain represents reward predictions as probability distributions
    <d-footnote>
      Experiments were conducted on mice using single-unit recordings from the ventral tegmental area.
    </d-footnote><d-cite key="dabney2020distribtionmice"></d-cite>.
    This contrasts against the widely adopted approach in reinforcement learning (RL) of modelling single scalar
    quantities (expected values).
    In fact, by using distributions we are able to quantify uncertainty in the decision-making process.
    Uncertainty is especially important in domains where making a mistake can result in the inability to recover
    <d-footnote>
      Examples of such domains include autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and the financial markets.
    </d-footnote>. Research in risk-aware reinforcement learning has emerged to address such problems
    <d-cite key="morimura2010risksensitive,chow2018riskconstrainedrl"></d-cite>.
    However, another important application of uncertainty, which we focus on in this article, is efficient exploration
    of the state-action space.
  </p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    The purpose of this article is to clearly explain Q-Learning from the perspective of a Bayesian.
    As such, we use a small grid world and a simple extension of tabular Q-Learning to illustrate the fundamentals.
    Specifically, we show how to extend the deterministic Q-Learning algorithm to model
    the variance of Q-values with Bayes' rule. We focus on a sub-class of problems where it is reasonable to assume that Q-values
    are normally distributed
    and derive insights when this assumption holds true. Lastly, we demonstrate that applying Bayes' rule to update
    Q-values comes with a challenge: it is vulnerable to early exploitation of suboptimal policies.
  </p>

  <p>
    This article is largely based on the seminal work from Dearden et al. <d-cite key="dearden1998bayesianqlearning"></d-cite>.
    Specifically, we expand on the assumption that Q-values are normally distributed and evaluate various Bayesian exploration
    policies. One key distinction is that we model $$\mu$$ and $$\sigma^2$$, while the
    authors of the original Bayesian Q-Learning paper model a distribution over these parameters. This allows them to quantify
    uncertainty in their parameters as well as the expected return - we only focus on the latter.
  </p>

  <div><h4>Epistemic vs Aleatoric Uncertainty</h4></div>
  <div><p>
    Since Dearden et al. model a distribution over the parameters, they can sample from this distribution and the resulting
    dispersion in Q-values is known as <b>epistemic</b> uncertainty. Essentially, this uncertainty is representative of the
    "knowledge gap" that results from limited data (i.e. limited observations). If we close this gap, then we are left with
    irreducible uncertainty (i.e. inherent randomness in the environment), which is known as <b>aleatoric</b> uncertainty
    </p><d-cite key="kiureghian2007aleatoric"></d-cite><p>.

    </p><p>
    One can argue that the line between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty is rather blurry. The information that
    you feed into your model will determine how much uncertainty can be reduced. The more information you incorporate about
    the underlying mechanics of how the environment operates (i.e. more features), the less aleatoric uncertainty there will be.

    </p><p>

    It is important to note that inductive bias also plays an important role in determining what is categorized as
    epistemic vs aleatoric uncertainty for your model.
    </p><p>

    <b>Important Note about Our Simplified Approach:</b></p><p>

    Since we only use $$\sigma^2$$ to represent uncertainty, our approach does not distinguish between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.

    Given enough interactions, the agent will close the knowledge gap and $$\sigma^2$$ will only represent aleatoric uncertainty. However, the agent still
    uses this uncertainty to explore.

    This is problematic because the whole point of exploration is to gain
    knowledge, which indicates that we should only explore using epistemic uncertainty.
    </p></div>


  

  <p>
    Since we are modelling $$\mu$$ and $$\sigma^2$$, we begin by evaluating the conditions under which it is appropriate
    to assume Q-values are normally distributed.
  </p>

  <a href="#section-1" id="section-1"></a>
  <h2>When Are Q-Values Normally Distributed?</h2>

  <p>
    The readers who are familiar with Q-Learning can skip over the collapsible box below.
  </p>

  <div><h4>Temporal Difference Learning</h4></div>
  <div>
    <p>
      Temporal Difference (TD) learning is the dominant paradigm used to learn value functions in reinforcement learning
      <d-cite key="sutton1988tempdiff"></d-cite>.
      Below we will quickly summarize a TD learning algorithm for Q-values,
      which is called Q-Learning. First, we will write Q-values as follows <d-cite key="Sutton2017ReinforcementIntroduction"></d-cite>:
    </p>

    <d-math block="">
      \overbrace{Q_\pi(s,a)}^\text{current Q-value} =
      \overbrace{R_s^a}^\text{expected reward for (s,a)} +
      \overbrace{\gamma Q_\pi(s^{\prime},a^{\prime})}^\text{discounted Q-value at next timestep}
    </d-math>

    <p>
      We will precisely define Q-value as the expected value of the total return from taking action $$a$$ in state $$s$$ and following
      policy $$\pi$$ thereafter. The part about $$\pi$$ is important because the agent's view on how good an action is
      depends on the actions it will take in subsequent states. We will discuss this further when analyzing our agent in
      the game environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the Q-Learning algorithm, we sample a reward $$r$$ from the environment, and estimate the Q-value for the current
      state-action pair $$q(s,a)$$ and the next state-action pair $$q(s^{\prime},a^{\prime})$$
      <d-footnote>
        For Q-Learning, the next action $$a^{\prime}$$ is the action with the largest Q-value in that state:
        $$\max_{a^{\prime}} q(s^{\prime}, a^{\prime})$$.
      </d-footnote>. We can represent the sample as:
    </p>

    <d-math block="">
      q(s,a) = r + \gamma q{(s^\prime,a^\prime)}
    </d-math>

    <p>
      The important thing to realize is that the left side of the equation is an estimate (current Q-value), and the right side
      of the equation is a combination of information gathered from the environment (the sampled reward) and another estimate
      (next Q-value). Since the right side of the equation contains more information about the true Q-value than the left side,
      we want to move the value of the left side closer to that of the right side. We accomplish this by minimizing the squared
      Temporal Difference error ($$\delta^2_{TD}$$), where $$\delta_{TD}$$ is defined as:
    </p>

    <d-math block="">
      \delta_{TD} = r + \gamma q(s^\prime,a^\prime) - q(s,a)
    </d-math>

    <p>
      The way we do this in a tabular environment, where $$\alpha$$ is the learning rate, is with the following update rule:
    </p>

    <d-math block="">
      q(s,a) \leftarrow \alpha(r_{t+1} + \gamma q(s^\prime,a^\prime)) + (1 - \alpha) q(s,a)
    </d-math>

    <p>
      Updating in this manner is called bootstrapping because we are using one Q-value to update another Q-value.
    </p>
  </div>

  

  <p>
    We will use the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) as the foundation to understand when Q-values are normally
    distributed. Since Q-values are sample sums, then they should look more and more normally distributed as the sample size
    increases <d-cite key="lecam1986clt"></d-cite>.
    However, the first nuance that we will point out is that rewards must be sampled from distributions with finite variance.
    Thus, if rewards are sampled distributions such as Cauchy or Lévy, then we cannot assume Q-values are normally distributed.
  </p>

  

  <p>
    Otherwise, Q-values are approximately normally distributed when the number of <b><i>effective timesteps</i></b>
    $$\widetilde{N}$$ is large
    <d-footnote>
      We can think of effective timesteps as the number of <b>full</b> samples.
    </d-footnote>.
    This metric is comprised of three factors:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      $$N$$ - <b>Number of timesteps</b>: As $$N$$ increases, so does $$\widetilde{N}$$.
    </li>

    <li>
      $$\xi$$ - <b>Sparsity</b>: We define sparsity as the number of timesteps,
      on average, a reward of zero is deterministically received in between receiving non-zero rewards
      <d-footnote>
        In the Google Colab notebook, we ran simulations to show that $$\xi$$ reduces the effective number of timesteps by $$\frac{1}{\xi + 1}$$:
        <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/brandinho/bayesian-perspective-q-learning/blob/main/Sparsity.ipynb">
          Experiment in a <span>Notebook</span>
        </a>
      </d-footnote>.
      When sparsity is present, we lose samples (since they are always zero).
      <!-- As sparsity increases, we essentially lose samples since they are always zero. -->
      Therefore, as $$\xi$$ increases, $$\widetilde{N}$$ decreases.
    </li>

    <li>
      $$\gamma$$ - <b>Discount Factor</b>:
      As $$\gamma$$ gets smaller, the agent places more weight on immediate rewards relative to distant ones, which means
      that we cannot treat distant rewards as full samples. Therefore, as $$\gamma$$ increases, so does $$\widetilde{N}$$.
    </li>

    <div><h4>Discount Factor and Mixture Distributions</h4></div>
    <div>
      <p>
        We will define the total return as the sum of discounted future
        rewards, where the discount factor $$\gamma$$ can take on any value between $$0$$ (myopic) and $$1$$ (far-sighted).
        It helps to think of the resulting distribution $$G_t$$ as a weighted mixture distribution.
      </p>

      <d-math block="">
        G_t = r_{t+1} + \gamma r_{t+2} + \gamma^2 r_{t+3} + ... + \gamma^{N-1} r_{t+N}
      </d-math>

      <p>
        When we set $$\gamma \lt 1$$, the mixture weights for the underlying distributions change from equal weight
        to time-weighted, where immediate timesteps have a higher weight. When $$\gamma = 0$$, then this is
        equivalent to sampling from only one timestep and CLT would not hold. Use the slider
        to see the effect $$\gamma$$ has on the mixture weights, and ultimately the mixture distribution.
      </p>

      <div>
        <div>
          <p>
              $$$$<br>
              $$$$
          </p>
          

          <p>
              $$$$<br>
              $$$$
          </p>
          

          <p>
              $$$$<br>
              $$$$
          </p>

          
          
        </div>

        
      </div>

      <p><label for="barGammaMixture">$$\gamma$$ = <span></span></label></p>
    </div>
  </ul>

  We combine the factors above to formally define the number of effective timesteps:

  <d-math block="">
    \widetilde{N} = \frac{1}{\xi + 1}\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\gamma^{i}
  </d-math>

  <p>
    Below we visually demonstrate how each factor affects the normality of Q-values
    <d-footnote>
      We scale the Q-values by $$\widetilde{N}$$ because otherwise the distribution of Q-values
      moves farther and farther to the right as the number of effective timesteps increases, which distorts the visual.
    </d-footnote>:

                <p>Take <strong>Uncle Bob's</strong> Clean Architecture and map its correspondences with <strong>Gary Bernhardt's</strong> thin imperative shell around a functional core, and you get an understanding of how to cheaply maintain and scale software!</p>
<p>This is what <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/">Mr. Brandon Rhodes</a> did. It's not every day that I find such clear insight.</p>
<p>I am honored to have found his <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/talks/#clean-architecture-python">presentation</a> and <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/slides/2014-07-pyohio/clean-architecture/">slides</a> explaining  <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture</a> and Gary Bernhardt's PyCon talks of <a href="https://archive.org/details/pyvideo_422___units-need-testing-too">2011</a>, <a href="https://pycon-2012-notes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fast_tests_slow_tests.html">2012</a>, and <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries">2013</a>.</p>
<p>Mr. Rhodes offers such a distilled view, that he can show you these crucial concepts in 3 slides of code. I will go ahead and summarize what he said and add a tiny bit of my insight.</p>
<p>Copyright of all Python code on this page belongs to <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/">Mr. Brandon Rhodes</a>, and copyright of the diagram belongs to <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)</a>. I use these under (hopefully) fair use (nonprofit and educational).</p>


<p>First of all, we need to be on the same page, in order to be able to understand each other. Here are the words I'll use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Function: I use "function" or "pure function" to refer to a Python "function" that only uses its parameters for input, returns a result as output, and does not cause any other side-effects (such as I/O). <ul>
<li>A pure function returns the same output given the same inputs.</li>
<li>A pure function may be called any number of times without changing the system state - it should have no influence on DB, UI, other functions or classes.</li>
<li>This is very similar to a mathematical function: takes you from <em>x</em> to <em>y</em> and nothing else happens.</li>
<li>Sadly we can't have only pure functions; software has a <strong>purpose</strong> of causing side-effects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Procedure, Routine, or Subroutine: A piece of code that executes, that may or may not have side effects. This is a "function" in Python, but might not be a "pure function".</li>
<li>Tests: automated unit tests. By "unit" I mean not necessarily just a class, but a behavior. If you want, see more details in <a href="https://danuker.go.ro/tdd-revisited-pytest-updated-2020-09-03.html#update-2020-09-03-keep-coupling-low">the coupling chapter of my previous post</a>.</li>
</ul>

    <span>return</span> <span>definition</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, we have a piece of code that prepares a URL, then gets some data over the network (I/O), then validates the result (a word definition) and returns it.</p>
<p>This is a bit much: a procedure should ideally do one thing only. While this small-ish procedure is quite readable still, it is a metaphor for a more developed system - where it could be arbitrarily long.</p>
<p>The current knee-jerk reaction is to <em>hide</em> the I/O operations somewhere far away. Here is the same code after extracting the I/O lines:</p>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>find_definition</span><span>(</span><span>word</span><span>):</span>           <span># Listing 2</span>
    <span>q</span> <span>=</span> <span>'define '</span> <span>+</span> <span>word</span>

    <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>call_json_api</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span>
    <span>definition</span> <span>=</span> <span>data</span><span>[</span><span>u</span><span>'Definition'</span><span>]</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>definition</span> <span>==</span> <span>u</span><span>''</span><span>:</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>ValueError</span><span>(</span><span>'that is not a word'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>definition</span>

<span>def</span> <span>call_json_api</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>):</span>
    <span>response</span> <span>=</span> <span>requests</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span>     <span># I/O</span>
    <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>response</span><span>.</span><span>json</span><span>()</span>           <span># I/O</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>data</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In Listing #2, the I/O is extracted from the top-level procedure. </p>
<p>The problem is, the code is still <strong>coupled</strong> - <code>call_json_api</code> is called whenever you want to test anything - even the building of the URL or the parsing of the result.</p>
<p><strong>Coupling kills software.</strong></p>
<p>A good rule of thumb to spot coupling is this: Can you test a piece of code without having to mock or dependency inject like Frankenstein?</p>
<p>Here, we can't test <code>find_definition</code> without somehow replacing <code>call_json_api</code> from inside it, in order to avoid making HTTP requests.</p>
<p>Let's find out what a better solution looks like.</p>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>find_definition</span><span>(</span><span>word</span><span>):</span>           <span># Listing 3</span>
    <span>url</span> <span>=</span> <span>build_url</span><span>(</span><span>word</span><span>)</span>
    <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>requests</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>json</span><span>()</span>  <span># I/O</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>pluck_definition</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>build_url</span><span>(</span><span>word</span><span>):</span>
    <span>q</span> <span>=</span> <span>'define '</span> <span>+</span> <span>word</span>
    <span>url</span> <span>=</span> <span>'http://api.duckduckgo.com/?'</span>
    <span>url</span> <span>+=</span> <span>urlencode</span><span>({</span><span>'q'</span><span>:</span> <span>q</span><span>,</span> <span>'format'</span><span>:</span> <span>'json'</span><span>})</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>url</span>

<span>def</span> <span>pluck_definition</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>):</span>
    <span>definition</span> <span>=</span> <span>data</span><span>[</span><span>u</span><span>'Definition'</span><span>]</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>definition</span> <span>==</span> <span>u</span><span>''</span><span>:</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>ValueError</span><span>(</span><span>'that is not a word'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>definition</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, the procedure at the top (aka. the <span><strong>imperative shell</strong></span> of the program) is handling the I/O, and everything else is moved to <span><strong>pure functions</strong></span> (<code>build_url</code>, <code>pluck_definition</code>). The <span><strong>pure functions</strong></span> are easily testable by just calling them on made-up data structures; no Frankenstein needed.</p>
<p>This separation into an <span><strong>imperative shell</strong></span> and <span><strong>functional core</strong></span> is an encouraged idea by Functional Programming.</p>
<p>Ideally, though, in a real system, you wouldn't test elements as small as these routines, but integrate more of the system. See <a href="https://danuker.go.ro/tdd-revisited-pytest-updated-2020-09-03.html#update-2020-09-03-keep-coupling-low">the coupling chapter of my previous post</a> to understand the trade-offs.</p>

<p>Look at <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture chart</a> (Copyright Robert C. Martin aka. Uncle Bob) :
<img alt="The Clean Architecture" src="https://danuker.go.ro/images/CleanArchitecture.jpg"></p>
<p>Uncle Bob's <span><strong>Use Cases</strong></span> and <span><strong>Entities</strong></span> (red and yellow circles of the chart) map to the <span><strong>pure functions</strong></span> we saw earlier - <code>build_url</code> and <code>pluck_definition</code> from Listing 3, and the <span><strong>plain objects</strong></span> they receive as parameters and send as outputs. <em>(updated 2020-10-28)</em></p>
<p>Uncle Bob's <span><strong>Interface Adapters</strong></span> (green circle) map to the top-level <span><strong>imperative shell</strong></span>  from earlier - <code>find_definition</code> from Listing 3, handling only I/O to the outside (Web, DB, UI, other frameworks).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/jj7ave/the_grand_unified_theory_of_software_architecture/gabst6z/?context=3">Update 2020-10-28</a>: A "Model" object in today's MVC frameworks is a poisoned apple: it is not a <a href="https://khanlou.com/2014/12/pure-objects/">"pure" object</a> or <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Humble%20Object.html">"humble" object</a>, but one that can produce side effects like saving or loading from the database. Their "save" and "read" methods litter your code with untestable side-effects all over. Avoid them, or confine them to the periphery of your system and reduce their influence accordingly (they are actually a hidden <span><strong>Interface Adapter</strong></span>) due to interacting with the DB.</p>
<p>Notice the arrows on the left side of the circles, pointing inwards to more and more abstract parts. These are procedure or function calls. Our code is called by the outside. <strong>This has some exceptions. Whatever you do, the database won't call your app. But the web can, a user can through a UI, the OS can through STDIN, and a timer can, at regular intervals (such as in a game).</strong> <em>(updated 2020-10-28)</em></p>
<p>The top-level procedure:</p>
<ol>
<li>gets the input, </li>
<li>adapts it to simple objects acceptable to the system,</li>
<li>pushes it through the functional core,</li>
<li>gets the returned value from the functional core,</li>
<li>adapts it for the output device,</li>
<li>and pushes it out to the output device.</li>
</ol>
<p>This lets us easily test the functional core. Ideally, most of a production system should be pure-functional.</p>

<p>If you reduce the <span><strong>imperative shell</strong></span> and move code into the <span><strong>functional core</strong></span>, each test can verify almost the entire (now-functional) stack, but stopping short of actually performing external actions.</p>
<p>You can then test the imperative shell using <strong>fewer integration tests</strong>: you only need to check that it is <strong>correctly connected</strong> to the functional core.</p>
<p>Having two users for the system - the real user and the unit tests - and listening to both, lets you guide your architecture so as to <strong>minimize coupling</strong> and build a more <strong>flexible system</strong>.</p>
<p>Having a flexible system lets you implement new features and change existing ones <strong>quickly and cheaply</strong>, in order to <strong>stay competitive as a business</strong>.</p>
<p>Comments are much appreciated. I am yet to apply these insights, and I may be missing something!</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2020-10-28:</strong> I have tried out this methodology in some small TDD Katas, and together with TDD, it works great. But I am not employed right now, so I can't say I've <em>really</em> tried it.</p>

<p>Posted by admin on 28 October 2020 at 06:15 CET. Latest update on 28 October 2020 at 17:02 CET.</p>
<p>A greedy bunch of bastards calling themselves "Voodoo Bear" sent an <a href="#mail">email</a> to my private email address announcing a DDoS attack aimed at TinyCert to take place, starting Monday 2 November 2020. They seem to be under the impression that there is a large company with deep pockets behind TinyCert, which I suppose is flattering. TinyCert is just a pet project of mine, that I find useful for myself and figured others might find it useful too.</p>
<h3>Ransom demands</h3>
<p>As you can see from the <a href="#mail">email below</a>, they are demanding a "small" $1000 ransom to call off the attack, increasing their demands by $1000 per day they are not met. TinyCert has been up for 6 years now and costs me about $200 per year to run ($1200 thusfar) and the total amount of <a href="https://www.tinycert.org/donate">donations</a> in that time has been $75, as I guess not enough people found it useful enough to consider donating. Thus, even if I <i>could</i> pay the ransom, I would not want to. If the site goes down, so be it, the version I use privately will be unaffected anyway.</p>
<h3>What can I do about it?</h3>
<p>Realistically, nothing. I could change the IP address by moving to another host or hosting provider, so that the attack goes to the wrong place. That would probably not be effective, at least not for very long. Besides, I would much rather the moronic dipshits waste their time and effort by attacking my little pet project rather than going after somebody who might actually pay them. Heck, if anything, they're saving me money if I have to shut down the site.</p>
<h4>Cloudflare?</h4>
<p>Using Cloudflare or similar services is not an option. The dumb idiots indicate they will attack the network directly (most likely the IP address of the server TinyCert is running on, rather than the actual network of my hosting provider). Since it is a very lightweight server, as TinyCert requires very little in terms of server resources, it won't hold up against a proper DDoS attack for any significant length of time. If anything, it will be interesting to see how well it holds up. For Cloudflare's protection to be effective, the IP address would first have to be changed (which in itself is easily done - I guess the criminals overestimate how much work it is to migrate a small website), but the Cloudflare SSL proxy is not suitable in the free tier. This is because the free tier does not allow the use of a custom certificate and TinyCert uses <abbr title="HTTP Public Key Pinning">HPKP</abbr>. There is also no way I could afford the higher tier that allows that.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince has <a href="https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/1321320999678136325">offered Cloudflare's assistance</a> at no cost if needed. I hope it will not be necessary, but kudos to him and Cloudflare for their work and the kind offer.</p><h4>Open source?</h4>
<p>It has been suggested that I open-source the TinyCert codebase and allow people to have their own local versions, which of course wouldn't be affected. This too is not an option. Parts of the codebase are licensed to me personally and providing the source to them would be a breach of that license. Swapping that out for open source code would be possible, but time consuming and labour intensive and not something I am willing to do.</p>
<h3 id="mail">The actual email received</h3>
<p>Here is a copy of the email, for anybody who is interested.</p>
<div>
	<p>
		From: Robert Clark &lt;robertclark@coronaxy.com&gt;<br>
		Subject: If www.tinycert.org is important to you, you must read this<br>
		Date: Wed, 28 Oct 2020 02:13:37 +0000
	</p>
	<div><p>
		PLEASE FORWARD THIS EMAIL TO SOMEONE IN YOUR COMPANY WHO IS ALLOWED TO MAKE IMPORTANT DECISIONS!</p><p>
		==========================================</p><p>
		We are the Voodoo Bear and we have chosen www.tinycert.org as target for our next DDoS attack.<br>
		Please perform a google search for "Voodoo Bear" to have a look at some of our previous work.</p><p>
		Your network will be subject to a DDoS attack starting at 2020 November 2nd (Monday).</p><p>
		THIS IS NOT A HOAX, and to prove it right now we will start a small attack on www.tinycert.org that will last for 30 minutes.<br>
		It will not be heavy attack, and will not cause you any damage so don't worry, at this moment.</p><p>
		This means that your website, e-mail and other connected services will be unavailable for everyone.</p><p>
		We will refrain from attacking your servers for a small fee.<br>
		The current fee is $1000(USD) in bitcoins (BTC). The fee will increase by 1000 USD for each day after deadline that passed without payment.</p><p>
		Please send Bitcoin to the following Bitcoin address (cAsE-SeNsitIve):</p><p>
		[address removed]</p><p>
		You can easily buy bitcoins via several websites or even offline from a Bitcoin-ATM. We suggest you coinmama.com or https://buy.coingate.com/ for buying bitcoins.</p><p>
		Once you have paid we will automatically get informed that it was your payment. Please note that you have to make payment before the deadline or the attack WILL start!</p><p>
		If you decide not to pay, we will start the attack on the indicated date and uphold it until you do, there's no counter measure to this, you will only end up wasting more money trying to find a solution (Cloudflare, Sucuri, Imperva and similar services are useless, because we will hit your network directly).</p><p>
		We will completely destroy your reputation and make sure your services will remain offline until you pay.<br>
		We will also download your database and do as much damage as possible.</p><p>
		Do not reply to this email, don't try to reason or negotiate, we will not read any replies.</p><p>
		Once you have paid we won't start the attack and you will never hear from us again.</p><p>
		Please note that Bitcoin is anonymous and no one will find out that you have complied.</p><p>
		-- Voodoo Bear team

</div>
<p>I literally laughed out loud at the first sentence, as it indicates how clueless these numbskulls are. Maybe I'll forward the email to my budgerigars, as they are the only other living beings in here, though I'm not sure they're qualified to make any decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> some users have reported receiving similar emails. On the one hand, that is a good thing, as it reduces the likelihood of (persistent) follow-through on the part of these scumbags. On the other hand, the more widespread this is, the more likely it is that somebody will give in and pay up. If you receive a threat like this, do not comply. It will only encourage them that their actions are successful and marks you as being susceptible to caving in to pressure.</p>
<p>So, Mr. "Clark" or "Voodoo Bear", whatever you hilariously pitiable imbeciles call yourselves, you can just fuck off. I have not for a nanosecond considered giving in to your demands, even if I could. You wanna waste your time to take down my pet project? Be my guest. My taking the time and effort to Write this page is the only thing you have "achieved" as you're not getting a penny from me. And thank you for thinking TinyCert something worthy of extortion - that means I must've done something right in creating it.</p>
<p>Well, there you go. It's been fun while it lasted. This is why we can't have nice things.</p>

<p><strong>MulticoreWare is a software development company that works on video compression, ML, heterogeneous computing, and championed the open-source x265 encoder in the past. They are now driving the x266 project to create an open-source VVC (Versatile Video Coding) encoder and use their experience from their UHDKit product to make it the premier open-source VVC encoder.</strong></p>




<h2><span id="Who_is_MulticoreWare"></span><strong>Who is MulticoreWare?</strong><span></span></h2>



<p><a href="https://multicorewareinc.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="MulticoreWare (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">MulticoreWare</a> is a multi-faceted company with expertise in different verticals such as high-performance Video Compression, AI &amp; Video Analytics, ADAS (Automated Driver Assistance), etc. A common thread through these verticals is their ability to design and write high-performance code for various computing platforms. MulticoreWare’s background and experience are cool, in my opinion, and how they’ve nurtured and built a strong team in a very complex niche is admirable.</p>



<p>With teams in the US, India, China, and Germany, MulticoreWare is well-placed to don the role of a thought-leader in the open-source video codec world.</p>



<p>Let’s see why and what their plans are!</p>



<h2><span id="The_Road_To_x266_%E2%80%93_An_Open_Source_VVC_Encoder"></span><strong>The Road To x266 – An Open Source VVC Encoder</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>MPEG announced three new video codecs – VVC (Versatile Video Coding), EVC (Essential Video Coding), and LCEVC (Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding). Of these three, VVC or H.266 is touted as the successor to H.265 (HEVC) and promises 50% more compression efficiency over HEVC but comes at a much higher complexity. Here’s a <a href="https://ottverse.com/vvc-evc-lcevc-mpeg-video-codecs/">brief explanation of all three</a> on OTTVerse.</p>



<p>But, first, let’s take a look at HEVC and the x265 encoder.</p>



<h3><span id="x265_and_HEVC"></span><strong>x265 and HEVC</strong><span></span></h3>



<p>MulticoreWare announced the <a href="https://x265.com/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">x265 project</a> back in 2013, and it was a success. x265 allowed video compression teams worldwide to get their hands on an efficient, standards-compliant HEVC encoder. x265 was made available under the open-source <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">GNU GPL v2 license</a> and also offered by MulticoreWare under Commercial License Agreements.</p>



<p>But, having a good encoder clearly wasn’t enough. Because, fast-forward 7 years, and unfortunately, HEVC is still embroiled in patent-wars that seem destined to give it a “death by a thousand cuts.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>HEVC’s situation is rather unfortunate considering that HEVC had interesting features such as the use of quadtree-decomposition, large block sizes, the concept of TU, PU, and CUs, the Sample Adaptive Offset filter, new picture types, and several innovations which made it possible to compress 4K videos quite efficiently (in comparison to H.264/AVC).</p>



<h3><span id="The_x266_Project"></span><strong>The x266 Project</strong><span></span></h3>



<p>Riding on the back of their x265 success, MulticoreWare has decided to pioneer the x266 project along the x265 project lines they worked on earlier. x266 will be an open-source project with the MulticoreWare video compression team’s full attention and the backing of an industry-consortium.</p>



<p>As with any new codec, there are always early adopters (both programmers and companies) willing to give it a try, evaluate, file tickets, and contribute code. But, to get the ball rolling, you need a reliable encoder that is not only standards-compliant but also reasonably fast and with enough presets and knobs to make the early-adoption both valuable and exciting (in a geeky-sense!)</p>



<p>I spoke to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shivakumarasu/" target="_blank" aria-label="Shivakumar Narayanan (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shivakumar Narayanan</a>, Senior Director – Marketing and Product Management at MulticoreWare, about the consortium, and this is what he had to say –</p>



<blockquote><p><em>Similar to when we did this for x265 consortium, to get key consortium members on board and invest in the development of this codec. These members will be founding partners with benefits when the codec (rather encoder is ready to release for the open-source world). Consortium members being strategic, will also play an important role in the shaping of this codec as well as prioritization of functionalities as it would pertain to their and their customers’ interests.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Industry involvement bodes well for the open-source community because <strong>video encoder implementation is both an art and a science.</strong></p>



<p>It helps to have a proficient team that understands and implements concepts such as wavefront parallelism, multi-threading, intrinsics, etc. to make codec implementations practical and useful. And, of course, people with “golden eyes” to spot issues with video quality as they occur.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MulticoreWare has such a team, and I feel they’ll bring their experience from x265 to the x266 development.</p>



<h3><span id="Expertise_from_UHDKit"></span><strong>Expertise from UHDKit</strong><span></span></h3>



<p>Another product in MulticoreWare’s portfolio is <a href="https://x265.com/uhdkit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UHDKit</a>. It is an extended encoding library built on top of the x264 (AVC) encoder and x265 (HEVC) encoder libraries. It has a better performance and feature-set than the vanilla x264, x265, and svt-av1 encoders. UHDKit comes in-built with powerful features such as a “control system for video compression” that dynamically adjusts settings to achieve better video quality based on the computing platform’s spec. </p>



<p>Additional features include fast ABR encoding (to get the bitrate ladder faster!) and high-performance live encoding, all this on software, without any requirement for additional hardware accelerators. It can be used as a standalone encoding library or can be invoked via the FFmpeg framework, which makes it seamlessly integrate into any software encoding/ transcoding pipeline.</p>



<p>I am sure some of this expertise from building UHDKit will rub off on the x266 encoder development.</p>



<h2><span id="How_Do_I_Get_my_hands_on_x266"></span><strong>How Do I Get my hands on x266?</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>Currently, MulticoreWare is working closely with x266 Consortium members and after a few months, it will be available to them.</p>



<p>Upon enquiring about the open-source implementation, here’s what MCW had to say –</p>



<blockquote><p><em>For the larger open source community, it will be made available when we have reached critical mass required for its first release. As we near readiness, we will update here on how you can get hold of it.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>If you have any questions for the MulticoreWare team, please get in touch with Shivakumar Narayanan at <a aria-label="x266@multicorewareinc.com (opens in a new tab)" href="mailto:x266@multicorewareinc.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">x266@multicorewareinc.com</a>.</p>



<p>Also, many thanks to <a aria-label="Praveen Kumar Karadugattu (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/praveenkpk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Praveen Kumar Karadugattu</a>, Video Architect at MulticoreWare for kicking off this discussion between MulticoreWare and OTTVerse.com. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>What Is A Yarn Workspace?</h2><p>Before I start to use a new technology, I first try to make sure that I really understand what it is. </p><p>This means getting the definition of what it is to be as crystal clear as possible for me, in all areas that compose the technology.</p><p>This is what we will first do with Yarn Workspaces before we dive into the way we can use them for our projects.</p><p><strong>We can briefly state that a Yarn Workspace is a method of combining multiple project NPM dependencies into a single workspace, so that all projects share the same dependencies. This is commonly referred to as a ‘</strong><a target="_blank" title="monorepo" href="https://www.perforce.com/blog/vcs/what-monorepo"><strong>monorepo</strong></a><strong>’.</strong></p><p>To get an even better understanding of what a Yarn Workspace is, it's best to take a look at the broader picture of the problem it solves and why that problem exists in the first place.</p><h2>The Multi-Megabyte Problem that a Yarn Workspace solves</h2><p>While the emergence of open source packages within the NPM ecosystem has lead to <a target="_blank" title="https://flaviocopes.com/node-modules-size/" href="https://flaviocopes.com/node-modules-size/">tremendous benefits</a> and time-saved on project code, the fact that so many node modules are now needed for even the simplest of projects has led to a lot of bloat in overall project size. </p><p>The average node js project, specifically the dependencies located within it, <a target="_blank" title="https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/node-modules-is-huge-is-this-normal/137282/12" href="https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/node-modules-is-huge-is-this-normal/137282/12">have a total estimated size of 76MB</a>.</p><p>For a single, web based project for example, this is huge.</p><p>When working on more complex projects, with dependencies from a variety of frameworks, this size can swell even more. I’m sure we’re all familiar with the infamous Godzilla 500+ MB /node_modules folder.</p><p>Imagine now, with these large individual file sizes on each project, that we had a multi-project setup with each project that needed to have its own dependencies, such as what you might find in a standard MERN or MEVN stack. With a separate /client and /server folder structure, each with their own package.json and subsequent package dependencies.</p><p>Each of these projects would have to be loading in their own dependencies, and sometimes, as shown in the drawing above, having the same duplicate dependencies loaded in for each folder, causing massive unnecessary bloat. Not to mention the issues that would arise from dealing with out-of-date code and the potential conflicts in the overall codebase.</p><p>These issues are what are commonly referred to as ‘<a target="_blank" title="https://blog.appsignal.com/2020/04/09/ride-down-the-javascript-dependency-hell.html" href="https://blog.appsignal.com/2020/04/09/ride-down-the-javascript-dependency-hell.html">dependency hell’</a>. </p><p><strong>And it’s not a new issue. Infact, its been around for a long time. </strong></p><p>Fortunately, there are now solutions to this problem. That solution as we have stated above is the monorepo. </p><p>One of the most prominent (within the NPM ecosystem) of which is the <em><strong>Yarn Workspace</strong></em>.</p><p><strong>Whose benefits alongside the obvious bloat reduction mentioned above, include:</strong></p><p>-	Better code-quality and optimization due to packages being linked together. Leading to more up to date code in general. </p><p>-	All your dependencies installed together at one time, leading to better ability for Yarn to optimize them.</p><p>-	Yarn gets to make a single lock file rather than multiple, giving you fewer conflicts and making code review easier.</p><p>So now that we have a clearer overall picture of what a Yarn Workspace is in general. Let’s now take a look at what it actually looks like and how we can go about setting it up within a project.</p><h2><strong>How Do You Set Up A Yarn Workspace? And What Does It Looks Like?</strong></h2><p>Setting up a Yarn Workspace is as easy as running a few commands and making some edits to a few simple pages.</p><h3><strong>The general steps are:</strong></h3><p><strong>1. Create your main project directory with a command like this:</strong></p><p>$ mkdir my-monorepo-workspace</p><p><strong>2. Navigate to the newly created project directory root and create your package.json.</strong></p><p>$ cd my-monorepo-workspace</p><p>$ touch package.json</p><p><strong>3. Replace the contents of your package.json with the following:</strong></p><p>{</p><p>   "private": true,</p><p>   "name": "my-monorepo-workspace",</p><p>   "workspaces": [],</p><p>   "scripts": {}</p><p>}</p><p>This makes the workspace project that we have created private, as we don’t want to upload it to NPM. It also creates the spaces where we will set our workspace project names and our scripts.</p><p><strong>4. Create two project directories within your main directory root, like this:</strong></p><p>$ mkdir project-1 project-2</p><p>Feel free to name these however you want.</p><p><strong>5. Add your project names to the workspace package.json that lives within your root directory:</strong></p><p> {</p><p>   "private": true,</p><p>   "name": "my-monorepo-workspace",</p><p>   "workspaces": [“project-1”, “project-2”],</p><p>   "scripts": {}</p><p>}</p><p>Once set up, these two of our projects will be able to share the same installed NPM packages. </p><p>The above steps have now given us our basic Workspace structure. </p><p>Now we can get started with fully activating our Workspace. Let’s add some real code to it before we do that, to demonstrate how it all works.</p><p>We’ll do this by creating a front end in project-1 and a backend in project-2.</p><p><strong>6. For our front-end in project-1, we’ll use React, which we can install with the following command:</strong></p><p>$ yarn create react-app project-1</p><p><strong>7. For our backend in project-2, we’ll use an </strong><a target="_blank" title="https://expressjs.com/" href="https://expressjs.com/"><strong>Express.js</strong></a><strong> server package. Which we can install by first adding Express Generator to our global package.json like so:</strong></p><p>$ yarn global add express-generator --prefix /usr/local</p><p><strong>Note</strong><strong>:</strong> Notice here that we use ‘yarn global add’ instead of the usual ‘yarn add’, now that we have multiple projects, we need to specify the scope of our installed packages for clarity.</p><p><strong>8. Generate and install the Express package for our server in ‘project 2’ like this:</strong></p><p>$ express --view=pug project-2</p><p>Now that we have set up our react app frontend and our express app backend we can now install all of our dependencies.</p><p><strong>9. Install all of the dependencies like so:</strong></p><p>$ yarn install</p><p>This command generates a yarn.lock file, which contains a note of all of your dependencies. This is generated automatically and should not be deleted.</p><p>Our packages our now installed and should be available to both of our projects within the workspace. </p><p>As a final step, let us now set up some scripts that can run our projects for us concurrently, which is wise to do within a shared workspace, as the core concept is about bringing these two together.</p><p><strong>10. We can set up the two projects to run concurrently by first setting the command within our root package.json like this:</strong></p><p>$ yarn add -W concurrently</p><p>This adds the ‘concurrently’ start script that you’ll see below that runs the two project start scripts concurrently. </p><p>To tell our package.json how we want those scripts to run, add the following:</p><p>{</p><p>   "private": true,</p><p>   "name": "my-monorepo-workspace",</p><p>   "workspaces": [“project-1”, “project-2”],</p><p>   "scripts": {</p><p>   	"project-1": "yarn workspace project-1 start",</p><p>   	"project-2": "yarn workspace project-2 start",</p><p>   	"start": "concurrently --kill-others-on-fail \"yarn project-2\"  \"yarn project-1\"</p><p>   }</p><p>}</p><p>The actual scripts that are necessary to run the projects are within the installations within the project directories.</p><p>Last but not least, change the port name within our project-2 express app directory to port 4000, just to ensure that we don’t get conflicts by running the same port 3000 when we run our two app projects.</p><p><strong>11. We can do that like this, within our server/bin/www on line 15:</strong></p><p>var port = normalizePort(process.env.PORT || '4000');</p><p>Now to run our project, all we need to do is go to our root directory and run:</p><p>$ yarn start</p><p><strong>That’s it, we’re done. </strong></p><p>This has fully set up our Yarn Workspace, and has it running!</p><p><em><strong>If you’d like to read some more on the topic of Yarn Workspaces, as well as monorepo's in general.

  <p><label>Posted on <strong>26 October 2020</strong></label></p><p>An <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=three+weeks&amp;oq=three+weeks">eternity</a> ago, I published a <a href="https://www.peterstefek.me/focused-render.html">blog post</a> about a shader I wrote. In that post, I casually repeated a piece of gpu folklore I picked up as a wee opengl enthusiast almost a decade ago,   </p>
<p>
"Using if statements inside a shader will cause performance degradation."  
</p>

<p>People on the internet seemed a little skeptical about this statement, and I realized my advice might be outdated. So this post is a quick follow up about the cost of branching on more modern gpus.  </p>
<p>Before we talk about branching, what is a gpu? A GPU or graphics processing unit, is a special piece of hardware initially developed to crunch numbers for graphics calculations. It accomplishes this goal quickly through a large amount of parallelization.   </p>
<p>GPUs can run many threads at the same time in parallel. These threads are generally executed in groups called warps (CUDA), invocations (Vulkan) and waves (I will use the term warp, but they are all interchangeable). On recent Nvidia hardware (Ampere/ Volta / Pascal) these warps contain 32 threads. Pascal for example can theoretically run up to four independent instructions per warp over 56 warps of 32 threads which comes out to a mind blowing 7168 instructions per cycle. </p>
<p>Each warp can only execute one instruction at a time. However that instruction can be executed for each of the threads in the warp. This means the GPU can execute 32 copies of the same instruction in parallel for each thread in the warp at once.   </p>
<p>However, taking both sides of a branch will cause the threads inside a warp to "diverge". This means some threads will need to execute one side of the branch and some will need to execute the other. Unfortunately, both instructions can not be executed simultaneously for threads in the same warp. So these divergent instructions must be executed sequentially.   </p>

<p>Consider the <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/WdyyWV">following fragment shader</a>:<br>
<code>
void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )
{  <br>
  </code></p><p><code>
  // TUNE THIS AMOUNT TO YOUR GPU STRENGTH<br>
  int workAmount = 2000;<br>
  float incr = 1. / float(workAmount);<br>
  float outColor = 0.0;  
<p>// USE THIS VARIABLE TO TOGGLE BRANCHING<br>
  bool branch = true;  </p>
<p>if (mod(fragCoord.x, 2.) &lt; 1. &amp;&amp; branch) {
    </p><div><p>
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; workAmount; i++) {
        </p><p>
          outColor += incr;
          </p><p>
      }<br>
      fragColor = vec4(0.0,outColor,0.0,1.0);
      </p></div>
  } else {
    <div><p>
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; workAmount; i++) {
        </p><p>
          outColor += incr;
          </p><p>
      }<br>
      fragColor = vec4(outColor,0.0,0.0,1.0);
      </p></div>
  }
  </code></p><p><code>
}
</code></p>
<p>In fragment shaders like the one above, each warp is composed of a set of spatially close pixels. Each warp in this shader should diverge because each horizontally adjacent pixel takes a different side of the branch. Let's say the cost of each inner loop is n cycles. Since each side of the branch is executed in series, each warp must take at least 2n cycles, even though each thread uses only one side of the branch. These effects scale with the number of threads in the distinct divergent paths taken (up to 32x in Nvidia hardware). Here's another shader which should have roughly four branches per warp. <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/wsVyzG">This shader</a> will take at least 4n cycles.  </p>
<p>However, let's look a <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/tsVyzG">second shader</a>:   </p>
<p><code>
void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )
{
  </code></p><p><code>
  // USE THIS VARIABLE TO TOGGLE BRANCHING<br>
  int workAmount = 2000;<br>
  float incr = 1. / float(workAmount);<br>
  float outColor = 0.0;  
<p>// USE THIS VARIABLE TO TOGGLE BRANCHING<br>
  bool branch = true;  </p>
<p>if (fragCoord.x &lt; iResolution.x / 2.0 &amp;&amp; branch) {
    </p><div><p>
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; workAmount; i++) {
        </p><p>
          outColor += incr;
          </p><p>
      }<br>
      fragColor = vec4(0.0,outColor,0.0,1.0);
    </p></div>
  } else {
    <div><p>
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; workAmount; i++) {
          </p><p>
          outColor += incr;
          </p><p>
      }<br>
      fragColor = vec4(outColor,0.0,0.0,1.0);
      </p></div>
  }
  </code></p><p><code>
}
</code></p>
<p>This shader should run roughly twice as fast as the other shader even though roughly the same number of pixels take each branch. This is because most of the warps do not diverge (with the exception of a few around half way across the screen).   </p>
<p><strong>Nvidia Specifics</strong><br>
As far as I can tell, there are roughly two different ways of nvidia graphics cards handle divergence with in a warp.</p>
<p><strong>Thread Masking (Pre Volta)</strong><br>
On pre volta Nvidia card, divergence was handled by something called thread masking.   </p>
<p>Basically when a conditional is hit, a thread mask is generated.  We can think of this mask as a 32 entry array. Each entry specifies whether the corresponding thread takes the first side of the branch or not. The first side is then executed for each of those threads. After the first side of the branch is then executed, the mask is reversed and the other side of the branch is executed.   </p>
<p>This thread mask strategy exists in part because there is only one program counter per warp on pre volta gpus. So essential every thread in the warp must be at the same place in the program. The only way we know which threads to execute, is by using the mask.</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/shader-branch/pascal-divergence.png" width="65%"> 
</p>

<p>The above image is taken from the Volta whitepaper.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that only the threads which need to execute the branch actually are assigned to computational cores. So if no threads execute one side of the branch, no work is done.</p>
<p><strong>Independent Thread Scheduling (Volta and Beyond)</strong><br>
One big change in the Volta architecture and beyond is the introduction of "Independent Thread Scheduling".   </p>
<p>In Independent thread scheduling, each thread has its own program counter. This allows each warp to track the execution of every thread at a fine grain level. However, we can still only execute only one instruction at a time. So the actual runtime of a branch does not change.  </p>
<p>So if Independent Thread Scheduling does not speed up branching, what does it do? Independent Thread Scheduling enables both sides of a branch to execute concurrently but not in parallel.   </p>
<p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/shader-branch/volta-divergence.png" width="65%"> 
</p>

<p>The above image is taken from the Volta whitepaper.</p>
<p>The reason for this shift is because before Volta, branches were places where deceptive deadlocks could occur. <br>
<code>
leader_id = 0<br>
If (threadIdx.x == leader_id) {<br>
  </code></p><p><code>
    // Do some inital work
  </code></p><p><code>
} else {
  <p>
    // Wait for leader to finish it's work<br>
    // then do my work
  </p>
}<br>
</code></p>
<p>In the above compute shader pseudo code, we have 31 "follower" threads waiting for the "leader thread" to finish (using in-warp shared local memory) before executing their own instructions. </p>
<p>On a Pascal GPU or below, if the else side of the branch is executed first, a deadlock will occur. The leader will never get a chance to start it's work because its followers will be waiting for it. </p>
<p>Independent Thread Scheduling gets around these locking problems by interlacing the two diverging paths. </p>
<p><strong>Article TLDR</strong><br>
Branch divergence in warp makes all parts of the branch execute in sequence which slows down the shader. Branching divergence between warps does not affect runtime.  </p>
<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br>
Branch execution on gpus is surprisingly deep, and there are many edge cases I didn't address and I also didn't touch gpu vendors other than Nvidia. Here are some good sources if you want to learn more:  </p>

            Making a Real-Time NYC Subway Map with Real Weird NYC Subway Data
        </a>
      </h3>
      
            
      <p>Earlier this week the NYC MTA released a new <a href="https://map.mta.info/">digital-first map</a>. The <a href="https://www.curbed.com/2020/10/first-look-new-yorks-digital-subway-map-comes-alive-today.html">Curbed exclusive</a> that announced its release accurately portrays it as a strange child of both the 1972 map design by Massimo Vignelli and the current <a href="https://new.mta.info/map/5256">“paper” map</a>. One feature of the new map (though it's harder than it should be to notice at first) is real-time visualizations of each train in the system.</p>
<p>I've been working on a similar concept, starting in February 2020, on which progress stalled once I stopped riding the subway regularly in March. But, when I started my batch at <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a> I decided to pick up the project again. My inspiration for the map was the large TV screens that the MTA has installed in stations over the last few years, which frustratingly display the “paper” version of the map.</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://www.patrickweaver.net/images/blog/nyc-subway/tv-screen-map.jpg" alt="A photograph of a TV in a subway station with the “paper” map displayed.">
</p>

</figure>
<p>Over the past few weeks at RC the subway map has been my main focus, which is longer than I expected the project to take (and though I have a prototype, I wouldn’t say I’m close to “done”). A big factor in the time the project has taken is some of the quirks in working with MTA data, which based on some of the bugs I've seen in the "official" version I'd say the team working on that version had to grapple with as well.  I'm not sure I will ever finish this project to a state that would look great on a subway station tv, or be useful, but I do want to point out <a href="https://www.theweekendest.com/trains">The Weekendest</a> by <a href="https://sunny.ng/">Sunny Ng</a> (who also made <a href="https://www.goodservice.io/">goodservice.io</a>), which is a great take on the concept, and handles some of the challenges of this kind of project much better than the MTA map does.</p>
<p>For a long time the NYC Subway was almost <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/11/why-dont-we-know-where-all-the-trains-are/415152/">completely lacking in real-time data</a>. For many years the only line that had even countdown clocks in stations was the L, which seems to be the line the MTA tries out new technology on, likely because it never shares tracks with any other line. Over the last 5 years the MTA has slowly installed countdown clocks in every station, and made the data that powers the countdown clocks available on their website, in apps, and as data online.</p>
<p>Inspired and frustrated by the “paper” maps on the tv screens, I first became interested in working with MTA data in 2018, but I initially started working with bus data, I think for two reasons: the first was because at the time the API key for working with bus data was easier to obtain than for subway data, the second because my morning commute at the time usually started with the bus (The MTA, earlier this year, has fortunately updated the system for obtaining an API key for subway data). I made a small prototype of an iPhone app that would show real-time bus data, but got distracted by learning the Swift programming language and abandoned the project without building functionality beyond what the MTA already provided <a href="https://bustime.mta.info/">on their bustime website</a>.</p>
<p>That MTA Bustime website was the other inspiration for what became my map idea. Though you could only view one route at a time (and the functionality is not available on phone-size devices), the Bustime website showed, in addition to countdowns for each stop, the physical location of each bus on a map. This leads us to the first weird thing about working with NYC Subway data, unlike real-time bus data, the subway data does not contain the latitude and longitude data for each train that would make it easy to show them on a map.</p>
<h3>Real-Time Transit Data</h3>
<p>Transit data for most transit systems is available in formats called <a href="https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs">GTFS</a> (General Transit Feed Specification) and <a href="https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime">GTFS Realtime</a>, which were developed by Google (makes you wonder what the “G” originally stood for), but are now widely used. A GTFS file is, “a collection of at least six, and up to 13 CSV files (with extension .txt) contained within a .zip file.” and “The GTFS Realtime data exchange format is based on Protocol Buffers” (which are <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">“Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data”</a>).</p>
<p>The GTFS Realtime feeds are available through 9 different API endpoints from the MTA. These 9 endpoints roughly correspond to the line colors, with Shuttles combined with trains they share tracks or stations with, and the 1/2/3 and 4/5/6 sharing one endpoint. This list of separate endpoints is another challenge with working with the entirety of the MTA data.</p>
<p>I have exclusively worked with the NYC MTA’s GTFS Realtime feeds through the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gtfs-realtime-bindings">npm module</a> maintained by Google. It is very possible that some of the challenges I’ve encountered are due to trying to squeeze the “extensible mechanism for serializing structured data” into JSON. Each API response is mostly composed of an array of "Feed Entity" objects like <a href="https://www.patrickweaver.net/notes/nyc-subway-feed-entity/">these</a>, but there are a few quirks to working with this data (some maybe because of the JSON conversion).</p>
<ul>
<li>Each item in the array has an <code>id</code> property, but unfortunately these ids do not consistently refer to the same train between each update, it's best to ignore it.</li>
<li>The array consists of pairs of objects that either have a <code>tripUpdate</code> property or a <code>vehicle</code> property. Each of these have a sub-property called <code>tripId</code> that allows you to unite the pairs, but there are also some that don't have a corresponding item (usually these represent trips that recently ended or haven't yet begun).</li>
<li>The data mixes together HH:MM:SS timestamps for data about when a train's trip started, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">Unix timestamps</a> for data about the current time (according to the API) and when a train will arrive at a station (the API provides both arrival and departure times but as far as I have seen they are always identical).</li>
<li><code>tripUpdate</code> items show information about the stops a train will make in the future (stopTimeUpdates) and vehicle items show information about the current status of the train, but the first <code>stopTimeUpdate</code> is usually in the past.</li>
</ul>
<p>I had never heard of Protocol Buffers before starting this project, so I was excited to learn more about them while reading through <a href="https://dataintensive.net/">Designing Data Intensive Applications</a> with fellow Recursers.  In the book Martin Kleppmann notes that a, "curious detail of Protocol Buffers is that it does not have a list or array datatype, but instead has a repeated marker for fields (which is a third option alongside required and optional)." This could be the reason for the strange organization of the <code>tripUpdate</code> and <code>vehicle</code> properties.</p>
<h3>Calculating Train Locations</h3>
<p>The subway real-time API doesn’t have latitude and longitude data because it is designed to feed data to countdown clock style applications that show when the train will be at a specific station. One of the earliest features that I built into the real-time map was a way to translate these station-by-station countdown clocks into an approximation of the location of each train. My first attempt at this was to just show a list of stations and display an icon for a train between the names of the station it had been at previously and the station it was approaching.</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://www.patrickweaver.net/images/blog/nyc-subway/prototype-diagram.png" alt="An early prototype diagram of G train positions.">
</p>
<figcaption>A first prototype, still available at: <a href="https://nyc-subway-g.glitch.me/">nyc-subway-g.glitch.me</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The next step was plotting the stations on a map. To start off, as with the diagram version, I just placed each train at the midpoint between the station it was travelling from and the station it was travelling towards.</p>
<p>A goal I had for the project was not just to show real-time train locations, but to animate them as they moved around the map. To determine how long I should expect a train to take to travel between each station I logged updates from the MTA API for a few hours and noted both the average time for a pair of stations, and the longest time I had seen for the pair. I'm still experimenting a little bit with what values to use as the baseline, but from looking at the logged numbers there does seem to be an expected amount of time for most stations.</p>

  <p><span>08 Apr 2020</span></p><p>When you run the Ubuntu installer, there’s an option to dual-boot Ubuntu with an
existing Windows installation. There’s also an option to encrypt your Ubuntu
installation, but <em>only if you erase everything and install ubuntu</em>. There’s no
automatic way to install Ubuntu alongside Windows 10 with encryption. And while
there are plenty of tutorials for dual-booting Ubuntu and Windows, many of them
are outdated – often referencing an MBR partition table – and almost none of
them seem to address encrypting your Ubuntu partition.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dual-booting with encrypted storage should not be this hard in 2020.</p>

  <p>–Me, while figuring out how to do this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In reality, once you figure it out, it’s not that hard. The tricky thing is that
this isn’t well-documented <strong>anywhere</strong>! So I’m hoping to fix that with this
tutorial blog post. Honestly, if you know enough about Ubuntu to set up a
dual-boot with Windows, it’s only a little bit harder to do it with encryption.
I prepared this tutorial on a Dell Latitude e7450, and I fine-tuned it when I
tested it on my Dell Precision 5510. So it should work with almost no
modification on most Dell systems, and with only minor modifications
(particularly around BIOS setup) on most other types of computers.</p>

<h2 id="references">References</h2>

<p>To write this guide, I compiled information from several sources. Here are some
of the most useful references I found:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://gist.github.com/luispabon/db2c9e5f6cc73bb37812a19a40e137bc">XPS 15 9560 Dual-Boot with Encryption Notes</a>,
by <a href="https://gist.github.com/luispabon">luispabon</a>. I followed these notes pretty
closely, but modified some partition sizes and names based on other guides.</li>
  <li><a href="https://gist.github.com/mdziekon/221bdb597cf32b46c50ffab96dbec08a">XPS 15 9570 Dual-Boot with Encryption Notes</a>,
by <a href="https://gist.github.com/mdziekon">mdziekon</a>, upon which the above is based.</li>
  <li><a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Full_Disk_Encryption_Howto_2019">Full Disk Encryption HowTo 2019</a>,
from the Ubuntu Community Wiki. This is a great resource, but deals with
encryption without dual-booting.</li>
  <li><a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ManualFullSystemEncryption">Manual Full System Encryption</a>,
from the Ubuntu Community Wiki. This is longer, and isn’t focused on
dual-booting, but provides great details on the way certain things work.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is worth noting that this method doesn’t encrypt <code>/boot</code>. While there are
valid reasons for encrypting /boot, the graphical installer does not encrypt it
when you do a graphical install with LUKS. As such, I’m matching that precedent,
and keeping the simplicity of an unencrypted /boot partition. Thus, the guide
I’ve compiled below is just about the <strong>simplest way to have a LUKS encryption
with dual-boot.</strong></p>

<h2 id="why-encryption-is-important">Why encryption is important</h2>

<p>I began using encrypted storage on all my personal computers 5 or 6 years ago
after noticing that all the companies I’d worked for required it, and had good
reason to. Laptops get lost and stolen all the time. They’re high-value items
that are small and easy to carry. And when a thief gets your laptop, there’s
tons of valuable information on it that they can use or sell. Even if you use a
password to log in, it’s easy for an attacker to gain access to your data if
your disk isn’t encrypted – for example, by using a live USB stick. And once
they have that data, they might get access to online accounts, bank statements,
emails, and tons of other data. For me, an encrypted hard disk isn’t optional
anymore – its a necessity.</p>

<h2 id="an-overview">An Overview</h2>

<p>So what are we going to do? This tutorial will help you set up a system to
<strong>dual-boot Ubuntu 20.04 and Windows 10</strong>. (I haven’t tested it, but it should
work with most other modern versions (~16.04+) of Ubuntu or Windows.) The system
will use a GPT hard disk with UEFI (your BIOS must support UEFI). The Ubuntu
partition will be encrypted with LUKS.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> The Windows partition can optionally
be encrypted with BitLocker. I’m going to keep the Ubuntu installation as close
to a “default” installation as possible – no fancy tricks like a separate
<code>/home</code> partition, but it should be somewhat easy to add that yourself if you
really want to.</p>

<p>I’m going to start with a blank hard disk, installing both Windows 10 and Ubuntu
from scratch. If you already have Windows installed and you want to keep it, you
should be able to shrink your windows partition and join us in phase 3 (though
you might want to skim phases 1 and 2 to understand what we did).</p>

<p>To give you a broad overview of where we’re headed, here’s what we’re going to
do:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Prepare the installation media and computer</li>
  <li>Install Windows 10</li>
  <li>Create an encrypted partition for Ubuntu</li>
  <li>Install Ubuntu</li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, as with any new OS installation, you should back up any important
data before proceeding. <strong>The instructions below will erase all the data on your
hard disk.</strong> Proceed at your own risk; I’m not responsible for any damage or
data loss.</p>



<p>Since we’re installing both Windows 10 and Ubuntu from scratch, we’ll need a USB
stick for each. If you don’t already have a computer running Ubuntu or Windows,
making the installation media will be a little harder – but there are tutorials
for that and I’ll let you figure it out on your own.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a Windows Installer USB stick.  The easiest way is to use the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/">Windows
10 Media Creation Tool</a> from a
computer that’s already running Windows.</li>
  <li>Create an Ubuntu 20.04 USB stick. The easiest way is to <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop">download the
ISO</a> and use the Startup Disk Creator on a
computer that’s already running Ubuntu.</li>
</ol>

<p>Great! We’ve got our USB sticks ready to go! One final thing before we get
started – we need to make sure our BIOS is set up correctly. In particular, we
want to make sure we’re using UEFI to boot our OS.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="https://www.mikekasberg.com/images/dual-boot-encryption/dell-bios.jpg" alt="The Dell BIOS"></p>

<ol start="3">
  <li>Ensure your computer is running the latest BIOS available. This is important
because an out-of-date BIOS can have bugs, and those bugs sometimes affect
things like UEFI, non-Windows operating systems, or other components we’ll be
touching.</li>
  <li>Edit your BIOS settings. The following names are probably specific to Dell
BIOS, but other manufacturers will have similar settings.
    <ol>
      <li>Under <code>General</code> and <code>Boot Sequence</code>, make sure your <code>Boot
List Option</code> is set to <code>UEFI</code>.</li>
      <li>Under <code>General</code> and <code>Advanced Boot Options</code>, I disabled
<code>Legacy Option ROMs</code>. It’s important that both OSes install in UEFI mode.
(You can probably enable this when installation is complete if you care).</li>
      <li>Under <code>Security</code>, <code>TPM Security</code> must be enabled if you
want to easily set up BitLocker in Windows.</li>
      <li>I disabled <code>Secure Boot</code>. I’m not sure if this is absolutely required, and
you can try leaving it on or re-enabling it when you’re done if you want.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Now that our BIOS is configured for UEFI, we’re going to set up our hard disk.</p>

<div>
<p><b>For this tutorial, your BIOS must support UEFI!</b></p>
<p>Most modern computers support this, but if yours doesn't this tutorial won't
work for you. You should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Installing only Linux with encryption using the graphical installer.</li>
  <li>OR Installing only Windows with encryption.</li>
  <li>OR Dual-booting Linux and Windows without encryption using Ubuntu's graphical installer.</li>
  <li>OR Finding another tutorial or figuring out how to do this with an MBR disk.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<ol start="5">
  <li><strong>Completely erase</strong> your hard disk and set it up for UEFI by doing the
following.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>
    <ol>
      <li>Boot your Ubuntu USB stick and use <code>Try without installing</code>.</li>
      <li>Open a terminal. Make it fullscreen while you’re at it.</li>
      <li>Figure out what your primary hard disk is called. It will probably be
either <code>/dev/sda</code> or <code>/dev/nvme0n1</code>. Importantly, it’s <strong>not</strong> <code>/dev/sda1</code> or
<code>/dev/nvme0n1p1</code> – those are partitions of the disk. One way to figure out what
yours is called is to run <code>lsblk</code> and look at the disk size. Throughout the rest
of this guide, I’m going to refer to <code>/dev/sda</code>. <strong>If yours is not
<code>/dev/sda</code>, replace <code>/dev/sda</code> with your own (perhaps <code>/dev/sdb</code> or
<code>/dev/nvme0n1</code>) for the rest of this guide.</strong></li>
      <li>
        <p>Run the following commands. This will initialize the drive as a GPT drive
and create a 550M EFI system partition formatted as FAT32.</p>

        <div><div><pre><code>$ sudo su
# sgdisk --zap-all /dev/sda
# sgdisk --new=1:0:+550M /dev/sda
# sgdisk --change-name=1:EFI /dev/sda
# sgdisk --typecode=1:ef00 /dev/sda
# mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/sda1
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>OK, phase 1’s complete. We have our installation media ready to go and the
computer’s BIOS and hard drive is set up correctly. Next, we’ll install Windows.</p>

<h2 id="phase-2-install-windows">Phase 2: Install Windows</h2>

<p>In this phase, we’re going to install Windows. Note that when we do this, we’re
going to leave some unallocated space to install Linux later. This is a good
approach because the Windows installer will mess with our partitions a little
bit, and its easier to let it do so before finalizing our Linux partitions.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.mikekasberg.com/images/dual-boot-encryption/windows-installer.jpg" alt="The Windows installer"></p>

<ol>
  <li>Boot from your Windows Installer USB stick.</li>
  <li>Choose a <code>Custom (advanced)</code> install to get to the Windows partitioning tool.</li>
  <li>Create a new partition. The size of this partition should be the amount of
disk space you want to use for Windows. In this example, I did 80G since the SSD
on my computer is relatively small. If unsure, do about half of your hard
disk.</li>
  <li>Windows will warn you that it is going to create an extra system partition.
This is good.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></li>
  <li>Install Windows onto the partition you just made. There’s no need to format
any partitions – the Windows installer will take care of that for you.</li>
  <li>When the Windows installation is finished, log in and enable BitLocker on
drive <code>C:</code>. This will automatically create yet another partition on your disk
(a Windows recovery partition) - which is why we’re doing it before
partitioning for Ubuntu.</li>
</ol>

<p>At this point, you can start using Windows. But I’d avoid doing too much setup
or personalization yet so you don’t have to do it again if something goes wrong
below. If you want to double check your partitions, this is what you’ll be left
with after installing Windows and enabling BitLocker:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo sgdisk --print /dev/sda
Disk /dev/sda: 500118192 sectors, 238.5 GiB

Number  Start (sector)    End (sector)  Size       Code  Name
   1            2048         1128447   550.0 MiB   EF00  EFI
   2         1128448         1161215   16.0 MiB    0C01  Microsoft reserved ...
   3         1161216       167825076   79.5 GiB    0700  Basic data partition
   4       167825408       168900607   525.0 MiB   2700
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="phase-3-partition-the-drive-for-ubuntu">Phase 3: Partition the drive for Ubuntu</h2>

<p>This is the trickiest phase since this is where we need to manually set up our
encrypted disks for Ubuntu. We’re going to make it work very similar to …</p></div></div>

The players were physically and mentally stronger, and far more mature. The coaching was more intense, the fitness requirements whizzed up a notch, and everything seemed to shift from 0 to 60 extremely quickly.</span></p><p id="viewer-7skt"><span>One of the players on the team was phenomenal. In my first game for the side, he walked in to bat and hit 5 fours off his first 5 balls. He was retired and he walked off the field as if nothing had happened. It was magic. That was my first encounter with a wizard. </span></p><p id="viewer-3gk1g"><span>Wizards do work that is not only brilliant in its own right but work that makes everyone around them better. Our team was filled with an unrivalled sense of confidence. It's what makes wizards valuable. It's why we want to be wizards. </span></p><p id="viewer-c3is3"><span>That season was a phenomenal experience. Even though we were on the same team, and logically we were playing at the same level, it seemed like the skills required were completely different. You couldn’t compare my abilities with his. I improved more in that season than in any other.</span></p><p id="viewer-aao0e"><span>It leads me to wonder how one person on one team helped me produce good work for years to come. <strong>The best explanation I’ve come across is tacit knowledge.</strong> Tacit knowledge is the knowledge and skills we pick up from the people around us and i<!-- -->t plays a disproportionately large role in doing good work. </span></p><p id="viewer-1ugo0"><span>Tacit knowledge is challenging to wrap your head around. This anecdote from an </span><a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-tacit-knowledge-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>essay series</u></span></a><span> on the topic provides context:</span></p><blockquote id="viewer-1mt6r"><span>“Gallwey (a tennis coach) relays the story of teaching a student without explicit instruction: “I was going to skip entirely my usual explanations to beginning players about the proper grip, stroke and footwork for the basic forehand. Instead, I was going to hit ten forehands myself, and I wanted him to watch carefully, not thinking about what I was doing, but simply trying to grasp a visual image of the forehand. He was to repeat the image in his mind several times and then just let his body imitate.” 

It worked. Gallwey concluded: “I was beginning to learn what all good pros and students of tennis must learn: <strong>that images are better than words, showing better than telling, too much instruction worse than none, and that trying often produces negative results.”</strong></span></blockquote><p id="viewer-7j54h"><span>Tacit knowledge is knowledge that cannot be captured through words alone. It’s what’s on display when you ask someone how they did something and they tell you that "it just felt right.” </span></p><p id="viewer-2rjc9"><span><strong>Tacit knowledge is a catalyst that transforms average people with average skills into people with the intuition and know-how to produce good work. It’s not to say that you can’t do good work without it, but you’re far more likely to succeed with it and as a result of it. </strong></span></p><p id="viewer-6i9ji"><span>When learning a new skill, your tacit knowledge resources start at zero. Over time they increase and the quality of your work increases with them. Time spent with wizards reduces the effort required to develop tacit knowledge and produce good work. Why? Because when learning, images are better than words, showing better than telling, and too much instruction worse than none. When you question and imitate wizards, you learn extremely quickly. You place yourself on the shortest path to doing good work. </span></p><p id="viewer-c09e3"><span>It happens because stress elicits growth. Place your body under stress and it’ll overshoot and overprepare in response. It’s how you get stronger and more capable. Do it often enough and good work becomes your default. </span></p><p id="viewer-81jj0"><span>In theory, it’s simple: place yourself under sufficient stress to elicit desired growth. In practice, it’s more complicated. Imagine I went to the gym every day and pushed myself as hard as I could. I’d see growth, but would it be the most growth I’m capable of? Probably not. My biological and nutritional knowledge would let me down, and it would be far tougher to remain motivated when in pursuit of this goal by myself. </span></p><p id="viewer-2rdj8"><span>Intellectual and career growth works in the same way. I can push myself to read more books and learn new skills. I’ll grow, but will I reach the levels I’m capable of without the right environment? Probably not. <!-- -->To get a more accurate picture of the type of growth you’re capable of, you need to be in an environment that fosters and values growth. </span></p><p id="viewer-5dmef"><span>Tobi Lutke, CEO of Shopify, began an apprenticeship at the age of 16.

October 27, 2020 | https://linus.coffee/note/no-code/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://linus.coffee/note/no-code/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>To talk about what no-code is good for, we need to first take a digression on what makes no-code fundamentally different from “yes-code” software.</p>
<h2 id="the-grain-of-abstractions">The grain of abstractions</h2>
<p>Software – yes-code software – has been around for a while. One of the things we’ve learned as an industry is how to write software <em>that gracefully evolves</em>. We’re not perfect – sad, legacy systems still proliferate – but we as a technical industry have learned how to build and evolve software systems against changing requirements and constraints that span years and decades.</p>
<p>When we first solve a problem with software, we write some code against the constraints of that particular day. We don’t necessarily know how the problem is going to change. Maybe there will be different customers or stakeholders tomorrow, or maybe the product will expand to serve a related, but different, problem space. We need to be able to change software to accommodate changing circumstances without rewriting it, and that is fundamentally what <em>software engineering</em> is: how to change software systems. <em>Change</em> is the name of the game.</p>
<p>We’ve gotten decent at change. We’ve built tools like Git and patterns like continuous integration and code autoformatting to make it easier to change code and remain stable. We’ve learned how to operate large software teams, especially in open source. We’ve also learned to use better abstractions. Abstractions are conceptual wrappers that isolate different parts of a codebase – say, a data source from a user interface – so that one part may change while another doesn’t. In general we have started to figure out how to make the DNA of software systems resilient against the changing tides of time.</p>
<p>No-code seems to reject a lot of those learnings, for better or worse. I haven’t seen any no-code company or product that allows source control (and I’ve seen many no-code companies, but you’re welcome to prove me wrong.) I have yet to find no-code products that allow for natural construction of abstraction between layers of a no-code workflow. No-code software is also scarily ill-prepared for large scale development: we have software systems being worked on by tens of thousands of engineers – what does it look like for a team of 1000 engineers to be working on a set of thousands of no-code workflows? Chaos.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Traditional software has learned the abstractions and patterns that make software resilient and adaptable to change and scale. No-code software is not ready for changing constraints nor development scale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite these limitations, I think no-code has a few niches where making tradeoffs in adaptability and scale allows no-code tools to be much, much better. So, given this, <em>when is no-code useful?</em></p>
<h2 id="1-transitionary-ephemeral-software">1. Transitionary, ephemeral software</h2>
<p>The obvious answer, and one I had before our conversation, was <em>transitionary</em> software, software with <em>a defined lifetime</em>. If your software system has a finite, pre-defined lifetime and team, it doesn’t need to worry about changing constraints or team growth. It just needs to worry about solving a problem well, now.</p>
<p>Lots of software has predictably finite lifetime: a product prototype for an early-stage company, a game or app used as a part of an interactive online ad, a quick sketch or solution to patch a particularly urgent problem in a product, an app built for an event or a conference or a recruiting cycle or a quarterly goal tracker… all of these are projects with a pre-defined, maximum lifetime. They don’t need to last or grow or change – they just need to work now, and by giving up some of the adaptability of software abstractions of code, no-code software benefits from way faster prototyping speed. This is a plus.</p>
<p>I think we see lots of finite-time software in transitions. Transitions from having no product to having a product, in a prototype. Transitions in the process of brainstorming a solution and trying multiple designs. Software with a finite shelf life is a good fit for no-code tools.</p>
<h2 id="2-high-churn-code">2. High-churn code</h2>
<p>There’s another category of software for which long-term maintainability matters little – code with high churn.</p>
<p>By high churn, I mean that requirements are changing almost daily, and very little of the code written today will exist in a month or a quarter’s time. If the code you write today doesn’t have to last and evolve, because something new is going to take its place tomorrow, what matters is the speed to build, not resilience to change.</p>
<p>There’s lots of high-churn code in businesses. Marketing websites and landing pages, data pipelines for analytics, e-commerce storefronts, marketing campaigns, payment portals – requirements for these kinds of solutions change quickly enough that code is constantly being rewritten, and if code needs to <em>be replaced</em> more than it needs to <em>last</em>, no-code tools are a great fit.</p>
<h2 id="avoiding-the-same-mistakes">Avoiding the same mistakes</h2>
<p>I think “no-code” is a misnomer. It leads us to think that no-code software is the start of a trend in which general software will involve less coding, and software engineering will become easier. This is not the case. Software engineering is not about building solutions, it’s about evolving them. But change resiliency over time is not the focus of no-code tools, and I think that’s ok.</p>
<p>I think no-code tools are instead an extension of a different trend: <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/text/">reifying workflows</a>. Business processes and workflows used to be documented in Word docs strewn about the office or on a shared folder, or even just passed down by oral tradition in companies. Now, we have tools that allow us to build these workflows, talk about them, edit them, and share them more concretely. This is a huge boon for more repeatable business processes and for getting things done quickly! I think this is the true win of no-code tools: concretizing workflows.</p>
<p>If no-code wants to be a serious competitor against “traditional” software – though I don’t think it should try – no-code needs to learn from the mistakes of early software. No-code tools need to understand that products and software systems need to live on for decades against changing teams and requirements, and against products and companies and standards that die out and get replaced. This requires a cultural shift, a tooling shift, and a new class of abstractions in our toolbelt as no-code engineers. Anytime we try to introduce more tooling and abstraction to no-code, I think no-code gets just a little more “code” in it. And perhaps that’ll bring us right back to where we started, discovering that code is good.</p>
<p>After all, the world is complex. And when we build software against the complexity of the world, that <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/complexity-conservation/">complexity needs to go somewhere</a>. Software is complex, but only as much as the world it attempts to make sense of.</p>
<p>It feels like we’re getting off the edge of a discovery phase of no-code, and into a time when we’re starting to understand what problems no-code tools are great for. I think it’s important that no-code tool builders focus on those strengths, or risk falling into the trap of repeating the software industry’s mistakes from the ground up.</p>

<h2>OfferMarket launched today on Product Hunt, and we failed miserably.</h2>

<div><p>
We tried launching on Product Hunt today, if that's what you'll call it. We half-assed it. We put together our launch post and asked a few friends to upvote.&nbsp;<span>6 hours in and we have 3 referrals to our site from Product Hunt.</span></p><p>

One person we asked for an upvote replied "I just like sold my soul to give you an upvote", here's what they were referring to in the sign up with Twitter authentication flow:
</p></div>

<div>
<p><a><img src="https://www.offermarket.us/uploads/1/3/1/0/131040874/published/twitter-authorize-an-application-copy.jpg?1603845762" alt="Picture"></a></p>
</div>
</div>



<p>
Then we tried to have some people find us on Product Hunt, but they couldn't because their search doesn't work...<br>
</p>

<div>
<div>
<p><a><img src="https://www.offermarket.us/uploads/1/3/1/0/131040874/published/producthunt-offermarket-search-no-results.png?1603845954" alt="Picture"></a></p>
</div>
</div>



<div><p>
So that's when we realized we probably were not going to be raising much awareness on Product Hunt this time around. It also made it clear that Product Hunt either has some bugs or performance issues, or the only people whose product launches percolate to the top of the daily rankings do one or both of the following:</p><ul>
<li>know a lot of people already on Product Hunt and build a following on Product Hunt before launch</li>

<li>coerce a lot of friends, family and others for upvotes</li>
</ul><p>
Which doesn't lend much credibility to the platform as a utility for finding valuable tools.</p><p>

Moving on then. We'll try again next time. We hope you enjoyed our post-mortem and how not to launch on Product Hunt.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I had a few goals in my first few days of vacation:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Figure out GitHub Actions.</li>
<li>Try out <a href="https://tidymodels.org/"><code>tidymodels</code></a> , after being inspired by a R in Pharma talk on the <code>stacks</code> package.</li>
<li>Investigate this whole MLOps thing, and by investigate I meant <em>try it</em>, I did NOT go on vacation to read more Gartner Garbage ™️ .</li>
</ol>
<p>As luck would have it, <a href="https://twitter.com/DrElleOBrien">@DrElleOBrien</a> happened to reach out about trying <a href="https://twitter.com/DrElleOBrien">DVC</a> with R. DVC is a framework for MLOps that can use GitHub actions, so I had the perfect excuse to knock out all three goals with one sample project.</p>
<p>If you don’t want the rambling story, here is the project: <a href="https://github.com/slopp/tidydvc">https://github.com/slopp/tidydvc</a>.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<h3 id="dvc">DVC</h3>
<p><a href="https://dvc.org/">DVC</a>, and its close companion <a href="https://cml.dev/">CML</a>, provide tools for model management - think Git for data and models. The core idea is that a DVC pipeline tracks the input (files, data, hyper-parameters) to an experiment and the output of an experiment (model, metrics, etc). DVC can be used locally, but the real magic is that DVC can be combined with something like GitHub and GitHub actions to automate the experiment management. Just like a software engineer could create a PR to propose a change to code, a data scientist could create a PR to propose a change to a model. But, unlike in software engineering where the goal of a PR is to review and automatically test code changes, in ModelOps the goal of the PR would be to train a model and explain the outcome!</p>
<p>DVC is primarily built around Python, but I wanted to see if it could be used with R. In many ways it shares some of the principles of the <code>drake</code> (now <code>targets</code>) package, but with some added Git ✨.</p>
<h3 id="tidymodels">Tidymodels</h3>
<p><a href="https://tidymodels.org/">Tidymodels</a> is an opinionated workflow for model construction in R<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. It is kind of like scikit learn in the sense that many different algorithms are presented with a consistent interface.</p>
<p>A few interesting bits about tidymodels:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>There is a concept of a <code>workflow</code> that allows you to track a model’s pre-processing steps and the model itself in one easy-to-use object. This turns out to be super helpful, though a bit at odds with DVC (or drake)’s concept of a pipeline… more to come.</li>
<li>There are easy ways to <code>tune</code> hyper-parameters. Again, very helpful, but potentially at odds with external ModelOps-y things that want to control those elements.</li>
<li>There is experimental support for <a href="https://github.com/tidymodels/stacks">ensembles</a>, which is what I wanted to try!</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://loppsided.blog/posts/2020-10-26-tidymodels-dvc-mashup/images/paste-5761E6A6.png" title="The Delightful stacks Logo" alt="The Delightful stacks Logo"><br>
</p>
<h3 id="mashup">Mashup</h3>
<p>Aside from learning the individual pieces, I wanted to see if it was possible to glue these different ecosystems together. As I hinted at above, however, there were some surface level concerns. It wasn’t clear to me if I could define clean boundaries between the concepts <code>tidymodels</code> wanted to control and what DVC expected to own. But the goal of PRs with beautiful <code>ggplots</code>was enticing. (Famous last words).</p>
<p>Final note, I also enjoy using R Markdown as a framework for data exploration and model creation. I find R Markdown encourages “thinking while coding”. I definitely wanted R Markdown to play a role.</p>
<p>If you are interested in this type of mashup but want to play mostly in R, I highly recommend this article by David Neuzerling: <a href="https://mdneuzerling.com/post/machine-learning-pipelines-with-tidymodels-and-targets/">Machine Learning Pipelines with Tidymodels and Targets</a>.</p>
<h2 id="unstacking-stacks">Unstacking Stacks</h2>
<div><p>I began by creating an R Markdown document that roughly followed the outline of this <a href="https://stacks.tidymodels.org/articles/basics.html">stacks tutorial</a>. To spice things up, I decided to use the Ames Housing data, so my goal was to create an ensemble that predicted housing prices. You can follow the <a href="https://github.com/slopp/tidydvc/blob/main/fit_model.Rmd">code here</a>. Because one of my goals was to try tidymodels, here are some notes for future me on what I learned.</p></div>
<h3 id="dont-skip-eda">Don’t skip EDA</h3>
<p>I didn’t want to just copy code from Max’s <a href="https://www.tidymodels.org/learn/models/parsnip-ranger-glmnet/">parsnip regression tutorial</a> so instead I opted to write my own formula regressing on different predictors<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. I thought I could do this without any EDA. MISTAKE. I lost at least 2 hours fighting models that wouldn’t converge because my data was either incomplete or my pre-processing was non-sensical. I still am not happy with the results, but I did learn a valuable tactic. <em>When defining a recipe that will be used further down the line in a workflow, it is still a good idea (though not required) to prep and juice the recipe.</em> Essentially, this optional juicing allows you to SEE how the recipe is applied to your training dataset and troubleshoot any errors in a friendly space, as opposed to an unfriendly space (which is what I call a stack trace from the middle of a cross validation optimization routine that has failed because of a <code>NA</code>).</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<pre><code>
# First define the recipe
housing_rec &lt;- recipe(SalePrice ~ ...) %&gt;% 
  update_role(PID, new_role = "ID") %&gt;% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal()) %&gt;%  
  step_meanimpute(all_numeric()) %&gt;% 
  step_zv(all_predictors()) %&gt;% 
  step_nzv(all_predictors())

# Check it!
housing_rec %&gt;% 
  prep() %&gt;% 
  juice()

# Then do the rest of your workflow magic
housing_wflow &lt;- 
  workflow() %&gt;% 
  add_recipe(housing_rec)</code></pre>
</div>
<p><em>Tune</em></p>
<p>Tuning is easy. Getting the model out of the tune to actually use… a little less intuitive. As with all things, I should have started by reading <a href="https://juliasilge.com/blog/sf-trees-random-tuning/">Julia Silge’s advice</a>. Essentially there are a couple things you (future me) need to know:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>You create a model spec and stick it in a workflow:</li>
</ol>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<pre><code>
# PS - for those who learned penalized regression through glmnet
# penalty = lambda 
# mixture = alpha
model_spec &lt;- linear_reg(penalty = tune("penalty"), mixture = tune("mixture"))

# the workflow ties your model to your pre-processing
model_wflow &lt;- 
  workflow() %&gt;% 
  add_recipe(preprocess_data) %&gt;% 
  add_model(model_spec)</code></pre>
</div>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>You can tune the model<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> using a grid:</li>
</ol>

<li>BUT, at this point, <em>you have to finalize the actual best model</em>. Or in the case of an ensemble, you have to finalize <em>many</em> models.

<p>At different points of this process it can be easy to forget what is trained and what is still a placeholder. The print methods are really good, use them.</p>
<h3 id="stacks">Stacks</h3>
<p>My final goal was to fit an ensemble model. Unfortunately, I hit an error using the <code>stacks</code> package. I suspect this error was due to the fact that the package is experimental and I had some stale dependencies. This left me between a rock and, well, another rock. I could have tried to nuke my environment and fight with <code>remotes</code> to install a bunch of development tidymodels packages. (This was made harder by the WIP change to <code>main</code> from <code>master</code> 👏). Or I could try to push forward by working around the error with my own ensemble code. I went for the latter path, and refreshed a lot of my statistical thinking along the way. (Recall <code>%*%</code> is how to do matrix multiplication in R). But I also killed 5 hours of vacation. 🤷 I will spare you and my future self the details in the hope that the error is fixed, but a few conceptual tips:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The <code>stacks()</code> object starts with candidate models (from <code>tune_grid</code>) or a single model but with multiple fits (from <code>fit_resamples</code>). The magic this function does is align the different models based on the resample they used. In other words, if one candidate was fit on resample 1, it is matched with another candidate fit on resample 1. The same matching occurs within tuning configurations from a single model.<br>
</li>
<li>Under the hood, the ensemble is fit with glmnet, but buried in quite a few layers of tidymodels abstraction. <code>cv.glmnet</code> works as an alternative, but with a nasty side affect. You have to do all the work manually to get a final fitted object that glues all the prior models, workflows, and the ensemble together.<br>
</li>
<li>When those nice print methods I mentioned earlier fail, try <code>attributes</code> to see “all the stuff” tidymodels is carrying around.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-mashup">The Mashup</h2>
<h3 id="adding-dvc">Adding DVC</h3>
<p><br>
Once I had a functional R Markdown document that was fitting models, it was time to try this ModelOps thing. Now ModelOps can consist of a lot of things, but in this case I was interested in trying out the training side of model operations - tracking experiments and enabling collaboration. I’ll save the monitoring side - deploying models to production and watching them overtime - for another vacation.</p>
<div><p>DVC is oriented around pipelines. Unfortunately, this appeared to clash a bit with my R Markdown workflow. For one, the R Markdown document “drove” all the modeling code, and this code was not amenable to being managed by an external pipeline. Another problem was that the tidymodels packages, especially <code>tune</code> and <code>stacks,</code> handled the parameters and “experiments” that DVC wanted to control.</p><p>

I decided to mostly ignore the first challenge. If my data was large, or the pre-processing intense, I think I would have benefited from breaking the R Markdown document into child documents that could each be a stage in a pipeline. In this case, I didn’t care for the extra overhead in saving intermediate results, and things were fast enough that I didn’t mind re-running steps from scratch. As I mentioned, I am advocate for using R Markdown instead of .R files even in the multi-stage approach. You an see an example of this <a href="https://github.com/sol-eng/bike_predict">“split it up” approach here</a>.</p></div>
<p>For the second problem, I decided to go with a hyper-hyper-parameter strategy. Essentially, I allowed <code>tune</code> and tidymodels to handle the hyper-parameter optimization within a model, but I used DVC to handle “parameters” that would …</p></div></div>

<h2>Part 1: Introduction</h2>



<h3>Summary</h3>



<p>Game BASIC for Sega Saturn is a homebrew development kit that allows you to program games for the Sega Saturn using the BASIC programming language.&nbsp; If you’re familiar with the PlayStation’s Net Yaroze platform, think of this as the Saturn’s answer to it – just cheaper and easier to get started with.</p>



<p>Game BASIC’s use of the BASIC language makes for a very low barrier to entry in terms of programming skill.&nbsp; Though the Saturn is notoriously difficult to program for, Game BASIC makes it easy to get started and is surprisingly powerful, allowing very easy sprite manipulation and straightforward 3D polygon implementation.&nbsp; It even includes an adapter cable that allows you to communicate with the Saturn from your PC to transfer or save programs and streamline development.  For example, here’s a Pilotwings-esque demo, but in Game BASIC:</p>

</p><figcaption>“Jump” demo, provided with Game BASIC (video courtesy <a href="https://www.satakore.com/sega-saturn-game-basic,,GBSSCD_G_JUMP_A,,GBSS-CD-Jump-Multi-Controller-Version-Bits-Laboratory.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satakore.com</a>)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The caveat?&nbsp; Game BASIC was released only in Japan, so this means a complete setup can be difficult to obtain and all documentation is in Japanese!&nbsp; Moreover, the supporting software that allows you to use your PC for streamlined development was intended for the Windows 95 era and flat out does not install on modern systems. Oh, and the adapter cable that allows you to connect your Saturn to your PC is a 25-pin serial connection!</p>



<p>Who in the world still has both Game BASIC and a Windows 95 PC with a physical serial port? Nobody!&nbsp; (Well, unless you’re <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_QU8eaMymo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern Vintage Gamer</a>) But if you’re a brave experimenter who’s not afraid to tinker a bit, there are still multiple options to get everything working, even today!&nbsp; You can even do a lot just via emulation.&nbsp; So, let’s head to the Lab and get started…</p>



<h3>What You’ll Need</h3>



<p>There are several options for working with Game BASIC, ranging from quite simple but clunky to work with, to quite powerful and streamlined.&nbsp; Here are the three options:</p>



<h4>The Simple Saturn-only setup</h4>



<h5>Required Tools</h5>



<ul><li>A copy of the <a href="https://archive.org/details/game-basic-for-sega-saturn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game BASIC for Sega Saturn disc</a></li><li>The ability to play Japanese Saturn games (A Japanese or modded console, a Pro Action Replay/<a href="https://ppcenter.webou.net/pskai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pseudo Saturn Kai</a> cartridge, or a Saturn emulator)</li><li>Any Saturn controller</li><li>Plenty of room in the Saturn’s internal memory (if you want to save your programs)</li></ul>



<p>For this option, you’ll run Game BASIC on the Saturn with no PC connection, using only standard Saturn accessories.&nbsp; This is a reasonable choice if you just want to write “Hello, World!”-style programs or play around with the neat games and demos that come with the kit.&nbsp; Theoretically, you can write even the most complex programs this way, but you’ll run into limitations on the size of games you can save to the Saturn’s internal memory.&nbsp; Plus, programming with a virtual keyboard is an absolute pain.&nbsp; Start here if you don’t have the necessary hardware for the other options, or if you just want to poke around a bit and see what this is all about.</p>



<h4>The Enhanced Saturn-only setup</h4>



<h5>Required Tools</h5>



<ul><li>All of the tools from Option 1, PLUS</li><li>Some kind of external expanded memory, such as:<ul><li>A direct-save memory cartridge (e.g., the official Saturn Backup Memory)</li></ul><ul><li>A Sega Saturn Floppy Disk Drive and some 3.5″ floppy disks</li></ul></li><li>A Sega Saturn keyboard OR the NetLink keyboard adapter with a PS/2 keyboard</li><li>Fun peripherals, like the Stunner light gun, 3D Control Pad, multi-tap, and Shuttle Mouse</li></ul>



<p>One of the great things about Game BASIC is how easy it makes it to access the Saturn’s peripherals, including the internal backup RAM, external memory cartridges, and even the Saturn Floppy Disk Drive.&nbsp; With a setup like this, you’ll have plenty of space to save your programs and you can use a real keyboard for text entry.&nbsp; You can even start experimenting with different forms of input, like analog controls and light guns!&nbsp; But without access to the tools a PC provides, it will be difficult to make nice-looking sprites, textures, and 3D models.&nbsp; So, this will still limit what you’re capable of.&nbsp; Regardless, this is a great option for the sheer fun factor of “Hey look! I’m programming with my Saturn!” or if you have no ability to connect your Saturn to a PC.</p>



<p>You can even go this route with a Saturn emulator, giving you easy access to improved keyboard, mouse, and storage options.&nbsp; I’ve confirmed that Mednafen successfully emulates Game BASIC and allows for keyboard and mouse pass-through input, meaning you can do a whole lot of Saturn development with very little barrier to entry.</p>



<h4>The Full Saturn plus PC Setup</h4>



<h5>Required Tools</h5>



<ul><li>A complete Game BASIC for Sega Saturn kit, including:<ul><li>A copy of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://archive.org/details/game-basic-for-sega-saturn" target="_blank">Game BASIC for Sega Saturn disc</a></li></ul><ul><li>A copy of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://archive.org/details/game-basic-for-sega-saturn" target="_blank">Windows 95 Tools disc</a></li></ul><ul><li>The special Saturn-to-PC serial cable adapter</li></ul></li><li>A modern PC with a USB port, capable of running a Virtual Machine (I use VirtualBox)</li><li>A copy of Windows XP SP3 32-bit to install on a VM</li><li>A <a href="https://www.amazon.com/USB-Serial-Adapter-Prolific-PL-2303/dp/B003WOWBBW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">USB-to-Serial adapter</a> (Must support RS232 with a DB25 connector)</li><li>The ability to play Japanese Saturn games on original hardware (Japanese or modded console, or a Pro Action Replay/Pseudo Saturn Kai cartridge)</li><li>A Saturn controller</li><li>Optionally, any fun Saturn accessories you may want to experiment with (I especially recommend a keyboard or keyboard adapter)</li></ul>



<p>This is the Cadillac option!&nbsp; This is the setup I use, is how Game BASIC was really intended to be used (well, except nobody expected it to be run on a VM, I suppose), and is what the rest of this guide will focus on.&nbsp; With this setup, writing a game is as simple as writing BASIC in a text editor and hitting a couple of buttons to send it to your Saturn, where it immediately shows up on your TV and responds to controller and keyboard input!&nbsp; Seriously, it’s super cool once you get it working…</p>



<p>The Simple and Enhanced Saturn-only setups are extremely straightforward.&nbsp; You just boot Game BASIC like any other Saturn game and get started, so there’s not much configuration to discuss.&nbsp; Regardless of the setup you choose, continue on to Part 2 for a few test programs.&nbsp; But if you want the Full setup, it’s quite a project to get going, so read on to Part 3 for the complete How-To!</p>

<p>If the answer is yes, then keep reading. Chances are that if you program in Python, you will probably fall into one of these silly behaviors.</p>
<p>In the part 1 of this series I’m going to show you 5 things that have a great potential drive you mad in Python. Some of them are very subtle and others are not obvious at all. By learning about them in advanced, you can save hours of debugging time. So brace yourself and let’s go!</p>

<p>I confess that this one has costed me several hours of my life. When used correctly it is very nice but when you don’t, it’s a headache.</p>
<p>In Python you can concatenate strings using not only using the <code>+</code> operator but also implicitly. The following snippet illustrates a very common bug in Python.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>2</span>]: <span>"french "</span> + <span>"bulldog"</span>
Out[<span>2</span>]: <span>'french bulldog'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>That's fine, <code>&lt;string&gt; + &lt;string&gt;</code> generates a new <code>&lt;string&gt;</code>. But what you may not know is that you can leave <code>+</code> out and Python will still concatenate the string.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>3</span>]: <span>"french "</span> <span>"bulldog"</span>
Out[<span>3</span>]: <span>'french bulldog'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>When is this a problem, then? It'll be an issue when you want a list of strings and forget a comma.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>4</span>]: dogs = [<span>"poodle"</span> <span>"french bulldog"</span>, <span>"pit bull"</span>, <span>"american bully"</span>]
In [<span>6</span>]: dogs
Out[<span>6</span>]: [<span>'poodlefrench bulldog'</span>, <span>'pit bull'</span>, <span>'american bully'</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>Oh, it can get worse. Imagine you have a function that accepts two strings, but the second one is optional.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>11</span>]: <span><span>def</span> <span>print_pair</span>(<span>a: str, b: Optional[str] = None</span>):</span>
    ...:     print(<span>"a: "</span>, a, <span>"b: "</span>, b)
In [<span>13</span>]: print_pair(
    ...: <span>"First string"</span>
    ...: <span>"Second string"</span>
    ...: )
a:  First stringSecond string b:  <span>None</span>
</code></pre>
<p>You see? The function runs just fine, so that’s not great! Situations like these can hide nasty bugs. The lesson here is clear: be careful when passing strings to functions or using them as list of items.</p>
<h2 id="walrus-wat">Walrus WAT!?</h2>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/cv4aHA3NS4YxO/giphy.gif" alt="A dog playing goes #fail"></p>
<p>In 2019, Python 3.8 introduced the walrus operator. This new feature generated a lot of controversies. Some people loved whereas other actually hated it. The goal of this post is not to debate that, so I’ll dive right into what makes walrus confusing.</p>
<p>Before Python 3.8, you could not assign a value to a variable and test if it was “truthy” in the same statement.  For example, see the following example, of reading data from a socket until an empty string is read. This examples is inspired by  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0572/#capturing-condition-values">one</a>  described in the PEP.</p>
<p>Without <code>walrus</code>:</p>
<pre><code>data = sock.recv(<span>4096</span>)
<span>while</span> data:
    clean_data = clean(data)
    print(<span>"Received data:"</span>, data)
    data = sock.recv(<span>4096</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>With <code>walrus</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>while</span> data := sock.recv(<span>4096</span>):
    clean_data = clean(data)
    print(<span>"Received data:"</span>, data)
</code></pre>
<p>That is, you do both the assignment and the checking in the same line by using <code>:=</code>.</p>
<p>In Python we can use tuples to assign values to more than one variable in the same line.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>1</span>]: a, b = <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>

In [<span>2</span>]: a
Out[<span>2</span>]: <span>2</span>

In [<span>3</span>]: b
Out[<span>3</span>]: <span>3</span>
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Hum... we probably can do the same using walrus, right?</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>In [<span>4</span>]: (a, b := <span>16</span>, <span>19</span>)
Out[<span>4</span>]: (<span>2</span>, <span>16</span>, <span>19</span>)
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>WAT!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, a 3-tuple is returned!</p>

<p>Thanks to  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ForceBru/">@ForceBru</a> who kindly  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/jh66bh/how_to_shoot_yourself_in_the_foot_with_python/g9wfoi9/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">corrected me</a>, what gets assigned to <code>b</code> is not a tuple, but only the first element after <code>:=</code>.
As a result, <code>(a, b := 16, 19)</code> is the same as <code>(a, (b := 16), 19)</code>. And that explains why a 3-tuple is returned.</p>
<p>You can verify that by <a target="_blank" href="https://tio.run/##K6gsycjPM7YoKPr/PzO3IL@oRCGxuISLq6AoM69EA8jUSynNLQAzChKLilM1lDQSdRSSrGwVDM10FAwtNZU0NTX//wcA">printing the AST</a> .</p>

<p>As you can see, the thing is confusing!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What if <code>a</code> is not defined?</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>In [<span>14</span>]: (a, b := <span>16</span>, <span>19</span>)

<p>When the first variable is not defined, a <code>NameError</code> will be raised. Now you know how to avoid that!</p>
<h2 id="be-careful-when-using-with-lists">Be Careful When Using <code>+=</code> With Lists</h2>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/GEObzG7vNeRUs/giphy.gif" alt="A dog falling down the stairs"></p>
<p>Lists in Python are incredibly nice. You can perform all sorts of stuff like:</p>
<ul>
<li>concatenating multiple lists using <code>+</code> operator</li>
<li>generating a repeated list by using the <code>*</code> operator</li>
<li>concatenate and assign lists using <code>+=</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s look at an example on how <code>+</code> operator works with the <code>list</code> object. I know you may be tired of such toy examples, but please, bear with me.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>20</span>]: lst = [<span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>]

In [<span>21</span>]: lst_copy = lst

In [<span>22</span>]: lst = lst + [<span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]

In [<span>23</span>]: lst
Out[<span>23</span>]: [<span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]

In [<span>24</span>]: lst_copy
Out[<span>24</span>]: [<span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>Cool, we created a list called <code>lst</code> then we built a new one named <code>lst_copy</code> by pointing it to <code>lst</code>. Then we changed <code>lst</code> by appending <code>[8, 9]</code> to it. As expected, the <code>+</code> operator expanded <code>lst</code> whereas <code>lst_copy</code> remained the same.</p>
<p>In Python one can shorten expressions like <code>a = a + 1</code> as <code>a += 1</code>. As I mentioned in the beginning, you can also use the <code>+=</code> operator with lists. So, let’s give it a shot and re-write our example.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>25</span>]: lst = [<span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>]

In [<span>26</span>]: lst_copy = lst

In [<span>27</span>]: lst += [<span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]

In [<span>28</span>]: lst
Out[<span>28</span>]: [<span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]

In [<span>29</span>]: lst_copy
Out[<span>29</span>]: [<span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>WAAATTT!? What happened here?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason for this behavior is that, like other Python operators, the implementation of <code>+=</code> is defined by the class that implements it. That is, to define <code>+=</code> the <code>list</code> class has defined a <code>object.__iadd__(self, other)</code> magic method. And the way it works is the same as <code>list.extends</code>. </p>
<p>So why has <code>lst_copy</code> been modified? </p>
<p>Because it is not an actual copy of <code>lst</code> but it points to the in memory.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The key takeaway is, don't blindly assume operators will have the same semantics across different classes. </p>
<h2 id="mutable-defaults">Mutable Defaults</h2>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/13cbZDgXa23UeQ/giphy.gif" alt="A dog jumping sofas #fail"></p>
<p>I understand that this one might not be new to you. However, it’s unquestionably one of the most dangerous. The case I’m talking about is the usage of mutable default arguments on functions. If you don’t know what this is all about, take a look at the following example.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>35</span>]: <span><span>def</span> <span>add_fruit</span>(<span>fruit: str, basket: list = []</span>) -&gt; list:</span>
    ...:     basket.append(fruit)
    ...:     <span>return</span> basket
    ...: 

In [<span>36</span>]: b = add_fruit(<span>"banana"</span>)

In [<span>37</span>]: b
Out[<span>37</span>]: [<span>'banana'</span>]

In [<span>38</span>]: c = add_fruit(<span>"apple"</span>)

In [<span>39</span>]: c
Out[<span>39</span>]: [<span>'banana'</span>, <span>'apple'</span>]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>WAAATT!?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, we call the function twice without passing a list to it. The ultimate result is a list with two items, how did that happen?</p>
<p>The reason for this behavior is that when the interpreter defines the function, it also creates the default argument. Then, it binds the object created to the function argument. </p>
<p>In our problem, Python allocated an empty list and bound it to the argument <code>basket</code>. To make things simpler to follow, let’s look at a visual example made with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pythontutor.com/">python tutor</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1603048050068/v39uSktN5.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="mutable-1.png"></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1603048076920/D_qYippaU.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="mutable-2.png"></p>
<p>As you can see, the argument <code>basket</code> is created once and the function points to it during its entire lifetime. The only exception is when you pass another list to it but that won’t change the default. Whenever you call the function again without passing a list to it, it will use the one created when the function was defined.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How can we avoid this, then?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To avoid this, you must set the argument to <code>None</code> and create a list if none is passed.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>44</span>]: <span><span>def</span> <span>add_fruit</span>(<span>fruit: str, basket: Optional[list] = None</span>):</span>
    ...:     <span>if</span> basket <span>is</span> <span>None</span>:
    ...:         basket = []
    ...:     basket.append(fruit)
    ...:     <span>return</span> basket

In [<span>45</span>]: b = add_fruit(<span>"banana"</span>)

In [<span>46</span>]: b
Out[<span>46</span>]: [<span>'banana'</span>]

In [<span>47</span>]: c = add_fruit(<span>"apple"</span>)

In [<span>48</span>]: c
Out[<span>48</span>]: [<span>'apple'</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>Great! Now we create a list whenever no argument is passed to the function, which fixes the bug.</p>
<h2 id="chained-operations-gone-wrong">Chained Operations Gone Wrong</h2>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3oEduU8I0dHP38CdLW/giphy.gif" alt="A dog playing on grass and failing"></p>
<p>Chained operations are an exceptional feature. It makes the code terse without sacrificing readability. I discuss it in more detail in another blog <a target="_blank" href="https://miguendes.me/5-hidden-python-features-you-probably-never-heard-of">post</a> but to provide you a bit of context let’s see it in action.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>x = <span>10</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>20</span> == x == <span>0</span>
<span>False</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>25</span> &gt; x &lt;= <span>15</span>
<span>True</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Let's pay close attention to the first example. If Python didn't have this feature, that statement could be re-written as:</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>53</span>]: <span>20</span> == x <span>and</span> x == <span>0</span>
Out[<span>53</span>]: <span>False</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now, what happens if we add parentheses to enforce some kind of precedence?</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>51</span>]: <span>20</span> == x == <span>0</span>
Out[<span>51</span>]: <span>False</span>

In [<span>52</span>]: (<span>20</span> == x) == <span>0</span>
Out[<span>52</span>]: <span>True</span>
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Wait? What on earth has just happened?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we added the parentheses, <code>(20 == x)</code> was evaluated to <code>False</code>. However, the problem is that <code>False</code> is then compared to <code>0</code>.  ̶S̶i̶n̶c̶e̶ ̶<code>̶0̶</code>̶ ̶i̶s̶ ̶c̶o̶n̶s̶i̶d̶e̶r̶e̶d̶ ̶a̶ ̶"̶F̶a̶l̶s̶y̶"̶ ̶v̶a̶l̶u̶e̶,̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶n̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶c̶o̶m̶p̶a̶r̶i̶s̶o̶n̶ ̶r̶e̶t̶u̶r̶n̶s̶ ̶'̶T̶r̶u̶e̶`̶.̶</p>
<p>As pointed out by <a href="https://hashnode.com/@alexmojaki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@alexmojaki</a>, <code>False == 0</code> is <code>True</code> because <code>bool</code> is a subclass of <code>int</code>. For instance, other "Falsy" values such as <code>[]</code> or <code>""</code> are not equal to <code>False</code>.</p>

I resisted getting into AWS for a while because of its complexity. Any time I would log into AWS, my eyes would glaze over and my head would spin.</p><p>I realized, though, that ignoring AWS for much longer will be to my detriment. <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/18819/worldwide-market-share-of-leading-cloud-infrastructure-service-providers/">AWS is dominating</a> the hundred billion dollar cloud infrastructure and computing market:</p><p><span>

<a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/18819/worldwide-market-share-of-leading-cloud-infrastructure-service-providers/">Source</a></p><p>Because of this, AWS certifications are in very high demand. I decided a few months ago that it's time for me to step up and at least get the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/">Cloud Practitioner certification</a>, and probably others like the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/">Solutions Architect Associate</a>.</p><h2>Big AWS Concepts for Developers</h2><p>Let's lay down a couple of definitions to help you as you progress in your AWS education.</p><p>First, what are <strong>cloud computing</strong> and <strong>cloud infrastructure</strong>? In short, this means that instead of you having to physically set up servers and networks in your garage or at your company, you "rent" these from Amazon. Everything you might want to do to run a website <!-- -->—<!-- --> the hardware that runs the server, the database, the storage that holds the frontend and static files, and the domain name configuration <!-- -->—<!-- --> can be done using AWS's networking and computing resources.</p><p>Why does this matter? The main reason is <strong>scalability</strong>: the ability to grow based on demand. AWS alleviates both the cost and logistics of scaling a service or business. Imagine you're running an online store for dog toys on a single server in your garage (you probably bought it on eBay). Suddenly, <a href="https://twitter.com/dog_feelings">Thoughts of Dog</a> tweets about your store and your traffic spikes by twenty times as millions of people try to buy your bespoke artisan chew toys. What's going to happen? Most likely your server will crash due to that much demand. You're frantically searching eBay for another server and some networking equipment, but it will likely cost you a couple thousand bucks and several days to upgrade your server or add additional servers to your network. Ouch! (Incidentally, a show that demonstrates this dilemma perfectly is <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543312/">Halt and Catch Fire</a>, which is about startups in the 80s.)</p><p>Services like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform came along and revolutionized the industry. Now instead of needing to buy a brand new server, you can click a button and immediately grow your infrastructure. Even better, you can automatically grow and shrink your infrastructure as demand for your site or service fluctuates. This helps keeps costs more predictable and spreads them out over time instead of all at once with big hardware purchases.</p><h2>Key AWS Services for Developers</h2><p>When approaching AWS as a developer, there are a few of the core services that you'll likely encounter right away, so here's a quick overview of those:</p><ul><li><strong>Lambda</strong>: Serverless functions are kind of a gateway for developers into AWS and cloud infrastructure. In AWS, Lambda is the service that runs these functions. Serverless functions let you perform calculations or access databases without having a physical server.</li><li><strong>S3</strong>: S3 stands for Simple Storage Service. This is where you host static files such as HTML, images, or videos.</li><li><strong>Route 53</strong>: Route 53 is where you set up DNS for domain names. "Route" is a reference to US Route 66 and "53" is a reference to TCP or UDP port 53, where DNS server requests are addressed.</li><li><strong>EC2</strong>: Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is where you run servers. If you're looking to run an API or a traditional web app using something like Node or Nest, this is what you want. EC2 costs can add up quick, so be careful experimenting with these.</li><li><strong>RDS</strong>: RDS stands for Relational Database Service so this is where you'll set up databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.</li><li><strong>DynamoDB</strong>: DynamoDB is Amazon's No SQL solution similar to MongoDB.</li><li><strong>Amplify</strong>: Amplify is a platform for building full stack apps quickly. The Amplify Framework consists of 3 components including libraries, UI components, and a CLI toolchain, while the Amplify Console is a static web hosting service.</li></ul><p>These are the core services I would focus on as a developer getting started with AWS. There are many, many more services relevant to developers, but getting a handle on the basics of these will get you quite a long way.</p><h2>AWS Pitfalls for Developers</h2><p>The two main pitfalls you might run into as you learn AWS (other than its sheer complexity) are <strong>billing</strong> and <strong>identity and access management (IAM)</strong>.</p><p>AWS is not free to use, though there is a free tier and some services are free. Usually these costs are minor for short periods of time, but beware: if you run through a tutorial and then forget to clean up after yourself, you might face a big bill at the end of the month! Be sure to know what costs you're incurring as you do tutorials and try to shut down and delete anything you don't need when you're finished. AWS also lets you create billing alerts that will email you when you've hit a threshold. Here's a great <a href="https://egghead.io/playlists/use-aws-billing-cost-management-dashboard-to-keep-your-aws-bill-to-minimum-ff0f">egghead collection on AWS cost management</a> that will help a lot.</p><p>The other really sticky area in AWS is security. Identity and Access Management (IAM) in AWS is extremely complex. There are many layers of permissions for each service, user, and group. Most tutorials will help you navigate the basic set up that you will need to get things done. Be careful that you're not leaving yourself open to big vulnerabilities as you learn. Not only does that open the door to data theft, but it could also result in huge bills if someone gets a hold of your root account. This doc is kind of scary, but you're going to want to get familiar with <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html">security best practices in AWS</a> little by little. At the very least, secure your root account and enable MFA.</p><p>For the sake of both billing and IAM, you will likely want to avoid using your employer's AWS account to learn. If your job is the motivation for learning AWS, work with your company on creating a sandboxed account with a given budget.</p><h2>Overview of AWS Certifications</h2><p>While not all certifications in tech are created equal, AWS certifications are extremely valuable. They're designed to minimize false positives and fairly rigorous, so employers know they can use them as a solid benchmark of knowledge. This means they can add some zeroes to your paycheck and set you apart from the average developer.</p><p>There are many different AWS certifications, so let's break down what the options are.</p><p>The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/">Cloud Practicioner exam</a> is considered a <strong>Foundational</strong> exam recommended for people with 6 months of fundamental AWS knowledge. It's high-level and not super technical, but gets your feet with AWS.</p><p>From there, there are three <strong>Associate</strong> level exams, recommended for people with 1 year of experience solving problems and implementing solutions using AWS. These exams have broad scope but shallow depth and break into three paths: Architect, Operations, and Developer. The three exams are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/">Solutions Architect Associate</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-sysops-admin-associate/">SysOps Administrator Associate</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate/">Developer Associate</a></li></ul><p>From there, there are two <strong>Professional</strong> certifications, recommended for people with 2 years of comprehensive experience designing, operating, and troubleshooting solutions using AWS. These exams have broader scope and are quite deep. The Architect path remains, but Developer and Operations combine into DevOps. The two exams are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-professional/">Solutions Architect Professional</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-devops-engineer-professional/">DevOps Engineer Professional</a></li></ul><p>There are also six <strong>Specialty</strong> exams, which are very narrow in scope but very deep:</p><ul><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-advanced-networking-specialty/">Advanced Networking Specialty</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-security-specialty/">Security Specialty</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-specialty/">Machine Learning Specialty</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-alexa-skill-builder-specialty/">Alex Skill Builder Specialty</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-data-analytics-specialty/">Data Analytics Specialty</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-database-specialty/">Database Specialty</a></li></ul><p>I decided to get some of these certifications as a way to guarantee that I will actually set aside the time to learn some AWS and have something to show for it. My plan is to get the Cloud Practicioner and then the Solutions Architect Associate. Why not the Developer Associate first? Well, my understanding is that the Solutions Architect Associate is more comphrensive than the Developer Associate, and thus it's easier to get the Developer Associate after getting the Solutions Architect Associate. It also sets you up to get the Solutions Architect Professional, which is extremely difficult and highly coveted (and thus should come with a big pay raise!). The SA-P requires the SA-A, so it makes sense to go that route. I'll update this article when I've got some results.</p><h2>AWS Resources for Developers</h2><p>There are boatloads of resources for learning AWS out there. Some are geared towards infrastructure and networking folks, some are geared towards database admins, some for security teams, and others towards developers. Here are the key resources I've been using and a variety of others I've found useful.</p><h3>My Essential AWS Resources</h3><p>I've found myself relying pretty heavily on these resources in my own AWS journey:</p><ul><li><a href="https://acloud.guru/">A Cloud Guru</a>: A Cloud Guru is hands down the single best resources out there for learning AWS and just about any other cloud technology. I am honestly blown away. Just the <a href="https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certification-preparation?_ga=2.170270560.1574418745.1603210089-860129520.1602887034">AWS Certification Preparation Guide</a> is worth the cost of admission. I'm working my way through the Developer Learning Path and about halfway through the <a href="https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner?_ga=2.124181706.1574418745.1603210089-860129520.1602887034">Cloud Practitioner 2020 course</a>. I've also used A Cloud Guru a <em>ton</em> for work whenever I've needed to look up terms or concepts I don't understand. I had a big annoying run-in with VPCs and private networks and A Cloud Guru seriously came to my rescue.</li><li><a href="https://cloudnewbies.com/">Cloud Newbies Discord</a>: This is a Discord server founded by <a href="https://twitter.com/hirokonishimura">Hiroko Nishimura</a>, creator of <a href="https://awsnewbies.com/">AWS Newbies</a> (which is another great site full of articles, books, and exam tips). It is immensely helpful to have a welcoming and friendly community of people with whom to learn.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You may have heard about GPT-3 this summer, the new cool kid on the AI block. GPT-3 came out of OpenAI, one of the top AI research labs in the world which was founded in late 2015 by Elon Musk, Sam Altman and others and later backed with a $1B investment from Microsoft.</p>
<p>You’ve probably also heard about the ongoing AI revolution in healthcare, thanks to promising results in areas such as automated diagnosis, medical documentation and drug discovery, to name a few.
Some have claimed that algorithms now outperform doctors on <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/10/ai-can-outperform-doctors-so-why-dont-patients-trust-it">certain tasks</a> and others have even announced that robots will soon receive <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/insights-intelai/2018/09/21/the-ultimate-physicians-assistant/">medical degrees</a> of their own! This can all sound far-fetched... but could this robot actually be GPT-3?</p>
<p>Our unique multidisciplinary team of doctors and machine learning engineers at Nabla had the chance to test this new model to tease apart what’s real and what’s hype by exploring different healthcare use cases.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp0.jpg" alt="Primary care and GPT-3"></p>
<h2>But first, coffee</h2>
<p>In machine learning, a language model like GPT-3 simply tries to predict a word in a sentence given the previous words, called the context. It’s a supercharged autocomplete system like the one you may use with Gmail. Being able to predict the next word in a sentence seems deceptively simple at first, but this actually enables many compelling use cases, such as chatbots, translation or Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, GPT-3 is the most complex language model ever trained, with a whopping 175 billion parameters in total - that’s as many knobs that are fine-tuned over weeks of intensive cloud computing to make the AI magic work. Certainly a huge number, but still way below the 100 (or maybe 1000+) trillion synapses in the human brain that enable reasoning, perception and emotions.</p>
<p>Thanks to the large size of the model, GPT-3 can be applied on new tasks and ‘few-shot’ demonstrations without any further fine-tuning on specific data. In practice, this means the model can successfully understand the task to perform with only a handful of initial examples. This property is a huge improvement compared to previous, less complex language models, and is much closer to actual human behavior - we don’t need thousands of examples to distinguish a cat from a dog.</p>
<p>Despite obvious biases learned from the data used for training - basically books plus the whole Internet, from Wikipedia to the New York Times - GPT-3's ability to transform natural language into websites, create basic financial reports, solve langage puzzles, or even generate guitar tables has been very promising so far. But what about healthcare?</p>
<h2>Then, the obvious disclaimer</h2>
<p>As Open AI itself warns in GPT-3 guidelines, healthcare “is in the high stakes category because people rely on accurate medical information for life-or-death decisions, and mistakes here could result in serious harm”. Furthermore, diagnosing medical or psychiatric conditions falls straight in the “unsupported use” of the model. Despite this we wanted to give it a shot and see how it does on the following healthcare use cases, roughly ranked from low to high sensitivity from a medical perspective: admin chat with a patient, medical insurance check, mental health support, medical documentation, medical questions &amp; answers and medical diagnosis. We also looked at the impact of some parameters of the model on the answers - spoiler alert, it’s fascinating!</p>
<h2>GPT-3, your next medical assistant?</h2>
<p>Our first tests showed that GPT-3 seemed to work for basic admin tasks such as appointment booking, but when digging a bit we found that the model had no clear understanding of time, nor any proper logic. Its memory also sometimes fell short - for the appointment in the example below, the patient’s initial 6pm constraint is overlooked as GPT-3 suggests booking for 7pm after a few messages.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp1.jpg" alt="Medical assistant example with GPT-3"></p>
<h2>What about insurance checks?</h2>
<p>Similar to the admin tasks above, GPT-3 could help nurses or patients to quickly find a piece of information in a very long document, like finding insurance benefits for specific medical examinations. In the example below we seeded the model with a 4-page standard benefits table that shows a $10 copay for an X-ray, $20 for an MRI exam, and then asked 2 simple questions. GPT-3 was able to get the copay for an X-ray but could not sum up the copays for several exams, which again highlights a lack of basic reasoning.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp2.jpg" alt="Insurance checks example with GPT-3"></p>
<h2>Recycle to relieve stress!</h2>
<p>Relax on your living room sofa and talk, GPT-3 will listen to your problems endlessly and may even give you some actionable tips! This is probably one of the best use cases for GPT-3 in healthcare, and it’s not so surprising given the already good results from the Eliza algorithm back in 1966, which managed to give a human touch with only pattern matching rules operating behind the scenes.</p>
<p>One key difference between the two approaches though is that rule-based systems like Eliza were in full control of the computer’s response. In other words, we are certain that nothing potentially harmful could be said.</p>
<p>This contrasts with the example below in which GPT-3 sadly tells us that committing suicide is a good idea…</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp4.jpg" alt="Kill switch example with GPT-3"></p>
<p>The model can also shoot unexpected answers where it suggests recycling more to ease stress - using a rationale which, while being convoluted, is actually quite sensible!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp3.jpg" alt="Recycling and stress example with GPT-3"></p>
<h2>Medical documentation</h2>
<p>GPT-3 has already shown promising results in summarizing and simplifying text, something that could be very useful for patients to understand medical reports often full of jargon, or for doctors to quickly get the gist of a patient’s long medical history. Well, GPT-3 is probably not quite ready for this (yet?). Our tests show dangerous oversimplifications, difficulties to associate causes and consequences, and once again a lack of basic deductive reasoning.</p>
<h2>Medical Q&amp;A: not as good as good ol’ Google yet</h2>
<p>When looking for specific scientific information, drug dosages or prescription support, our experiments show that GPT-3 is not reliable enough to be safely used as a trustworthy support tool for doctors. One serious concern is that GPT-3 very often gives wrong yet grammatically correct answers, with no scientific reference that a physician could check. A tired doctor caught in the rush of an emergency department could easily confuse a syntactically sound statement for a medically valid one. For example the first answer below is correct but not the second.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp5.jpg" alt="Q&amp;A medical example with GPT-3"></p>
<h2>Diagnosis: at your own risk</h2>
<p>A more complex Q&amp;A task is diagnosis: input symptoms and get possible underlying conditions that may explain these symptoms. Recent symptom checker systems (Babylon, Ada, KHealth, etc.), if not perfect, seem to be a better option here than GPT-3 as they’ve been carefully optimized for this sole purpose. One benefit of these systems is that they can output different diagnoses with their probabilities, which acts as a measure of confidence for the practitioner. If the first diagnosis example below GPT-3 ignores the fever of the little girl that suggests ethmoiditis and mentions a “rash” that does not exist.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp6.jpg" alt="Medical diagnosis 1 example with GPT-3"></p>
<p>In another test, GPT-3 misses a pulmonary embolism. Fortunately nobody died here!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp7.jpg" alt="Medical diagnosis 2 example with GPT-3"></p>
<h2>Under the hood</h2>
<p>As others have observed, the quality of GPT-3 outputs is much impacted by the seed words used - the same question formulated in two different ways can result in very different answers. The model’s various parameters, such as the temperature and the top P also play a big role. Temperature and top P control the risks and creativity that the engine will exhibit in its answers.</p>
<h3>Temperature</h3>
<p>For the same input and a high temperature we get two answers with very different tones telling two opposite things. Here is an example with T = 0.9.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp8.jpg" alt="High temperature parameter and GPT-3"></p>
<p>By contrast, a similar seed with a very low temperature (T = 0) will always result in the same and quite straightforward answer.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp9.jpg" alt="Low temperature parameter and GPT-3"></p>
<h3>Frequency penalty and presence penalty</h3>
<p>It is also pertinent to mention the frequency penalty and presence penalty parameters, which prevent both word repetition and subject repetition. In a medical context, the intuition would be to reduce them as much as possible since a too abrupt subject switch can be very confusing and repetition can actually be pedagogical. However, comparing two conversations where the human asks the same questions, we clearly observe that the model with repetition penalties seems more empathic and friendly than the other one which appears cold and too repetitive to be human. Here is an example with no penalty.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp10.jpg" alt="No penalty parameter and GPT-3"></p>
<p>And an example with full penalty.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp11.jpg" alt="Full penalty parameter and GPT-3"></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As warned by OpenAI, we are nowhere near any real time scenario where GPT-3 would significatively help in healthcare. Because of the way it was trained, it lacks the scientific and medical expertise that would make it useful for medical documentation, diagnosis support, treatment recommendation or any medical Q&amp;A. Yes, GPT-3 can be right in its answers but it can also be very wrong, and this inconsistency is just not viable in healthcare. Even for more administrative tasks such as translating or summarizing medical jargon, GPT-3 while promising is still many moons away for a production use case actually supporting doctors. We’re still in this phase where multiple, narrow-task supervised models win over a single, very ambitious approach.</p>
<p>That being said, GPT-3 seems to be quite ready to fight burnout and help doctors with a chit-chat module. It could bring back the joy and empathy you would get from a conversation with your medical residents at the end of the day, that conversation that helps you come down to earth at the end of a busy day. Also, there is no doubt that language models in general will be improving at a fast pace, with a positive impact not only on the use cases described above but also on other important problems, such as information structuring and normalisation or automatic consultation summaries.</p>
<p>And at Nabla, we are working on it!<br>

        <small>2020-10-26</small>
        <p>The BEAM is the virtual machine that Erlang and Elixir runs on. It is widely cited as a battle-tested piece of software though I don’t know in which wars it has seen action. It has definitely paid its dues in the telecom space as well as globally scaled projects such as Whatsapp and Discord. It is well suited to tackle soft-realtime distributed systems with heavy concurrency. It has been a good platform chugging along. And with a small team at Ericsson responsible for much of its continuing development it has been managed in a deeply pragmatic way. Erlang has always been a bit of a secret and silent success. Almost no-one uses it if you look at market shares. But among the ones that use it there seems to be a very positive consensus. And then Elixir came and caused a bit of a boom. I think the BEAM has benefited from Elixir and Elixir wouldn’t exist without the BEAM. With that bit of background I’d like to shine a light on some cool developments that I think makes the BEAM more interesting or even uniquely interesting in the future.</p>
<h2 id="the-jit-is-here-soon-otp-24">The JIT is here (soon, OTP 24)</h2>
<p>With OTP 24 landing sometime next year we are going to get the a JIT for the BEAM. Based on the project <a href="https://github.com/asmjit/asmjit">AsmJit</a> this will mean that some BEAM code will be translated to native instructions. It will not be the kind of warm-up-for-performance-gains JIT that I’ve heard of in PyPy but rather significantly simpler. The goal of the project was to introduce a JIT that could give performance gains for some cases but would not cause any performance regressions. A pragmatic and laudable approach. Considering this made the Jason JSON-library (written in Elixir) beat the Jiffy JSON-library (written as a C NIF) in <strong>some</strong> tests I think this has the potential to obviate the need for some NIF implementations. Avoiding reaching out to the lower level code that is more capable but more dangerous is a good win.</p>
<p>Anyone running RabbitMQ should look forward to the update as measurements indicate 30-50% increased message throughput. Which is a nice thing to get for no code changes at all.</p>
<p>Pushing the performance of the BEAM closer to native is magnificent. To be clear the BEAM is already quite a good performer. I would put Erlang and Elixir at the abstraction level of languages like Python/Ruby/Node.js. Python and Ruby are poor performers. The Python ML stuff all goes into C++ or similar for performance. I’ve worked a bunch with Python and the things I hear from the Ruby world makes them sound quite equivalent in performance. They are a bit slow and can only <a href="https://underjord.io/more-than-one-thing-at-a-time.html">do one thing at a time</a>. Node.js is a bit different. It can do multiple things at a time, if you append asterisks and squint. It does it largely the same way Python + Gevent does it. This approach is incredibly susceptible to CPU-bound work causing head-of-line blocking. It becomes the single most important consideration for building a performant application “get to IO, don’t compute”. V8 that Node.js runs on is heavily optimized and fast for such a dynamic language. I think the BEAM provides a better approach that can deliver comparable results without as many footguns (opportunities for shooting yourself in the foot). But getting better at the raw crunching is a big gain with this JIT implementation and I look forward to the release.</p>
<h2 id="lumen---static-compilation--wasm">Lumen - Static compilation &amp; WASM</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://getlumen.org/">Lumen project</a> is a huge effort by a gang of open source developers and DockYard to implement a compiler (and more) that can take Elixir and Erlang into the browser. By solving that they end up solving static compilation for Erlang and Elixir as well. So this isn’t compiling and shipping the BEAM to the browser. This is a faithful reimplementation of the BEAM functionality in a way that allows it to be compiled statically. It uses LLVM and requires quite a bit of effort both in development and in wrangling the Web Assembly work group process stuff to make sure that the standard is not entirely run by Object-Oriented Programming needs.</p>
<p>I don’t think Lumen will replace the BEAM. The BEAM has a brilliant track record for long-running services and distributed computing that the Lumen project do not even attempt to achieve right now. Instead the Lumen project will allow Elixir and Erlang to move into spaces where the BEAM might be a bit too heavy and still provide the same guarantees. Typically I see it being good for command line tools, web frontends (super interesting to consider the Actor model going there), serverless/edge computing and potentially with WASM competing with Docker as a delivery mechanism for code in Kubernetes, using something like <a href="https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet">Krustlet</a> (<a href="https://player.fm/series/software-sessions/webassembly-on-the-server-with-krustlet">good podcast episode on WASM/Krustlet</a>). It’s probably Cloud Native or something. Who knows.</p>
<p>What gives Lumen the potential to be a better fit in these circumstances is that it can optimize for filesize (by cutting out hot code updates) and it is likely able to start much faster. Lumen is written in Rust. Which seems to be the popular choice around Web Assembly from what I’ve seen. Lumen is still an early release project and not fit for production. But it is beeing actively pushed forward.</p>
<h2 id="nerves---an-iot-platform-with-minimal-suck">Nerves - An IoT platform with minimal suck</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves project</a> is fantastic. I’m a hardware hobbyist, not an IoT dev but I’ve worked a fair bit with Nerves and it is so, so good. What Nerves gives you when working with a Raspberry Pi for example is a way to let your code run all of the device. The BEAM is basically your operating system on top of a minimal Linux installation. The Linux you have is based on the solid foundation of Buildroot so it is quite feasible to modify it as you see fit. The big idea is that if you are running a Linux-level SBC already you might as well build on something that gives you the guarantees of the BEAM.</p>
<p>Beyond that the default setup encodes a lot of good embedded practices by default so that you avoid bricking devices with firmware updates, you get easy support for pushing firmware over the network or USB and much, much more.</p>
<p>There are a ton of good libraries for sensors and assorted hardware, as well as the common protocols like GPIO/SPI/I2C/UART. Networking support is well considered and has been reworked since I first started using Nerves a few years back (and it worked well then too). BLE is getting more and more good support recently.</p>
<p>The project also created <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/nerveshub">NervesHub</a> which is a solution for managing a fleet of devices by securely providing firmware updates, allowing the switching on of a remote console on devices if that’s a need on your product. I think the most recent stuff is a UI revamp and some serious work on binary diffed patches to minimize firmware update sizes for data-constrained deployments.</p>
<p>This is very much a production project and people are shipping hardware with Nerves. It keeps marching forward.</p>
<h2 id="the-beam-can-be-your-entire-application">The BEAM can be your entire application</h2>
<p>Saša Jurić, author of the much-acclaimed Elixir in Action book has produced a library called <a href="https://github.com/sasa1977/site_encrypt">site_encrypt</a>. It allows you to handle LetsEncrypt configuration without a separate webserver or actually using certbot.</p>
<p>Now this library is good and meaningful in its own right but the underlying idea is why I bring it up. The BEAM can be your entire application. This is something I’ve realized over time. Where in Python you would reach for Gunicorn to run you Django app and Nginx to protect Gunicorn from the big bad world.. The BEAM is made for this. Introducing an intermediate layer of Nginx (or another HTTP server) might actually be detrimental in that you now have two things you need to configure correctly and two pools of multi-core processing workers that care about this request/response cycle and can independently screw it up.</p>
<p>The BEAM was always built for this. OTP has a lot weird corners where you find interesting libraries such as <code>wx</code> for WxWidgets (window management) and <code>ssh</code> for both SSH client and server work I believe. Because it is meant to be delivered as a full solution. It can run and manage multiple different types of work inside of it. Gracefully. It doesn’t replace Kubernetes for the large deployment or polyglot environments. But it might very well mean you don’t actually need to go there early. Or you can reduce how much Ops you need in your Dev. If your entire stack is Elixir or Erlang front to back I think you have empowered your developers significantly.</p>
<p>There is already a move towards this where tools are converging that give us a lot of things out of the box that we’d otherwise need to move outside our application for. These are pragmatic 80-90% solutions. The normal solutions are still all there if you need to reach for them. But maybe you don’t. I see these as moves in the same vein:</p>
<ul>
<li>LiveView - We can reduce the amount of frontend we need to build that isn’t BEAM code (Elixir or Erlang), in some cases get rid of it entirely.</li>
<li>Live Dashboard - Application insights right in your application stack instead of pushing them out to another solution.</li>
<li>Phoenix PubSub - Distributed PubSub without requiring coordination via something like Redis.</li>
<li>Phoenix Channels - Distributed PubSub over WebSockets using the above PubSub to coordinate delivery.</li>
<li>Phoenix Presence - Distribute Presence. A CRDT-powered thing for maintaining information about if someone is connected to a channel or not, like chatrooms and online/offline. Using Channels.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lowering complexity by keeping the solutions in a system you understand well is potentially very powerful. At some point many projects will need to pick up external dependencies such as Nginx, Redis or whatever. But I think there is something compelling about building your application inside a system that can do all of it quite well. Elixir and Phoenix already have significant mind-share in the startup world. I wouldn’t be surprised if this ends up being a very popular solution for startups. No frontend-specific code for the MVP, no New Relic or Mixpanel bill we make do with the Live Dashboard. Distribution is Erlang distribution + Swarm/Horde/Libcluster or something …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>27th October 2020</p>


<p><strong>TL;DR: I am stopping work on Notebag.</strong> It is causing me lots of stress and guilt and I currently
have neither the capacity nor the will to update it right now and for the foreseeable future.
It is available free and open-source <a href="https://github.com/pretzelhands/notebag">on GitHub.</a> You can extend it!
If you bought your license in the past 30 days, send me an email with your order number and I'll refund it.</p>

<hr>

<p>So. Here we are. The irony of my last two blog posts being about the start and end of something is not lost
on me. I know that a few of you are probably confused, angry and perhaps even a bit sad right now, and I
apologize in advance. And some critical voices that have been haunting me around the internet have finally
been proven right.</p>
<p>Now let me tell you why exactly I am stopping work on Notebag, what will happen to it and where I will
be going from here.</p>
<h2>The Why</h2>
<p>One or two of you reading this might perhaps know what it's like when you start a new project. You come
up with a concept! Ideas burst through your head! You are itching to tear the world apart and make
things come alive exactly the way you imagined them. This is an absolute high of productivity and you
hack away until late at night, only to get up early next morning and get right back into it.</p>
<p>That was me. </p>
<p>That's how Notebag started, doubly fueled by the fact that the world in 2020 is .. something else
and I was shit-out-of-luck in terms of freelancing contracts. So I clung to the one thing I had and put
all of my energy into it and I worked to make it into something I thought was nice.</p>
<p>I pushed and pushed each day. Bigger! Better! More features!</p>
<p>And this worked well for a while, until the inevitable tiredness came creeping in. So I put Notebag on the
backburner. New freelancing contracts finally started trickling in and I found myself busy with two kinds of
work: The one paying my bills and the one I did on Notebag.</p>
<p>It was a struggle. Every day after work I tried to pour some of my remaining energy into Notebag, but nothing
happened. I failed to implement the most basic things and bit by bit, this intense feeling of guilt set in.</p>
<p>In time, I started avoiding Twitter. Because everytime I tweeted, I felt like someone out there would be
judging me. Why wasn't I reporting progress on Notebag? What was I even up to? And so I withdrew to the confines
of Telegram and ignored Twitter. DMs came in asking and I was too scared to reply.</p>
<p>Worst of all, I was and am building this subconscious pressure on myself that I am not really allowed to work on anything
else. Why would I work on <code>Project X</code> when Notebag fans are clamoring for updates? That makes me a bad person, no? This
has led me to a state where I was afraid to program outside of my contracts. Not a great spot to be in.</p>
<p>When you are not happy with things, you should change them. I am not happy with how Notebag is currently holding
a soft stranglehold on my life and so I am changing it.</p>
<h2>The What</h2>
<p>What does all of this mean for Notebag's future? First of all, I have <a href="https://github.com/pretzelhands/notebag">published the source code.</a>
It's MIT-licensed and on GitHub, free for everyone to download, build and play with. In my wildest dreams of course there
would be a shining community hero that rises up and picks up where I left off. But that is unlikely to happen.</p>
<p>So at least as a consolation, Notebag in its entirety is available for everyone, for all time, for free. If someone is
seriously willing to make pull requests and improve the code, I am happy to release signed builds with those changes
included. If anyone has specific questions about the architecture and why my code is so bad, I will gladly answer them.</p>
<p>This is, I think, the most elegant solution. It at least guarantees that the code doesn't just gather dust on my machine,
forever unreachable for any interested person. </p>
<p>And since there is still the occasional sale of a license, I offer anybody who bought their license in the past 30 days
(after September 27) a full refund, no questions asked. To avail this, just <a href="https://pretzelhands.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5038353c3c3f10202235242a353c38313e34237e333f3d6f2325323a3533246d1e3f24353231377562600235243922353d353e24756260023536253e34">send me an email</a>
or send me a Twitter DM.</p>
<h2>The Future</h2>
<p>Notebags future probably does not hold many further improvements. I still use it as my personal preferred
note-taking app, because that was its purpose. It works for me and my workflow and I hope that other people will keep
on using it or maybe learn a thing or two from the source code.</p>
<p>Personally I only have one or two side projects, but I'll probably put them on indefinite hold. Clean slate.
There's a few other hobbies I've been meaning to get around to and I think right now is a good time to do that. And
perhaps, somewhere down the line an idea will strike me and I'll give in to the itch to build again. But the time for
that is not right now.</p>
<h2>Final words</h2>
<p>I would again like to apologize to anyone who put high hopes into this app. Turns out that the detractors who pointed out
my legacy of abandoned apps were onto something! It sucks to be known for this, but maybe one day that will change. Or
maybe it won't.</p>
<p>As it is, Notebag will keep working in its usual state for the foreseeable future. But maybe <code>Au revoir</code>, doesn't have
to mean goodbye forever. Not that I have any hopes of picking it back up, but if 2020 has taught the world anything,
it's that life is unpredictable.</p>
<p>For my final point I'd like to give a special shout-out to <a href="https://twitter.com/Clo__S">@Clo__S</a>, who aside from being
an early adopter and wonderful source of feedback was probably Notebag's most vocal fan. Thanks for all the support along
the way.</p>

<p>Moore’s law has been the driver of semiconductor capabilities and cost for decades. This phenomenon is still being pushed by the likes of TSMC, Intel, and Samsung in logic, but in DRAM, it is dead. DRAM scaling slowed significantly nearly a decade ago and it is moving at a snail’s pace now. New DRAM nodes are now a tiny fraction of a shrink. Going from 20nm to sub 10nm is going to take at least 5 different incremental node shrinks.</p>

<p>Density has not doubled over even the last 5 years. Despite this, DRAM demand has continued to grow at an incredible pace. This is not a shocker to anyone who follows the semiconductor field.</p>

<p>The death of this scaling is what caused previous price spikes. As technology scaling slows, the only way to produce DRAM is with more wafers. It became a very capital-intensive task to increase DRAM bit output when this became true.</p>

<p>Most of the wafer output increases will be coming from new fabs, as existing clean room space is bursting at the seams. This contrasts from Logic which requires much more clean room space and fab area for node shrinks, despite relatively stable wafer output on the leading edge.</p>

<p>More wafers require additional clean room space and semiconductor capital equipment. This spells great news for the likes of Applied Materials, ASML, Lam Reaseach, KLA-Tencor, and Tokyo Electron. Not all of these companies stand to gain the same and investors should keep this in mind when targeting the DRAM semi capital equipment market.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    
                  <p><img src="https://chaordic-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/images/productivity-1995786_960_720.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>To productively build serverless &amp; distributed systems, we need to adopt new practices, some which may seem counterintuitive at first. This post will suggest five concrete practices to up your game.</p>
<p>Let’s jump in, roughly in order of importance:</p>
<h4 id="1-prefer-running-your-system-in-the-cloud-over-local-emulation">1. Prefer running your system in the cloud over local emulation</h4>
<p>Local development is sacred cow for many developers, being able to deploy, run and test an application or system on your laptop. But the reality of modern distributed systems is that some things cannot easily be emulated locally, if at all.</p>
<p>It is not for a lack of trying: systems running on Kubernetes are often emulated with Docker Compose or Minikube, with varying levels of success. For AWS Serverless, we have AWS SAM and LocalStack.</p>
<p>There are however a few issues with this type of emulation:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cost of maintaining emulation is high, since you effectively maintain two stacks - one for local development, and one for “real” deployment.</li>
<li>Emulation isn’t the real thing: you will find configuration drift, small or large differences in the behaviour of your stack.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, our experience of trying to maintain emulation is that the costs far outweigh the benefits. That effort should instead be put towards the ability to deploy local code quickly to the cloud environment, or where possible, connect a locally running process to a real environment in the cloud.</p>
<p>One of the great benefits of Serverless in particular, is that the cost of creating and provisioning <em>Feature Environments</em> is approaching zero. Moving local development to the cloud is a low-cost proposition.</p>
<h4 id="2-cicd-pipelines-are-not-enough-local-deployment-automation-is-crucial">2. CI/CD Pipelines are not enough, local deployment automation is crucial</h4>
<p>Given our stance on local emulation, the next instinct to suppress is that of relying on CI/CD to manage deployments to feature environments. If we rely entirely on CI pipelines for our ongoing development work, we end up wasting large amounts of time waiting for CI pipelines to build and deploy.</p>
<p>If instead, CI &amp; local development workflows can share as much as possible of deployment infrastructure, we should be able to reduce/remove this bottleneck on development, while also minimizing the duplicated effort of maintaining two types of automation.</p>
<p>In summary, any developer should trivially be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deploy or connect locally built resources to their own feature environment in seconds with a single command from their laptop.</li>
<li>Deploy only the unit of deployment which has changed.</li>
<li>Have a development experience that is practically indistinguishable from “local development”.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-for-aws-serverless--function-as-a-service---monolithic-functions-are-ok">3. For AWS Serverless &amp; “Function-as-a-Service” - monolithic functions are OK</h4>
<p>The first thing many teams do when they first start using AWS Lambda, is that they create separate deployable functions for every type of function invocation. For instance, a REST API gets a function for every single endpoint on the API. However, if you think in terms of <em>Domain Driven Design</em>, this might mean you end up with a number of functions that logically make up a single <em>Bounded Context</em>.</p>
<p>There are also practical considerations: as an example, AWS CloudFormation has a default limit of maximum 200 resources per stack. When you start adding up the multiplicative effect of the resources required for a Serverless application, you quickly realise that this is a limit that can be easily reached. Sticking to a service per Bounded Context, that acts as the target for multiple types of Lambda invocations is a sensible thing to do. Doing this will also reduce the automation and coordination overhead.</p>
<h4 id="4-consider-adopting-a-monorepo-with-tooling-appropriate-for-monorepos">4. Consider adopting a monorepo, with tooling appropriate for monorepos</h4>
<p>Let us start with a caveat emptor: monorepos without using appropriate tooling can be a disaster of slow CI pipelines &amp; low productivity. The upside is that some amazing and battle-tested tooling for monorepos exist these days (a personal favourite is <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a>, which originated from Google).</p>
<p>Without a monorepo, building distributed systems can be painful.</p>
<p>With dozens of repositories, code navigation for larger changes spanning multiple services become painful. Another thing that quickly becomes painful is dependency management, code sharing &amp; reuse. It is not uncommon to find that different components have different, mutually incompatible dependencies, which become painful to upgrade.</p>
<p>A monorepo negates these pains, while also making things such as security audits easier to conduct and address.</p>
<p>However, to avoid the “rebuild the universe” problem with monorepos, you need tooling that solves three problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change detection &amp; dependency-graph tracking.</li>
<li>Dependency-graph based rebuilds (rebuild only what has changed and what is invalidated by the change).</li>
<li>Build caching.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="5-implement-all-three-pillars-of-observability">5. Implement all three pillars of observability</h4>
<p>Observability in control theory is defined as the ability to infer the internal state of a system by from knowledge about its external outputs. In practice, this is the triumvirate of event logs (log aggregation &amp; analytics), metrics (for alerting) &amp; tracing (driving visualization). Most organizations today skew heavily towards event logs only, with maybe some metrics, but very few do all three well.</p>
<p>In a distributed systems world, doing all three pillars of observability well means that the time to detect, find and address bugs and other issues can be cut down to a fraction of what it would otherwise be. Furthermore, great observability will also improve developer productivity, since we can better understand the state of our entire system.</p>
<p>This is perhaps an area where AWS Serverless stands out as a leader. While the Kubernetes eco-system is filled with many options of various complexity and quality, AWS gives us an easy way to achieve a high level of observability at low effort and cost. <em>CloudWatch Logs, CloudWatch Metrics</em> and <em>AWS X-Ray</em> can provide observability to a Serverless architecture at a relatively low threshold of effort and learning.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>It should be obvious by now that Serverless &amp; distributed systems require great discipline in deployment automation. It is unfortunate that many still make the distinction between deployment being an “ops” concern, separate from development.</p>
<p>Dev &amp; Ops in modern systems are intertwined, the level and quality of automation has a great impact on DevEx (Developer Experience), and thus developer productivity. It is not a concern that can be postponed or thought about after the fact: it requires effort initially, and disciplined refinement throughout. If this is done well, you will be able to develop with a speed, reliability and level of productivity that will run rings around the competition.</p>
<p>We will return to this subject in the future to show what a practical Serverless toolchain and reference architecture could look like. Feel free to sign up to our email list below to get notified when we do!</p>

The new field called <code>referer</code> — a misspelling of the word <i>referrer</i> — allowed "the client to specify, for the server's benefit, the address (URI) of the resource from which the Request-URI was obtained". A great addition to the protocol, but ter-ible spelling 😛</p><p>75 years later, on every website request that is made, there is now a <code>referer</code> header. Barker later <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!original/alt.folklore.computers/7X75In21_54/JgV9Rw04f-EJ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">joke</a>d that he was trying to get the Oxford English dictionary to adjust their spelling..."since my spelling is used several billion times a minute more than theirs" </p><p>SQL queries have been written, databases have been designed, bugs have been introduced...because of how Barker and Fieldings spelled this word. </p><a href="#&quot;in-this-great-future,-you-can't-forget-your-past&quot;" id="&quot;in-this-great-future,-you-can't-forget-your-past&quot;"><h2>"In this great future, you can't forget your past"</h2></a><p>Developing products is inherently path dependent. History matters. Every product decision you've made determines every product decision you're going to make in the future.</p><p><img src="https://n2parko.com/api/asset?assetUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F147e9b25-92c3-4534-bfef-510315be9d39%2FUntitled.png&amp;blockId=cb6c5a83-5484-4e3d-8049-e7c40cb03e23" alt="An image from Notion"></p><p>Product-Market Fit is where that initial path is set. It is Decision A. At that point, you could've head in any direction. You could turn around quickly, and head in another direction. But the further you go down a particular trail, the further you have to backtrack. The more people you convince to join you on the trail, the more you have to explain why <i>everyone</i> needs to turn around. </p><p>I've found that thinking about your product path dependency is a helpful framework for understanding why your product is the way it is, and how to shape its future. It helps clarify why parts of your product — the product you are building! — stink and are so hard to fix. It clarifies which decisions matter and which do not. </p><p>And it helps you understand how and when you can change that path.</p><a href="#exploring-some-paths" id="exploring-some-paths"><h2>Exploring Some Paths</h2></a><p>Let's explore a few examples of Product Path Dependency at play...</p><a href="#smtp-protocol" id="smtp-protocol"><h3>SMTP Protocol</h3></a><p>Most email clients don't let you retract an email once it's been sent. You also can't edit a sent email. Most email clients — from Superhuman to HEY to Gmail — are built on the assumption that a sent email is a sent email. </p><p>Products have gotten creative to work around this assumption. Superhuman adds a 10 second wait period to allow you to unsend. If both sender and recipient are using Microsoft Exchange, an email can be "recalled". </p><p>But an <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc821" rel="noopener" target="_blank">early decision in 1982</a> is largely still dictating how much of the world digitally communicates.  </p><p><img src="https://n2parko.com/api/asset?assetUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F902fe272-6f32-4432-8a0f-718df674cc53%2FUntitled.png&amp;blockId=96299059-f253-4b65-8d7c-138bfc19f900" alt="An image from Notion"></p><p>Slack is a great example of what can happen when new entrants aren't burdened by past decisions. Rather than using SMTP, slack uses Websockets. When you send a message, the recipients see the message almost immediately. And you can edit, delete, pin and share the messages you're sending. </p><p>Once you've used Slack, you wonder why email was so static and immutable. It revisited an assumption, and made it painfully visible. </p><a href="#instagram" id="instagram"><h3>Instagram</h3></a><p>There's been a lot of <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/8/5/21354975/tiktok-clone-instagram-reels-facebook-copycat" rel="noopener" target="_blank">shade</a> thrown at Instagram for attempting to clone hit features like Stories (Snapchat) and Reels (TikTok). Occasionally these clones will work, in the case of Stories, but most of the time they flop.

Now put yourself in the shoes of the PM responsible for shipping Reels. You're trying to figure out how to fit Reels in alongside Stories, IGTV, Shop, Well-Being Guides, DMs for Brands, Influencers, Advertisers, and a user base in every country around the world. </p><p><img src="https://n2parko.com/api/asset?assetUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F9c67aef4-e50a-47b7-baf6-cceddeef5173%2FUntitled.png&amp;blockId=85d7f892-4c3b-4a23-8c45-c33b213177cf" alt="An image from Notion"></p><a href="#what-to-do-about-product-path-dependence" id="what-to-do-about-product-path-dependence"><h2>What to do about product path dependence?</h2></a><p>Path dependency is inherent to product development. It is a badge of successfully building something that people want, and an organization that can support it. So if we can't avoid it, what can we do about it? </p><a href="#early-decisions-are-disproportionately-important" id="early-decisions-are-disproportionately-important"><h3>Early Decisions are <i>Disproportionately Important</i></h3></a><p>There is a paradox of early product decision-making. Early decisions are disproportionately important in that all future decisions will rely on it. Yet they are also the ones that need to be made the fastest and given the least consideration. "Try it out and see what sticks." Until it sticks, and then you are left with that decision for a very long time. </p><p>I think there's a way to resolve this tension by making decisions that <i>preserve future optionality</i>. It's somewhat of a hack to avoid making a decision that you will have to unwind in the future.  </p><p>Let's take a user data model as a simple example. When you have no users, designing your data model is easy. You can change on the fly. As you build more features — like your sign up flow — they are built around the assumptions you made in designing your user model. Are you going to collect birthday? Are you going to ask them to use a company email address? Can they invite friends? As you build upon these early product assumptions, they become harder and riskier to change. </p><p>Designing for optionality may take slightly more time, but thinking through some potential options you might want down the line can reduce your path dependence. </p><ul><li>Will Users be part of an Account?</li><li>Will Users need to be Linked via a social graph?</li><li>Will Users need to have multiple Plans?</li></ul><p><img src="https://n2parko.com/api/asset?assetUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fa558f675-6d7e-45a3-ade1-174780e3bb29%2FUntitled.png&amp;blockId=38c88d0c-697e-4319-ab5e-a7fd6f9d6881" alt="An image from Notion"></p><p>An option-preserving decision early on can save you months or years of migration work down the line. </p><a href="#competitors-are-forging-their-own-paths" id="competitors-are-forging-their-own-paths"><h3>Competitors are forging their own paths</h3></a><p>Competitors are on a path as well, but it's different from yours. By understanding your competitors path, you can understand what they might do in the future, and what they aren't able to do given their prior decisions. A company geared at large enterprises has likely built a sales team that will be reluctant  to lower prices to sell to startups. A company designed to run on-prem will have quarters/years to migrate to the cloud. </p><p>New entrants are unburdened by decisions of the the past and can move much faster in many more directions. Every so often, revisit the assumptions and "path" that you are on. If you were to start all over again, how might your product and the org look different? Migrations and re-writes can be painful, but better to do so early than to continue to building on a crumbling foundation. </p><a href="#pms-are-the-&quot;product-historians&quot;" id="pms-are-the-&quot;product-historians&quot;"><h3>PMs are the "Product Historians"</h3></a><p>PMs can play an important role in understanding the market, organizational, and technology constraints that of the past, that led to the product today. In doing so, you'll be able to revisit past assumptions, avoid making the same mistakes, and build the trust of your team and customers. It's easy to fall into the trap that those who came before made bad decisions. Rarely is that the case. They made the best decision they could with the data and assumptions they were working off of. </p><p>By putting yourself in the shoes of those that came before — and really understanding the context — you can make even better decisions going forward. </p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
              <p>We’re excited to announce the release of version 1.20. The 1.20 release shipped on Oct 26, 2020. This version delivers new features as well as resolving issues for users on version 1.19 and older.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>

<p>In addition to bug fixes and user interface improvements, there are a couple of new features and improvements which deserve a spotlight.</p>

<h3 id="saml-saml-saml">SAML, SAML, SAML</h3>

<p>With this release, FusionAuth implements additional parts of the SAML 2.0 standard.</p>

<p>FusionAuth now has support for SAML POST bindings when it is acting as either the SP or the IdP. This allows FusionAuth to integrate with a number of popular commercial off-the-shelf applications and websites, including <a href="https://developers.login.gov/saml/">login.gov</a> and <a href="https://docs.alfresco.com/saml/concepts/saml-overview.html">Alfresco</a>.</p>

<p>FusionAuth also supports the <code>SessionIndex</code> attribute, which is optional, but required by some software applications, notably Artifactory.</p>

<p>Finally FusionAuth now honors the <code>AssertionConsumerServiceURL</code> in a SAML request. Multiple redirect URLs can be configured in the application SAML settings as well.</p>

<h3 id="docker-changes">Docker changes</h3>

<p>In this release, we updated the base image for Docker from <code>alpine</code> to <code>ubuntu:focal</code>. This should not impact functionality, but it’s worth paying attention to if you are building Docker images based on our image.</p>

<p>We made this change because in order to run on <code>alpine</code> without including the GNU C Library (<code>glibc</code>) we had to use a custom build of OpenJDK compiled using the <code>musl</code> C library. Due to some possible performance concerns with this option, we have moved to an official build of JDK provided by AdoptOpenJDK. This build is compiled using <code>glibc</code>. Unfortunately, using the <code>ubuntu:focal</code> image increased the docker image size by approximately 30 MB over the <code>alpine</code> based image. However, until we can obtain official builds from AdoptOpenJDK based upon the <code>musl</code> C library, we are not planning to ship an official FusionAuth image on <code>alpine</code> due to the performance concerns.</p>

<h3 id="additional-admin-user-management-forms">Additional admin user management forms</h3>

<p>In version 1.18, FusionAuth added <a href="https://fusionauth.io/features/advanced-registration-forms/">custom registration forms</a> for users with a paid edition.</p>

<p>In this release, we’ve added a few new forms. These customizations are also only available to customers with a paid edition. (Learn more about <a href="https://fusionauth.io/pricing/">purchasing a paid edition</a>.)</p>

<p>This new feature allows you to customize the form used to add or edit a user from the FusionAuth admin UI. These forms can be configured on a per tenant basis. For instance, you can now require a mobile phone number or require one or many custom fields when a FusionAuth admin is creating a user.</p>

<p>You can also modify the registration creation and update form in the FusionAuth admin UI, including capturing custom data, removing unused fields and adding validation to the custom fields. This form is configurable on an application by application basis.</p>

<p>For instance, if your business logic needs to know a user’s favorite color (or anything else), FusionAuth has you covered:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/release-1-20/custom-edit-registration-form.png" alt="A customized registration editing form."></p>

<p>When combined with FusionAuth’s granular roles, which allow you to create users with limited privileges, you can expose these forms to customer service reps or other users whom you might not want to access the entire FusionAuth admin UI.</p>

<h2 id="bugs-squashed">Bugs squashed</h2>

<p>In addition to these features, there were over ten other bugs squashed and GitHub issues resolved as well. These fixes include changes to JWT contents in certain situations, dashboard user counts, and superfluous log messages. Please see the <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/release-notes/">release notes</a> for the full breakdown of the changes between 1.19 and 1.20.</p>

<p>If you’d like to upgrade your self-hosted FusionAuth instance, see our <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/upgrade/">upgrade guide</a>. If you have a FusionAuth Cloud deployment, open a <a href="https://account.fusionauth.io/" target="_blank">support request from your account dashboard</a> or <a href="https://fusionauth.io/contact" target="_blank">use our contact form</a> and we’ll get your servers upgraded! Or, if you’d like to download and use FusionAuth, <a href="https://fusionauth.io/pricing/">check out your options</a>.</p>

                                <div><p>Reddit will give employees, with some exceptions, the flexibility to work outside of offices going forward, the company said Tuesday in&nbsp;a blog post.</p>

<p>U.S. employees will now be paid the same, based on high-cost locations like NY or San Francisco, whether they work from those places or not.</p>

<p>â€œMoving forward, teams and team members will have flexibility to explore where they work: in the office, remotely, or a combination of the two,â€� the post said.</p>

<p>For those who do come into the office, the spaces will be look different: Reddit said itâ€™s â€œreimaginingâ€� its office space, without fixed desks and with â€œneighborhoodsâ€� for teams to work together. The newly flexible approach will help Reddit bring in top talent without concerns about relocations, increase workersâ€™ engagement and make their office space more efficient.</p>

<p>Several&nbsp;tech firms, including Facebook and Slack, have said during the pandemic that their workers are free to relocate and work remotely going forward, but they will be paid based on where they live. Stripe Inc. said that it would pay employees who relocate from the Bay Area or New York a one-time bonus of $20,000 â€“ but theyâ€™d also get a pay cut of as much as 10%. Brex, a fintech company based in San Francisco, has also outlined salary reductions for employees who move out of the Bay Area and New York to places like Austin, Texas or Utah.</p>

<p>â€œWe will not be afraid to continuously adapt and evolve our workforce philosophies, programs, and processes,â€� Redditâ€™s post stated.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>
I used to hate the term “networking”.
</p>
<p>
I remember walking home one day when I saw one of my friends rushing towards our career center. When I asked why he was in such a hurry, he mentioned there was a networking event going on. 
</p>
<p>
He carefully explained that your network is your net worth. I puked a bit in my mouth and continued home. 
</p>
<p>
It always seemed really artificial to me - you go to a place with the intention of meeting someone who’ll benefit your career, irrespective of your actual interest in getting to know them as a person. 
</p>
<p>
That doesn’t sit right with me. It leads to artificial and short sighted conversations. 
</p>
<p>
After thinking about it more, I realized that the reason I don’t like networking events is because the agenda is very unclear. 
</p>
<p>
And no, an opportunity to potentially meet someone who will help advance your career is not a clear agenda. I guess what I don’t like is that these events are trying really hard to manufacture serendipity. And no one likes a try-hard. 
</p>
<p>
But then you have something like developer meetups which I think are much better, mainly because the agenda is clear: you’re learning about something new. And you’re doing it together. 
</p>
<p>
Now, in the process of learning, you might indeed meet like minded people who help you advance in your career. But the point is that, this is not the primary purpose of the meetup - it’s just a byproduct. 
</p>
<h2>The best networking is learning</h2>


<p>
This got me thinking and then I realized that the best form of networking is learning. You either offer value by sharing your knowledge or by asking someone else a specific question about something they have experience with.
</p>
<p>
That’s why the best way to network is to write blog posts, reach out to people you admire with specific requests, and to use platforms like Twitter to find interesting content. 
</p>
<p>
This is the opposite of exchanging business cards and sending random Linkedin requests. 
</p>
<p>
This is networking done right - you have a clear agenda in mind and the focus is on giving value. Not like vague entrepreneurship conferences where the supposed goal is to end up with as many business cards as humanly possible. 
</p>
<p>
And to be clear, I don’t think the above has anything to do with being an extrovert or an introvert. 
</p>
<p>
Those two are just attitude types, not interpersonal skills, and more importantly, everyone has both sides. 
</p>
<p>
I consider myself an introvert but when I’m interested in a topic and I read something insightful about it, I’ve made it a habit to reach out to the author. 
</p>
<p>
Here are a few examples I’ve seen that embody the “best way of networking is learning” approach. 
</p>
<h2>Example #1: Learning in public</h2>

<p>
I follow <a href="https://twitter.com/stopachka/status/1318361464831442949">Stepan</a> on Twitter. He’s constantly posting his learnings and asking questions. Here’s an example:
</p>
  <center>
    <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_enjoy_networking/stopa_tweet_1.png" alt="">
  </center>
<p>
Most of his tweets won’t get engagement, but sometimes people will comment and discuss topics he’s thinking about. 
</p>
  <center>
    <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_enjoy_networking/stopa_tweet_2.png" alt="">
  </center>
<p>
Over time, when someone visits his profile, they can basically scroll through his timeline and discover what kind of topics he’s interested in. This is a fantastic way to meet like-minded people and develop a high quality network. 
</p>
<h2>Example #2: Blogging </h2>


<p>
I wanted to have a coffee chat with a founder. I reached out to him and he agreed. Instead of just speaking to him in private, I decided to make the <a href="https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/interview-with-ceo-of-appsumo">interview public</a> and wrote it up on my blog (with his permission, of course). 
</p>
  <center>
    <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_enjoy_networking/ayman_screengrab.png" alt="">
  </center>
<p>
People who like the interview can now email me about it and we can talk about something that was discussed. A further benefit is that people can also reach out to Ayman (the CEO I spoke with). 
</p>
<p>
Extending this - people often email me about multiple topics I’ve discussed. All because I decided to publish online and share my thoughts. I’m still at the very early stages of this, but the benefits are already trickling in. 
</p>
<h2>Example #3: Publishing book notes </h2>


<p>
Nat Eliason publishes <a href="https://www.nateliason.com/notes">book notes</a> for almost everything he reads. Talking about books you both like is a great conversation starter. 
</p>
  <center>
    <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_enjoy_networking/eliason_notes.png" alt="">
  </center>
<p>
Again, just like the Twitter example, people can get an overview of the kind of topics that Nat is interested in and reach out to him if they want to talk about something specific.
</p>
<p>
Reaching out to someone you admire or even just a peer works way better when you narrow the focus of conversation. For instance, instead of sending a 500 word email where you ramble your thoughts all over the place, you send 150 words directed at something you want to talk to about.
</p>
<p>
All of the above examples make it really easy to do this.

We're here to help.</blockquote><h2 id="part-1-cotter-setup">Part 1: Cotter Setup</h2><p>Go to <a href="https://dev.cotter.app/">https://dev.cotter.app</a> to create an account. Once you have created an account, make sure to create a new project and grab the API Key ID. We will be using your API Key ID later in part 2.</p><h2 id="part-2-webflow-setup">Part 2: Webflow Setup</h2><p>For this tutorial, we have created 3 pages: Blog Homepage (/), Sign In Page (/login), and Blog Content Page (/protected). We will be using Webflow CMS to do this. Please <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBtF_XuimCo&amp;t=3720s">refer to this YouTube tutorial to create a simple blog</a>.</p><h3 id="blog-homepage-setup">Blog Homepage Setup </h3><p>The Blog Homepage contains a list of your blogs and an overview of each blog. If a reader wants to read the full article, they will be redirected to the Sign In Page where we will show the embedded Cotter login form for your users to type in their email before getting access to the full blog post. If the reader is already signed in, then they will be redirected to the full article page.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Add a Sign-in/Sign-out button</strong></p><p><strong>Add</strong> <strong>a button element to redirect users to the Sign In Page. Moreover, we need to set that button ID to "auth-button"</strong>. This allows the button to be assigned to both "Sign In" and "Sign Out" based on the login status of the user.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Add custom code for the Sign-in/Sign-out button logic</strong></p><p>After finishing the page setup, we can start with adding custom code to the Blog Homepage.

<p>I was first diagnosed with depression when I was working on a startup in 2007. I went to the doctor, told him I was feeling mild flu symptoms for a couple of months, he asked me a few questions, determined that I had depression, gave my some SSRIs, and sent me home.</p>



<p>It worked for a while, but then 2008 happened, our startup collapsed, the stakes got higher and the depression came back. I tried different meds for a few years and every time life took a bad turn the doc recommended I up the dosage. I could see this how  would eventually lead me to a straitjacket and started looking for other ways.</p>



<p>Over the years I tried various forms of therapy, studied and actively practiced life coaching, got married, had kids, moved to another country and changed everything I could think of about my life. Unfortunately the dark bouts of depression remained.</p>



<p>About four years ago I stumbled on a book called Highly Sensitive Person that absolutely blew my mind. I realized I had very intense emotions that I was culturally programmed to repress, which caused my psyche to overload and go into full apathy mode also known as depression.</p>



<p>I’ve been on a path to figure out how to process my emotions without repressing them and combined my personal experience with several non-mainstream techniques to build Wuju. It’s an online app that can help you tap into your hidden emotions and release them so they no longer influence your behaviour or cause depressive symptoms.</p>



<p>I’ve used it in the last 18 months to deal with parenting two kids, surviving infidelity, losing my job, starting a business, and managing covid anxiety. My longest bout of depression now lasts a couple of hours at most, and even that is pretty rare. Others have used the app to deal with loneliness, social media and porn addiction and a general sense of being stuck in a rut.</p>



<p>I can’t make any bold claims yet, but the <a href="https://twitter.com/finereli/status/1314784540703899648?s=20">stats I have from close to 1,000 people</a> show that a single use of the app causes apathy, tension and fear to drop by about 70% and anger by almost 90%.</p>



<p>You can try it too: <a href="https://wuju.app/">wuju.app</a></p>



<hr>



<p>You can try the app for free but full use is subscription based. If you need it but can’t afford it please ping me and we’ll figure something out.</p>



<p>Your mental health is your responsibility and this is an experimental tool that may or may not work for you.</p>

                <p>This article could have been entitled&nbsp;337,737,600 seconds, but hiding the fact that Prototypo started more than 10 years ago would have been a missed opportunity to show the dedication the team and I, as a founder, put in this project over the years.</p>
<p>Prototypo started as a student project when I studied Graphic Design at H.E.A.R Strasbourg in France. As a non-savvy Type Designer I was frustrated to not be able to complete the typeface projects I had in mind. Typefaces are made of rules and systems, right? Catcha! We can code something that follows rules, so we should succeed in coding fonts. That was the starting point of the next 10 years, and the beginning of the Roller Coaster, a.k.a creating a startup company.</p>
<p>Prototypo is a startup like many others: before having a stable and reliable business model, we put a lot of energy into developing innovative and useful technologies for our users.</p>
<p>But before being a startup, Prototypo is a company. Today we have reached the end of our resources without having found the expected Product Market Fit, and so the Break-even.</p>
<p>After several years of a strong dedication and passion for what we’ve built, we decided to shutdown the company.</p>
<p>Since the first second, I knew that it would be a hard journey with many obstacles on the path. But I regret nothing. The next 337,737,599 seconds were full of great experiences, shared with amazing people.</p>
<p>Thank you for those who supported us along the road, it was a great adventure.</p>

<p>Another day, another HackerNews discussion about hiring being broken. The most recent one I saw was triggered by <a href="https://blog.alinelerner.com/ive-been-an-engineer-and-a-recruiter-hiring-is-broken-heres-why-and-heres-what-it-should-be-like-instead/">a blog post</a> by the formidable Aline Lerner (disclaimer: Aline is a friend and we collaborated on a <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring/about">hiring book</a> last year). Now, I 100% agree that hiring is broken, and Aline’s post is really thoughtful. In fact, a lot of “hiring is broken” articles are thoughtful.</p>



<p>But the discussion threads are something else—they miss the point of the article. The discussion threads are even more broken than hiring. And they’re really repetitive. They always do contain grains of truth, but inevitably have us reaching conclusions that are simplistic, and in my opinion, create a pretty bad attitude in the tech industry.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #1: “Hiring sucks for candidates, but hiring managers can do what they want</strong>“</p>



<p>The truth is that hiring is hard for everyone. There’s no question about it. It’s hard for both candidates and for hiring managers. Sure, FAANGs and the startup-du-jour might have a leg up, but most people who are hiring are trying to hire at a non-FAANG, non-sexy company. If you’ve never done it, you should try it at some point in your career. It’s an <em>incredibly </em>humbling experience. Or, at the very least, find a friend who’s spent time on hiring, and ask them for their favorite battle story. They’ve been ghosted by candidates. They’ve spent hours trying to convince people to talk to them. They’ve spent even more time getting candidates to the offer stage, only to lose out to the FAANG / startup-du-jour.</p>



<p>And yes, on the balance, power and information asymmetry work out in favor of the companies hiring. And that asymmetry is much larger with FAANGs. But even FAANGs have to invest a tremendous amount of time and energy into hiring. It’s not really easy for anyone. </p>



<p>Especially if you want to do it <em>well</em>. Ask any successful leader (entrepreneur, manager) what they spend most of their time on, and it’ll either involve a large chunk spent on hiring (if they appreciate the problem and give it the attention it deserves) or dealing with the consequences of bad hiring (if they don’t).</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #2: “Hiring is a crap-shoot—it’s a roll of the dice</strong>“</p>



<p>I strongly disagree with this one. When writing the <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring">Holloway Guide to Technical Hiring and Recruiting</a>, I got to interview dozens of really thoughtful hiring managers and recruiters. They were really good at their jobs. And there were some common themes. They were thoughtful about every step of their process. They kept their process balanced and fair, holding a high bar but respecting candidates and their time. They didn’t chase the same pool of candidates everyone else was chasing—instead, they found non-traditional ways to discover really talented and motivated people who weren’t in the pool of usual suspects. They were thoughtful about what signals they were looking for and how best to assess them. And, they deeply understood their team’s needs, and candidates’ needs, and were really good at deciding when there was or wasn’t a fit. But most of all, they were effective: they built really talented teams.</p>



<p>There are a handful of companies that have built amazing hiring engines, and the proof is that they’ve been able to put together really strong teams. You can generally tell that if a person worked at a certain company at a certain time, that person is probably incredibly intelligent and incredibly motivated (some examples are Google, Facebook, Stripe, Dropbox at different points in time). There will always be noise. Even the best hiring managers will sometimes make hiring mistakes. And of course, even the best engineers may not be a fit for every role or every company. </p>



<p>Again, hiring is hard. But there is not a shred of doubt in my mind that if you are thoughtful about it, you can hire well. And really, you don’t need to be perfect at it. You just need to be better than the rest.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #3: “FAANGs suck at hiring”</strong></p>



<p>This one has some truth to it, but it’s a lot more subtle than “FAANGs suck at hiring”. Because let’s face it, they do hire really smart people. Some of the smartest people I know are at FAANGs right now. So let’s decouple that statement a little more.</p>



<p>FAANGs <em>do </em>suck at parts of hiring, like their candidate experience. They can be really slow at making hiring decisions. Their hiring process might be tedious and seem arbitrary. But <em>they usually can get away with it</em>, <em>and you probably can’t!</em> They’ve got a strong brand, interesting technical challenges (interesting for some people, at least), and a lot of money. In fact, one FAANG VP of Engineering told me: “our process is what we can get away with”. To the point that they can even play it off as a positive: “our process is slow and long because we are <em>very</em> selective”.</p>



<p>And look, I’m sure FAANGs lose some talented candidates who get turned off by their “you’d-be-blessed-to-work-with-us” attitude. They definitely have a lot of room for improvement. But at the end of the day, they’re operating a process that’s delivering large quantities of really smart people at scale. In fact, I’d argue their internal processes around strategy, performance management / promotions, etc cause incredibly <em>more</em> damage to them than broken hiring—if you lose out on hiring one talented person when you have thousands applying to work for you, that’s one story, but if you hire someone really talented and driven, and they work for you for 6 to 12 months but don’t meet their potential and leave in bitter frustration… well, that’s a subject for another post)</p>



<p>“But”, people go on, “FAANGs <em>also</em> don’t know how to interview!” Which brings me to trope #4.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #4: “Whiteboard</strong> <strong>and algo/coding interviews suck”</strong></p>



<p>Again, this one has some truth to it, but if you just stop at the above statement, you miss the point.</p>



<p>Algo/coding interviews are one of the primary hiring mechanisms used by FAANG companies. And they are incredibly unpopular—at least in discussion threads. But big companies have spent years looking at their hiring data and feeding that back into their hiring process (coining the term “<a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/subjects/people-analytics/">people analytics</a>” along the way).</p>



<p>The argument against them is usually a combination of:</p>



<ul><li>they really only assess pattern-matching skills (map a problem to something you’ve seen before)</li><li>they only assess willingness to spend time preparing for these types of interviews</li></ul>



<p>These are fair criticisms, but that doesn’t mean these interviews are actually terrible. I mean, they might be terrible for you if you’re interviewing and you don’t get the job. You’re probably a brilliant engineer, and I agree, these interviews certainly don’t fully assess your ability (or maybe you’re a shit engineer, I don’t know you personally). In any case, the leap from “this interview sucked for me” to “this interview sucks” is still pretty big.</p>



<p>If you’re a large tech co with a big brand and a salary scale that ranks at the top of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.levels.fyi/">Levels.fyi</a>, you probably get a lot of applications. So a good interview process is one that weeds out people who wouldn’t do well at your company. To do well at a large tech company, you need to (and I’m painting with a really broad brush, but this is true for 90% of roles at these companies):</p>



<ol><li>Some sort of problem-solving skill that’s a mix of raw intelligence and/or ability to solve problems by pattern-matching to things you’ve seen before.</li><li>Ability/commitment to work on something that may not&nbsp;<em>always&nbsp;</em>be that intrinsically motivating, in the context of getting/maintaining a well-paying job at a large, known company.</li></ol>



<p>Hopefully you can see where I’m going with this. Basically, the very criticisms thrown at these types of interviews are the reason they work well for these companies. They’re a good proxy for the work you’d be doing there and how willing you are to do it. If you’re good at pattern matching, and are willing to invest effort into practicing to get one of these jobs, you’ll probably do well at the job.</p>



<p>Not that there’s anything wrong with that type of work. I spent several years at big tech co’s, and the work was intellectually stimulating most of the time. But a lot of times it wasn’t. It was a lot of pattern-matching. Looking at how someone else had solved a problem in a different part of the code-base, and adapting that to my use-case.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if you’re an engineer (no matter how brilliant) who struggles with being told what to do or doing work that you can’t immediately connect to something intrinsically motivating to you, that FAANG interview just did both you and the company a favor by weeding you out of the process.</p>



<p>So the truth is, there is no single “best interview technique”. In our book, we wrote several chapters about different interviewing techniques and their pros and cons. In-person algo/coding interviews on a whiteboard, in-person interviews where you work in an existing code base, <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring/sections/take-homes">take-home interviews</a>, pairing together, having a trial period, etc all have pros and cons. The trick is finding a technique that works for both the company and the candidate. </p>



<p>And that can really differ from company to company and candidate to candidate. A VP at Netflix told me about how they had a really strong candidate come in, but when asked to do a whiteboard-type interview, informed them (politely) that they might as well just reject him then. He was no good at whiteboard interviews… But if they allowed him to go home and write some code, he’d be happy to talk through it. And since then, many Netflix teams have offered candidates the choice of doing a take home.</p>



<p>And really, any interview format can suck. It can fail to assess a candidate for the things a company needs and it can be a negative candidate experience. Which would you rather have:</p>



<ul><li>A whiteboard interview with heavy algorithms for a role where that knowledge (or ability to develop that knowledge) isn’t critical, delivered by an apathetic engineer who doesn’t care about their job.</li><li>A …</li></ul></div></article></main></section></div></div>

				<h3 id="pants-2-0-0-the-first-stable-release-of-the-pants-v2-open-source-build-system-is-out-now-">Pants 2.0.0, the first stable release of the Pants v2 open-source build system, is out now!</h3><p>There are so many tools in the Python development ecosystem. You might use <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/">pip</a> to resolve dependencies, <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/">pytest</a> to run tests, <a href="https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/">flake8</a> and <a href="https://www.pylint.org/">pylint</a> for lint checks, <a href="https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">black</a> and <a href="https://pycqa.github.io/isort/">isort</a> for auto-formatting, <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a> for type checking, <a href="https://ipython.org/">IPython</a> or <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> for interactive sessions, <a href="https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">setuptools</a>, <a href="https://pex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">pex</a> or <a href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a> for packaging, <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">protocol buffers</a> for code generation, and many more. Not to mention any custom tooling you've built for your repo. </p><p>Installing, configuring and orchestrating the invocation of these tools<strong>—</strong>all while not re-executing work unnecessarily<strong>—</strong>is a hard problem, especially as your codebase grows. The lack of a robust, scalable build system for Python has been a problem for a long time, and this has become even more acute in recent years, with Python codebases increasing in size and complexity. </p><p>Fortunately, there is now a tailor-made (pun intended) solution: <strong>Pants v2</strong>!</p><p><a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/">Pants v2</a> is designed from the ground-up for fast, consistent builds. Some noteworthy features include:</p><ul><li>Minimal metadata and boilerplate</li><li>Fine-grained workflow</li><li>Shared result caching</li><li>Concurrent execution</li><li>A responsive, scalable UI</li><li>Unified interface for multiple tools and languages</li><li>Extensibility and customizability via a plugin API</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.pantsbuild.org/content/images/2020/10/render1603750306032.gif" alt=""><figcaption>Pants running multiple linters in parallel</figcaption></figure><p>Read on to learn more about Pants v2, and what it means for your Python codebase.</p><hr><h2 id="a-little-history">A little history</h2><p>We started the original open-source Pants project back in 2011. At the time, we were frustrated by slow, flaky Scala builds. The leading strategy for scaling was to hand each developer a RAM stick and a screwdriver... Surely this was a problem we could tackle with software! Thus Pants v1 was born. </p><p>Pants v1 was quite successful, and was adopted at cutting-edge tech companies such as Twitter, Foursquare, Square and others. But we still weren't satisfied: The APIs were clunkier than we would have liked, the UI was overly chatty, caching was hard to get right, and concurrent execution had to be special-cased. We knew there were plenty of performance and stability improvements to be had, if we could only unlock them. </p><p>We learned a lot from our years of work on Pants v1, and knew that we could design something new and better, leaning on our experience with v1 while addressing the drawbacks of that system. Luckily, at the same time as we began thinking about this hypothetical next system, a new motivating problem emerged: Python builds.</p><h2 id="python-builds-today">Python builds today</h2><p>As you probably know, Python has skyrocketed in popularity in recent years. Not only is it used to build a wide variety of server applications, via frameworks such as <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a>, but it's also the language of choice for data scientists, thanks to powerful libraries and tools such as <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a>, <a href="https://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a>, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> and <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a>. </p><p>Python hits a sweet spot of simplicity and power, but there is a big problem - there is no truly great scalable build tool for Python, and this is becoming a real pain point as Python repos grow like never before. &nbsp;</p><p>Python builds today involve manually invoking a wide variety of tools. Each tool has to be installed, configured and invoked in just the right way, often while sequencing the output of one tool into input of another. Knowing how to use each tool in a given scenario is complicated and burdensome. </p><p>Sure, you can hack around the problem for a while with some combination of shell scripts, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html">Makefiles</a>, <a href="https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">tox</a>, and <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">poetry</a>. But even a small code change might require you to run a huge amount of sequential build work. Re-executing the same processes with the same inputs over and over again is a frustrating waste of time and resources. &nbsp;And these solutions start to break down as your codebase grows.</p><p>Perhaps you experimented with more complex build systems, such as <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a> or <a href="https://v1.pantsbuild.org/">Pants v1</a>. &nbsp;But it's laborious to maintain all that BUILD metadata, all for a sub-par experience not optimized for Python. Not to mention the difficulty of implementing your own custom build logic. </p><p>Alternatively, maybe you've been tempted to split up your codebase into multiple interdependent repos, each with their own "smaller" builds. But that creates an even thornier problem, namely how to manage those interdependencies. Having to propagate changes across codebase boundaries can slow development down to a crawl, and leave you with the worst of both worlds - slower processes and a fragmented, unmanageable codebase.</p><p>A great build system for repos - of all sizes - that include Python code would support fine-grained invalidation and caching, so that it only executes the build work actually affected by a change. It would support concurrent local and even remote execution, to greatly speed up work by using all available CPU. It would be easy to adopt in a small repo, but would scale up as your codebase grows. It wouldn't require huge amounts of boilerplate metadata, and it would be easy to extend with custom build logic. </p><p>Well, Pants v2 is that system! </p><h2 id="introducing-pants-v2">Introducing Pants v2</h2><p><a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/">Pants v2</a> is a completely new open-source build system, inspired by our work on Pants v1. &nbsp;We've been developing and testing it for the last couple of years, and it's finally ready for prime time!</p><p>A key factor in the design of Pants v2 was a set of lessons we learned from Pants v1 and other existing systems, such as Bazel. Among them: that ease of use and performance matter, boilerplate is annoying, concurrency and caching require hard design work, and most people will need custom logic at some point.</p><h3 id="lesson-1-ease-of-use-and-performance-both-matter">Lesson #1: Ease of use and performance both matter</h3><p>When designing software you often find yourself making tradeoffs between ease of use and performance. But in a build system, both are vital. The Pants v2 execution engine - which is the performance-critical heart of the system - is written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, for raw speed. And the domain-specific build logic is written in familiar, easy to work with, type-annotated Python 3. This helps make Pants v2 easy to extend, without compromising performance. </p><p>Pants v2 also runs a daemon that memoizes fine-grained build state in memory, for even faster performance. This daemon watches for changes to your source files and precisely invalidates its state on the fly to ensure that the minimum amount of work happens the next time you build.</p><h3 id="lesson-2-writing-build-metadata-is-a-real-drag">Lesson #2: Writing build metadata is a real drag</h3><p>Some build tools are slow because they don't have enough information about the structure of your code to intelligently perform incremental work. Others have gone too far in the other direction, requiring a huge amount of metadata and boilerplate in BUILD files, especially relating to your code's dependencies. </p><p>Pants v2 offers the best of both worlds - intelligent, fine-grained incremental work, without the boilerplate. It does so by assuming sensible, magic-free defaults, inferring dependencies from the import statements in your code, and supporting plugins for custom inference logic. Stay tuned for an upcoming post on exactly how Pants achieves this!</p><h3 id="lesson-3-design-for-caching-concurrency-and-remoting">Lesson #3: Design for caching, concurrency and remoting </h3><p>Writing build logic that can be cached and executed concurrently and remotely is very hard. You have to be very careful about not producing or consuming side-effects, and it's extremely difficult to tack that on later. And unless you design your APIs with care, supporting these kinds of features often places severe restrictions on what your build logic may safely do. </p><p>In Pants v2, build logic is composed of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">pure</a> Python 3 <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html">async coroutines</a>. So a build rule can depend not only on its inputs, but can also await on new data at runtime - all of which is precisely tracked for invalidation and caching. This gives us the best of both worlds: logic that is properly isolated from side-effects, and is therefore amenable to caching, concurrent execution and remoting, while still allowing the use of natural control flow.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pantsbuild.org/content/images/2020/10/caching.gif" alt=""><figcaption>We run both tests, then add a syntax error to one test and rerun; the unmodified test uses the cache and is isolated from the syntax error.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="lesson-4-almost-everyone-needs-to-customize-their-builds">Lesson #4: Almost everyone needs to customize their builds</h3><p>Most teams have custom build steps, so extensibility is a key feature in any build system. Pants v2 is built around a <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/plugins-overview">plugin architecture</a>. You can write your own rules using the same API as the built-in functionality. So your custom build logic will enjoy the same fine-grained invalidation, caching, concurrency and remote execution abilities as the core Pants code.</p><h2 id="pants-2-0-0-is-out-now-">Pants 2.0.0 is out now!</h2><p>All this leads me to the happy announcement that <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pantsbuild.pants/2.0.0/">Pants 2.0.0</a>, the first stable release of Pants v2, is out now! 2.0.0 is the culmination of years of design and development work, and many months of beta testing at several organizations. So we're really happy, proud (and relieved…) to finally have it ready for general use. </p><p>You can see what Python tools Pants currently supports <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/python">here</a>. There are also commands for querying and understanding your dependency graph, and a robust help system. &nbsp;We're adding support for additional tools and features all the time, and it's straightforward to implement your own. Beta users have already written their own logic for Cython and docker, for example. </p><p>Now is a great time to adopt Pants 2.0.0! The team that developed Pants v2 is <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/community">ready to help you</a> onboard, answer any questions, and even pair with you to help you write any custom build logic. We're also eager to get feedback, bug reports and suggestions for what features we should focus on in the next weeks and months of development.</p><p>Pants v2 is developed by a helpful open source community, is funded by a 501(c)6 non-profit, and has excellent support available. If you have a growing Python codebase, and want to take Pants 2.0.0 for a spin, <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/community">let us know</a>. We'd love to fit you with some new Pants today!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>October 2020</p><p>Aaron Chen</p><p>The vast majority of software-related internships should weigh meaningful interest over technical experience.</p><p>If an applicant can effectively display <strong>qualified interest</strong> through a well-thought and value-aligned argument, then they deserve that spot over those who don’t display that initiative. <em><strong>Even</strong> if there are others that seem more technically qualified</em>. </p><p>In a world of hiring, meritocracy reigns supreme <!-- -->[1]<!-- -->. And for good reason. The most effective individuals are the most skilled. A for-profit company’s essential and primary goal is to make money. To do that, a company needs to provide a product or service at a certain level of quality and form. At the base level, it’s simple: to create the best product, hire the best engineers. But these open positions inherently have a certain expectation of performance granted upon them. Internships on the other hand are fundamentally different.</p><p>One primary difference is that they’re learning-focused <!-- -->[2]<!-- -->. Companies hire full-time engineers with the expectation that they’ll be able to produce, and not primarily to learn <!-- -->[3]<!-- -->. On the other hand, interns are hired so they’ll learn the product and company. At its center internships are used to test candidates in a real world environment <!-- -->[4]<!-- -->. Hiring full-time engineers are based on the presumption that these individuals know how to perform in or at least navigate a real company environment already <!-- -->[5]<!-- -->. And for that reason, they should be treated differently. <strong>Meritocracy need not be the highest measure for hiring an intern</strong>. When present, well-intentioned and meaningful interest should be given precedence over experience. </p><p>I say this acknowledging that there should still be some minimum standard of technicality that the candidate has. They should be interested in programming after all! Deciding that minimum standard is a little up in the air though. What if the standards are <em>too</em> low? How do we differentiate between applicants at scale? First, well that’s already a problem with recruiting. Scaling to large numbers is incredibly difficult, and being able to do so currently, like your Google’s and Amazon’s often entail an already very frustrating and hated interviewing process. Second, your technical standards work in tandem with the entire application itself––I almost want to <strong>guarantee</strong> you that the amount of individuals who are willing to put in that effort to write a thoughtful, and cohesive letter are few to none in comparison to the bulk of applications <!-- -->[6]<!-- -->.</p><p>So I think those standards shouldn’t be set high.</p><p>Say you’re hiring for a frontend internship position. This position entails working on a server-side web framework––let’s use Ruby on Rails. As a hiring manager (lead talent guy or whatnot), you have to pick between two people: an individual who’s just submitted a resume that has 1 - 2 years of experience in Ruby on Rails, passes whatever technical examination you give him/her with high marks, and seems to be a smart and amiable individual on phone. And then there’s the applicant who’s had experience in Java for two years, a bit of JS/CSS/HTML for personal sites, and does a little below average on the technical portion <!-- -->[7]<!-- -->. But they also submit an extensive 1.5 page cover letter, detailing why they wanted to work at Company X, and also describes why they believe they’ll be a right fit <!-- -->[8]<!-- -->. This applicant, like the other, appears to be a good person, and displays similar levels of enthusiasm as in the letter on phone <!-- -->[9]<!-- -->.</p><p>If I were in that position of making the choice, I’d pick the latter. </p><p>I’d do so <em>knowing</em> that this applicant isn’t as technically qualified as the former. But, I’d also make this decision knowing this candidate displayed genuine interest, logically and persuasively argued his/her case in a manner that showed critical thinking and enthusiasm, and had the baselines for a programmer to adequately navigate the dynamics of software. The other candidate’s application was <em>just</em> a resume. And while they were technically qualified and adequately amalgable with the company, they just didn’t have the initiative or <em>spark</em> in their application. I think those sparks can make or break a company culture.</p><p>You want people that <strong>want to work at your company</strong>. The other candidate may have been a fine full-time too. But I think that spark goes a long way: you can rest assured knowing they have that demonstrated interest in learning the technology, product, and company. With that demonstrated interest, they’ll learn with minimal personal friction, they’ll enjoy being at your company, and the fact that you gave them a chance while they were under-qualified sure does give them even more appreciation and willingness to go above and beyond. We should keep in mind: this is an <strong>internship position</strong>. They are there to learn and to be tested. Interest should be paramount to these types of positions. In our situation, one candidate displayed that initiative more so than the other. </p><p>Take a chance on these types of applicants I say. They’ll exceed your expectations.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>
I’ve been in this situation before. To be left with a simple 3 sentence email rejection after writing extensive cover letters, with no acknowledgement whatsoever of what I wrote hurts quite a bit. Of course, I never knew if they hired someone else after me because they seemed to be more skilled, but I think it can be easily assumed they did (provided they still had space! Which, if you have a job opening on Lever, then that should be the case).</p><p>Perhaps, this comes off as a salty rant, or maybe it has some substance. Who knows. I’d love to hear any critique or thoughts on this area either way.</p><p>--</p><p>[1]<!-- --> We don’t acknowledge any role if any that diversity may play within this process. I think that discussion should be reserved for a later time. </p><p>[2]<!-- --> Other differences include the time-span (months compared to however long a FTE stays on with the company) and mentorship (the type and the extent of it).</p><p>[3]<!-- --> Given a specific time span after hiring. Of course, incoming engineers learn some way or another. But not necessarily with the same focus as say an intern.</p><p>[4]<!-- --> Real world environment as in there is revenue tied in, one way or another, to the product/feature at hand and so the company places real value in it. There are internships that don’t do this, and instead use dummy projects interns work on. I’m not going to address those types (much less encourage that strategy either!).</p><p>[5]<!-- --> I use full-time hires as a word for engineers who aren’t interns but rather your “typical” engineer at a company. Obviously though, many internships are full-time too. But you know what I mean.</p><p>[6]<!-- --> Differentiating between varying levels of interest (between a letter, conversation, etc.) is definitely a good thing to wonder about. If you’re at the point where you have to do that though, I’d have to give you props! Sadly, I don’t have a very thought-out answer for it right now. But, I bet there are very <strong>few</strong> individuals who’ll have to deal with that. Barely any applicants are that <em>interested</em> in the companies they apply to, sadly. The game itself is spray and pray (sample size: 1 college student).</p><p>[7]<!-- --> For simplicity’s sake, a technical portion that measures general programming paradigms and concepts.</p><p>[8]<!-- --> Of course, a not-so-well written cover letter really isn’t going to go well. But, if you have an individual who’s willing to take that extra step and write an extensive letter like such, you’re probably not going to encounter a poorly written one. </p><p>[9]<!-- --> At this point, you’ve gauged the company fit for these individuals on the phone. But, we should also acknowledge there are many individuals you’ll miss if you’re analyzing the individuals you did talk to on the phone. </p></article></div></div>]]>

                    <p>We will never have enough software developers.</p><p>Developers are dropping out of the profession in large numbers despite efforts to grow the number of computer science graduates and software engineers.</p><p>Here's why.</p><h2 id="developer-dropout-is-real">Developer dropout is real</h2><p>Software development has a <em>serious</em> retention problem:</p><ul><li>At age 26, 59% of engineering and computer science grads work in occupations <em>related</em> to their field of study. By age 50, only 41% work in the same domain, meaning a full <strong>~30% drop out of the field by mid-career</strong></li><li>In contrast, engineering and computer science majors who join <em>unrelated</em> fields upon graduation retain at much higher rates, with only 10-15% switching out after the age of 26:</li></ul><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/W-kECKz1nw.png"></figure><p>Engineers often leave engineering for non-STEM management roles. Graduation into management is not surprising. What's surprising is that these are <strong>non-STEM</strong> positions. Engineers swap technical roles for <em>non-technical</em> roles over time.</p><p>This phenomenon, which I'll call "<strong>developer dropout</strong>," is a real problem. What's behind it?</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><section>

</section><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="out-with-the-old-skills-in-with-the-new-skills">Out with the old skills, in with the new skills</h2><p>Programming-related jobs have high rates of skill turnover. Over time, the types of skills required by companies hiring software developers change more rapidly than any other profession.</p><p>To demonstrate this, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/135/4/1965/5858010">researchers</a> analyzed job postings on more than 40,000 online job boards and company websites between 2007 and 2019, controlling for employer, location, and occupation. They defined "new" skills as those that were rare or non-existent in 2007 but prevalent in 2019 and "old" skills as those that were prevalent in 2007 but rare or extinct in 2019.</p><ul><li>While only 30% of all job vacancies required at least one new skill by 2019, <strong>47% of computer and mathematical jobs required at least one new skill</strong> (i.e. a skill that was not common back in 2007)</li><li>This compares to <em>less than 20%</em> of jobs in fields like education, law, and community and social services</li><li>In addition, <strong>16% of jobs in computer and mathematical fields in 2007 required a skill that was obsolete by 2019</strong> (i.e. a skill that was common in 2007 but relatively rare in 2019), more than double any other job category:</li></ul><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/azDsA9n3rx.png"></figure><p>About a third of the change in required skills in computer-related occupations is due to specific new software:</p><ul><li>The fastest-growing software skills between 2007 and 2019 include <strong>Python, R, and Apache Hadoop</strong></li><li>Software that was popular in 2007 but effectively obsolete by 2019 includes QuarkXpress, ActionScript, Solaris, IBM Websphere, and Adobe Flash (ah, finally a name I recognize)</li></ul><p>Data science, machine learning, and AI saw big increases among technology-intensive jobs as well. For example, the number of STEM-related jobs requiring skills in machine learning and AI grew more than 4x from 2007-2017, touching more than 15% of STEM jobs:</p><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/Pc3AjVflhW.png"></figure><p>To better compare rates of skill change across occupations, the researchers came up with a measure of skill change that tracks the absolute growth or decline of various skills within each profession from 2007 to 2019. Occupations whose required skills change rapidly in prevalence among job postings receive a high score, while jobs whose skills do not change much receive a lower score:</p><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/xfeKvOWxo-.png"></figure><ul><li><strong>Computer-related occupations receive the highest score by far, 4.8</strong>. Note that the mean and standard deviation of this measure are ~3 and ~1 respectively, so computer-related jobs are <strong>nearly two standard deviations away from the typical job in America</strong></li><li>Meanwhile, jobs in education and and those involving manual labor have very low skill change scores, typically less than 2.</li></ul><p>We can get even more granular and look at specific job roles. This level of detail makes the difference even more stark (only showing the fastest changing roles):</p><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/OwoB5xsSdO.png"></figure><p>Web development has the highest rate of skill change <em>among all jobs in the country</em>. Next up are sales engineers, another often technical role. Database administrators, computer network architects, sysadmins, and application developers all make the top 10, and we see many other technical roles among the top 30. The mean and standard deviation are similar here, placing web development <strong>more than 3 standard deviations away from the typical job in America</strong> in terms of skill change over time.</p><p>Suffice to say, <strong>software development is a rapidly changing profession</strong>.</p><p>You might think, however, that skill change would eventually settle down as one becomes more experienced.</p><p><em>You'd be wrong.</em> The skills for software engineering jobs change rapidly throughout the entire career lifecycle:</p><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/7ItjXMaTE-.png"></figure><ul><li>In entry-level roles in computer and engineering occupations all the way through those requiring 12+ years of experience, <strong>the proportion of job postings requiring at least one new skill in 2019 was effectively the same, 40-45%</strong></li><li>In contrast, <strong>29% of entry-level non-computing and engineering roles in 2019 required at least one new skill, but this proportion declines to 24%</strong> for jobs requiring more than four years of experience</li></ul><blockquote>This means that experienced STEM workers seeking employment in 2019 are often required to possess skills that <strong>were not required</strong> when they entered the labor market in 2007 or earlier.</blockquote><p>Software engineers <strong>never</strong> escape the skill-change vortex, even many years into their careers. Experienced engineers must learn and adopt technologies that didn't even exist when they started out. Developers must constantly retool themselves, even well after their <a href="https://whoisnnamdi.com/college-degrees-software-engineers/">formal education</a> ends.</p><h2 id="nothing-s-changed-but-my-change"><a href="https://youtu.be/m1ERvlxgCD8?t=166">Nothing's changed but my change</a></h2><p><strong>College majors associated with faster changing jobs pay more early on.</strong></p><ul><li>In professions with one standard deviation increased skill change, pay is <strong>~30%</strong> higher in the first few years of one's career</li><li>If we exclude both the fastest and slowest-changing fields (Engineering/Computer Science at the high end, Health/Education at the low end), the early earnings premium for faster-changing roles increases to <strong>~60%</strong>:</li></ul><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/heMo13OsG1.png"></figure><p><strong>Fast-changing fields pay better.</strong></p><p>Notice however that the pay advantage declines over time. By the time one approaches the age of 50, the pay premium for working in rapidly changing fields falls dramatically to only 20-30% vs slower changing professions.</p><p>Here's another way to see the eroding pay advantage. The below chart simulates the earnings of the average worker by category of college degree from ages 23 to 50 in 2016 dollars.</p><ul><li>Computer science and engineering grads start off with sizable advantage vs any other major</li><li>However, this premium <em>falls</em> over time as the earnings of CS and engineering graduates plateau over time while the earnings of their peers grow <em>faster</em> for <em>longer</em></li><li>In fact, <strong>life and physical science graduates' earnings surpass their computer and engineering classmates by the age of 40</strong>:</li></ul><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/Lifecyle-Earnings-by-Degree-Category.png"></figure><p>Excluding business majors, the earnings premium of software engineering declines over time in both percentage <em>and</em> absolute dollar terms, to the point where engineers barely out-earn social science majors:</p><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/Engineering-_-Computer-Science-Earnings-Premium.png"></figure><p>But the focus on college major is somewhat misleading. This phenomenon has less to do with one's field of study and more to do with <em>choice of occupation</em>.</p><p>To show this, researchers plotted the earnings premium of various categories workers relative to those with a non-Engineering/Computer Science major working in a non-Engineering/Computer Science job.</p><ul><li>Workers who major in Engineering or Computer Science but work in unrelated fields actually see their earnings advantage <em>compound</em> over time, rather than decline</li><li>On the other hand, regardless of major, individuals who work in Engineering or Computer Science jobs see their earnings advantage erode over the years:</li></ul><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/OFffH9kBKA.png"></figure><blockquote><strong>Declining relative returns is a feature of STEM jobs, not majors.</strong> The earnings premium for non-STEM majors in STEM occupations starts off near 40%, but declines to 20% within a decade. In contrast, the relative earnings advantage grows over time for computer science and engineering majors working in non-STEM occupations.</blockquote><p>The <strong>profession</strong> of software development drives the declining earnings premium, <strong>not the college major</strong>.</p><p>In fact, computer science majors who work in non-CS fields experience the <em>opposite</em> dynamic of their non-developer peers — their relative earnings premium rises as they advance. A CS major who eschews the profession doesn't earn much more than otherwise similar non-CS majors early on, but eventually out-earns their peers by nearly 20%.</p><p>OK, that's enough about <em>what</em> is happening. Now let's see <em>why</em> it's happening.</p><h2 id="human-capital-depreciates-too"><em>Human</em> capital depreciates too</h2><p>Imagine a simple model where workers choose their profession in order to maximize income, which is a derivative of their own skill or human capital. Over time, workers gain new skills, while the value of their existing skills depreciates somewhat due to changing times.</p><p>Some workers, endowed with superior ability, learn faster than others, picking up skills at a quicker pace. Those workers will tend to sort into high-skilled, fast-changing professions initially, maximizing their early career earnings. Less impressive workers will sort into low-skilled, slower-changing professions.</p><p>In a world where human capital never depreciated, we could imagine that high-skilled individuals like software developers would maintain a relative human capital (and earnings) advantage over other professionals, leading to consistently increasing pay and a stable relative premium:</p><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/Human-Capital--w_o-Depreciation-.png"></figure><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/Software-Engineering-Human-Capital-Premium--w_o-Depreciation-.png"></figure><p>But, if human capital depreciates over time and that rate of depreciation is higher in rapidly-changing fields like software development, then developers' initial advantage would erode over time, narrowing the gap vs. non-developers:</p><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/Human-Capital--w_-Depreciation-.png"></figure><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/Software-Engineering-Human-Capital-Premium--w_-Depreciation-.png"></figure><p>This simple model helps explain what we see in the data — the software engineering earnings advantage disappears as the <em>effective</em> human capital gap narrows.</p><blockquote>Applied majors such as computer science, engineering, and business teach vintage-specific skills that become less valuable as new skills are introduced to the workplace …</blockquote></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>When we started work on the recently released feature <a href="https://www.sanity.io/blog/review-changes">Review Changes</a>, we needed a way to keep a significant part of the edit history of a document in the browser memory to be able to respond quickly to different user interface states. As the user picked various document versions to compare we wanted to be able to quickly reconstruct a specific section of the history of a document. </p><figure><div role="button"><div data-has-aspect="false"></div></div><figcaption>Review Changes for Sanity Studio. Powered by Mendoza.</figcaption></figure><p>For text diffs, we use the <a href="https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch">diff-match-patch format</a>, and we just assumed someone would have implemented a similarly efficient and compact diff format for JSON documents, but no such luck. If we wanted a general JSON diff format that was super compact and fast to apply, we would have to invent it ourselves. And thus, Mendoza, the totally non-human readable diff format for structured JSON documents, was born.</p><p>Mendoza is:</p><ul><li>Lightweight JSON format</li><li>A flexible format that can accommodate more advanced encodings in the future</li><li>As a Go library for encoding and decoding</li><li>A JavaScript library for decoding</li><li>Efficient handling of the renaming of fields</li><li>Efficient handling of reordering of arrays</li><li>Not designed to be human-readable</li></ul><p>Mendoza differs (hah!) from normal diffs as they are:</p><ul><li>Made for humans to read and understand and based on simple operations (like keep, insert, and delete text)</li><li>Possible to apply even if the source has changed a bit by including some of the contexts around every part that has changed</li><li>Designed for text, and not structured documents</li></ul><p>Now, this is great when you are collaborating with humans on code development and use something like git to track your changes. What it isnâ€™t great for, however, is expressing differences between structured documents (such as JSON) in a compact manner that can be efficiently transferred over the network and parsed in JavaScript inside of browsers.</p><div data-block-key="27e85758c59a"><h2><a id="most-diffs-arent-meant-for-machines-27e85758c59a"></a><a href="#most-diffs-arent-meant-for-machines-27e85758c59a"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path fill="currentColor" d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76 0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71 0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71 0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76 0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a>Most diffs aren't meant for machines</h2></div><p>Most diff formats are made to be human-readable. Take these two documents, where a key and the array have some changes between them:</p><p>If these where two commits, the Git diff between them would be expressed like this:</p><p>This makes it somewhat practical for humans to understand what is going on when the latter change is applied. But as you can see, in terms of pure data, there is a lot of repetition going on. and expressing all changes with only plusses and minuses isn't very efficient.</p><p>The same diff with Mendoza is expressed like this:</p><p>Mendoza constructs a minimal recipe for transforming a document into another. All it really does is to compare two JSON documents and figure out the most minimal way to express their difference as strings and integers in an array. You can use this difference to reconstruct the first document to the other.</p><div data-block-key="308db67aa205"><h2><a id="how-to-read-a-mendoza-patch-even-though-you-shouldnt-308db67aa205"></a><a href="#how-to-read-a-mendoza-patch-even-though-you-shouldnt-308db67aa205"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path fill="currentColor" d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76 0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71 0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71 0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76 0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a>How to read a Mendoza patch (even though you shouldn't)</h2></div><p>A Mendoza patch consists of an array of integers and strings. The integers are <em>opcodes</em> (short for â€œoperation codesâ€�), 8-bit numbers that correspond to an operation. Opcodes take parameters as strings, positive numbers, or JSON values (that is: the actual data that is changing). The list of available opcodes is as follows, notice that 10-18 are composites of the preceding ones:</p><ul><li>0 <code>Value<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>1 <code>Copy<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>2 <code>Blank<!-- -->â€‹</code></li><li>3 <code>ReturnIntoArray<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>4 <code>ReturnIntoObject<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>5 <code>ReturnIntoObjectSameKey<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>6 <code>PushField<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>7 <code>PushElement<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>8 <code>PushParent<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>9 <code>Pop<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>10 <code>PushFieldCopy</code></li><li>11 <code>PushFieldBlank</code></li><li>12 <code>PushElementCopy</code></li><li>13 <code>PushFieldBlank</code></li><li>14 <code>ReturnIntoObjectPop</code></li><li>15 <code>ReturnIntoObjectSameKeyPop</code></li><li>16 <code>ReturnIntoArrayPop</code></li><li>17 <code>ObjectSetFieldValue</code></li><li>18 <code>ObjectCopyField</code></li><li>19 <code>ObjectDeleteField</code>â€‹ </li><li>20 <code>ArrayAppendValue</code>â€‹ </li><li>21 <code>ArrayAppendSlice<!-- -->â€‹</code></li><li>22 <code>StringAppendString<!-- -->â€‹</code></li></ul><p>Mendoza reads these opcodes from the patch and produces the resulting document from them. Depending on the patch, Mendoza might choose not to strictly follow the opcodes but take a simpler path. If every field and value has changed, for example, itâ€™s more efficient just to replace the whole document with the new data without going through all the operations. Or if you have a list of objects where one has moved to another position and changed a key-value, Mendoza will manage to go back to the original and represent the change in a cheap way.</p><p>Mendoza is implemented in Go and can be found in this <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/mendoza">GitHub repository</a>. We have also made <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/mendoza-js">a parser for Mendoza patches in JavaScript</a>, that you can use in your own application. </p><p>Of course, you can dive into <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/sanity/blob/a3f7158016d63728a9b435e6ab444ff2b90fd424/packages/%40sanity/desk-tool/src/panes/documentPane/documentHistory/history/timeline.ts#L421">the source code for the Sanity Studio</a> and explore how Mendoza is used there. If you want a slightly simpler use-case, you can also <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/groq-store/blob/main/src/patch.ts">check out how weâ€™re using Mendoza to simulate a part of Sanityâ€™s real-time datastore</a> in the browser to power the <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/next-sanity">real-time preview for Next.js</a>. </p><p>Naming a project is always difficult. Since this project is focused on representing changes between <em>JSON</em> documents I naturally started thinking about names like "JSON differ, JSON changes, JSON patch, â€¦". However, most of these names have already been used by existing projects. While I was muttering "JSON, JSON, JSON" it suddenly turned into "JSON, JSON, Jason, Jason Mendoza".</p><p>Jason Mendoza is a character from the show The Good Place, and while this project has little in common with the stupidest DJ from Florida, at least it's short and catchy.</p><p>Since a Mendoza patch is just describing the effect of a change it is also limited to work for the documents it was based on. It doesnâ€™t come with guarantees for consistency if the document you apply it on has changed from the original in meanwhile. This is one of the tradeoffs that we needed to do to make it really compressed. </p></div></div></div>]]>

          <p><img src="http://www.flyingmachinestudios.com/assets/images/posts/rich-hickey-function.png" alt="The Rich Hickey Function"></p>
          
          <p>Part of my excitement in learning Clojure has been being exposed to
          Rich Hickey's thoughts on programming. Rich Hickey has a clear,
          consistent way of viewing fundamental programming concepts that I
          think any programmer would benefit from. Every time I watch one of his
          talks, I feel like someone has gone in and organized my brain.</p>
          
          <p>In this article (and more to come (possibly)), I begin my attempt to
          catalog Mr. Hickey's unique viewpoint. Eventually, I would like to
          produce a concise summary of his ideas. My hope is that this will
          provide an easily-scannable reference to Clojurists and an accessible
          introduction to non-Clojurists.</p>
          
          <p>What follows is derived from Rich Hickey's talk,
          "<a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Are-We-There-Yet-Rich-Hickey">Are we there yet?</a>"</p>
          
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          
          <p>Today's OOP languages - Ruby, Java, Python, etc. - are fundamentally
          flawed. They introduce
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet">accidental complexity</a>
          by building on an inaccurate model of reality. Where they have
          explicit definitions for the following concepts, the definitions are
          wrong:</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>Value</li>
          <li>State</li>
          <li>Identity</li>
          <li>Time</li>
          <li>Behavior</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Below, we'll contrast the OOP viewpoint on each of these topics with
          the Functional Programming viewpoint. But first, we'll compare the
          models of reality which underlie OOP and FP. It's this underlying
          difference which gives rise to their different approach to the topics
          above.</p>
          
          <h2>Metaphysics, Programming, and You: Comparing OOP and FP</h2>
          
          <p>When talking about metaphysics things tend to get a little fuzzy, but
          hopefully this will all make sense.</p>
          
          <p>As the ever-trusty
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics">Wikipedia</a> explains,
          metaphysics attempts to answer two basic questions in the broadest
          possible terms:</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>What is there?</li>
          <li>What is it like?</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Rich Hickey explains the difference between OOP and FP metaphysics by
          contrasting their explanations of what a river is. </p>
          
          <h3>Object Oriented Programming</h3>
          
          <p>In OOP metaphysics, a river is something which actually exists in the
          world. I know, I know, I can hear what you're saying: "Uh... yeah?
          So?" But believe me, the accuracy of that statement has caused many a
          sleepless night for philosophers.</p>
          
          <p>The wrinkle is that the river is always changing. Its water never
          ceases to flow. In OOP terms, we would say that it has mutable state,
          and that its state is ever fluctuating.</p>
          
          <p>The fact that the state of the River Object and that Objects in
          general are never stable doesn't stop us from nevertheless treating
          them as the fundamental building blocks of programs. In fact, this is
          seen as an advantage of OOP - it doesn't matter how the state changes,
          you can still interact with a stable interface and all will work as it
          should. An object can change, but to all observers it is still
          considered the same object.</p>
          
          <p>This conforms to our intuitive sense of the world. The position of the
          electrons of the coffee in my mug matters naught; the coffee still
          interacts with my taste buds in the way I expect.</p>
          
          <p>Finally, in OOP, objects do things. They act on each other. Again, this
          conforms to our intuitive sense of the world: change is the
          result of objects acting upon each other. A Person object pushes on a
          Door object and enters a House object.</p>
          
          <h3>Functional Programming</h3>
          
          <p><img src="http://www.flyingmachinestudios.com/assets/images/posts/fp-metaphysics.png" alt="FP Metaphysics"></p>
          
          <p>In FP metaphysics, we would say that we never step in the same river
          twice. What we see as a discrete <em>thing</em> which actually exists in the
          world independent of its mutations is in reality a succession of
          discrete, unchanging things.</p>
          
          <p>The "river" is not a thing in and of itself; it's a concept
          that we superimpose on a succession of related phenomena. This concept
          is very useful - I won't belabor that point - but it is just a
          concept.</p>
          
          <p>What really exists are atoms (in the sense of atomic, unchanging,
          stable entities) and processes. The river is not a stable object;
          rather, it is a succession of related atoms which are generated by
          some kind of process.</p>
          
          <p>These atoms don't act upon each other and they can't be changed. They
          can't <em>do</em> anything. Change is not the result of one object acting on
          another; change is the result of a process being applied to an
          unchangeable atom. To say that something has changed is to say, "Oh,
          there's a new atom in this stream of atoms." It's like saying that
          HEAD points to a new commit in your Git repo.</p>
          
          <p>OK! Enough with metaphysics. Now let's describe the more immediately
          useful topics, starting with Value.</p>
          
          <h2>Value</h2>
          
          <p>It's obvious that numbers like 3 and 6 and 42 are values. Numbers are
          stable, unchanging.</p>
          
          <p>It should also be obvious that OO languages have "no proper notion" of
          values in this sense. As Rich Hickey points out, you can create a
          class whose instances are composed of immutable components, but there
          is no high-level concept of immutable value implemented as a first
          class construct within the class.</p>
          
          <p>This is one of the main causes of headaches when doing OOP. How many
          times have you pulled your hair out trying to figure out how an
          object's attribute got changed? The fact is, in OO languages there is
          no built-in mechanism to ensure that the object you're dealing with is
          stable.</p>
          
          <p>This is the big reason why concurrent programming is so difficult.
          Even in single-threaded programs this is a problem, and it's one of
          the reasons why we develop sprawling test suites. You can't be sure if
          a method call on your Toupee object is somehow going to cause a change
          in your HipsterGlasses object.</p>
          
          <p>By contrast, in FP languages emphasis is placed on working with
          immutable values. Since these values can't change, a whole class of
          problems simply disappears.</p>
          
          <h2>Identity</h2>
          
          <p>In the video, Mr. Hickey says:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
          <p>The biggest problem we have is we've conflated two things. We've
          said the <em>idea</em> that I attach to this thing that lasts over time
          <em>is</em> the thing that lasts over time.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>In FP, identity is essentially a name we give to a sequence of related
          atoms. "River" refers to the sequence R1, R2, R3, etc, produced by the
          river process. This is directly analogous to HEAD in Git - it's just a
          name which is used to refer to actual values. In OO, there really
          isn't such a distinction.</p>
          
          <p>Or as the man himself says, </p>
          
          <blockquote>
          <p>Identity is a putative entity we associate with a series of causally
          related values (states) over time. It's a label, a construct we use
          to collect a time series.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <h2>State</h2>
          
          <p>In OO, there is no real clear definition of state. Maybe it's, "the
          values of all the attributes within an object right now." And it has
          to be "right now", because there's no language-supported way of
          holding on to the past.</p>
          
          <p>This becomes clearer if you contrast it with the notion of identity in
          FP. In the Hickeysian universe, a State is a specific value for an
          identity at a point in time. (For me, this definition really clarified
          my own thoughts.)</p>
          
          <h2>Time</h2>
          
          <p>There's no real notion of time in OO. Everything's just "right now".
          This is part of what causes problems in concurrent programs.</p>
          
          <p>By contrast, in the FP worldview we've been exploring, time is
          well-defined. Time is a by-product of ordering states within an
          identity.</p>
          
          <p>(By the way, I'd really like to write more here, and would appreciate
          any suggestions.)</p>
          
          <h2>Behavior</h2>
          
          <p>Finally, behavior. I don't have too much to write here - I might need
          to watch some more talks - but I'll include Mr. Hickey's
          thought-provoking observation:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
          <p>There is no behavior. When you get hit by lightning, who's behaving?</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>This may be what inspired Steve Yegge's post,

          <h2>The End</h2>
          
          <p>Well, that's it for now. I hope you've found this post useful. If you
          have any suggestions, I'd love to hear them!</p>

          Frequently Asked Questions
        </h2>
        
        
        <p>
          When does the course start and finish?
        </p>
        <p>
          The course starts now and never ends! It is a completely self-paced online course - you decide when you start and when you finish.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          How long do I have access to the course?
        </p>
        <p>
          How does lifetime access sound? After enrolling, you have unlimited access to this course for as long as you like - across any and all devices you own.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          What if I am unhappy with the course?
        </p>
        <p>
          We would never want you to be unhappy! If you are unsatisfied with your purchase, contact us in the first 30 days and we will give you a full refund.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I never used Blender before, am I able to follow this courses?
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes! This course is especially designed to help you get started, even if you don't know anything about Blender or 3D in general.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Do I need a powerful system to run Blender 2.8?
        </p>
        <p>
          In general, Blender should also run on older systems. But when it comes to rendering, Blender 2.8 makes heavy use of your graphics card, especially when you're working with the EEVEE realtime renderer (what we will do a lot during this course). That's why we recommend to check if Blender 2.8 runs on your computer. <a href="https://code.blender.org/2019/04/supported-gpus-in-blender-2-80/">Here you can check if your graphics card is supported.</a> We also recommend <a href="https://builder.blender.org/download/">downloading the latest version of Blender 2.8</a> and check if it runs on your machine.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Are you covering UV Mapping and Texturing in this course?
        </p>
        <p>
          To keep the content beginner friendly, we won't cover UV mapping and texturing in the main course. These topics are planned to be added in the future, as a bonus chapter. Stay tuned.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Is this course suitable for advanced Blender users?
        </p>
        <p>
          It depends. When you feel really comfortable with Blender already, this course is probably not for you. However, if you want to make the switch from Blender 2.7x to Blender 2.8 this course can help you. Also, if you feel that after learning Blender for a while, you are still not able to bring the 3d projects to life which are in your head, this course can help you fill in the missing gaps.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Can I get single chapters independently without buying the whole course?
        </p>
        <p>
          Sorry, this is not possible.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Does this course work with Blender 2.9?
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes! The changes from Blender 2.8 to 2.9 won't much affect the course content. The UI of both versions are nearly identical, so you can easily follow. We also try to update outdated lessons. Also, if you get stuck, we are there to help you, just ask your questions in the comment section below the lessons.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      
      
      <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f7870162b071951f3775d1abad3359269892043b/cbca1/assets/blog/img/fitness_main.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Deadlifting 337.5 lbs in my <a href="https://billmei.net/blog/gym-build">home gym</a>.</p>

<p>I wasted years failing at improving my health and fitness by following misguided “common sense” advice. I tried everything: P90X, cross-country running, bodybuilding, HIIT, swimming, BodBot, 2 types of yoga, CrossFit, rowing, personal training, F45, and cycling. None of them worked.</p>

<p>It seemed like everyone around me was getting results, but no matter how hard I tried, I wasn’t able to carry more things, attain a muscular physique, better outrun an emergency, or climb over a fence.</p>

<p>But after hundreds of hours of frustration and disappointment, I finally figured out what was preventing me from achieving the fitness results that I wanted.</p>

<p>I made 10 major mistakes by following “common sense” advice that hindered my progress for years. They are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="#mistake-1-not-reasoning-from-first-principles">Not reasoning from first principles</a></li>
  <li><a href="#mistake-2-taking-action-instead-of-planning">Taking action instead of planning</a></li>

  <li><a href="#mistake-10-not-prioritizing-recovery">Not prioritizing recovery</a></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="mistake-1-not-reasoning-from-first-principles">Mistake #1: Not reasoning from first principles</h2>

<h3 id="who">Who</h3>

<p>I learned that everyone’s body is different. A nutrition and exercise program that works for me may not work for you, or vice-versa. Our genetics, physiology, and lifestyles are not the same so do not read this article as “advice” for you. It is advice only for me.</p>

<p>For example, I use more extreme language than other articles on health and fitness, because I find it necessary to go “all or nothing” in forming habits, but this writing style may be counterproductive if it does not fit your predilection; e.g. I’ll say something like “If you miss a workout, you have to <em>start over from the beginning</em>”, and this is not technically true because you can make up for the workout later, but I need to be told that the stakes are much higher than they actually are to motivate myself to stay on track. I regret that nobody was ever this forceful with me. By being too forgiving they gave me an excuse to not take things as seriously as I should have. You may find this writing style off-putting, but I will remind you that this is written for me, not for you.</p>

<p>One way I wasted a lot of time in the beginning is assuming that other peoples’ advice can apply to me, but it can’t. What worked was to figure out what first principles apply to my situation, and then build up a strategy from there to solve my individual needs, and not copy or follow someone else’s advice from the Internet.</p>

<h3 id="why">Why</h3>

<p>Why are health and fitness important? Physical health is required to operate in the physical universe. It’s the wellspring from which all other actions depend. Therefore, to improve your cognition, mood, relationships, career, morals—work out.</p>

<h3 id="how">How</h3>

<p>Ground truth comes from physics. The irreducible first step is Force = Mass × Acceleration. This is an inviolable law of the universe. Force production is therefore the only objective performance metric. All other secondary goals (weight loss, flexibility, cardiovascular health, etc.) are therefore relevant only when they are on the critical path to improving force production.<sup id="fnref:critical-path" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:critical-path">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Maintaining health is expensive, and biological organisms do not spend more resources than marginally required by their environments, because any wasteful organism will be evolutionarily outcompeted by a more resource-conserving rival. Therefore, any increase in wellness must be proportional to a preceding increase in stress. This leads us to the second step, the <a href="#mistake-4-doing-exercise-instead-of-training">Stress Recovery Adaptation cycle</a> (SRA), which I will describe later. Any strategy that does not follow this is disallowed by biology.</p>

<h3 id="mistake-2-taking-action-instead-of-planning">Mistake #2: Taking action instead of planning</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s important not to overthink things—just take action! You’ll figure it out as you go.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>No plan survives contact with the enemy.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just Do It.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are all wrong. It turns out that planning is <em>really, really</em> important. I did not expect this, but having an appropriate plan <em>makes or breaks</em> your success.</p>

<p>Based on what I learned from entrepreneurship and the “Lean Startup Approach”, I assumed that a mediocre plan with great execution is better than a great plan with poor execution. This is not true for health and fitness.</p>

<p>A mediocre plan with great execution is not better than a great plan with poor execution. A mediocre plan with great execution achieves <em>nothing</em>.</p>

<p>Good planning is the difference between achieving all your goals, and achieving <em>nothing at all</em>. Action is irrelevant to outcome.</p>

<p>The problem with bad plans is that taking the <em>wrong</em> action gives you negative progress. “Just Do It” is harmful advice, because it gives you the illusion of progress while actually accomplishing nothing, or taking you in reverse.<sup id="fnref:reverse" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:reverse">2</a></sup></p>

<p>It took years for me to learn this because the vast majority of exercise programs are not good. It was only by luck that after years of trying many different programs I finally found one that worked. The probability that the average personal trainer you pick after walking into a random commercial gym can design the right program is effectively nil.</p>

<p>To understand why planning is more important than action, I have to explain four other mistakes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mistake #3: Not planning all the way until the end</li>
  <li>Mistake #4: Doing exercise instead of training</li>
  <li>Mistake #5: Listening to experts</li>
  <li>Mistake #6: Following a plan not designed for me</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mistake-3-not-planning-all-the-way-until-the-end">Mistake #3: Not planning all the way until the end</h3>

<p>Strenuous exercise is not required for success in modern civilization. Thus, the vast majority of people lack any adaptation to physical stress, with the result that even a tiny amount of exercise will produce results. This gives the misleading impression that exercise is “easy” because almost anything you do in the beginning will work; but “doing anything” eventually causes you to stall out very quickly when the early progress ends, you get frustrated, and then you quit.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://billmei.net/books/practical-programming-for-strength-training/">Practical Programming for Strength Training</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Virtually anything that makes a novice work harder than bed rest will produce positive results. As a result, many people have an erroneous impression of the quality of their training system. Single sets, multiple sets, high volume, high intensity, super slow, supersets, giant sets, gnarlmonster sets – quite literally anything resembling a training program will produce better results than no program at all in novice trainees. <strong>This is known as “the novice effect,” and must be considered when training this population.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is what happened to me: I tried cross-country running which worked for a bit until it didn’t, then I got discouraged and quit. Then I tried P90X which also worked for a bit until it didn’t, then I got frustrated and quit. And so on ad infinitum.</p>

<p>After I understood the novice effect, I could see that the key to a successful fitness program is not about how effective it is for beginners, but about how effective it is for people at all skill levels from beginner to olympian.</p>

<h3 id="mistake-4-doing-exercise-instead-of-training">Mistake #4: Doing exercise instead of training</h3>

<p><em>Exercise</em> is about physical activity. Almost any strenuous physical action you take can be classified as <em>exercise</em>, no matter if it is helpful or harmful in the long term.<sup id="fnref:exercise-vs-training" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:exercise-vs-training">3</a></sup></p>

<p><em>Training</em> is about long-term goal-directed progress. It requires that you set an objective, measurable goal you can achieve (e.g. deadlift 200lbs, run 1 mile in under 20 minutes, finish 1st in my city’s tennis tournament). If an external observer cannot unambiguously say whether you succeeded or failed at your goal<sup id="fnref:failure" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:failure">4</a></sup>, then you also cannot tell whether your day-to-day actions are beneficial or harmful to your long-term goal, hence this is not <em>training</em>.<sup id="fnref:fire-your-trainer" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fire-your-trainer">5</a></sup></p>

<p>The reason for this distinction is the biological first-principle that determines whether you will succeed or fail in the long-term: the <strong>Stress Recovery Adaptation cycle</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/815fe3b43867cf07a9398a20126ed188b57f3071/be6bc/assets/blog/img/fitness_sra-primary.png" alt="One iteration of the Stress Recovery Adaptation (SRA) cycle. Performing exercise creates stress on the body, which diminishes your biological capabilities for a short time. As you eat and sleep, your body repairs itself during recovery, plus some additional extra capacity (adaptation) to handle future stress."></p>

<p>x and y axes exaggerated for emphasis in all of these graphs.</p>

<p>Performing <em>exercise</em> creates <em>stress</em> on the body, which diminishes your biological capabilities for a short time. As you eat and sleep, your body repairs itself during <em>recovery</em>, plus some additional extra capacity (<em>adaptation</em>) to handle future stress.</p>

<p>The stress is an external signal to your body that your environment must be more dangerous than it previously assumed, so your body tries to adapt to enable you to have a better chance of staying alive going forward.</p>

<p>Doing a workout that isn’t any harder than what you did before does not lead to additional adaptation, because you didn’t signal to your body that your environment is more dangerous than it previously assumed:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e279ba0e443b829d621c6490a4f5d66e69e78fa1/85ff1/assets/blog/img/fitness_sra-not-enough.png" alt="Undertraining in the Stress Recovery Adaptation (SRA) cycle. Insufficient stress creates a small drop in performance, but when you recover there is no additional adaptation above baseline. Hence, there is no performance improvement."></p>

<p>Biological organisms do not spend more resources than marginally required by their environments, because any wasteful organism will be evolutionarily outcompeted by a more resource-conserving rival. Thus, a lack of stress is a signal to your body that your environment must be safer than it previously assumed, so your body tries to conserve resources by decreasing its athletic capability:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/336a6ad7d7c8eefa02ca3dab85b92e046704afb9/ee30a/assets/blog/img/fitness_sra-atrophy.png" alt="Atrophy in the Stress Recovery Adaptation (SRA) cycle. When you skip a workout, no stress is applied, and performance slowly diminishes below baseline because your muscles atrophy. The result is a decrease in performance."></p>

<p>Conversely, too much stress that exceeds your body’s ability to recover will just result in your cells breaking down without being properly repaired:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/1fd88d0c95cbd5f093e41cdd5ac7628b54b9a72a/151b4/assets/blog/img/fitness_sra-too-much.png" alt="Overtraining in the Stress Recovery Adaptation (SRA) cycle. Too much stress creates a sharp performance drop-off that can't be recovered from properly. This leads to performance to revert to a level smaller than your original baseline, and hence is a performance decline."></p>

<p>Thus, the key to effective <em>training</em> is to carefully tune the amount of stress per <em>exercise</em> into the “Goldilocks zone” where you receive just enough stress to trigger an adaptation response, but not too much stress that you can’t recover, and not too little stress where you don’t trigger any adaptation response.</p>

<p>If you repeat this over a long time horizon, you get this classic (but incorrect!) graph that everyone draws, which you’ll see if you google this topic:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9829068739fe825d7a72080130c41917eea6dda7/3478a/assets/blog/img/fitness_sra-wrong.png" alt="The classic diagram of the Strength Recovery Adaptation (SRA) cycle. Just as you recover to a higher baseline, you perform another workout to apply additional stress, and in order to move your fitness baseline even higher"></p>

<p>There is a key mistake made by everyone else who draws this graph. The big problem with the above diagram is that once you’ve adapted to a higher baseline, a larger amount of stress is required to trigger further adaptation!</p>

<p>Trying to exert the same stress on a higher baseline does not trigger adaptation, because your body has gotten used to it and the stress …</p></article></div>

<p>Our friends over at ICmasters have delved into the package of the Apple A14 Bionic. The die size has been unmasked, and it stands in at 88mm<sup>2</sup>. Despite cramming in 11.8 billion transistors, the die size is incredibly small thanks to utilization of TSMC’s 5nm process node.</p>

<p>The march of progress is not all rosy. Apple’s chips have historically achieved 90%+ of the process node’s theoretical density in their processors. This generation stands out by missing that mark by a large amount. A14 comes in at a cool 78% effective transistor density when compared to theoretical density. Despite TSMC claiming a 1.8x shrink for N5, Apple only achieves a 1.49x shrink.</p>

<p>This is not due to a failure of TSMC or Apple. These companies are clear leaders for the manufacturing and design of semiconductors respectively. Instead, this failure to convert theoretical to effective density stems from the slow death of SRAM scaling. SRAM is extensively used throughout a processor from registers to caches. Geoffrey Yeap of TSMC claims that the typical mobile SoC which consists of 60% logic, 30% SRAM, and 10% analog/IO.</p>

<p>TSMC’s N5 node diverges from prior shrinks by showing signs of slowing SRAM scaling. Despite being a full shrink with logic, the SRAM is a 1.35x shrink. This figure is overstated as it will end up being even lower once other the other assist circuitry is accounted for. Hence TSMC’s guidance of chip area reduction at 35%-40% with N5. SemiAnalysis expects this to be a trend that will persist with new nodes. TSMC and Samsung are already demonstrating 3D stacked SRAM which will help alleviate the issue of density.</p>

<p>3D Stacking is not the silver bullet. Cost scaling has begun slowing dramatically. With TSMC N5 wafer pricing in the ~$17k range, it is clear cost per transistor has not fallen. Even if SRAM scaling kept up, the cost per transistor would still have remained flat from N7 to N5.</p>

        <blockquote><p>Serious defects happen, despite the best efforts of QA departments. Here’s what you can learn from real world screw-ups, so you can avoid making the same mistakes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Accidents in software development and testing have brought headlines ranging from hilarious to horrific. Back in 2013, for example, millions of PayPal users were tickled to learn that the long-standing online payment system had erroneously awarded more than $92 quadrillion – yes, <em>quadrillion</em> – to another user. Yet software mishaps have also been blamed for devastating incursions into credit rating services, massive billing mistakes by health insurers, and tragically, even fatal airplane crashes.</p>
<p>The rise of <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/the-mobile-testing-gotchas-you-need-to-know-about/">mobile devices and software apps</a> has also helped to bring software issues more out into public view. On sites like Apple’s App Store and Google Play, consumers rate mobile apps and sometimes leave bug reports, thereby themselves participating in software testing, albeit after the app has already seen the proverbial light of day.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/3-lessons-from-big-software-failures/">Software testing accidents happen</a> all the time, and most go unheralded except by company managers, software developers and testers, and any end users directly impacted.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, companies are tightlipped about the causes of software flaws, even when the error gains public attention. If you’ve kept up with the progress of any mobile apps in online stores, you’ll see that a bug related to this-or-that was fixed in a subsequent release, although nobody would tell you why the bug got there or why it wasn’t eradicated earlier through the company’s quality assurance testing<em>.</em></p>
<p>If you’re a software developer or tester, you already know that bugs can slip through the cracks at any of the manifold stages of software testing. There can’t be a tech person on Earth, however, who’s experienced every single sort of software disaster.</p>
<p>Here are five tips gleaned from lessons learned by seasoned testers and developers, along with the nitty-gritty details on real-life examples of software projects gone awry. Let’s take the positive approach here, with the useful takeaways, rather than indulge wholly in schadenfreude.</p>
<h3>Tip #1: Enforce a culture of testing at every level</h3>
<p>“Software testing is not foolproof by any means. Apple, Microsoft, Zoom, and almost any company with an app in an app store keeps releasing updates with fixes to holes and flaws in both functionality and security,” maintains David Galownia, CEO of the <a href="https://www.slingshotsoftware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slingshot</a> software and app development firm.</p>
<p>“Even when companies have rigorous testing processes, problems can slip through anyway,” Galownia adds. “You’re talking hundreds of thousands of lines of code and untold numbers of different ways users can use the software. It’s impossible to test them all.”</p>
<p>If a software error is relatively innocuous and rarely evident, <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/improve-your-debugging-strategies/">chasing it down through testing</a> can be a highly frustrating experience, anyhow. Galownia recalls a time early in his company’s history when testers kept trying, again and again, to discover the cause of a bug in a client’s software.</p>
<p>“For a long time, we couldn’t duplicate the bug no matter what we did. We tested every scenario we could think of, tested with multiple browsers, and put multiple eyes on it,” Galownia remembers. “When we eventually did stumble on to the cause of the error, we found it happened during a unique series in which the user went forward exactly seven steps in a process, then went back exactly four steps using the backspace button, and then went forward clicking something else. Once we finally found that out, it was an easy fix.”</p>
<p>Due to all the potential complexities involved, the CEO recommends “enforcing a culture of testing at every level.”&nbsp; Testing should start with “developers testing their own code and only saying they’re done when they themselves believe they have no bugs,” &nbsp;Galownia elaborates.</p>
<p>“Ideally, at that point a QA analyst is testing, but project and product managers should also test. Designers even should test and finally the client or end users should test in an alpha or beta setting,” Galownia says. The key is to have multiple different types of people who come at your software at different angles.</p>
<h3>Tip #2: Negotiate test deadlines</h3>
<p>We don’t live in an ideal world, though. All too often, projects aren’t given as much time for testing as developers and testers think they need.</p>
<p>In one particularly egregious case, a major statewide health insurance company expanded a new software system before it was ready to go full scale. As a result, more than <a href="https://www.ciklum.com/da/blog/5-famous-software-glitches-which-could-be-avoided-with-good-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">25,000 customers were enrolled</a> in the wrong health care plans; the knowledge became public when a<a href="https://abc11.com/system-failure-blue-bross-shield-health-insurance/1158471/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> company whistleblower</a> approached a local TV network affiliate. Documents suggested that the insurance company management were aware of technical issues and testing delays for months, but they got impatient and deployed the software anyway.</p>
<p>Alan Zucker, founding principal at <a href="https://pmessentials.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Project Management Essentials</a>, once grappled with his own time crunch. He was managing the development of a specialized accounting program that integrated the processing of a dozen applications.</p>
<p>The accounting program Zucker worked on required the building of a processing hub that received and shared information with the other applications. The accounting process was executed daily, weekly, and monthly with specific timing requirements.</p>
<p>“Our project timeline was very short because the company needed to quickly enable this capability,” Zucker says. “We did not have time to run an end-to-end monthly test that would allow us to replicate the process. So we created a testing strategy where we simulated the processing cycle.&nbsp; Rather than having the process triggers execute based on the cycle clock, we manually executed the workflow.”</p>
<p>So far, so good. In test, everything worked fine. But executing the cycle the first time in production turned out to be a different matter. “Everything fell apart. In order to have the information loaded the application and available to the accountants by 8:00 a.m. the process first process executed at midnight and the second process kicked off at 2:00 a.m. Well, the first process did not take 30 minutes as expected. It took over two hours to complete,” Zucker recalls.</p>
<p>“The cascading impacts were disastrous,” Zucker says. “We had to take the application out of production and start over. We made the decision to execute a full end-to-end test simulating the actual daily, weekly, and monthly processing cycles.&nbsp; We spent nearly two months fixing the bugs and retesting the application suite.”</p>
<p>Zucker learned three lessons from this debacle:</p>
<ol>
<li>Creating a robust and well considered testing strategy early in the project is essential when building a complicated system;</li>
<li>Simulating a process cycle using test data is a not a substitute for real end-to-end testing;</li>
<li>Compressing project schedules to meet externally mandated timelines can be disastrous. Project managers need to negotiate deadlines and expectations with their project sponsors.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Tip #3: Users come first</h3>
<p>Software problems are often caused by not enough testing, agrees David (Grue) DeBry, CTO and co-founder at web startup company <a href="https://www.volleyapp.com/" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Volley</a>. Yet the opposite problem – too much testing – can lead to needless product delays.</p>
<p>Culprits behind excessive testing are often “code cowboys,” or “engineers going off the rails by throwing out code,” says DeBry, whose 20 years of industry experience also includes visual effects development for a string of Hollywood movies.</p>
<p>The “code cowboys” can become so driven by their own needs for meeting defined engineering processes that they lose sight of why the software is being developed in the first place.</p>
<p>“Unit tests. Smoke tests. Regression tests. The list goes on,” DeBry says. “There’s constant feature improvement. You’re unable to move forward, and testing can cause other things to happen.”</p>
<p>When in “cowboy mode,” engineers try to eliminate <a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/introduction-to-the-technical-debt-concept/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">technical debt</a>, or what results when software teams expedite the delivery of a piece of functionality or a project which later needs to be refactored. In other words, they balk at prioritizing speedy delivery over perfect code. Cowboys want “to “pay back the tech debt now,” according to DeBry.</p>
<p>Yet teams should instead focus on the people who will use the software, DeBry maintains. “Users are humans, and engineers maybe not so much. You don’t just write code. Efforts need to be organized around what to test and where. What’s important to do? What are the users’ priorities? There’s the argument that you don’t spend time testing for something if the user doesn’t care about it.”</p>
<h3>Tip #4: Don’t neglect the negative</h3>
<p>“Only testers who do nothing make no mistakes,” echoes Bartek Nowakowski, test lead at career website <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-positive-testing-and-negative-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zety,</a> “When testing big apps there are a lot of connections between functionalities, so it is easy to miss some of them.”</p>
<p>Zety has run into complications by not performing negative testing, a form of testing that checks to find out how software will behave under unexpected circumstances, such as if a user types letters instead of numbers into a phone number field.</p>
<p>“So even if functionality works as intended there can be circumstances in which incorrect or unpredicted user behavior creates an edge case situation,” says Nowakowski. “These can occur for months before someone realizes there’s an issue.”</p>
<h3>Tip #5: Doing live testing? Warn your users!</h3>
<p>A variety of industry best practices can and do get overlooked in the heat of the moment during a software crisis.</p>
<p>“After some changes to our database, we wanted to test the new elements. Unfortunately, there was an error that severed the connection between the backend and frontend,” says Reuben Yonatan, CEO of <a href="https://www.getvoip.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GetVoIP</a>. “We couldn’t connect to the database. It took a while, but our IT team found the bug and fixed it. However, we suffered disruption to our services.”</p>
<p>To GetVoIP, the incident underscored the need to always be prepared with a backup when running a software test. “That way, if something …</p></div></div>

                    <div>
                        <p>About 2 years ago, <a href="https://grafana.com/blog/2018/12/12/loki-prometheus-inspired-open-source-logging-for-cloud-natives/">I wrote</a><a href="https://grafana.com/blog/2018/12/12/loki-prometheus-inspired-open-source-logging-for-cloud-natives/"> a long post</a> about why we built <a href="https://grafana.com/oss/loki/">Loki</a> and the tradeoffs we made. Now, we've just launched <a href="https://grafana.com/oss/grafana-tempo/">Tempo</a>, our tracing store, which I think takes a very unique approach to tracing. I've been raving about tracing <a href="https://grafana.com/blog/2019/09/09/how-grafana-labs-is-running-jaeger-at-scale-with-prometheus-and-envoy/">for a while now</a>, and I am <a href="https://promcon.io/2019-munich/talks/prometheus-and-jaeger-a-match-made-in-heaven/">personally a massive fan</a>! Before I dive in, I have to say that both <a href="https://twitter.com/mrannanay">Annanay</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/actually_chores">Joe</a> did an amazing job with Tempo given the short amount of time they had and I am completely blown away, just watching from the sidelines! Amazing job team! Read the official blog and how to get involved here: <a href="https://deploy-preview-2675--grafana.netlify.app/blog/2020/10/27/announcing-grafana-tempo-a-massively-scalable-distributed-tracing-system/">https://grafana.com/blog/2020/10/27/announcing-grafana-tempo-a-massively-scalable-distributed-tracing-system/</a></p><h2 id="omg-the-index-">OMG the index!</h2><p>But tracing is not without its problems, the chief of them is cost. Most of the cost comes down to the indexing issues. You have to run <a href="https://www.jaegertracing.io/">Jaeger</a>, the leading open-source solution with either Cassandra or Elastic, both beasts of their own and extremely complex and costly to scale. The main reason to use them is because of the query and data patterns.</p><p>Traces have a varied datamodel, but fundamentally we track durations, and each of the object, called a span, we track has the following structure:</p><pre><code>spanID → string
traceID → string
functionName → string

tags → map[string]string

startTime → time.Time
duration → time.Duration

parentSpan → string (is a spanID if it has a parent span, else “” to indicate rootSpan)
</code></pre><p>Now in Jaeger, we basically have to answer a few queries, first of them is give me all the spans for a particular traceID, i.e, something like:</p><pre><code>SELECT spans WHERE traceID=XXXX</code></pre><p>Once, we have all the spans, we can reconstruct the full trace to be something like:</p><figure><img src="https://gouthamve.dev/content/images/2020/10/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://gouthamve.dev/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image-2.png 600w, https://gouthamve.dev/content/images/2020/10/image-2.png 952w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The second class of questions to answer is to select the traces matching a particular criteria, for example, give me all the traces emitted by the gateway for requests by user XXX on path `/home` that took more than `5s`.</p><pre><code>SELECT unique(traceIDs) 
LIMIT 1000 						[not-optional]
WHERE 
tags(user=XXX and service=gateway and operation=/home)		[optional]
duration &gt; 5s							[optional]
T1 &lt; time.start &lt; T2		</code></pre><p>Once we have all the traceIDs, we can use the query above to get all the spans for those traceIDs and we can get all the traces we want. Here in lies the problem, we need to lookup things on a set of arbitrary tags, and these tags are neither constant nor a predefined set.</p><p>Developers can and in most cases need to add 1000s of tags over the lifetime of the service, and each of these tags can have an insane cardinality, for example, the tags for userID or IPAddr have virtually infinite cardinality. To create a very efficient index is really hard, hence the dependency on Cassandra or Elasticsearch, but once you start using them, things start becoming expensive very quickly. One solution to the problem is to define a very strict set of tags with low cardinality, but the moment you start doing that you start losing out on a lot of the benefits of tracing.</p><h2 id="enter-tempo">Enter Tempo</h2><p>So, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/153NHJ9RZttAMbIGUEY8x61W3TZej-jXKjOqOppJiuvc/edit">I've played around with this problem before</a> and I'm convinced that the best index for tracing is a columnar store, but hotdemn, there is not a single columnar store that is easy to operate, like Prometheus. The team went looking and realised the complexity and decided to break the problem into two parts:</p><h3 id="finding-the-relevant-traceids">Finding the relevant traceIDs</h3><p>Our biggest use case for tracing is to debug query and request performance and we realised most of our queries are of the form, give me all the traceIDs from this namespace, for this user that took longer than 5s. And tbh, the Jaeger querying <a href="https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues/166">didn't really work for us</a> so we did the next best thing, <a href="https://github.com/weaveworks/common/pull/123">we printed out the traceID in the request logs</a> and then generated a daily report!</p><figure><img src="https://gouthamve.dev/content/images/2020/10/block-out-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://gouthamve.dev/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/block-out-2.png 600w, https://gouthamve.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/block-out-2.png 1000w, https://gouthamve.dev/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/block-out-2.png 1600w, https://gouthamve.dev/content/images/2020/10/block-out-2.png 2271w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Our daily report with the queries blurred out.</figcaption></figure><p>We basically traced and stored <em>all </em>the read path requests and then from this report, we picked the slowest queries and looked them up in Jaeger. This worked wonders, but over time, as our query load grew, we had to switch on sampling and could only store 50% of our queries. This meant when I was looking at a particularly interesting query, there is only a 50% chance I could look it up. Less than ideal, but we could live with it (for the short term ;)). We were using Loki to retrieve the logs and then had custom logic to generate this report but now with <a href="https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/logql/">Loki v2.0, you can basically use LogQL</a> to generate all the info in the report above!</p><p>As we started to explore how a new tracing solution would look like, we realised that we could offload the <em>discovery</em> of traceIDs to logs and metrics. For logs, the report above is enough, and in general we can figure out which traces are interesting by looking at the request logs. </p><figure><img src="https://gouthamve.dev/content/images/2020/10/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://gouthamve.dev/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image-4.png 600w, https://gouthamve.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/image-4.png 1000w, https://gouthamve.dev/content/images/2020/10/image-4.png 1118w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>For metrics, we slowly started the work of adding exemplars into Prometheus, so that we can basically jump to a trace from a graph. A good example is the screenshot above. This is with an experimental version (<a href="https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/6635">open PR</a>) of Prometheus, you can see that the spikes in latency are only due to the very short spike (at the beginning) and the graph is over 1m, because of the <code>rate[1m]</code>. This is super interesting information already, but the killer feature is that you can click on a dot to jump to the trace for that latency!</p><p>We've been touting this holy grail of jumping between metrics, logs and traces for a while now and we decided for the first version, not having an index and powering all the lookups through Loki and Prometheus might be enough. It's an interesting experiment to run tbh, and it works quite well for us. We just have to see how others react to it, it takes <em>a lot of discipline</em>. You need to print traceIDs in your logs and expose exemplars in your applications and nothing in this workflow is commonplace.</p><h3 id="tempodb-the-kv-store-over-object-store">TempoDB: The KV store over Object Store</h3><p>Okay cool, we kinda sorta circumvented the problem of finding the right traceIDs, we still needed to figure out how to lookup the traces given a traceID. Now tracing is no small beast, you need to store a lot of information. For every single request, we need to store all the RPC calls, and the tags associated with each RPC call (namespace, pod, service, endpoint, function, etc.) <em>atleast</em> but the power of tracing is truly unlocked when you start instrumenting specific functions you're curious about and various other metadata.</p><p>This means for about 1K QPS (our query load), we're writing 170K spans/sec and and 40MB/s of data. This is insane, with a week of retention its <strong>24TB of data</strong>!<strong> </strong>Now, not a lot of storage systems can handle that load and even if they can, they're a pain to manage and build.</p><p>Going back a little, that amount of data is not new to us. We run our <a href="http://grafana.com/cloud">hosted Prometheus</a> solution on top of <a href="https://cortexmetrics.io/">Cortex</a>, which manages several hundred TB on top of Bigtable. Cortex also supports Cassandra, DynamoDB, but one problem ails all these systems: They're hard to manage and expensive to run! <a href="https://thanos.io/">Thanos</a>, another project that does long term storage for Prometheus, uses Object Storage like S3, GCS, Minio, etc. to store data. It saw a lot of adoption, even with the existence of a more mature Cortex project, and a large part of the credit goes to using Object Storage which reduces the TCO by an order of magnitude and makes the system overall much easier to use.</p><p>We've learnt from Thanos and made sure Loki could run purely off of object storage and made it super easy to use and we saw incredible success! At this point it was clear that if we wanted to build a scalable, robust but <em>inexpensive</em> tracing solution, we needed to build it on top of Object Storage. To put it in perspective, storing 24TB in GCS costs less than $500 per month! This is great, and now Cortex's new storage engine borrows from Thanos and is fully backed by an Object Store and easy to use as well!</p><p>With that decision, we needed to see what the datamodel looks like and we quickly realised that all we needed was a KV Store built on top of Object Storage. Literally the query model is to load all the spans for a <em>traceID</em>. Hence a KV store where the key is the <em>traceID </em>and the value is the blob of spans for that traceID. Now, a trace object (the collection of spans) is super small in the order of bytes to a few KB hence using the <em>traceID</em> as the key in the object store won't work, atleast not cost efficiently. We need much bigger objects for this to work.</p><p>Enter <a href="https://github.com/grafana/tempo/tree/master/tempodb">tempodb</a>, our KV store built on top of Object Store. tempodb collects the KV objects and builds them into large blocks, several 100MBs big and stores them in an object store. It has a lot of cool magic inside including bloom filters and compactions and I'll dive into it in its own blogpost.</p><h3 id="tempodb-is-not-tempo-">TempoDB is not Tempo!</h3><p>But a simple KV store won't cut it. When applications send us data, they will end up sending us individual spans, and not all the spans bunched together by traceID. We needed a system that could collect all the spans together, assemble them by traceID and store them in the Object Store. Basically we need to collect spans by the <em>traceID</em> and fortunately we have a lot of experience with this problem in Cortex (and Loki) where we needed to assemble all the samples by their metric for compression. It's a very robust and scalable system that uses a hash ring and we used the same system for Tempo. This guarantees us virtually infinite scalability!</p><p>Our docs are sparse now (we're working on them pronto!) but you can get some of the details here: <a href="https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest/architecture/">https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest/architecture/</a>. </p><figure><img src="https://gouthamve.dev/content/images/2020/10/image-5.png" alt=""></figure><p>I'll explain this in detail with the tempodb blogpost but the gist is, tempodb is a generic KV db built on top of an object store backend. In Tempo, we use it to index the high cardinality traceID field.</p><p>Now Tempo is not just the simple storage layer, but also does sampling if required and enforces retention and we are going to add more tracing specific features to it.</p><h3 id="tldr">TLDR?</h3><p>Overall, I can say this about Tempo, it's a <em>simple</em> but <em>scalable, easy to run </em>and <em>inexpensive</em> tracing store that relies on other systems for its …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

October 27, 2020 | https://ish-ar.io/tutorial-go-git/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ish-ar.io/tutorial-go-git/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Tutorial introduction and requirements</h2>
<p>Today’s article is a tutorial on how set up and use the go-git library to clone and update a repository with an in-memory filesystem.<br>
This procedure is quite useful if you want to push against or clone a repository without touching the OS filesystem and deal with permissions or temporary files.<br>
Albeit, there’s documentation about git-go, I find it not really clear and sometimes misleading due to the different versions and names of the library.<br>
For this reason, I’ve decided to share this tutorial, and hopefully will be helpful to someone.<br>
For the purpose of this tutorial, we will do everything inside a main.go file, however you might want something more sofisticated for your use case :)</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>An https Git repository (Github, Bitbucket doesn’t really matter as long as it’s accessible via https.)</li>
<li>Go installed and configured.</li>
<li>Basic Knowledge of Go.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Setting up the In-Memory Filesystem</h2>
<p>To set up the in-memory filesystem, we will use two packages storage and memfs.
The storer will contain the objects, references and other metadata (normally what the directory <code>.git</code> would do).<br>
The memfs filesystem will be our filesystem to read, create, remove any kind of file in our repository.<br>
First step, we need to create the two objects (the storer and the filesystem).</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>package main

import (
        "fmt"

        billy "github.com/go-git/go-billy/v5"
        memfs "github.com/go-git/go-billy/v5/memfs"
        git "github.com/go-git/go-git/v5"
        http "github.com/go-git/go-git/v5/plumbing/transport/http"
        memory "github.com/go-git/go-git/v5/storage/memory"
)

var storer *memory.Storage
var fs billy.Filesystem

func main() {
        storer = memory.NewStorage()
        fs = memfs.New()

...</code></pre></div>
<h2>Setting up Git objects and Clone the repo</h2>
<p>Second step, in order to have our repository in the in-memory filesystem, we need to <strong>clone</strong> it and create the <strong>worktree</strong> object.<br>
The function <code>Clone()</code> will also return the Repository interface that we will then use to <code>Push()</code> to the remote.<br>
The method <code>Worktree()</code> will return the Worktree object that we will need to <code>Add()</code> &amp; <code>Commit()</code> our changes.<br>
Finally, if our repository is private, we would need to set up the basic authentication to clone it (We need the basic authentication to push anyway so better to set up it here!).</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>...

        // Authentication
        auth := &amp;http.BasicAuth{
                Username: "your-git-user",
                Password: "your-git-pass",
        }

        repository := "https://github.com/your-org/your-repo"
        r, err := git.Clone(storer, fs, &amp;git.CloneOptions{
                URL:  repository,
                Auth: auth,
        })
        if err != nil {
                fmt.Printf("%v", err)
                return
        }
        fmt.Println("Repository cloned")

        w, err := r.Worktree()
        if err != nil {
                fmt.Printf("%v", err)
                return
        }</code></pre></div>
<h2>Create and commit your files</h2>
<p>Now, will we use the <code>fs</code> object to create an actual file, add &amp; commit it to the Worktree().</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>By default, the repository is always cloned into <code>"/"</code>. </li>
<li>For some reason (unknown to me), if the filename starts with ”/” it will create a folder and not a file.<br>E.g.: /hello/world.txt (world.txt would be a directory) hello/world.txt (world.txt would be a file inside the folder hello)</li>
</ul>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>...

        // Create new file
        filePath := "my-new-ififif.txt"
        newFile, err := fs.Create(filePath)
        if err != nil {
                return
        }
        newFile.Write([]byte("My new file"))
        newFile.Close()

        // Run git status before adding the file to the worktree
        fmt.Println(w.Status())

        // git add $filePath
        w.Add(filePath)

        // Run git status after the file has been added adding to the worktree
        fmt.Println(w.Status())

        // git commit -m $message
        w.Commit("Added my new file", &amp;git.CommitOptions{})</code></pre></div>
<h2>Push and check errors</h2>
<p>The Push() will be performed using the method of the Repository interface as shown below.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>...

        //Push the code to the remote
        err = r.Push(&amp;git.PushOptions{
                RemoteName: "origin",
                Auth:       auth,
        })
        if err != nil {
                return
        }
        fmt.Println("Remote updated.", filePath)
        return
}</code></pre></div>
<p>Our final main.go would look like this: <a href="https://github.com/ish-xyz/ish-ar.io-tutorials/blob/master/tutorial-go-git/main.go">https://github.com/ish-xyz/ish-ar.io-tutorials/blob/master/tutorial-go-git/main.go</a></p>
<h2>Install and run our module</h2>
<p>Let’s try our new go module. Run the following commands:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>go mod init
go build
go run main.go

    Repository cloned
    ?? my-new-file.txt
    &lt;nil&gt;
    A  my-new-file.txt
    &lt;nil&gt;
    Remote updated. my-new-file.txt</code></pre></div>
<p>I know this is quite a specific topic, but I hope this tutorial will help someone!</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Infrastructure as code has been an important practice of DevOps for years.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyone running an Apache Kafka data infrastructure and running on Kubernetes, the chances are you’ve probably nailed defining your infrastructure this way.</p><p>If you’re running on Kubernetes, you’re likely using operators as part of your CI/CD toolchain to automate your deployments.&nbsp;</p><p>Adopting GitOps is natural evolution, whereby the state of your landscape is managed in Git (or any code repo) with automation systems ensuring the state of a deployment remains consistent with the repo.</p><p>Where we’ve seen a particular lack of maturity and best practices is in managing the application landscape of flows and microservices on technologies such as Kafka and Kubernetes.</p><p>GitOps is increasingly playing a big part of DataOps. DataOps promotes the accelerated delivery of data products through decentralized data governance, automation, self-service and lowering the skills required to operate data. GitOps brings standardization, governance and automation.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a subject we’ve spoken about at a few events recently including at Kafka Summit this year and on DevOps.com:</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iJygfiN-RR8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2>What Kafka with GitOps should look like</h2><p>
When looking to automate real-time applications following DataOps, we need to be thinking about more than automating the app deployment. We need to define the correct data governance controls as part of the software delivery.&nbsp;</p><p>This means avoiding blind releasing apps where governance is an afterthought.&nbsp;</p><p>Lack of good governance will reduce the accessibility and trust in data and reduce the confidence to use the data downstream. Governance should cover the accessibility, availability, quality, integrity and confidentiality of the data.&nbsp;</p><p>We want the creator of the App, who best understands the data to be able to define the governance controls as a single package and then have it reviewed by a standard workflow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Example: A data analyst builds their own data-processing application, but they also define the governance and compliance controls required to release it. This puts the app’s performance parameters in their hands - they decide what makes it production-ready and enterprise-grade.</p><p>When deploying Kafka on Kubernetes, it may look like this: The analyst defines the application logic in some form (such as SQL) and includes:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>The necessary Kafka ACLs</p></li><li><p>The data policies to mask any sensitive data</p></li><li><p>The lag and expected data throughput alerting rules</p></li><li><p>Where those events should be sent to (Slack, Pagerduty, etc)</p></li><li><p>The auditing rules to 3rd parties</p></li></ul><p>And so on...&nbsp;</p><p>This can then be pushed to Git, managed through your standard Git workflows and a merge request created, triggering a build pipeline to deploy across your different environments.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/57dTrzg6Sg6OORdvRTeebS/adef2d61514ca6b0e621c6343a22c4cf/GetYourGitOps.png" alt="GetYourGitOps"></p><p>If you’re working with Kafka and doing this, there are two areas we need to consider:</p><ol><li><p>How to define the the application &amp; governance landscape as config</p></li><li><p>How to best automate deployment in an infrastructure-agnostic and secure way.</p></li></ol><h2>Defining the App and Governance as config</h2><p>
Lenses provide a full experience for data practitioners (developers, analysts, even business users) to build real-time applications deploying on a Kafka &amp; Kubernetes data platform by ensuring all data is catalogued, made accessible and explorable.&nbsp;</p><p>The<a href="https://docs.lenses.io/4.0/tools/cli/"> Lenses CLI client</a> allows your “data landscape” to be exported as declarative

and best maintain a consistent state</h2><p>
Here’s where there are a few different methods that are commonly adopted.&nbsp;</p><h3>Push Methods</h3><p>This is the method we see most organizations adopt. Teams will push to Git which will trigger a deploy pipeline in any CI/CD (such as Jenkins) using various APIs in Kafka, Kafka Connect, Kubernetes or wherever you’re running your applications. It also makes it difficult for Jenkins to monitor the desired state and ensure consistency with Git.</p><p>Of course you also need to open up the firewall to allow Jenkins into your data platform.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/74tcs9DG4E3jGe7mk34fku/3a4d4d3bd393f1de19d92d0f659ad9ff/GetYourGitOps_Pushing.png" alt="Traditional CI/CD push for Kafka automation"></p><h4>K8 Operator for Kafka</h4><p>You can use a Kubernetes operator to push the desired state. Jenkins or your CI/CD tool still needs to penetrate the data platform environment, however, which may increase security risk. Then you can use a Kubernetes operator (such as Strimzi’s) to monitor the desired state and apply the state to Kafka via APIs. This method is often used to operate the Kafka infrastructure, scale up Brokers etc. rather than to operate at the data layer (Topics, ACLs etc.)</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/47dnPqN0cGXI46XbqGx9gg/25f72efd0b1a927661c5dd0359e9916c/GetYourGitOps_K8s.png" alt="Traditional Kubernetes operator for GitOps"></p><h3>Pull Methods</h3><p>Pull methods are still based on an operator pattern, but through watching Git rather than watching Kubernetes.&nbsp;</p><p>This allows the pattern to work independently of using Kubernetes. </p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/RrcOkBDI9jgcm4KXBL9ca/73f4b286f539b47886b4854803fd7917/gitops_graffic_lenses_operator.png" alt="Lenses Operator for GitOps"></p><p>The operator is a Lenses operator which can run either inside or outside your data platform.&nbsp; The operator speaks with Lenses which applies the desired state to the data platform including any real-time applications. So for example for anyone using <a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/07/Why-new-Streaming-SQL-opens-up-data-platform/">Lenses Streaming SQL</a>, this would deploy the application over Kubernetes.&nbsp;</p><p>The desired state of course would have been created within a separate Lenses environment and exported as config with the CLI before being pushed into Git.&nbsp;</p><p>The benefit of this pull deployment approach is it provides a more secure environment by not needing your CI/CD to access your infrastructure, it also ensures your applications are secured, governed and audited in Git with the state actively monitored and the ability to rollback at any time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><b>You can practice GitOps in the free </b><a href="https://lenses.io/box/">Kafka+Lenses docker developer Box </a><b>now.&nbsp; If you’re interested in an early access to the Lenses Operator: get in touch with us now</b><a href="https://lenses.io/contact-us/"> by form</a><b> or via </b><a target="_blank" href="https://launchpass.com/lensesio">Slack.</a><b> </b></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Organizations that operate microservices/service-oriented architecture face a variety of technical and people related problems. Over the past few years, companies have been migrating massive monolithic applications into smaller microservices (think services that do one thing, like <em>archive a pdf</em>) or even service oriented architectures (e.g. service-per-domain, <em>payments, billing, auth</em>).</p><p>There are undoubtedly many issues that come from monolithic architectures: easy to tightly couple domains and data, slower deployment process, and long test runs to name a few. Breaking the monolith can seem like a panacea for these issues. An SOA can provide team level ownership of domains and their systems, data is decoupled, and features/fixes can be deployed separately. Unfortunately, a SOA comes with its own set of issues.</p><p>Monoliths have been around for a while. There's a lot that's been written about "taming the monolith". As we get to work building Cortex, we've been talking to engineers about their experiences dealing with microservice architectures. Here's some things we've learned about taming your microservices.</p><p>A monolith, for all its warts, is simple to reason about. There are no network calls. There's no overhead to calling a function elsewhere in the codebase. If you're using a typed language, you can catch API changes at compile time. All the code is in one place – if you're so inclined, you can easily peek under the hood.</p><p>An SOA brings with it a suite of technical challenges, including operational complexity and performance hits. You now have to think about:</p><ul role="list"><li>Network latency</li><li>API versioning - what if the payments team makes a breaking change to its API without notifying me?</li><li>Network issues - what happens if I don't receive confirmation that the payment went through?</li><li>Change management/releases - when an issue occurs</li></ul><p>Yet, these technical challenges are the least of your worries.</p><h2>PEBCAK - Problem exists between chair and keyboard</h2><p>While it may sound strange to think that cultural and people problems are a significant challenge stemming from architectural choices, keep in mind that most organizations move to an SOA to scale their team, not their software.</p><p><strong>Distributing ownership of domains, data, and release cadence across services and teams can increase the velocity of your engineering org.</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, distributing ownership does just that - teams start diverging in their operational procedures, documentation practices, and more. As an organization scales, this can wreak havoc on productivity, and ultimately bring your velocity back to square one.</p><p>People, process, and cultural issues around service oriented architectures have far reaching consequences:</p><ul role="list"><li>Ramping up engineers becomes costly - each team maintains their own processes. An engineer moving between teams may have to learn as much as a brand new hire.</li><li>Operational triage takes longer - tribal knowledge dissipates as an organization grows, making it harder to answer questions such as: what services exist, what they do, and who owns them</li><li>Communication overhead between teams - oversharing information is noisy, undersharing (e.g. when making API changes) can, in the worst case, cause outages or functionality issues and directly impact the bottom line</li></ul><p>Looking to scale your team? It's time to start thinking these challenges and how you can counter them.</p><p>There's no silver bullet to solve these problems. No combination of tools or processes can protect you. However, prevention really is better than the cure.</p><p>Think of it like a flu shot - you know its flu season, getting the flu sucks, and even though you may still get the flu, you'll never regret setting yourself up for success.</p><h2>Spec first design</h2><p>An excellent habit to promote is thinking about APIs and data models before jumping into the implementation.</p><h3>API Design</h3><p>It's important to ensure your SOA doesn't turn into a <em>distributed monolith</em>.</p><p>Signs of a distributed monolith:</p><ul role="list"><li>No separation of concerns</li><li>Shared databases and data models</li><li>Releasing one service requires coordination of deploys across multiple other services</li><li>Consuming a service's APIs requires knowledge about its data models, side effects, etc</li></ul><p>One way to prevent this is following the Amazon model - APIs are the only way teams communicate. This means that a service owner should:</p><ul role="list"><li>Think about their API request/responses <strong>before implementation</strong></li><li><strong>Share the API for review</strong> so that use cases for dependents are well covered</li><li><strong>Communicate API changes</strong> ahead of time</li><li><strong>Version their APIs</strong> to maintain backwards compatibility</li></ul><p>This workflow provides additional benefits when used in conjunction with tooling, such as OpenAPI or gRPC. If schemas and APIs are designed ahead of time, you can use:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Code gen</strong> for clients across different languages</li><li>Catch breaking changes to your API at <strong>build time</strong></li><li>Use your code review process to loop in the right stakeholders <em>before a change is released</em></li><li><strong>Contract testing</strong> to ensure you don't go out of compliance with your predetermined schema</li></ul><figure id="w-node-9def8f3c3ff0-f078b551"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/5ecd2f3387ce026d1c67c8e6_JqjXbRYzUWfOUOAN.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Atlassian is an example of successfully using spec-first API design to improve their development lifecycle. I found <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/technology/spec-first-api-development"><strong>https://www.atlassian.com/blog/technology/spec-first-api-development</strong></a> to be an excellent overview of using OpenAPI as the tooling to enable spec-first development.</p><h3>Data models</h3><p>The breaking point for a monolith is when multiple teams start depending on the same data models across domains. This slows down the development cadence across the org and the resulting spaghetti data models make it exponentially more difficult to reason about the code base.</p><p>It's easy to go down the same route in an SOA as well. There are some habits that help prevent this nightmare:</p><ul role="list"><li>Separate data stores for each service</li><li>Thinking carefully about data models and links before implementing APIs</li><li>Reducing dependencies at the data level between services - for example, store reference IDs to resources in a different service, and fetch data through their API</li><li>Ensuring stakeholders (business, developers, service consumers) don't build tooling directly on your data. This locks in your data model and prevents you from iterating as a service owner. Instead, expose data (with its own contract) through APIs or analytical data streams.</li></ul><h2>Standardization of platform/process</h2><p>There's one obvious solution to "each team doing things their own way" - make it easy for teams to do things in a standardized way.</p><p>Atlassian, for example, has built out an internal PaaS that is essentially a thin wrapper around AWS. By doing so, developers are provisioned their desired resources but the platform automatically augments it with standard monitoring, logging, and more.</p><p>Well designed tooling that provides a standard way of doing things speeds up developer velocity and makes sure teams are working in consistent ways.</p><p>This even extends to documentation. Spotify and Atlassian have built internal tooling that standardizes information discovery around their microservices. System-Z at Spotify and <a href="https://blog.developer.atlassian.com/why-atlassian-uses-an-internal-paas-to-regulate-aws-access/"><strong>Microscope at Atlassian</strong></a> provide a source of truth for details about each service, such as system ownership, links to documentation/runbooks, and recent deploys. What makes them even more powerful is that they are the entrypoint into further information about services – on-call rotations, links to monitoring dashboards, logging, etc.</p><figure id="w-node-a1aa57605d7f-f078b551"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/5ecd2f37ddc5afe80353230b_vpQZUjpsspzaKCVQ.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>This kind of standardization of information improves engineering ramp up time and operational efficiency - all services are operated in the same way and developers have a single source to look for critical information about their services.</p><p>Many organizations end up building an internal service registry for humans after the problem has gotten out of hand – too many services, growing teams and turnover, remote developers, etc.</p><p>Cortex provides a standard, opinionated way to organize information about all of your services and enables functionality such as:</p><ul role="list"><li>A dashboard to answer questions such as "what services exist?", "who owns this service?", "where are the runbooks for this service?"</li><li>An audit report that shows you the health of your services: does every service have an owner, an oncall rotation, etc.</li></ul><figure id="w-node-66b03bd1403c-f078b551"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/5ecd2f3276ebd32f1e32f034_YyoCvebvNYItDndV.png" alt=""></p></figure><ul role="list"><li>Integrations with third party tools - for example, when Pagerduty triggers an alert, Cortex can send a slack message with information about the service such as ownership, latest commits from github, latest deploys, and more.</li></ul><p>Reach out to us on our home page to request a demo, we'd love to show you what we've built and help prevent some of the headaches that come with a service oriented architecture.

Why on Earth would they pick you if there are <a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/differentiation?rq=mountain" target="_blank">so many better alternatives</a>?

And just picked 10% to work on.</p><p>It’s not hard to be the best if you’re the only one doing it.</p><p><strong>EXPLOIT GEOGRAPHICAL CONSTRAINTS</strong></p><p>Another way to cheat is to realize ‘’the world’’ doesn’t mean the entire planet.

<p><code>dry-python/returns@0.15</code> is <a href="https://github.com/dry-python/returns/releases/tag/0.15.0">released</a>! And it means that now anyone can use our Higher Kinded Types emulation in their projects.</p>

<p>In this post I will explain:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What Higher Kinded Types (HKTs) are and why they are useful</li>
  <li>How they are implemented and what limitations there are</li>
  <li>How can you use them in your own projects</li>
</ul>

<p>Without further ado, let’s talk about typing!</p>


      <h2 id="simple-types">
        
        <a href="#simple-types">Simple types</a>
        
      </h2>

<p>Typing is layered. Like a good cake. There are at least three layers that we are going to cover.</p>

<p>Simple (or flat) typing, like <code>x: int = 1</code>. This allows us to express simple types and their transformations. Like <code>int -&gt; str</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>stringify</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>str</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A lot of languages like <code>go</code> and <code>php</code> do not go beyond this line. And they still work pretty well! These types are also sometimes called <code>*</code>-kinded. It can be understood as “a place for just a single type argument”.</p>


    
      <h2 id="generic">
        
        <a href="#generic">Generic</a>
        
      </h2>

<p>Generic level is required to express “nested” types. For example, you have a list of integers. In Python we annotate it as <code>List[int]</code> or <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0585/"><code>list[int]</code></a> in Python <code>3.9</code>. This allows us to have types with other types as arguments. <code>List</code> can receive <code>int</code> or <code>str</code> or even another <code>List</code> as the type argument. This way we can nest type and types start to have their own structure.</p>

<p>Generics are much more interesting than simple types. And they can have multiple type arguments:</p>
<ul>
  <li>List has one: for values, so it has a kind of <code>* -&gt; *</code>. It can be understood as a type transformation <code>List -&gt; T = List[T]</code></li>
  <li>Dict has two: for keys and values, so it has a kind of <code>* -&gt; * -&gt; *</code>. It can be understood as a type transformation <code>Dict -&gt; K -&gt; V = Dict[K, V]</code></li>
  <li>And so on!</li>
</ul>

<p>This would be very helpful for us in the future, I promise.</p>

<p>We can also write transformations for generic types:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>stringify_list_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>List</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>[</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>arg</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But, that is where things begin to be quite complicated.</p>

<p>How can this function work with other iterables like <code>set</code>, <code>frozenset</code>, <code>tuple</code>?
We can express this in Python as easy as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>type</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>arg</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But the typing part would be quite challenging. Let’s try several things.</p>


    
      <h3 id="common-interface">
        
        <a href="#common-interface">Common interface</a>
        
      </h3>

<p>The first obvious thing to try is <code>Iterable</code> protocol. It is builtin into Python and does what we need.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Iterable</span>

<span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>Iterable</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Iterable</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>type</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>arg</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s try it out:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>]))</span>
<span># Revealed type is 'typing.Iterable[builtins.str]'
</span>
<span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>({</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>}))</span>
<span>#  Revealed type is 'typing.Iterable[builtins.str]'
</span>
<span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>((</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)))</span>
<span>#  Revealed type is 'typing.Iterable[builtins.str]'
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can see that a part of our typing information is lost. We pass <code>List</code> or <code>Set</code> or <code>Tuple</code> and always get the <code>Iterable</code> back.</p>

<p>Sometimes - this is ok. But, in some cases, this is not enough. Let’s try some other technique!</p>


    
      <h3 id="methods">
        
        <a href="#methods">Methods</a>
        
      </h3>

<p>One can say: we are all using Object-Oriented Programming! Why cannot we just create a new method for each type we need? And specify the exact return type there!</p>

<p>Well, it is a possible solution. But, there are some reasonable problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You cannot add methods to existing types and extend them with this approach. Only create new ones, probably via subtyping, and add new methods there. In our example you would have to create your own versions of <code>List</code>, <code>Set</code>, and <code>Tuple</code>. Which is not desirable in most situations</li>
  <li>It really starts to be messy if you have a lot of methods to add. A type with more than <code>X</code> (choose the number yourself) methods starts to be really complex to read, understand, and use. Instead, using separate functions is much easier, because we don’t have to put everything into a single namespace</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s try something else.</p>


    
      <h3 id="overloads">
        
        <a href="#overloads">overloads</a>
        
      </h3>

<p>Another solution that might solve our problem is using the <code>@overload</code> decorator with proper types for each required case.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>List</span><span>,</span> <span>Set</span><span>,</span> <span>overload</span>

<span>@</span><span>overload</span>
<span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>List</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>...</span>

<span>@</span><span>overload</span>
<span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>Set</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Set</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>...</span>

<span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>type</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>arg</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s test it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>]))</span>
<span># Revealed type is 'builtins.list[builtins.str]'
</span>
<span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>({</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>}))</span>
<span># Revealed type is 'builtins.set[builtins.str]'
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Awesome! Looks like we’ve achieved our goal, haven’t we? But, there’s a new problem. We have to manually list all possible cases in a function’s signature. This works for cases when all possible arguments and outcomes are known in advance. But, not in this case. In Python <code>Iterable</code> is a protocol. We can use this function with any type with <code>__iter__</code> method defined: with both builtin and custom types. So, the number of possible arguments and outcomes is endless.</p>

<p>To illusrate the problem, let’s see what happens for <code>Tuple</code> which is not listed in the function’s overloads:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>((</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)))</span>
<span># error: No overload variant of "stringify_iterable_items" matches argument type "Tuple[int, int, int]"
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We, in <code>dry-python</code> <a href="https://github.com/dry-python/returns/blob/0.14.0/returns/_generated/converters/flatten.pyi">used this technique</a> with <code>@overload</code> decorator for our previous versions. This allowed us to write correct definitions of functions working with generic types. But, they were limited to the pre-defined set of our own types. And we wanted to allow our users to create their custom types based on our interfaces. With the full existing code reuse.</p>


    
      <h2 id="higher-kinded-types">
        
        <a href="#higher-kinded-types">Higher Kinded Types</a>
        
      </h2>

<p>That’s where the idea of Higher Kinded Types becomes useful. We need HKTs when we want to change the inner structure of generics with full type information preserving and openness to the extension. In theory, you can write something like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Iterable</span>

<span>T</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'T'</span><span>,</span> <span>bound</span><span>=</span><span>Iterable</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>type</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>arg</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And this would solve our problem! What happens here is that we abstract away the <code>Iterable</code> type itself. And then ask <code>mypy</code> to figure this out for us.</p>

<p>This way we can potentially have <code>stringify_iterable_items</code> working for any <code>Iterable</code> type, but with the exact same type returned back without any information lost. And it would work for all types.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>]))</span>
<span># Revealed type is 'builtins.list[builtins.str]'
</span>
<span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>({</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>}))</span>
<span># Revealed type is 'builtins.set[builtins.str]'
</span>
<span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>MyCustomIterable</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)))</span>
<span># Revealed type is 'my_module.MyCustomIterable[builtins.str]'
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://github.com/python/typing/issues/548">it is not supported</a> at the moment.</p>


    
      <h3 id="emulation">
        
        <a href="#emulation">Emulation</a>
        
      </h3>

<p>Turns out we are not alone in this situation. There are multiple languages where Higher Kinded Types are not natively supported yet. But, they can be emulated:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts/blob/master/docs/guides/HKT.md">TypeScript</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://bow-swift.io/docs/fp-concepts/higher-kinded-types/">Swift</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://arrow-kt.io/docs/0.10/patterns/glossary/#higher-kinds">Kotlin</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And now with <a href="https://returns.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/hkt.html">Python</a> too!</p>

<p>There’s also <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jdy22/papers/lightweight-higher-kinded-polymorphism.pdf">an original whitepaper</a> for ones who are interested.</p>

<p>The core idea of HKT emulation is that we can write types the other way around: not like <code>T[int]</code>, but rather like <code>Kind[T, int]</code> (which is absolutely the same thing).</p>

<p>This way we can transform the inner structure of generics, but maintain the simple context without reinventing <code>TypeVar</code> with type arguments. And our function’s type signature will look like: <code>Kind[T, int] -&gt; Kind[T, str]</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s see the implementation.</p>


    
      <h2 id="implementation">
        
        <a href="#implementation">Implementation</a>
        
      </h2>

<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: here’s <a href="https://gist.github.com/sobolevn/7f8ffd885aec70e55dd47928a1fb3e61">the final working code</a> with all the logic, all the hacks, and everything. In this article, we going to write and explain it step by step.</p>

<p>We would need a better example to test our implementation. Let’s build two types: a <code>Box</code> and a <code>Bag</code>. <code>Box</code> is defined by its size, while a <code>Bag</code> is an item of fashion: it has a brand name and a model name (I have a wife, I know this stuff!).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>dataclasses</span> <span>import</span> <span>dataclass</span>

    <span>height</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span>

<span>@</span><span>dataclass</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Bag</span><span>(</span><span>Generic</span><span>[</span><span>_ValueType</span><span>]):</span>
    <span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>_ValueType</span>
    <span>brand</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span>
    <span>model</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And we can create <code>Box</code>es and <code>Bag</code>s of different types, because we can put different things inside them:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>box</span> <span>=</span> <span>Box</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>=</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>length</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>width</span><span>=</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>height</span><span>=</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>  <span># Box[int]
</span><span>bag</span> <span>=</span> <span>Bag</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>=</span><span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>brand</span><span>=</span><span>'Fancy'</span><span>,</span> <span>model</span><span>=</span><span>'Baggy'</span><span>)</span>  <span># Bag[int]
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, we need a function with a type transformation. Let’s say we want to apply a function to the value inside boxes and bags. Let’s use fake <code>BoxOrBag</code> type for now to illustrate our intent:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Callable</span>

<span>_NewValueType</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_NewValueType'</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>apply_function</span><span>(</span>
    <span>instance</span><span>:</span> <span>BoxOrBag</span><span>[</span><span>_ValueType</span><span>],</span>  <span># fake type for now
</span>    <span>callback</span><span>:</span> <span>Callable</span><span>[[</span><span>_ValueType</span><span>],</span> <span>_NewValueType</span><span>],</span>
<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>BoxOrBag</span><span>[</span><span>_NewValueType</span><span>]:</span>  <span># fake type for now
</span>    <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It is going to work like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>assert</span> <span>apply_function</span><span>(</span><span>box</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>Box</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>=</span><span>'10'</span><span>,</span> <span>length</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>width</span><span>=</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>height</span><span>=</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>apply_function</span><span>(</span><span>bag</span><span>,</span> <span>bool</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>Bag</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>,</span> <span>brand</span><span>=</span><span>'Fancy'</span><span>,</span> <span>model</span><span>=</span><span>'Baggy'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We only need to change current fake <code>BoxOrBag</code> type to a real HKT. We would need to define a new <code>Kind</code> type to make the emulation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>_InstanceType</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_InstanceType'</span><span>,</span> <span>covariant</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>
<span>_FirstTypeArgType</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_FirstTypeArgType'</span><span>,</span> <span>covariant</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Kind</span><span>(</span><span>Generic</span><span>[</span><span>_InstanceType</span><span>,</span> <span>_FirstTypeArgType</span><span>]):</span>
    <span>"""Used for HKT emulation."""</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One pro-tip about <code>Kind</code>: it won’t not exist during runtime. Only during type-checking.</p>

<p>Now, let’s change <code>apply_function</code> to use <code>Kind</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>_InstanceKind</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_InstanceKind'</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>apply_function</span><span>(</span>
    <span>instance</span><span>:</span> <span>Kind</span><span>[</span><span>_InstanceKind</span><span>,</span> <span>_ValueType</span><span>],</span>
    <span>callback</span><span>:</span> <span>Callable</span>…</code></pre></div></div></div></div>

October 27, 2020 | https://findka.com/blog/essays-implementation/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://findka.com/blog/essays-implementation/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently finished the MVP for an idea I had last month: <a href="https://essays.findka.com/" target="_blank">Findka Essays</a>, a newsletter that adapts to your preferences with machine learning. I pivoted to this from a much more complicated recommender system app, so I was already familiar with (almost) all the parts needed to build it. I'm extremely happy with the result: the new app is simple, the codebase is clean, and I launched it in under two weeks. In the grand tradition of our people, it is now time for an architecture + toolkit walkthrough. Feel free to skip to whichever sections interest you most. If you read only one section, I suggest <a href="https://findka.com/blog/essays-implementation/#recommendations">Recommendations</a>.</p><p>Note: I've abstracted a lot of the code into <a href="https://findka.com/biff">Biff</a>, a web framework I released several months ago. I'll reference Biff frequently.</p><ul>

<li><a href="https://findka.com/blog/essays-implementation/#front-end">Front end</a></li>

</ul><hr><h3 id="language">Language</h3><p>The vast majority of the app is written in Clojure (the only exception is the actual recommendation algorithm, which is written in Python). Clojure is a fabulous language that has a strong emphasis on simplicity and stability, which makes codebases easy to maintain and extend in the long run. As a Lisp, it also has an extremely tight feedback loop which is great for rapid development.</p><p>There is a trade-off: since Clojure focuses on long-term concerns over short-term concerns, it can take a while to get up to speed (though it's a lot easier if you have a mentor). For example, to do web dev in Clojure, you'll need to learn how to piece together a bunch of individual libraries—there isn't a go-to framework like Rails or Django. (<a href="https://luminusweb.com/" target="_blank">Luminus</a> is probably the best starting point, after you're familiar with the language itself).</p><p>In most cases, I'd say the trade-off is well worth it. But for small or experimental apps (like you might build in a startup), speed at the beginning is extra valuable. If you want to move fast right away but you're not already comfortable in the Clojure ecosystem, you might have a bad time. One of my goals for Biff is to help mitigate that.</p><h3 id="front-end">Front end</h3><p>OK, now for some actual code. Findka Essays, unlike its predecessor, is a humble multi-page application. No React here. So the front end is pretty simple.</p><p>(For brevity, I'll call it "Findka" from here on out).</p><p>I use <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/rum" target="_blank">Rum</a> for HTML generation. Here's a quick example:</p><pre><code>(ns hello.world
 (:require
   [rum.core :as rum]))

(defn -main []
  (spit "hello.html"
    (rum/render-static-markup
      [:html
       [:body
        [:p {:style {:color "red"}}
         "Hello world!"]]])))
</code></pre><p>After <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started" target="_blank">installing Clojure</a>, you could put that in <code>src/hello/world.clj</code> and then run the program with <code>clj -Sdeps '{:deps {rum/rum {:mvn/version "0.11.5"}}}' -M -m hello.world</code>. That's a great way to get started with Clojure, actually—you can make a whole static site with just functions, data structures, and Rum. That's how I made Findka's landing page. Here's a snippet:</p><pre><code>(defn home []
  (base-page {:scripts [[:script {:src "/js/ensure-logged-out.js"}]]}
    [:.bg-dark.text-white
     [:.container.px-3.mx-auto.max-w-screen-md
      [:.nunito-sans-bold.text-2xl.mt-4.mb-8.sm:text-center
       "Great essays delivered to your inbox. " [:br.hidden.md:inline]
       "Chosen specifically for you with machine learning."]
      [:a.btn.btn-green.btn-block.sm:max-w-sm.mx-auto
       {:href "/signup"}
       "Sign up"]
      ...
</code></pre><p>This project is the first time I've used <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">Tailwind CSS</a> (I used Bootstrap previously). I give it two thumbs up. Tailwind gives you smaller, better building blocks than Bootstrap, and it has responsive variants for every class (hallelujah). Setup was straightforward. After an <code>npm init; npm install tailwindcss --save-dev</code>, you just need a few files:</p><p><code>tailwind.config.js</code>:</p><pre><code>module.exports = {
  purge: [
    './src/**/*.clj', // for tree-shaking
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        'dark': '#343a40',
        'hn-orange': '#ff6600',
        ...
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre><p><code>tailwind.css</code>:</p><pre><code>@tailwind base;

@tailwind components;
@responsive {
  .btn-thin {
    @apply text-center py-2 px-4 rounded;
  }
  .btn {
    @apply btn-thin font-bold;
  }
  ...
}

@tailwind utilities;
@responsive {
  .nunito-sans-bold {
    font-family: 'Nunito Sans', sans-serif;
    font-weight : 900;
  }
  ...
}
</code></pre><p>Build with <code>npx tailwindcss build tailwind.css -o output.css</code>.</p><p>The last piece is fonts. I am not a designer, at all. Despite this, I have recently made a startling discovery: using different fonts, instead of just the default, can actually make your site look a lot better. It turns out you can just doom scroll through <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a> until you find some you like. I did that for Findka's logo (I tried AI logo generators in the past, but they weren't good).</p><h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3><p>Findka supports signin via email link or Google. Biff mostly handles email link auth for you.
Just make a form with an <code>email</code> field that POSTs to <code>/api/signup</code>. Biff sends the user an email with a link, they click on it, boom. You have to provide an email template and a function that actually sends the email. I use Mailgun, so Findka's email function looks like this:</p><pre><code>(def templates
  {:biff.auth/signup
   (fn [{:keys [biff.auth/link]}]
     {:from "Findka Essays &lt;...&gt;"
      :subject "Create your Findka Essays account"
      :html (rum/render-static-markup
              [:div
               [:p "We received a request to create a Findka Essays account using this email address."]
               [:p [:a {:href link :target "_blank"} "Click here to create your account."]]
               [:p "If you did not request this link, you can ignore this email."]])})
   ...})

(defn send** [api-key opts]
  (http/post (str "https://api.mailgun.net/v3/mail.findka.com/messages")
    {:basic-auth ["api" api-key]
     :form-params opts}))

(defn send* [{:keys [mailgun/api-key template data] :as opts}]
  (if (some? template)
    (let [template-fn (get templates template)
          mailgun-opts (template-fn data)]
      (send** api-key mailgun-opts))
    (send** api-key (select-keys opts [:to :subject :text :html]))))

(defn send [{:keys [params template recaptcha/secret-key] :as sys}]
  (if (= template :biff.auth/signup)
    (let [{:keys [success score]}
          (:body
            (http/post "https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/siteverify"
              {:form-params {:secret secret-key
                             :response (:g-recaptcha-response params)}
               :as :json}))]
      (when (and success (&lt;= 0.5 score))
        (send* sys)))
    (send* sys)))
</code></pre><p>As shown at the end, I use Recaptcha for bot control. It's nice because you
don't have to make the user do anything; Google's script will simply give you a
score that represents how likely the user is to be a human.</p><p>Biff doesn't have Google sign-in support built in (yet), but it's pretty simple to add.
After the front-end bit is taken care of, you just have to add an HTTP endpoint that receives
a token, verifies it using Google's library, and sets a session cookie.</p><p>That's sort of a funny way to use Google sign-in, I'll admit. You're "supposed" to send the token
with every request and verify it each time, letting Google's code handle sessions on the client.
However, Biff is already set up for authenticating requests via session cookie, and that's more convenient for multi-page applications anyway.</p><h3 id="crud">CRUD</h3><p>I use <a href="https://opencrux.com/" target="_blank">Crux</a> for the database. Crux is an immutable document database with datalog queries. Another way to explain it is that Crux works well as a general-purpose database (e.g. a replacement for postgres), but it fits better with functional programming. You also get flexible data modeling without giving up query power.</p><p>(That ignores Crux's raison d'être, bitemporal queries—a cool feature, and no doubt extremely useful if you need those. For my simple applications, I haven't.)</p><p>Crux doesn't enforce any schema, but Biff does. You can specify schema using <a href="https://clojure.org/about/spec" target="_blank">Clojure spec</a>:</p><pre><code>(require '[trident.util :as u])

(u/sdefs
  ::event-type #{:submit :email :click :like :dislike}
  ::timestamp  inst?
  ::url        string?
  ::parent     uuid?
  ::user       uuid?
  ::event      (u/only-keys
                 :req-un [::event-type
                          ::timestamp
                          ::user
                          ::url]
                 :opt-un [::parent]))

(def schema
  {:events {:spec [uuid? ::event]}})
</code></pre><p>This schema defines a "table" for events. The <code>[uuid? ::event]</code> part means that
the primary key for an event document should be a UUID, and the rest of the
document should conform to the spec given for <code>::event</code> above. In this case,
that means the document must have an event type, timestamp, user ID and URL,
and it can optionally have a "parent" key (which is set to the primary key of
another event).</p><p>Like a standard multi-page app, Findka has POST endpoints for writing to
the database and GET endpoints for reading (though I have no idea if the
endpoints adhere to REST or not). Here's one for submitting an essay:</p><pre><code>(defn submit-essay [{:keys [biff/node session/uid params] :as sys}]
  (if (nil? uid)
    {:status 302
     :headers/Location "/login/"}
    (do
      (crux/await-tx node
        (biff.crux/submit-tx sys
          {[:events] {:user uid
                      :timestamp :db/current-time
                      :event-type :submit
                      :url (:url params)}}))
      {:status 302
       :headers/Location "/settings"})))

(def routes
  [["/api/submit-essay"
   {:post submit-essay
    :name ::submit-essay
    :middleware [anti-forgery/wrap-anti-forgery]}]
   ...])
</code></pre><p>And here's a snippet from the <code>/settings</code> page. The call to <code>crux/q</code> performs
a datalog query which returns the current user's 10 most recent events, which
are displayed in the UI:</p><pre><code>(defn settings* [{:keys [biff/db session/uid]}]
  (let [events (map first
                 (crux/q db
                   {:find '[event timestamp]
                    :full-results? true
                    :args [{'user uid}]
                    :order-by '[[timestamp :desc]]
                    :limit 10
                    :where '[[event :event-type]
                             …</code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>PR, or Public Relations, is just the process of getting people to write article about you. The type of press you can get does vary beyond that though.</p><p>It could be podcast interviews, it could be getting featured in a magazine or the newspaper, it could be getting on television for a local news channel.</p><p>But the process is relatively the same to get new press. You have a good story, and you pitch it to news sources. Before you pitch it to larger news sources like TechCrunch or WIRED you need to make a proof of concept. Most of the successful press pitches I've seen have used an existing piece of content almost as if to prove the story is interesting.</p><p>So you get that flagship smaller article, or a decent podcast interview, and then you email it to reporters at bigger publications to see if they'll pick it up.</p><p>But before you do that, you've got to get that flagship content. In my case, I do a lot of stuff on social media, and I connect with a lot of podcast hosts since I have my own show. Then, I emailed a local news outlet in the business space with the podcast link and a simple description. It helps that I've spoken with the reporter I pitched, as well. I had recommended her a few different people already for other articles she was writing, and so she knew me before I sent that request.</p><p>So, recommend other awesome companies or entrepreneurs you know, and then a little while later, pitch yourself with a podcast episode or personal article. Hopefully you'll get that first bit of press, and you can use it to scale.</p><p>Now let's say you have your first piece of content, article or otherwise, and you want to pitch it to larger publications - you'll need to target specific writers. Scroll through the articles each news outlet has published in the past, find a series they do, or a common thread, and for each article that seems to relate to your story, keep track of the author. If you find a common author among a few articles similar to the story you want to pitch, they're your point person.</p><p>Now, you'll likely want to pitch them over email, and if it's not immediately listed on the website, you can use <a href="https://hunter.io/">Hunter.io</a> to find it 95% of the time. I <a href="https://youtu.be/8UP8DiCMCDU">filmed a little guide</a> a long time ago on how I personally do it. </p><p>Great, now you have content about your story and a list of people that might be interested. That's all you need, just send a few incredibly short emails and hope. A lot of the successful press pitches I've seen look something like this:</p><p>"Hello [name],</p><p>There's a new startup helping dog owners get connected to local dog walkers and it seems to be solving a really big problem. I noticed you report on this kind of tech so I figured I would reach out.</p><p>Here's a link to an article recently written on it: [link]</p><p>I run the startup, and I would be happy to talk about what we're trying to solve if an interview is something you would be interested in!"</p><p>That's it - as simple as possible. Reporters are getting pitched all day. Make sure the topic is right in their wheelhouse, and make sure you keep the email short as hell so they can read it super quick. I'm not entirely sure what timing would be appropriate, but if I want someone to respond to an email I send it Tuesday morning, so it's at the top of their inbox when they get to work and they already cleared the weekend backlog on Monday.</p></div></div>]]>

  <p>Yesterday I <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/mugshot-bot">launched Mugshot Bot on Product Hunt</a> as a solo founder. It was a wild ride and I’ve never been glued to my computer like this.</p>

<p>The launch finished with with over 250 upvotes, 39 comments, and #5 Product of the Day. It generated close to 1000 visits, over 70 sign ups, and 6 paying customers.</p>

<p>I even got a cute little badge from Product Hunt!</p>

<p>Here’s my journey on what worked, what didn’t work, and things I wish I spent more time on. I’m not guaranteeing following these will make your launch a success. But hopefully you can pick up a tip or two.</p>

<p>Oh, and for newcomers, <a href="https://www.mugshotbot.com/">Mugshot Bot</a> is a tool that automates link preview images for your website without design tools.</p>

<h2 id="what-worked">What worked</h2>

<p>The single biggest contributor to the success of this Product Hunt launch was the work done, well, before the launch.</p>

<h3 id="build-in-public">Build in public</h3>

<p>First, I’ve been building Mugshot Bot in public, sharing progress as it happens. Almost every day for the past two months I’ve tweeted about a new feature, an idea, design progress, or a question.</p>

<p>Anything worth elaborating on (but not quite long enough for a blog post) I’ve been posting to <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/joemasilotti">Indie Hackers</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve also been very active in the <a href="https://www.weekendclub.co/">Weekend Club</a> community on Slack. Shout out to <a href="https://twitter.com/charlierward">Charlie</a> for running an amazing community.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Weekend Club is a weekend co-working community and a very supportive Slack group. Mention <code>WEEKENDJOE</code> when you sign up for a free month.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All of my metrics are <a href="https://www.mugshotbot.com/stats/">publicly available</a>, too: total visitors, registered accounts, MRR, etc.</p>

<h3 id="get-early-upvotes">Get early upvotes</h3>

<p>You only get one day on Product Hunt, and those <a href="https://blog.producthunt.com/how-to-launch-on-product-hunt-7c1843e06399">24 hours are based on the Pacific time zone</a>. Ideally, you are launching early in the morning so you can maximize your time for upvotes.</p>

<p>I’m in Eastern time and didn’t want to get up at 3am to start promoting my post. Instead, I had someone in London help me out.</p>

<p>Shout out to <a href="https://twitter.com/jmckinven">James</a> for getting the ball rolling. He shared the post with other indie hackers and makers in his circle which bumped the post right from the get-go.</p>

<h3 id="live-tweet">Live tweet</h3>

<p>About five seconds after I woke up I <a href="https://twitter.com/joemasilotti/status/1320674419077910530">tweeted a link</a> to the Product Hunt post. I followed up on every milestone, every mishap, and every little victory.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/joemasilotti/status/1320674419077910530">
  <img src="https://masilotti.com/images/mugshotbot-tweet-thread.png" alt="Beginning of Twitter thread about Product Hunt launch">
  </a>
</p>

<p>I also pinned the tweet to my profile and set my URL to the Product Hunt page for the day.</p>

<p>In total, the tweet received 7500 impressions and a whopping 500 engagements. I replied to <a href="https://twitter.com/joemasilotti/status/1320674419077910530">the thread</a> 20 times.</p>

<p>This was where people showed their excitement. If you click through the thread there’s a ton of people interacting with me, letting me know they upvoted, and just being generally awesome.</p>

<p>It was a highlight of the day for me to connect directly with people about Mugshot Bot on Twitter.</p>

<p>Shout out to <a href="https://twitter.com/panphora">David</a> for this idea and for providing a <em>ton</em> of feedback while building Mugshot Bot.</p>

<h3 id="be-genuine">Be genuine</h3>

<p>Product Hunt has a strict policy against asking for upvotes. Instead, they recommend asking folks to “check out the page.”</p>

<p>What worked well for me was being genuine. I wanted support from my audience so that’s what I asked for. “I would love if you could show me some support” seemed to resonate.</p>

<p>I also called out in my <a href="https://twitter.com/joemasilotti/status/1320674419077910530">initial tweet</a> that I was nervous. This was met with a lot of positive reinforcement from folks that went a long way towards ending the day feeling great.</p>

<h2 id="what-didnt-work">What didn’t work</h2>

<p>Not every second of my launch day was productive. Here are some things that I tried but didn’t seem to help very much.</p>

<h3 id="engaging-out-of-target-audiences">Engaging out-of-target audiences</h3>

<p>A big portion of my Twitter followers are indie makers, developers, and/or bloggers. Mugshot Bot helps content creators and hackers the most, so there’s a ton of overlap.</p>

<p>That isn’t the case for my Facebook audience. Most of these folks are friends from high school and college. I’ll also be the first to admit I don’t post on Facebook much anymore.</p>

<p>The takeaway is to pick the audience that matters and focus on that instead of spreading yourself too thin.</p>

<h3 id="email-campaign-asking-for-support">Email campaign asking for support</h3>

<p>This one surprised me the most. Before the launch I had about 100 registered accounts. I sent an email letting them know about the importance of the Product Hunt launch and asking for support.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, only 9 people clicked through the Product Hunt post. Here’s the email, if you’re interested.</p>

<p><img src="https://masilotti.com/images/product-hunt-launch-email.jpeg" alt="Screenshot of email campaign announcing Product Hunt launch"></p>

<p>Looking back, I can’t tell if these folks didn’t care enough or my messaging was off. Probably a combination of the two!</p>

<h3 id="twitter-ads">Twitter ads</h3>

<p>As soon as I got my first new customer I set up a Twitter campaign for the same amount. I focused on getting clicks to the Product Hunt post and promoted the first post in the Twitter thread.</p>

<p>I cancelled the campaign after two hours.</p>

<p>In 2 hours I received 2 clicks. For $15. This might make sense for a direct acquisition channel, but $7.50 per click was nowhere near worth it for potential upvotes.</p>

<h3 id="obsessively-refresh-metrics">Obsessively refresh metrics</h3>

<p>In the spirit of building in public all of <a href="https://www.mugshotbot.com/stats/">Mugshot Bot’s metrics are publicly available</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mugshotbot.com/stats">
  <img src="https://masilotti.com/images/mugshotbot-stats.png" alt="Mugshot Bot public metrics">
  </a>
</p>

<p>I probably refreshed this page over 100 times throughout the day. Sure, there were a few dopamine hits when a number spiked. But overall, it was a waste of time.</p>

<p>Metrics are important but being glued to them is a dangerous habit.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-wish-id-also-done">What I wish I’d also done</h2>

<p>There’s only so many hours the day. But here are a few things that I wish I carved out some extra time for.</p>

<h3 id="post-to-indie-hackers">Post to Indie Hackers</h3>

<p>Early last week I posted to Indie Hackers documenting <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/my-prep-for-a-product-hunt-launch-on-monday-66f2757c1f">everything I did for seven days leading up to the launch</a>. It was really fun to update this throughout the week.</p>

<p>But for some reason I completely forgot to post on launch day! I think this could have strummed up a bit more excitement but nothing getting too upset over.</p>

<p>You could post in the <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/group/product-launch">Product Launch</a>  or <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/group/product-hunt">Product Hunt</a> groups, they both have about 150 members.</p>

<h3 id="fine-tune-a-welcome-e-mail">Fine-tune a welcome e-mail</h3>

<p>Late in the day I added a click-to-tweet link to the welcome email to people who have signed up for Mugshot Bot. A few people used it, too!</p>

<p>The link uses Twitter intents to automatically prompt a drafted tweet with populated content. I used <a href="https://tech.cymi.org/tweet-intents">Twitter Intent Creator</a> to generate the link.</p>

<p>In hindsight, I wish I added this earlier in the day to capitalize on some more reach.</p>

<h2 id="your-product-hunt-launch">Your Product Hunt launch</h2>

<p>That’s everything that I learned during my first big Product Hunt launch. I hope you picked up a tip or two for your launch!</p>

<p>My tl;dr is to build an audience before your launch. Without this you’ll be fighting an uphill battle.</p>

<p>If you used this post to help your launch I’d love to hear about it. <a href="https://twitter.com/joemasilotti/status/1321129876938649600">Reply to this tweet</a> or <a href="mailto:joe@masilotti.com">send me an email</a> and we can talk shop.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I started learning Python in 2009, and I had a pretty challenging task and somewhat unusual use of Python. I was working on a desktop application that used PyQT for GUI and Python as the main language.</p><p>To hide the code, I embedded Python interpreter into a standalone Windows executable. There are a lot of solutions to do so (e.g. <a href="https://www.pyinstaller.org/">pyinstaller</a>, <a href="https://www.py2exe.org/">pyexe</a>), and they all work similarly. They compile your Python scripts to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-bytecode">bytecode</a> files and bundle them with an interpreter into an executable. Compiling scripts down to bytecode makes it harder for people with bad intentions to get the source code and crack or hack your software. Bytecode has to be extracted from the executable and decompiled. It can also produce obfuscated code that is much harder to understand.</p><p><img src="https://rushter.com/static/uploads/img/code_isolation.svg"></p><p>At one point, I wanted to add a plugin system so that users could benefit from extra features. Executing arbitrary third-party code on your server is dangerous. But can it harm your commercial product when you execute it on user's machines, and users have trust in that they are executing? At that time, the answer was not obvious, and I decided to implement the system.</p><p>A few years later, it became apparent that you should <strong>never</strong> execute third-party code using the same Python process (interpreter) if you don't want to leak the source code. There are a lot of commercial products that use Python for desktop software or as a <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/AppsWithPythonScripting">scripting language</a>. Some of them can be at risk.</p><p>There are many ways to extract Python bytecode even if you don't run any third-party code. It's a never-ending arms race between developers and reverse engineers, but it's much easier to extract the bytecode and crack your program when you can run your own code. My software was later cracked without using the plugins subsystem.</p><p>So what can you do to the "host" code when it executes your scripts?</p><p>Python is a very dynamic language, and you can do a lot of things. This article demonstrates a few approaches on how to modify or extract the source code.</p><blockquote><p>When you work with a regular Python process, you don't even need a plugins system. You can always <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/DebuggingWithGdb">attach to a running</a> process using GDB and inject your own code.</p></blockquote><h2>Monkey patching</h2><p>If a plugin can be initialized before a function that you want to modify, we can simply mock it.</p><p>Let's suppose we have a function that validates license:</p><div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>validate_license</span><span>():</span>
    <span>hw_hash</span><span>,</span> <span>hw_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_hardware_id</span><span>()</span>

Python modules and class definition use frames too. That is a building block of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack">call stack</a>.</p><p>Given a frame object, you can:</p><ul><li>Change locals, globals, and builtins at runtime.</li><li>Get bytecode of a function (code block) that is being executed.</li></ul><p>Here is how you can list all frames in the current call stack:</p><div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>list_frames</span><span>():</span>

For example, the path to callback can be defined in the settings file.</p><div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>get_amount</span><span>():</span>

</code></pre></div><h4>Fast locals</h4><p>In Python, local and global variables are stored in dictionaries. Every time you use a variable, Python needs to lookup it in a dictionary. Since dictionary lookups are not free and take time, Python uses various optimization techniques.</p><p>By analyzing the code of a function, it's possible to detect variable names that a function will be using when running. Our function has three local variables: <code>amount</code>, <code>user</code>, <code>logger</code>. Function arguments are local variables too.</p><p>When compiling source code to bytecode, Python maps known variable names to indexes in a special array and stores them there. Accessing a variable by an index is fast, and most of the functions use predefined names. Optimized variables are called <code>fast locals</code>. To keep variable names that are generated on the go, Python uses a dictionary as a fallback.</p><p>When dereferencing variables, Python prioritizes fast locals and ignores changes in the dictionary. That's why we use <code>ctypes</code> and call internal <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/cb9879b948a19c9434316f8ab6aba9c4601a8173/Objects/frameobject.c#L1148"><code>PyFrame_LocalsToFast</code></a> function.</p><h2>Patching bytecode</h2><p>I have an article on <a href="https://rushter.com/blog/python-bytecode-patch/">bytecode patching</a> that describes how to patch function definition. We can go even further and patch a running function.</p><p>Instead of source code, Python interpreter executes bytecode that was generated using a special compiler. When executing the code, a special virtual machine executes each instruction one by one. That allows us to replace unexecuted instructions on the go.</p><p>Let's use this function as an example:</p><div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>is_valid</span><span>():</span>

Unfortunately, we can't modify the <code>frame.f_code.co_code</code> attribute since it's a read-only attribute.</p><p>To bypass this restriction, we use <code>ctypes</code> module that allows us to modify the RAM of a Python process. Every <code>bytes</code> object contains meta-information, such as <a href="https://rushter.com/blog/python-garbage-collector/">number of references</a> and information about the type.

</code></pre></div><p>Fortunately (or unfortunately for some people), there is no easy way to extract the bytecode of a whole module if you don't have a <code>pyc</code> (bytecode cache) file. If you want to get the source code from a running Python process, you will need to extract the bytecode of each function, class, and module definitions as well as from some frame objects. After that, you will need to run it through one of the <a href="https://github.com/rocky/python-decompile3">decompilers</a>.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>This article is a part of <a href="https://rushter.com/blog/tags/cpython/">CPython internals</a> series. It's hard to find a practical application to these techniques, but such language details are useful for people who perform security research or participate in CTF competitions. My previous articles on bytecode have helped people to get extra points in security competitions.</p></div></div>]]>

<h2>OberonScript</h2>
<p>Oberon Script is a scripting language and runtime system for building interactive Web Client applications. It consists of a compiler that translates the full Oberon language into JavaScript code, and a small runtime system that detects and compiles at load-time script sections written in Oberon Script.</p>
<p>It is a complete re-implementation from scratch of an earlier compiler that I built
while being with <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Research</a>
in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge">Cambridge</a>. For legal reasons I was unable to take the code with me
but I cleared the code by MSR's legal department for publication via <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/research/downloads/default.aspx">Microsoft Research's code posting tool</a>.
However, I left MSR before completing the process, hence the complete rewrite.</p>
<h3>Code</h3>
<p>The code of the compiler is available in its current, far from final version in source code (obviously...) for personal,
non-commercial and non-governmental use. The usual disclaimers apply.</p>
<p>A very minimal documentation is also available. I may merge it some time with the prettyprinted HTML version below.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Most people don’t practice taking ideas seriously. I think it’s because most people don’t know how to. I didn’t either, until I stumbled upon an implication.</p>

<p>For example, what would it mean to take compounding seriously?</p>

<p>Ugh. I can feel your aversion. You’ve already heard so much about compounding, how it works, how it’s the eight wonder of the world, etc. etc.</p>

<p>But, familiarity is not the same as taking it seriously.</p>

<p>Say you start with $100, and every year, make 10% more. This compounds, since the extra money is a function of how much you already have. The more you have, the more you get. It’s a positive loop that keeps on increasing.</p>

<p>That’s the familiar interpretation. The earlier you start, the more money you’ll make.</p>

<p>To take this interpretation seriously would mean investing your earnings for a similar return. <a href="http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reality has a surprising amount of detail</a>, and sometimes assumptions break. You don’t make 10% - which means you need to balance your investments somehow. That makes things complicated. However, this complication is not related to compounding.</p>

<p>Taking compounding seriously means taking it a step further. Your net worth is just one implication. What else compounds?</p>

<p>Your life experiences and knowledge. What would it mean to leverage compounding here?</p>

<p>If you’re taking compounding seriously, you’d learn the skills with the greatest return first. That means learning the broadest applicable skills you’d apply throughout your life first. That means learning how to think well - before learning the new fancy tech you want to learn.</p>

<p>Of course, sometimes you need a medium to learn the skill better. That makes sense: learn to think well via this new tech you wanted to learn. <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/3HyeNiEpvbQQaqeoH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Purposes are fragile</a> though, and it’s easy to get lost in the tool, instead of the overall goal.</p>

</figure>

<p>What makes this example so good is that you’re probably very familiar with compounding. What else are you familiar with, but haven’t realised you’re not taking seriously?</p>

<p>A good way to practice this is to ask this question: What are the implications of (idea) in (field of interest)?</p>

<p>For example, asking myself What are the implications of compounding for my self-directed knowledge base led to the above insight of learning broader skills first.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p><time datetime="2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z">October 1, 2020  · 6 min read</time></p><div><p><a href="https://twitter.com/PhelanEnda" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/11743717?s=460&amp;u=3fd43aed3b4b8eb706fed5719e179d23c9c47eb1&amp;v=4" alt="Enda Phelan"></a></p></div></header><section><p>We are excited to announce the <strong>official release of Graphback 1.0</strong>! This release is the end result of the amazing work and collaboration between the Graphback team and our community. </p><p>To each and every one of you who helped by using Graphback and providing us with invaluable feedback, and to those who contributed in code and issues - thank you! You are all stars, and we would not have gotten here without you.</p><h2>What is Graphback?</h2><p>Graphback is a Node.js runtime framework and toolkit to generate a production-ready GraphQL project. Graphback is a core extension of the GraphQL CLI, used to generate a set of queries, mutations and subscriptions for each of your data models and connects to the database of your choice, allowing you to focus on the business objectives of your application.</p><p><img alt="Graphback logo" src="https://graphback.dev/assets/images/logo-df65e28e87b32b8790bc7436dbeb52b6.png"></p><p>The generated API layer follows the <a href="https://graphqlcrud.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GraphQL CRUD</a> specification developed by the GraphQL community, providing a common pattern for querying your data, and enables interoperability between GraphQL libraries which also adopt these patterns.</p><p>On top of the core framework, Graphback comes with a number of additional utility libraries which can optionally be used to aid development, like GraphQL Migrations for automatic database migration from your schema, and GraphQL Serve to instantly start up a Graphback API in-memory from the command-line.</p><h2>Why not ${otherGraphqlLibrary} instead?</h2><p>But, you might ask, why not some other library instead? The GraphQL ecosystem is evolving quickly, with a growing number of frameworks and libraries. Why should I choose Graphback and GraphQL CLI?</p><h3>No vendor lock-in</h3><p>The open design of Graphback and GraphQL CLI means there will be no vendor lock-in. You have full control over your code and you can easily extend, customise and replace to suit your use cases.</p><h3>Open Source, forever</h3><p>Graphback is, and always will be, 100% open source. We actively work with and use feedback from our awesome community to help drive Graphback in the right direction, and will continue to do so forever more.</p><h3>Committed to improving the GraphQL ecosystem</h3><p>One of our main philosophies is to ensure Graphback coexists and works with as many other GraphQL libraries and standards as possible, improving the overall experience for developers. Some of the libraries that Graphback works with:</p><ul><li><a href="https://graphql-cli.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GraphQL CLI</a> - Graphback helps to power the GraphQL CLI</li><li><a href="https://www.graphql-tools.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GraphQL Tools</a></li><li><a href="https://graphql-config.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GraphQL Config</a></li><li><a href="https://graphql-code-generator.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GraphQL Code Generator</a></li><li><a href="https://graphqlcrud.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GraphQL CRUD</a> - an open specification for common operations on top of GraphQL</li></ul><h3>Easy to use, easier to stay</h3><p>We tried to make Graphback as easy to use as possible. Whether you are highly experienced with GraphQL, or Graphback is your first venture into the world of GraphQL, we wanted to make it easy for you to add Graphback to your project and get up and running. You can bootstrap your server with Graphback through a couple of programmatic APIs.</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> buildGraphbackAPI</span><span>,</span><span> createCRUDService </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'graphback'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> createKnexDbProvider </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'@graphback/runtime-knex'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>PubSub</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'graphql-subscriptions'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>Knex</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'knex'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>const</span><span> db </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Knex</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> typeDefs</span><span>,</span><span> resolvers</span><span>,</span><span> contextCreator </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>buildGraphbackAPI</span><span>(</span><span>modelDefs</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  serviceCreator</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>createCRUDService</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> pubSub</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>PubSub</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span>  dataProviderCreator</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>createKnexDbProvider</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>const</span><span> apolloServer </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>ApolloServer</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  typeDefs</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  resolvers</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  context</span><span>:</span><span> contextCreator</span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><h3>GraphQL CRUD out of the box</h3><p>The Graphback team is a founding contributor of the GraphQL CRUD specification.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p><span>Do you have "exceptional communication skills"? Well, it is a requirement in every product manager job description. Writing is a core part of a PM's job. Be it emails, documents, status updates. </span></p> <p><span>In this article, I distilled the principles and tactics collected from masters of the craft of writing in various domains. If it sounds too simple or basic, that means I've done my job.</span></p> <p><span>Enjoy.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Keep It Simple</span></h3></p> <p><span>In written communication at work, your objectives are clarity and persuasion. If you remember just one thing from this post: keep it simple. </span></p> <p><span>In the words of </span> <a href="https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/06/the_day_you_bec.html" target="_blank"><span>Scott Adams</span></a> <span>: </span> <em>"A good argument in five sentences will sway more people than a brilliant argument in a hundred sentences. Don’t fight it."</em></p> <p><span>Style is a small part of writing well, especially in a work setting. Focus on getting your point across.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Miscommunication is Costly</span></h3></p> <p><span>Miscommunication is costly. And the reader likely </span> <em>won't tell you</em> <strong> </strong> <span>if they don't understand what you are saying. They will just ignore it, or interpret it the way they think is right. As the saying goes, "it's not what you say, it's what people hear".</span></p> <p><span>You can't persuade someone if they don't even understand you. Worse yet, misunderstanding among your stakeholders can lead to the wrong product being built. And that is expensive.</span></p> <p><span>Make your point as easy as possible to understand. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Help the Reader Out</span></h3></p> <p><span>Everyone is busy. That's why people are much more likely to skim than to peruse your writing. </span></p> <p><span>Make your writing easy to parse. Optimize the content for scanning. Break up your walls of text, because no one will read them. Use more bullet points, whitespace, and clear headings.</span></p> <p><span>Just get your point across. And help your stakeholders move on with their day. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Use Simple Words</span></h3></p> <p><span>Avoid words that would require the reader to reach for the dictionary, because most won't. And when they don't understand the word, they either skip it or guess it. </span></p> <p><span>Your job isn't to sound smart or write poetry. Your job is to communicate effectively to ship successful products.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Use Fewer Words</span></h3></p> <p><span>Write with an eraser in hand. Messages with fewer words are easier to understand.</span></p> <p><span>In the words of George Orwell: "if it is possible to cut a word out always cut it out."</span></p> <p><span>Examples of words to cut out: "really", "very", "amazing", and adjectives in general. Chances are, the additional words won't add to your point. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Use Short Sentences</span></h3></p> <p><span>Don't put more than one idea in each sentence. One sign that you are doing this wrong is having run-on sentences with lots of commas. To combat that, try using a period where you would normally use a comma.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Use Visuals</span></h3></p> <p><span>Include visuals in your written communication where possible. Paint a vivid picture for the reader. This could mean diagrams, charts, or even sketches that illustrate your point.</span></p> <p><span>It both makes your message easier to understand, and it is </span> <a href="https://informedpm.com/posts/persuasion-product-manager" target="_blank"><span>more persuasive</span></a> <span>. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Order Matters</span></h3></p> <p><span>In written communication, you present a sequence of ideas in a particular order. And that order matters.</span></p> <p><span>Make your point early on. Your first sentence or two should grab the reader. Because again, people are busy. Is this something they would want to keep reading? </span></p> <p><span>The order also affects how the reader's brain understands the message. As a rule of thumb, we are faster at understanding active voice than passive voice in English. </span></p> <p><span>Once you are done writing, re-read it (preferably aloud) to check the flow.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Provide Context</span></h3></p> <p><span>As the reader reads your writing, one thought question that they always have is "Why should I care?" The answer to that question should be clear. Establish this early.</span></p> <p><span>Hyperlinks are helpful for packing more context to your writing without taking up additional space. Link to shared documents where possible in case your stakeholders need more information. This saves some back-and-forth questions and keeps the source of truth easier to maintain.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Repeat the Important Points</span></h3></p> <p><span>Because the reader is likely to skim, repeat the important points in case they missed them. And the down-side is limited. When the reader scans something they already read, they will just filter it out.</span></p> <p><span>The repetition doesn't need to take place in the same document either. You can repeat in the form of follow-ups, reminders, summaries etc.</span></p> <p><span>As a bonus side effect, repetition is </span> <a href="https://informedpm.com/posts/persuasion-product-manager" target="_blank"><span>persuasive</span></a> <span>. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Bold Words, Sparingly</span></h3></p> <p><span>Use contrast to make the key pieces of information pop, by bolding or highlighting keywords. This makes your writing easier to scan. </span></p> <p><span>Don't overdo it though. If everything is important, nothing is.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Further Readings</span></h3></p>

			<p>Administrators can use teams policies for controlling what users can do in Microsoft Teams.</p>

<p>In this blog, I’ll show that these policies are applied only in client and thus can be easily bypassed.</p>





<p>Policies are used in Microsoft Office 365 and Azure AD for securing access to services and data. Besides the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/identity-access-policies?view=o365-worldwide" target="_blank">common identity and device access policies</a>,
Microsoft has provided a set of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/teams-access-policies?view=o365-worldwide" target="_blank">Teams specific policies</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Teams and channel policies</li>
<li>Messaging policies</li>
<li>Meeting policies</li>
<li>App permission policies</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, administrators can configure Teams so that external users are not able to edit or delete any messages they’ve sent. Or, an owner of a Teams site can disable message editing for members of a certain channel.</p>



<h2 id="initial-discovery">Initial discovery</h2>

<p>While I was working with the previous version (v0.4.4) of <a href="https://o365blog.com/aadinternals" target="_blank">AADInternals</a> Teams functions I noticed an interesting thing: I was able to edit and delete chat messages using AADInternals as a guest
even when it was not allowed.</p>

<p>This led to a question that <strong>what if the policies are applied only at the client end?</strong> In practice this would mean that the Teams service tells to your Teams client that “Though shall not edit messages!” but the client
could still do so.</p>

<h2 id="observing-teams-client-behaviour">Observing Teams client behaviour</h2>

<p>I started by watching what was going on between the client and cloud when the Teams client started. The first observation was that the client made about 120 http requests to the cloud.
While browsing through those requests, I spotted one that caught my interest (headers stripped):</p>

<pre><code>POST https://teams.microsoft.com/api/mt/part/emea-02/beta/users/useraggregatesettings HTTP/1.1

{
    "tenantSettingsV2": true,
    "userResourcesSettings": true,
    "messagingPolicy": true,
    "clientSettings": true,
    "targetingPolicy": true,
    "tenantSiteUrl": true,
    "userPropertiesSettings": true,
    "callingPolicy": true,
    "meetingPolicy": true,
    "educationAssignmentsAppPolicy": true
}
</code></pre>

<p>The response contained all the settings and policies the Teams client is allowed to do as the logged in user. Below can be seen the <strong>messagingPolicy</strong> section:
</p><div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span></span><span>"messagingPolicy"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>"value"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>"allowUserEditMessage"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowUserDeleteMessage"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowUserChat"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowGiphy"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"giphyRatingType"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Moderate"</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowGiphyDisplay"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowPasteInternetImage"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowMemes"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowStickers"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowUserTranslation"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowUrlPreviews"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"readReceiptsEnabledType"</span><span>:</span> <span>"UserPreference"</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowImmersiveReader"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowPriorityMessages"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"audioMessageEnabledType"</span><span>:</span> <span>"ChatsAndChannels"</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"channelsInChatListEnabledType"</span><span>:</span> <span>"DisabledUserOverride"</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowRemoveUser"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowSmartReply"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>What we can learn here is that the Teams client asks from the cloud what the current user is allowed to do, which was the expected behaviour.</p>

<h2 id="testing-in-action">Testing in action</h2>

<p>Next I decided to try whether I could lie to Teams client:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I saved the response from above to be used as a baseline.</p></li>

<li><div><p>I created a new Messaging policy to disable editing and deleting of sent messages.</p><p>
I applied the policy to a single demo user:</p><p>
<img src="https://o365blog.com/images/posts/teams-policies1.png" alt="Custom policy"></p><p>Now I had two policies, the default organisation wide and the restricted one for demo user:</p><p>
<img src="https://o365blog.com/images/posts/teams-policies2.png" alt="Policies"></p></div></li>

<li><p>I restarted the Teams client and noticed that the editing and deleting were correctly disabled (didn’t exists).</p></li>

<li><div><p>I compared the returned policies from the <strong>useraggregatesettings</strong> requests<br>
and as we can see, the request was missing two lines:</p><p>
<img src="https://o365blog.com/images/posts/teams-policies3.png" alt="Policy comparison"></p></div></li>

<li><div><p>I closed the client and configured Fiddler to do an autoresponse using the saved http response from above:</p><p>
<img src="https://o365blog.com/images/posts/teams-policies4.png" alt="Fiddler autoresponse"></p><p>
Now, when the client is requesting the settings file, it will be served the one that allows editing and deleting.</p></div></li>

<li><p>I started the Teams client and <strong>the editing and deleting were again allowed</strong> and I was able to edit and delete (my own) messages!</p></li>
</ol>

<p>What we can lean here is that <strong>we can lie to Teams client</strong> and change its behaviour 😂 <br>
Moreover, we learnt that <strong>Teams policies are applied only on the client</strong> 🤦‍♂</p>

<p>Here is the video demonstrating this with <strong>AADInternals</strong> and <strong>Fiddler</strong> (sorry for the bad audio after 03:20):</p>

<div><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zcqig-OyUMY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

<p>Below is a video that shows in action that this works also with <strong>cloud file storage restrictions</strong>:<br></p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a32TkLIBwS4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<br><strong>Note:</strong> Although not seen on the video, I was able to add my Google Drive account to Teams so this is not just a UI thing.</p>



<p>As far as I know, the “uncompliant” Teams client behaviour can not be detected.</p>

<p>Same verdict with protecting. Well, one could try to use Conditional Access (CA) with device ownership and compliance restrictions, but that doesn’t cover all scenarios.</p>



<p>Our little test here proves that <strong>Teams policies are applied ONLY on the client!</strong>.</p>

<p>If the user (or guest) is utilising Teams APIs directly, using for instance AADInternals <a href="https://o365blog.com/aadinternals/#teams-functions" target="_blank">Teams functionality</a>, he or she can bypass the restrictions set by the policies.
However, this is not a bug or vulnerability as such, but a (very very bad) design choice by Microsoft.</p>

<p>Users can do at least the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bypass messaging policies</li>
<li>Bypass cloud file storage restrictions</li>
<li>Bypass meetings policies</li>
</ul>

<p>⚠️ <strong>Teams policies are NOT a security measure and organisations should not rely on them!</strong> ⚠️</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Feel Good Inc. by Gorillaz was my first experience with a “virtual band”. Virtual bands, virtual YouTubers, and virtual streamers are all the same concept; the people creating and performing are not the focus. CGI characters are replacing humans, even outside of animation.&nbsp;</p><p>Virtual performers are not new. Alvin and the Chipmunks are the earliest example. Other notable Western examples include Dethklok and Crazy Frog.</p><p>Japan and the East, unsurprisingly, love virtual performers. Hatsune Miku is one of the most popular. She has widely attended live concerts. K/DA is a virtual K-pop group composed of characters from Riot’s League of Legends that has also seen enormous global success.</p><p id="youtube2-YSyWtESoeOc" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;YSyWtESoeOc&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YSyWtESoeOc?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></p><p>Virtual streaming was really kicked off in 2016 by Kizuna AI. Kizuna plays video games just like other streamers, but she is entirely virtual. Body movements are likely motion captured or pre animated. Her voice is a paid actress. She embodies many cutesy anime girl tropes.&nbsp;</p><p>Previously, streaming was dominated by young men on Twitch in the West, which didn’t appeal to Eastern audiences. Japan was already primed because of their penchant for virtual idols. Kizuna likely uses the same freeware, MikuMikuDance, as Hatsune Miku.</p><p id="youtube2-3AK24prZk-k" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;3AK24prZk-k&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3AK24prZk-k?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></p><div><p>The Japanese popularity of virtual streamers has influenced a new generation of Twitch streamers. Streamers like projektmelody (NSFW) and BuffPup do well in their niches. The vast majority of virtual streamers follow the trail blazed by virtual idols and Kizuna AI. Typically they are young female anime avatars that speak Japanese.</p><p>BuffPup stands out. BuffPup is one of the earliest virtual streamers to branch out from its anime roots into furry fandom. I’ll let you look that one up if you’re unfamiliar. Virtual streaming is clearly still in its infancy. Expressiveness of many virtual streamers is lacking, which leaves a huge opportunity for the right tech to push the medium forward. Many fall into uncanny valley territory.</p></div><p><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F488692c5-d040-43fb-b228-79189c0dfe9e_1080x888.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F488692c5-d040-43fb-b228-79189c0dfe9e_1080x888.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/488692c5-d040-43fb-b228-79189c0dfe9e_1080x888.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:888,&quot;width&quot;:1080,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:112162,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></p><div><p>Since Riot is already getting their feet wet with virtual performers, I expect this trend to continue in the industry. Every major publisher will have a virtual version of their characters playing their games, streamed live. Publishers will pay actors to do motion / facial capture as well as live voice. Fans will finally be able to interact directly with their favorite video game characters. This market alone will be enormously profitable, since it can leverage existing live streaming monetization techniques.</p><p>Gaming companies will double down into motion capture and face filter-like technologies. They’ll branch into AI generated voice tech, or acquire it. Once the tech gets there, virtual streaming will be an extremely high margin business, because even the talent will be fully automated. At least in the short and medium term, this will mean more jobs for actors, so that’s a plus.</p></div><p>Stats:</p><ul><li><p>K/DA has over 384 million views on this video</p></li></ul><p id="youtube2-UOxkGD8qRB4" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;UOxkGD8qRB4&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UOxkGD8qRB4?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></p><ul><li><p>Kizuna AI has over 2.8 million subscribers on Youtube and videos with over 14 million views</p></li><li><p>projektmelody (NSFW) has 289,000 followers on Twitch, and routinely has 3,500+ concurrent viewers</p></li><li><p>64+ virtual streamers on Twitch (https://www.twitch.tv/team/antilewdarmy)</p></li></ul></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
  
  
  
  <!-- <time>2020-10-25</time> -->
  


<p><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/">538</a> and the <a href="https://projects.economist.com/us-2020-forecast/president">Economist</a> have both released detailed data from their election forecasts, listing how each state votes in 40,000 simulations of the presidential election. To understand some unusual scenarios from the 538 model, like every state <a href="https://twitter.com/gelliottmorris/status/1300480869082292225">voting for Biden but New Jersey</a>, Andrew Gelman <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/10/24/reverse-engineering-the-problematic-tail-behavior-of-the-fivethirtyeight-presidential-election-forecast/">examined the correlation</a> in the Trump vote share between pairs of several states. </p>
<p>I was curious what the whole universe of pairwise correlations looked like; you can click on a grid cell below to see voting patterns in two states in more detail along with the electoral maps from individual simulation scenarios. In the 538 model, 242 pairs of states are <span>negatively correlated</span>!</p>


<p>Mousing around the edges of the scatter plot pulls out more unusual scenarios, like Trump losing everywhere but <code>CA-HI-VT</code>. </p>
<p>On the correlation matrices, it appears that both models have identified similar groups of states. A scatter plot shows this directly: </p>


<p>Outside of the <code>CA-DC-VT-WA</code> and <code>LA-MS-ND-KY</code> clusters, where the 538 correlation dips below 0, the models are mostly aligned. Glancing over the outliers, it looks like the Economist might not have an equivalent to 538’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-fivethirtyeights-2020-presidential-forecast-works-and-whats-different-because-of-covid-19/">regional regression</a> that groups states in the same geographic region together; the Economist has <code>HI</code> at 0.2 correlation with <code>WA</code> &amp; <code>OR</code>  while 538 has it around 0.7.</p>
<p>Stepping back from the funky correlation charts, comparing the Trump vote share state by state clearly shows a bigger difference between the models: the <span>Economist model</span> considers really surprising outcomes, like Trump decisively winning <code>CA</code>, less likely than the <span>538 model</span>.</p>


<p>I haven’t followed the extensive discussion around election modeling closely enough to have a strong opinion on what all of this means, but it does look like the 538 model is allowing for the <a href="https://twitter.com/Nate_Cohn/status/1320043524771991560">possibility</a> of a broad <a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1300825856072454145">realignment in politics</a>–something you’d want to incorporate when modeling 2024 today, but not plausible for an election next week with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/absentee-ballot-early-voting.html">sixty million ballots</a> already cast.</p>
<div id="notes">
<p>Only 5,000 scenarios are shown on the scatter plots; the scenarios are a snapshot from 2020-10-25 and not updated (looking at the correlations over time might be interesting though!). The rendered electoral college scenarios ignore the possibility of <code>NE</code> or <code>ME</code> spliting their votes. 

</p><p>The correlations matrix orders states by clustering on 538’s correlations. Sorting using the Economist correlations <a href="https://i.imgur.com/JH9FC8I.png">splits up</a> the negative 538 correlations.

<p>The power of networks. Metaphors of our collective life, with all of its complexity and its entangled dependencies.
Two types of networks, the network of data and the network of artificial neurons when combined together open the way to a variety of interesting applications. Typical examples of data networks include social networks and the knowledge graphs, while, on the other hand, a new family of machine learning tasks based on neural networks has grown in the last few years. This lineage of deep learning techniques lay under the umbrella of graph neural networks (GNN) and they can reveal insights hidden in the graph data for classification, recommendation, question answering and for predicting new relations among entities. Do you want to know more about them?</p>
<p>When we talk of machine learning tasks, we refer to a set of algorithms that finds correlation between input and output. The input is basically a list of numbers also known as vectorized features:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Symbol</th>
<th>Vector representation</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>hiking</td>
<td>0.12, 0.25, 0.66, 0.45</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>mountain</td>
<td>0.16, 0.29, 0.62, 0.40</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>seaside</td>
<td>0.02, 0.70, 0.39, 0.60</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The vector representation of the nodes in the knowledge graph should preserve, to the maximum extent, the information carried by the single node within its own attributes compressed in a low dimensional space. In other words, the embeddings (the name of the vectorized representation) should identify the related symbol with a vector, and such vectors should be as small as possible. The objective of this article is about to find a proper way to generate good embeddings out of knowledge graphs.</p>
<p>For being useful in downstream machine learning tasks, embeddings should not just identify the related symbol but also they should have an important property. Symbols that are similar to each other – for whatever criteria we define for ‘similarity’ – should be associated with embeddings that are also similar, according to the favorite distance functions. In the above example, Hiking embeddings are more closely related to Mountain rather than Seaside. Embeddings are very familiar for those practiced in <a href="https://gfrison.com/categories/#nlp">natural language processing</a>, and they are based on the principle <em>“a word is characterized by the company it keeps (R. Firth)”</em>, and the skip-gram technique is employed for predicting what is the most likely word surrounded by a given set of predecessors and successors. Applied to a huge corpora, the trained skip-gram (or its complementary cbow) network will contain the embeddings that fulfill the similarity property. While the words in a text are strictly in sequential order (with one predecessor and one successor), in a graph a node might hold a multitude of relations, and as if that is not enough, those relations might be different one to another.</p>
<p>Representation learning is flourishing and new approaches are invented at an increasing rate:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://gfrison.com/assets/images/gcn/File.jpg" alt="Tecniques for generating embeddings with neural networks">
<figcaption>Tecniques for generating embeddings with neural networks</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Hereafter, I will present just two techniques for generating embeddings in graphs. For the sake of statistics, I implemented Deepwalk and Graph convolutional networks (GCN) in Scala with ND4J for matrices, and Deeplearning4J as a neural network framework.</p>

<p>The Deepwalk (and its successor Node2Vec) is an unsupervised algorithm, one of the first in the realm of representation learning for graphs, and it is as simple in its design as it is effective on capturing topological and content information. In principle it is equivalent to the already mentioned skip-gram, but how can the graph structure match the streaming sequence of words in a text? Starting from any node of choice, the algorithm visits its neighbors and the entire network in a controlled random way. The random walk is balanced among two different approaches that emphasize differences in closely related nodes in one case, and the differences among distant clusters in the other. The first approach is the Breadth First Search (BFS) which selects the next node to visit among the siblings of the current node, in the respect of the previous node. The second approach is the Deep First Search (DFS) that selects the new node among the connected nodes with the current one. The first persists with all neighbors of the current node, while the second tends to explore the network in depth.</p>

</figure>

<p>The graph convolutional networks, as the name might recall, share some commonalities with the convolutional neural network algorithm, the one that led the way to giant leaps in visual recognition. If a graph with nodes and edges is transposed in a two dimensional adjacent matrix, nothing can prevent us from running a sliding window function that compresses a grid of pixels and extracts features like CNNs do. The affinity with CNN ends here, because when we elaborate images we are more interested in complex visual features rather than single pixels. In knowledge graphs, on the other hand, we want to convolute in a single node its neighbours and recursively the information of the entire network.</p>

<p>The principle underlying GCNs lay its fundations on a method described several decades ago in the Weisfeiler-Lehman test. The test would determine whether two arbitrary graphs are isomorphic, i.e. they have exactly the same structure. According to the algorithm, all nodes are initialized with the same value, let’s put number 1 for all. Then, to that node is assigned that value plus the value of its neighbors, and this step is iterated. As you might think, in the first round the node already includes the information of first degree neighbors, but at the second iteration, the node will get a distilled notion of the second line of nodes, and so on as the iterations proceed. The test will confirm the isomorphism whether, after an arbitrary number of iterations, the partition of nodes by their current value does not change. Even though the isomorphism problem is not yet solved and the test is an heuristic attempt, the method brings the way to iteratively convolve information among the nodes.</p>

<p>The GCN method is described in Kipf &amp; Welling (ICLR 2017) and lies in the messaging passing methods family, whereas with “message” we intend solely the content of a single node and “passing” is the convolution which percolates throughout the network. While in the Weisfeiler-Lehman test the way to pass information is just a simple sum of values, in GCNs the convolution relies on the spectral propagation rule. What is this propagation rule? Let’s assume we know the graph structure (nodes and relations) and the content of all nodes (features). The propagation rule is applied with a linear matrix multiplication, but for not incurring in vanishing or exploding gradients in the downstream tasks, the features are normalized and a self-loop in the adjacency matrix is added.</p>

<p>I created some experiments with the small karate dataset, a fake set of node features (just a diagonal matrix) and a random set of weights. I repeated 4 experiments in sequence (no cherry-picking) in the image below where the color of the nodes indicates their similarity after running 2 iterations of the spectral algorithm.</p>

<figcaption>2 Iterations with Spectral Propagation Rule. Each figure is a separated run</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The results are clearly amazing! The two clusters are yet unrefined but as you can see the figure (d) is almost exactly what we obtained with Deepwalk! Those embeddings are elaborated with just random weights and 2 recursive iterations. Why not apply some learning mechanism for refining the clusterization with few examples?</p>

<p>I started this post on how your e-commerce could recommend new items according to your customers’ holiday preferences and I’ll run some experiments with a more pertinent dataset. If you are not familiar with ConceptNet, it is a huge graph database of general facts with 34 millions nodes, 34 types of different relations that I converted entirely in a OWL database. I extracted approximately 3 thousands of nodes about our topics of interest, the mountain and the seaside. Then I created a 2-layered neural network with the spectral propagation rule. I fed it with the adjacency matrix, the word-embeddings of the node names as input features and some labelled nodes. Two nodes classified as “seaside” category, and two nodes classified as “mountain” category. The 4 labelled nodes with 2 categories is all I need for classifying all the rest of the 3 thousands labels. That’s a ratio of 4/3000 labelled entries in the respect of the entire dataset, isn’t interesting? That’s why the name semi-supervised learning.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>ConceptNet snapshot. Red nodes are labelled “mountain”, the blue are “seaside”. 5 epochs</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This method of classification is really fast but has some drawbacks. The spectral propagation rule takes into account the adjacency matrix which is the whole network in a two dimensional vector. For a relatively small dataset that’s not an issue, but when it comes with real big data this method is actually unfeasible. The FastGCN comes into the rescue and scales to big sized graph DBs.</p>

                    <p>People often say that software is eating the world. But have you ever wondered what that really means?</p><p>Ten years ago, software eating the world might have been hard to believe. In 2008, only one of the top ten companies in the S&amp;P 500 was a tech company: Microsoft. </p><p>Today, all five of the top five companies in the S&amp;P 500 are tech companies. Their combined market cap is <a href="https://www.startribune.com/the-s-p-500-has-never-been-more-top-heavy/572106152/">22% of the entire index</a>. Or as much as the bottom 363 companies combined. They are so dominant, lawmakers want to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/house-panel-calls-for-congress-to-break-up-tech-giants-11602016985">break them up</a>.</p><p>How did this happen? And what happens next?</p><p>What role did software play in this outcome? And what does it mean for the future of financial services?</p><p>To understand what's really happening, you need to unpack the <a href="https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/">software eats the world hypothesis</a> and understand why digital is different and the implication this has on value chains everywhere.</p><p>In a <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/08/16/software-eaten-world-healthcare/">2019 interview</a>, Marc Andreessen describes in three layers how the software eats the world hypothesis unfolds across industries. Layer one is:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p>Any product or service in any field that can become a software product, will become a software product.</p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>If there's something you're used to doing on the phone, that will go to software. If there's something you're used to doing with paper, that will go to software. If there's something that you're used to doing in person and there is any way it can go to software, it will go to software.</p><p>Countless physical products are <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/apps-replacing-modern-devices/">now just apps on the phone</a> for most people: cameras, maps, keys, paper tickets, books, newspapers, magazines, calendars, radios, televisions, measuring tapes, remote controls, mirrors, and flash lights. Just to name a few. And more are being added all the time.</p><p>In other words, if it can become bits, it becomes bits.</p><p>What are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit">bits</a>? Zeroes and ones―a basic unit of information in computing. Data expressed as a series of zeroes and ones is what we call <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=digital">digital</a>.</p><p>And digital is different. On a deep and fundamental level.</p><p>An obvious reason is that digital products are easier to change, so it's faster to innovate and add new capabilities or features. Digital products are also easier to replicate at scale and are much more cost effective.</p><p>A less obvious reason is that digital products enable a shift from a world based on scarcity into a world based on abundance, unlocking large opportunities for value creation and re-arranging existing value chains in the process.</p><p><a href="https://www.usv.com/people/albert-wenger/">Albert Wenger</a>, a partner at Union Square Ventures, <a href="https://worldaftercapital.gitbook.io/worldaftercapital/digital">describes the two most important ways digital is different</a>:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Zero marginal costs</strong></strong> Making one additional unit and delivering it across the network costs nothing. The price for a product with zero marginal cost trends towards free. Zero marginal cost is like an economic singularity similar to dividing by zero in math―as you approach it strange things begin to happen, ranging from digital near-monopolies to granting all of humanity access to the world's knowledge.</li><li><strong><strong>Universality of computation</strong></strong> Anything that can be computed in the universe, can be computed by the type of machines we already have today, given enough memory and time. Computation means taking information inputs, executing a series of processing steps, and producing information outputs. Which is essentially what a human brain does. In principle, a digital machine can do everything a human brain does.</li></ul><p>So if products and services in your field are becoming software products and can take advantage of zero marginal costs and universality of computation, how do you figure out what might happen to your market?</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Ask yourself some of the <a href="https://andyjagoe.com/investment-analysis/">questions an early stage investor asks</a>  before investing in a startup:</p>
<ul>
<li>What used to be scarce but is now abundant?</li>
<li>What used to be full of friction but is now no friction? And how will consumer behavior change?</li>
<li>What is the new scarcity that the startup is going to claim?</li>
<li>How is the value chain arranged today and how can it be re-arranged to eliminate existing players or reduce their margins so that the total friction to a customer is lower but that the new point of friction is the startup—and that is why the startup can collect money?</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>For example, before the Web, information was scarce. Getting answers to questions was full of friction. It required knowing who to ask, or which physical books, magazines or articles to pore over. And then, how did you actually know if you had really found the best answer? Or just a local maxima?</p><p>With the emergence of &nbsp;the Web, information was digitized and only a click away. Information was now abundant. But there was a new problem. How did you find it?</p><p>Finding the best answers to questions was the new scarcity, and Google built clever software that did a much better job of ranking answers to questions than anyone else. Because of zero marginal costs, they allowed people to use it for free. The experience was 10x better than any alternative, and made users feel awesome. Like they had a superpower. </p><p>This was the beginning of a virtuous cycle. As people clicked on answers, Google recorded clicks as votes and then recalibrated their rankings. The more people used Google, the better it got. And the better it got, the more people used Google.</p><p>Software and digitalization enabled Google to aggregate the world's demand for answers on a scale never before seen. Google was the new point of friction in the value chain, and anyone who wanted to show up as the top answer had to pay. Many selling information (the old scarcity) had to find a new business.</p><p>OK, so what does all this mean for financial services?</p><p>Most money today is just information in a database. Deposits (checking and savings) should already be zero marginal cost, but banks have added friction and bureaucracy to keep money safe because of fraud and the absence of trust. Customers have been okay with this because trust is fundamentally what they've been buying.</p><p>As an individual, how can I trust that my money will be there when I need it? How can I trust that when I send a payment it's received by who I intended? How can I trust that I can borrow money when I need to? And that my loans will not be called in early? How can I trust that I own what I believe I have invested in? And when I have an accident, how can I trust my policy will pay as expected?</p><p>In today's world, trust is scarce.</p><p>But what if the world changed, and this was no longer true? What would happen to today's leading financial companies and their business models if trust became abundant?</p><p>Let's take a look at the evolution of the financial services platform stack¹ and see how things are changing.</p><h3 id="pre-internet-era">Pre-Internet Era</h3><p>For hundreds of years prior to the Internet, financial services were a vertically integrated oligopoly controlled by large banks. Names varied by country, but the story was always the same. Big banks managed every aspect of the stack, from the end user experience (bankers and ATMs) all the way down to the lowest level of infrastructure (settlements). </p><p>Regulation, infrastructure and customer acquisition cost made entry difficult, and so existing firms were very profitable. New products were rare, and old products hardly changed (aside from rates, fees or terms of service). Software was important at the platform and infrastructure layers, but would not be considered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design">good software</a> by today's standards. Software was used mainly to do old things better. There was no incentive to innovate, so things stayed the same.</p><figure><img src="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/10/Evolution-of-Finance--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Evolution-of-Finance--1-.png 600w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/10/Evolution-of-Finance--1-.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Evolution of Finance: Pre-Internet Era</figcaption></figure><h3 id="internet-era">Internet Era</h3><p>Mobile phones and broadband access to the Web meant that customers wanted always-on self-service access to financial services. Banks launched web sites and mobile apps, but there was no change to the underlying products and services being offered. Just a new way to interact with them that saved banks money. Once again, new technology was used to do old things better.</p><p>Meanwhile, a new class of innovators called fintechs emerged that were good at software, user experience and interfaces. They started targeting underserved customer segments and making improvements in the experience and interface layer, while partnering with existing financial services players for the middle office, back office and settlements.</p><p>These fintechs and neobanks are software companies in a way that banks are not. And some have become very big, like PayPal, Stripe, Square and Robinhood. Despite this, they are mainly innovating around the edge. Money and value still settles through fintechs essentially the same way paper bills settled hundreds of years ago.</p><figure><img src="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/10/Evolution-of-Finance--5-.png" alt="" srcset="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Evolution-of-Finance--5-.png 600w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/10/Evolution-of-Finance--5-.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Evolution of Finance: Internet Era</figcaption></figure><h3 id="future-era">Future Era</h3><p>Large financial institutions from the Pre-Internet era are still in control of the financial system today. The top four US banks each hold over a <a href="https://www.usbanklocations.com/bank-rank/total-deposits.html">trillion dollars in deposits</a> and maintain their positions through bundling, regulation and scarcity of access to the financial system's platform and infrastructure layers―coupled with a good measure of inertia, fear, uncertainty, and doubt. </p><p>Their value proposition is trust. </p><p>But <strong>public blockchains make trust abundant</strong>. And when trust is no longer scarce, big changes will happen in financial services.</p><p>It's hard to overstate how important this is. Today's entire financial system is based on trust being scarce.

<div><h2 id="The-Virtues-of-Prototyping">The Virtues of Prototyping<a href="#The-Virtues-of-Prototyping">¶</a></h2><p>One neat thing about prototyping (with Python or whatever) is that it allows you to fully focus on your <em>approach</em>, rather than on the infrastructure. Very obviously, this is useful for <em>teaching</em> – you can use examples as the ones above in a lecture to very quickly communicate essential techniques of program analysis and test generation.</p>
<p>But prototyping has more advantages. A Jupyter Notebook (like this one) documents how you developed your approach, together with examples, experiments, and rationales – and still focusing on the essentials. If you write a tool the "classical" way, you will eventually deliver thousands of lines of code that do everything under the sun, but only once you have implemented everything will you know whether things actually work. This is a huge risk, and if you still have to change things, you will have to refactor things again and again. Furthermore, for anyone who will work on that code later, it will take days, if not weeks, to re-extract the basic idea of the approach, as it will be buried under loads and loads of infrastructure and refactorings.</p>
<p>Our consequence at this point is that we now implement new ideas <em>twice</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, we implement things as a notebook (as this one), experimenting with various approaches and parameters until we get them right.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Only once we have the approach right, and if we have confidence that it works, we reimplement it in a tool that works on large scale programs. This can still take weeks to months, but at least we know we are on a good path.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Incidentally, it may well be that the original notebooks will have a longer life, as they are simpler, better documented, and capture the gist of our novel idea. And this is how several of the notebooks in this book came to be.</p>

            <p>Prior research has shown that physical activity can prevent unhealth as well as improve the prognosis of several diseases including various forms of cancer. Exactly how exercise exerts its protective effects against cancer is, however, still unknown, especially when it comes to the biological mechanisms. One plausible explanation is that physical activity activates the immune system and thereby bolsters the body’s ability to prevent and inhibit cancer growth.</p>

<p>In this study, researchers at Karolinska Institutet expanded on this hypothesis by examining how the immune system’s cytotoxic T cells, that is white blood cells specialized in killing cancer cells, respond to exercise.</p>

<h2>Cancer growth slowed in trained animals</h2>

<p>They divided mice with cancer into two groups and let one group exercise regularly in a spinning wheel while the other remained inactive. The result showed that cancer growth slowed and mortality decreased in the trained animals compared with the untrained.</p>

<p>Next, the researchers examined the importance of cytotoxic T cells by injecting antibodies that remove these T cells in both trained and untrained mice. The antibodies knocked out the positive effect of exercise on both cancer growth and survival, which according to the researchers demonstrates the significance of these T cells for exercise-induced suppression of cancer.</p>

<p>The researchers also transferred cytotoxic T cells from trained to untrained mice with tumors, which improved their prospects compared with those who got cells from untrained animals.</p>

<h2>Exercise altered T cell metabolism</h2>

<p>To examine how exercise influenced cancer growth, the researchers isolated T cells, blood and tissue samples after a training sessions and measured levels of common metabolites that are produced in muscle and excreted into plasma at high levels during exertion. Some of these metabolites, such as lactate, altered the metabolism of the T cells and increased their activity. The researchers also found that T cells isolated from an exercised animal showed an altered metabolism compared to T cells from resting animals.</p>

<p>In addition, the researchers examined how these metabolites change in response to exercise in humans. They took blood samples from eight healthy men after 30 minutes of intense cycling and noticed that the same training-induced metabolites were released in humans.</p>

<p>“Our research shows that exercise affects the production of several molecules and metabolites that activate cancer-fighting immune cells and thereby inhibit cancer growth,” says <a href="https://staff.ki.se/people/helame">Helene Rundqvist</a>, senior researcher at the <a href="https://ki.se/en/labmed/department-of-laboratory-medicine">Department of Laboratory Medicine</a>, Karolinska Institutet, and the study’s first author. “We hope these results may contribute to a deeper understanding of how our lifestyle impacts our immune system and inform the development of new immunotherapies against cancer.”</p>

<p>The researchers have received financing from the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, the Swedish Research Council, the Swedish Cancer Society, the Swedish Childhood Cancer Foundation, the Swedish Society of Medicine, Cancer Research UK and the Wellcome Trust.</p>

October 27, 2020 | https://procesoid.com/blog/goodbye-lenovo/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://procesoid.com/blog/goodbye-lenovo/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>If you are into process management, you don’t see services. You see the processes behind them. And even though I was just an ordinary customer, I could see that Lenovo has some key processes that are seriously broken.</p><div>
			<p><i>Disclaimer: This text isn’t a lament from an angry customer, but rather a reflection of one customer’s experience which was determined by process flaws. The complaint itself went well and I have nothing to moan about there.</i></p>
<p>My old laptop died, so I went and bought a new <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/laptops/thinkpad/l-series/ThinkPad-L580/p/22TP2TBL580">Lenovo ThinkPad L580</a>. The thin chassis made of black plastic combined with a powerful i7 processor wasn’t the right choice though:</p>
<p>Hot air was blowing from the right vent of the fan directly onto my right hand holding a mouse. And when I placed my hands onto the keyboard, the i7 processor located just under my right wrist was overheating under the load to the point where I felt like I was typing on a heater.</p>
<p>So it made me wonder:</p>
<ul>
<li>How could Lenovo put a laptop with such bad heat management on the market?</li>
<li>Don’t they have some <b>“not-to-do” </b>list of previous construction mistakes to avoid?</li>
<li>Does Lenovo have an autonomous <a href="https://procesoid.com/blog/process/">process</a> for testing prototypes to correct ill-conceived product designs?</li>
<li>And if it does, why is the vent for the fan on the right side, where most people hold their mouse, and why is the processor exactly where it would be felt by the user?</li>
<li>And if my particular laptop was overheating that much, how could it leave the factory in the first place? A well designed stress test would reveal such overheating easily.</li>
</ul>
<p>These problems aren’t expensive to detect and fix, nor does it take exceptional intelligence to do so. It only takes properly implemented and reliable <a href="https://procesoid.com/blog/business-process/">business processes</a>. And it’s not a trifle. The brand’s reputation is at stake.</p>
<p>Even more curious to me is that according to a heatmap published in the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-T580-i7-8550U-MX150-UHD-Laptop-Review.299796.0.html">review</a> by the renowned webzine <i>NotebookCheck</i> the heat problem extends also to the higher model T580. Although that one has the vent of the fan on the left side, the keyboard area can get as hot as a tropical 43,5°C (107 F):</p>
		<p><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-T580-i7-8550U-MX150-UHD-Laptop-Review.299796.0.html"><img loading="lazy" src="https://procesoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Stress_oben.jpg" alt="Lenovo T580 stress test heatmap" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://procesoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Stress_oben.jpg 640w, https://procesoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Stress_oben-300x225.jpg 300w, https://procesoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Stress_oben-96x73.jpg 96w, https://procesoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Stress_oben-76x58.jpg 76w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></a> Source: NotebookCheck.net		</p>
	
<p>Right after diagnosing the problem, I contacted the seller, who recommended me to file a fast <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/d/doa.htm">DOA</a> complaint through a national Lenovo partner. There I was first promised a fast resolution by some lady over the phone. But later, her less agreeable colleague told me after the arrival and diagnosing of my laptop that the heat<b> is a feature and not a flaw.</b> —&nbsp;<i>Excuse me? So I’ve bought a heater instead of a laptop?!</i></p>
<p>Thus, I pointed out to the gentleman that this is not what the customer <b>support </b>for business laptops should look like and that his duty is to <b>help </b>the customers. I have also stressed that if my complaint was denied, it would leave me no other option than to send a complaint directly to Lenovo. He called me back in a few minutes and suddenly <b>nothing was a problem. </b>He did a complete 180°, even suggested another round of testing and within two weeks my complaint was resolved to my satisfaction by a full refund.</p>
<p>Yet it made me wonder again:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why wasn’t there someone from the very beginning to express Lenovo’s commitment to resolve my obvious problem with a new $1,800 laptop?</li>
<li>How is it possible, that the “support” could initially promise a quick resolution and then have another staff member claim it is a feature? Don’t they have a CRM to be at least consistent in their communication?</li>
<li>Why is the ticketing support system unavailable most of the day and showing errors? And why was the ticket full of incomprehensible technical jargon?</li>
<li>Why does Lenovo outsource its customer care into the hands of such an incompetent local partner? Don’t they have a reliable process to choose and control the quality of their local support?</li>
<li>Why, after I have filled out a form sent from <i>Lenovo EMEA Customer Experience</i> and complained about my problems with the local support, wasn’t there someone to contact me <b>immediately </b>to restore my confidence in the company’s reputation?</li>
<li>Why hasn’t anyone apologized to me during all this for the problem with a new product and troubles it has caused me? Not to mention offered me some compensation for the time lost.</li>
</ul>
<p>Customer care isn’t difficult with competent staff and a strong process structure. But if one chooses to outsource it (and the brand’s reputation with it) into someone’s hands, it is <b>absolutely crucial</b> to guard the customer experience by something more than a stupid form send in an email full of grammatical mistakes, to which there is no follow-up reply anyway. It tells another story about the company and its culture.</p>
<p>Would I buy another laptop by Lenovo after this experience? Only under the condition that the whole company was running like a Swiss watch. At the moment it looks rather like a game of Chinese roulette.</p>

        <h2>Make better decisions.</h2>
      </p>
      <p>A decision journal is a simple, yet effective tool. It helps us to avoid hindsight bias, recognize patterns of mistakes in our decision making, and provide accurate and honest feedback on the decisions we make.</p>

<p>For those unfamiliar with what a decision journal is, it is the simple idea of keeping track of your decisions by writing them down for the purpose of reviewing it in the future. The Nobel Prize winner and famous psychologist <a href="https://fs.blog/2014/02/decision-journal/" target="_blank">Daniel Kahneman introduced the basic concept of a decision journal</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Go down to a local drugstore and buy a very cheap notebook and start keeping track of your decisions. And the specific idea is whenever you’re making a consequential decision, something going in or out of the portfolio, just take a moment to think, write down what you expect to happen, why you expect it to happen and then actually, and this is optional, but probably a great idea, is write down how you feel about the situation, both physically and even emotionally. Just, how do you feel? I feel tired. I feel good, or this stock is really draining me. Whatever you think.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This, Kahneman said, helps us avoid hindisight bias. The bias where everyone tends to look back on their own past in a favorable light. It’s the tendency people have of attributing their success to their own skills and talent but their failures to bad luck.</p>

<p>By keeping a decision journal, we avoid this bias by writing down exactly how we feel in the moment of making the decision. That way our future self can’t create a false narrative. We’re forced to be honest with ourselves.</p>

<p>Many decision makers in all walks of life use decision journals to help them improve their decision making capabilities. The problem is they can be challenging to maintain and keep track of. They require you to always remember to write down the decisions you want to keep track of and to go back and review them periodically. This causes many people to stop using them or to use them sub-optimally.</p>

<p>What if there was a more convenient way to use a decision journal?</p>

<p>Now there is, introducing Decision Journal, now available on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/decision-journal/id1534768141" target="_blank">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.betterthinkingsoftware.decisionjournal" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p>

<p>With Decision Journal, we tried to take all of the awesome benefits decision journals offer and augment them with modern technology and software. Let’s go over some of the app’s key features.</p>

<h4 id="always-with-you">Always with you</h4>

<p>One of the challenges in keeping a good decision journal is making sure that you remember to write down the important decisions you want to keep track of. Not only that but the whole point of a decision journal is so that you can later recall exactly what you were thinking and feeling at the time of the decision. The challenge is that we don’t remember everything and the longer you go without writing down your thoughts, the more likely what you write down will be inaccurate.</p>

<p>That’s one of the great benefits of using the Decision Journal app as your decision journal. It’s always with you. Whenever you make a decision or begin thinking about making a particular decision, you can pull your phone out of your pocket and jot it down. Plus, given that it is on your phone, we’ll sync it to the cloud every time you save it so that you can keep track of your decisions on your own time, whenever is most convenient for you.</p>

<h4 id="scheduled-reviews">Scheduled reviews</h4>

<p>Another important part of keeping a decision journal is so that you can accurately and honestly evaluate your decisions. However, one of the challenges is in remembering to do so in a timely manner.</p>

<p>We’re probably all too familiar with setting out our New Year’s resolutions at the beginning of each year, only to never follow up and review them. Why? Because life happens and we lose track of things. We’re human.</p>

<p>But that’s where technology can come in and assist us. With the Decision Journal app, we’ve made it super simple to mark a particular decision for a review at some point in the future. And you don’t have to remember to follow up, the app will do all of that for you. When it’s time to review a particular decision, the app will send you a notification letting you know that a particular decision is up for review.</p>

<p>And we didn’t just stop there. Sometimes you make decisions where the outcome of that decision can take place over long periods of time. That’s why we made it easy for you to schedule multiple reviews for any decision.</p>

<p><img src="https://decisionjournalapp.com/assets/img/screens/schedule-review.light.ios.png" height="350">
</p>

<h4 id="analyze-the-results">Analyze the results</h4>

<p>The whole point in keeping a decision journal in the first place is to try and improve on our decision making ability. That means picking up on patterns of errors and mistakes that we may be making.</p>

<p>With a paper and pen journal, this can be quite challenging. We may be able to remember the most frequent patterns of errors that we make but we might also miss a lot due to information overload.</p>

<p>This is another area where modern technology and software can help us. With the Decision Journal app, you can tag every decision you make to easily find trends and patterns in any particular category of decisions. In addition to tags, we’ve also added a powerful search capability that allows you to find decisions in a flash, so that you can be sure you’re not missing anything.</p>

</p>

<h4 id="make-better-decisions-today">Make better decisions today</h4>

<p>Decision journals are such a powerful and effective tool for helping you make better decisions. Everyone should be using them. The problem is, they can also be a challenge and a burden to keep. That’s why we created the Decision Journal app for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/decision-journal/id1534768141" target="_blank">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.betterthinkingsoftware.decisionjournal" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p>

<p>It takes the powerful concept of a decision journal and expands on it with new capabilities made possible through modern technology and software. We think it is an essential tool for any decision maker out there, but don’t just take our word for it, give it a try today:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>During the last 10 years, Node.js has become a big player in the backend framework market, powering several large scale applications across the globe. Meanwhile, JavaScript has also evolved greatly, not only because of the efforts of its development team, but also based on community feedback. However, integrating some of these new language features into a 10-year-old framework is not really straightforward, and has a high level of complexity.</p>
<p>Therefore we could say that Node.js’ architecture hasn’t evolved as fast as the language. As a basic example, Node.js is still based on callbacks, while there are far better ways to deal with asynchronicity in modern JavaScript. This is something that its creator, Ryan Dahl, has acknowledged in the past few years, and it has moved him to work on a new framework that addresses some of these issues. It is called Deno, and in the following article, we would like to explore some of its concepts to determine if it will render Node.js obsolete.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-deno">What is Deno?</h2>
<p>First of all, you should know that Deno is not a fork of Node.js. It’s a modern runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript, implemented from scratch by Ryan Dahl in 2018. It was built on <a href="https://v8.dev/">V8</a> just like Node.js, but Deno was written with <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> and <a href="https://tokio.rs/">Tokio</a>. The runtime was designed with TypeScript in mind, and for that reason Deno supports TypeScript without extra configurations or tooling.</p>
<p>Deno was built to improve security and help increase productivity in developers using the latest JavaScript features. At the time this article was written, Deno’s version is 1.4.0. It’s a stable release, so it’s a good time to go over its main features and learn how you can use them for your application.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<h3 id="typescript-out-of-the-box">TypeScript out of the box:</h3>
<p>TypeScript is powerful. This superset of JavaScript allows us to use types, interfaces, classes, inheritance, modules, generics, and other awesome things. However, it can be a bit tricky when using it with Node.js, because we need to install a module for TypeScript support and some tools to transpile the code. It also requires some additional configurations through tsconfig.json. However, after all of this setup, the JavaScript files that get compiled from TypeScript work pretty well with Node.js.</p>
<p>Deno offers native support for TypeScript at its 3.9 version. For it to run nothing else needs to be installed, and no compilation step is needed since Deno transpiles the code behind the scenes. It is also possible to run the code with a custom <code>tsconfig.json</code> file to customize how Deno compiles your code.</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a><span># Using a custom tsconfig.json file</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2"></a><span>deno</span> run -c tsconfig.json my-application.ts</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="url-imports">URL imports:</h3>
<p>Node.js projects have a <code>package.json</code> file that contains relevant information for your project. It also holds the dependency list that you’ll be using. Deno handles this part in a completely different way. The <code>package.json</code> file is not used anymore in favor of <code>ES Modules</code>. In order to use modules in a Deno project, you will need to reference each module with its URL or file path.</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a># Import <span>module</span> <span>server</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a><span>import</span> <span>{</span>serve<span>}</span> <span>from</span> “https<span>:</span><span>//deno.land/std/http/server.ts”</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>When the application is executed for the first time, Deno downloads and caches all modules in a global cache. It is possible to store them in a custom directory using the <code>$DENO_DIR</code> environment variable. With this approach, Deno decentralizes the modules and your project will not have a large <code>node_modules</code> folder.</p>
<p>To keep module versions locked, it is possible to create a lock file with the <code>--lock</code> and <code>--lock-write</code> flags.</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a><span># Create/update the lock file "lock.json"</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2"></a><span>deno</span> cache --lock=lock.json --lock-write src/my-application.ts</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="secure-by-default">Secure by Default:</h3>
<p>Deno has some security measures in place to disallow potentially dangerous operations. By default, the code is executed in a secure sandbox, so it is not possible to access the network, file system, or environment unless you explicitly allow it. You can do this by adding flags when running the application. These are enabled by default in Node.js, which makes it insecure in some cases.</p>
<p>As a quick overview of what can be enabled we have the following flags:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a><span># Enable environment access with Deno.env.get</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2"></a><span>deno</span> run --allow-env my-application.ts</span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a href="#cb4-4"></a><span>#Enable high resolution time measurement (used for profiling)</span></span>
<span id="cb4-5"><a href="#cb4-5"></a><span>deno</span> run --allow-hrtime my-application.ts</span>
<span id="cb4-6"><a href="#cb4-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-7"><a href="#cb4-7"></a><span>#Enable network access</span></span>
<span id="cb4-8"><a href="#cb4-8"></a><span># This is used in cases where we want to fetch from external servers</span></span>
<span id="cb4-9"><a href="#cb4-9"></a><span># or when we want to expose a port from our server</span></span>
<span id="cb4-10"><a href="#cb4-10"></a><span>deno</span> run --allow-net=https://example.com my-application.ts</span>
<span id="cb4-11"><a href="#cb4-11"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-12"><a href="#cb4-12"></a><span># Enable plugin usage</span></span>
<span id="cb4-13"><a href="#cb4-13"></a><span>deno</span> run --allow-plugin my-application.ts</span>
<span id="cb4-14"><a href="#cb4-14"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-15"><a href="#cb4-15"></a><span># Enable filesystem access</span></span>
<span id="cb4-16"><a href="#cb4-16"></a><span># To read a file or directory with Deno.open, or write to a file</span></span>
<span id="cb4-17"><a href="#cb4-17"></a><span># or  directory with Deno.writeFile</span></span>
<span id="cb4-18"><a href="#cb4-18"></a><span>deno</span> run --allow-read=awesome.txt my-application.ts</span>
<span id="cb4-19"><a href="#cb4-19"></a><span>deno</span> run --allow-write=awesome.txt my-application.ts</span>
<span id="cb4-20"><a href="#cb4-20"></a></span>

<h3 id="built-in-utilities">Built-in utilities:</h3>
<p>In Deno, we have some nice tools available out of the box. This means that we don’t need to install any additional libraries for some common development tasks. At a glance, these utilities are:</p>
<p><strong>Debugger:</strong> Like Node, Deno supports the V8 Inspector Protocol, which means that it’s possible to debug the program in any client that supports it. This consists mainly of two commands:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a><span># Debugging flags</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2"></a><span>#   --inspect      : Allows debugger attachment at any point</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3"></a><span>#   --inspect-brk  : Pause execution on first line</span></span>
<span id="cb5-4"><a href="#cb5-4"></a><span># Usage:</span></span>
<span id="cb5-5"><a href="#cb5-5"></a><span>deno</span> run --inspect-brk</span></code></pre></div>
<p>From this point, all you have to do is open your client and the program will stop on the first line, allowing you to set up breakpoints where you need to. For VSCode you can add the entry point and arguments to your <code>launch.json</code> to enable it.</p>
<p><strong>Formatter:</strong> In Node.js applications, it’s common to add a linter tool (typically ESLint) with a formatter like Prettier so the code is standardized. Deno has this feature built into it. You can access it by simply running <code>deno fmt</code></p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1"></a><span>deno</span> fmt          <span>#Formats everything in the current tree</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2"></a><span>deno</span> fmt file1.ts <span>#Formats a single file</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3"><a href="#cb6-3"></a><span>deno</span> fmt --check  <span># Checks if files are formatted correctly</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Bundler:</strong> Bundling is a task that is currently done with webpack, gulp or Grunt in Node.js applications. We can use Deno’s bundler when we want to pack a module together with its dependencies and this will generate a single module we can reference from other files. These bundles can also be loaded in the web browser.</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1"></a><span>deno</span> bundle https://foo.bar/test.ts test.bundle.js</span></code></pre></div>
<p>After that, we can import it from another JavaScript file or using a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag in our HTML with the <code>type=”module”</code> property.</p>
<p><strong>Dependency inspector:</strong> We can display a tree structure of our dependencies using the <code>deno info</code> command, followed by the URL we want to inspect. This is similar to <code>npm ls</code> in Node</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1"></a><span>deno</span> info https://deno.land/std/uuid/test.ts</span>

<h3 id="asynchronous-handling">Asynchronous handling:</h3>
<p>JavaScript asynchronous operations have evolved over time. The standard way of making an asynchronous call was through the use of callbacks. Recently we’ve gotten better ways to handle these operations, by using Promises, async/await syntax or generators. For that reason, Deno has taken advantage of these modern features.</p>
<p>All async actions in Deno return a promise. This is interesting because the <code>await</code> keyword is supported on the top level and there is no need to define the function with the <code>async</code> keyword. This approach allows us to write more readable code when working with asynchronism.</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1"></a><span>// Await some asynchronous operation</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2"><a href="#cb9-2"></a><span>let</span> file <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>Deno</span><span>.</span><span>open</span>(<span>'./my-file.txt'</span>)<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-3"><a href="#cb9-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb9-4"><a href="#cb9-4"></a><span>// Awaiting when starting the server</span></span>
<span id="cb9-5"><a href="#cb9-5"></a><span>import</span> <span>{</span> serve <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'https://deno.land/std/http/server.ts'</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-6"><a href="#cb9-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb9-7"><a href="#cb9-7"></a><span>const</span> server <span>=</span> <span>serve</span>(<span>{</span> port<span>:</span> <span>3000</span> <span>}</span>)<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-8"><a href="#cb9-8"></a></span>
<span id="cb9-9"><a href="#cb9-9"></a><span>for</span> <span>await</span> (<span>const</span> req <span>of</span> server)<span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb9-10"><a href="#cb9-10"></a>  <span>req</span><span>.</span><span>respond</span>(<span>{</span> body<span>:</span> <span>'Running server!!'</span> <span>}</span>)<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-11"><a href="#cb9-11"></a><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Deno supports promises out of the box. In the first example, the <code>await</code> keyword waits until <code>Deno.open</code> is resolved and its result is stored in the <code>file</code> variable. In the second example, <code>server</code> is an async iterator and the <code>for await</code> keywords are used to iterate them, each item will be a new incoming request.</p>

<p>Deno has incredible features, but there are two points that I think can be improved: - The permission flags could be handled in a different way like using a file that allows us to set the flags. If your code needs almost all the permissions you will have to use a long command. However, this is not a big issue on itself. - About the dependencies, NodeJS has a better project organization and the <code>lock</code> file is generated automatically. With Deno your dependencies will be placed in one directory, and to lock the dependencies you need to run an additional command. This might not be a good developer experience, but the community is working on some alternatives to change this.</p>
<p>Another point I would like to mention is regarding the examples and tutorials. On the NodeJS side, you can find a lot of examples/tutorials of any library or functionality you may need, while with Deno there are few examples/tutorials. But it will increase in the future for sure.</p>
<p>In this <a href="https://github.com/stackbuilders/deno-example">link</a> you will find a small example using Deno and Typescript that shows how to create routes with the <code>oak</code> module, submit data from a form and generate a CSV file with the provided data.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h2>
<p>Deno is a good alternative for increasing security that allows us to use TypeScript without extra configurations or …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I loved my Amazon Echo when they first came out. I love to cook, and I love to listen to music, so my Amazon Echo naturally won a spot in my kitchen when I first got it. Later on, it got upgraded to a Sonos One. Both speakers had voice control features that I loved, and used all the time. Hands-free timer setting and music control? Sign me up! However, Alexa’s shine has started to wear off - especially in the last six months. What’s changed?</p><p>Just in the last week or two, I’ve noticed a pretty serious bug in the Alexa software: its timers are not playing alarms when they expire! I can set a timer on my Sonos One using Alexa, open the Alexa app, and watch the timer count down to “00:00:00”. I expected hitting “00:00:00” to result in a tone from the speaker, like it’s done reliably for years. Instead: silence. As if to add insult to injury, the timer stays in the Alexa app, stuck forever at “00:00:00”. I’m not certain if this is a Sonos problem, or an Alexa problem - I see this behavior on my Sonos One, but not on my Sonos Move.</p><p>Whatever the case, it’s very literally burnt my biscuits. I do, primarily, use it as a kitchen timer, and it’s hard not to notice a bug that ruins your food!</p><p>Alexa unquestionably has a much lower success rate understanding my wife’s voice than mine. At first, I chalked this up to a matter of training, and understanding how the voice recognition technology works. I’ve participated in the development of a few voice speakers. I know that the best results come when you face the speaker, and speak slowly, clearly, and without pausing. Even with coaching to do this, Alexa either fails to understand my wife, or ignores her completely, at a rate of at least twice my own.</p><p>Unfortunately, I think I know the reason for this, and it’s not a pretty one. Voice assistant software naturally has a better success rate when tested against speech signals with lower frequency ranges. As a result, they naturally have better chance of understanding deeper voices, which predisposes them to understand men better than women. I thought this was just paranoid suspicion on my part, but <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/smart-speakers-understand-men-better-than-women-according-to-study">I’m not the only one who has noticed this phenomenon</a>. Not to mention that it’s hard to argue with a plot of Voice Command Success Rate against average input frequency. The trend just goes down, down, down as the average input frequency increases.</p><p>It’s a disappointing bias set by technology.</p><p>I also get the impression that the quality of voice interactions has gone downhill over time. No longer does Alexa magically find the thing I want to do - whether that’s set a timer, add an item to a grocery list, or start playing a particular album I want to hear. I find myself leaning, more and more, on my smartphone to queue up music. Alexa is just not up to the task on any given day.</p><p>I have to admit that this might not be a real problem - or, rather, not a change in the voice recognition software. The only thing I know for sure has changed in the last six months is that I’m home a <em>lot</em> more. Working from home has given me many more opportunities to use my voice speaker. I’d estimate that, pre-COVID, I used the voice control functionality maybe five times a day, in two discrete blocks: in the morning, before leaving for work, and in the evening, after getting back home. Working from home has blown that schedule out of the water. Instead of a two-hour window at the start and end of each day, I’m at home <em>_</em>all the time_. This gives me more opportunities to use my voice speaker. Correspondingly, it gives more opportunities for Alexa to fail to meet my expectations.</p><p>Having previously worked at a company that makes voice speakers, I understand that there’s such a thing as an acceptable failure rate of voice transactions. (The terms of art are “False Accepts” and “False Rejects”, if you’re curious.) This leads me to wonder: is Alexa’s voice assistant technology getting worse, or am I just using it enough to expose its warts?</p><p>For example: let’s say I use the speaker an average of once per hour. If I’m home for four hours a day (like I was pre-pandemic), that averages out to four voice commands per day. If a voice command fails, on average, one time in twenty, this is likely an acceptable failure rate. It’s easy to forget a failed voice command if it only happens, on average, once a week or so.</p><p>Now, though, I’m <em>always</em> home. That gives me sixteen waking hours in which to issue voice commands. If we’re holding constant the once-per-hour rate of voice commands, and the one-in-twenty rate of failed voice transactions, then failures of the voice assistant start becoming a <em>daily</em> occurrence, rather than a weekly one. I suspect that this passes some sort of psychological threshold: even though the overall failure rate has not changed, I notice more failures just because the time between failures decreases. Since it’s now a daily occurrence instead of a weekly one, I have less other minutiae going on in my life to help me forget Alexa’s shortcomings.</p><p>I’d imagine the folks at Amazon would consider this a pretty serious problem, even though their underlying metrics for Alexa’s accept/reject rates likely haven’t changed at all. Being a consumer good, <em>perception</em> of its quality is almost as important as the reality of it!</p></div></div>]]>

<p>DENVER, CO — Oct 27, 2020 — Application security startup StackHawk announced today that it has raised a $10 million in Series A funding. The pre-emptive, oversubscribed round was led by <a href="https://sapphireventures.com/">Sapphire Ventures</a> and included return seed backers Foundry Group, Costanoa Ventures, Flybridge Capital, and Matchstick Ventures. Launched just over a year ago, StackHawk has seen significant demand as a platform that helps developers implement security testing before applications are pushed into production — a trend in the industry known as “shifting security left.”</p>



<p>With widespread adoption of DevOps over the past decade, companies are shipping software to production more frequently than before, with many companies pushing to production multiple times per day. The traditional models of application security testing such as quarterly penetration tests or scheduled scans of the production application have struggled to keep up with this shift, resulting in inefficiencies and increased risk exposure. Modern companies, however, are integrating application security into their DevOps practices, checking for vulnerabilities early in the software development life cycle. This approach vastly shortens the time to find and fix vulnerabilities, leading to efficient development and secure applications.</p>



<p>StackHawk is an application security testing platform that allows DevOps teams to instrument automated dynamic application security testing (DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline. With this approach, engineering teams can instrument automated testing with every pull request, ensuring that vulnerabilities are caught long before they hit production. And with a strong focus on features for software developers, application security can scale across the engineering organization, creating significant efficiencies in fixing security bugs.</p>



<p>Adrián Moreno Peña, Tech Lead at VanMoof, describes the company’s use of StackHawk, “At VanMoof we work fast and lean, in a DevOps-way of working with empowered teams using smart tools to handle their work. It was about time to find InfoSec tools that fit with our vision — high productivity tools, flexible, adaptable and created with developers in mind. Using StackHawk we can make our security improvement process transparent, actionable and easy to understand for each developer in the team, applying best practices and preventing security issues from going to production.”</p>



<p>The modern approach to application security also resonates with Katie Teitler, industry analyst at TAG Cyber. “Coming early into the development lifecycle is an attractive proposition, both for development lifecycles and for security teams,” said Teitler. “Since the platform is lightweight and quick to deploy through Docker, devs should feel instantly comfortable with it.”</p>



<p>The StackHawk founding team has leveraged their backgrounds in DevOps and security to build the product that puts application security in developer’s hands. Joni Klippert, StackHawk founder &amp; CEO, has spent the past decade building DevOps products, most recently as the VP, Product at VictorOps (acquired by Splunk).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Digital Transformation has allowed for automation of many tasks associated with building, delivering and operating software in production. DevOps automation enables companies to deliver business value to their customers faster than ever before,” said Klippert. “However, security practices are not keeping up with the speed of modern software delivery. StackHawk empowers software engineers to deliver secure software to their customers at the speed of DevOps.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The focus on integrating into the modern engineering workflow and building features for developers was a leading factor for Sapphire to lead the round. “With the rise of DevOps, companies have shifted to the frequent release of software and reliance on automation. How companies approach application security should be no different,” says David Hartwig, Managing Director at Sapphire Ventures. “We believe that StackHawk has the product and the team in place, led by Founder and CEO Joni Klippert, to deliver on developer-first automated application security testing in the DevOps pipeline, and we are excited to partner with them along their journey.”</p>



<p>With the additional capital, StackHawk will continue product development, invest in go-to-market teams, and continue to support ZAP, the open source project that the company’s platform is built upon.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>About StackHawk</strong><br>StackHawk, an application security SaaS startup in Denver, CO, empowers engineers to easily find and fix application security bugs at any stage of software development. With a strong founding team that has deep experience in security and DevOps, and some of the best venture investors in the business, StackHawk is putting application security testing into the hands of engineers.

People can read it and it communicates the intent, but it’s different for every API.</p> <p>OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) is a <strong>standardized format that describes how an API works</strong>. It captures the important parts of the documentation and defines a structure for it:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>paths</span><span>:</span>

It is in the YAML file, in the <code>servers</code> section.</p> <p>But when, for example, the same API is managed by Terraform and the URL is different for every deployed stack, it needs to be set dynamically.</p> <p>Terraform supports the <code>templatefile</code> function that allows defining values and inserts them into the document:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>resource</span> <span>"aws_apigatewayv2_api"</span> <span>"api"</span> <span>{</span>

<span>-</span> <span>url</span><span>:</span> <span>${api_url}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>When it is deployed, the YAML contains the URL of the API Gateway:</p> <p><img alt="Swagger UI shows the dynamic server URL" integrity="sha256-Qo8nJxaZuK4YVZqQE5DeN09T4UGagEqK3E7rMj7zQzM=" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/posts/api_docs_terraform/api-428f27271699b8ae18559a901390de374f53e1419a804a8adc4eeb323ef34333.png"></p> <h3 id="files">Files</h3> <p>To put files into a bucket, use the <code>aws_s3_bucket_object</code> resource.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We already discussed
<a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt1-basic-concepts#gameobject">Game Objects</a> and
<a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt1-basic-concepts#component">Components</a> as two
of the fundamental building blocks of the Unity Engine. Today, we’ll discuss
their programmatic representation.</p><p><em>This is <strong><a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/tag/unity-for-software-engineers">Unity for Software Engineers</a></strong>,
a series for folks familiar with software development best practices seeking an
accelerated introduction to Unity as an engine and editor. More is coming over
the next few weeks, so <a href="http://eepurl.com/gVgusL">consider subscribing</a> for
updates.</em></p><p>The Unity Engine <em>runtime</em> is primarily written in C++, and much of the Engine’s
primitives (such as the game objects and their components) live in C++ land.
You’ll also know that the Unity Engine <em>API</em> is in C#. The API gives you access
to all of Unity’s native objects in a way that<!-- -->—<!-- -->save for a few pitfalls
we’ll discuss today<!-- -->—<!-- -->feels like intuitive, idiomatic C#.</p><figure><p><img src="https://blog.eyas.sh/e1e4978ec3c78301c0c6b929c61f8bf7/object-hierarchy.svg" alt="A GameObject, MonoBehaviour, and ScriptableObject all inherit from UnityEngine Object."></p><figcaption><p>The <em>C#</em> class hierarchy of <code>UnityEngine.Object</code>, <code>GameObject</code>,
<code>ScriptableObject</code>, <code>Component</code>, and their children. This should map to the
<em>conceptual</em> hierarchy of how to think about these objects, though sometimes the
runtime implementation will look different.</p></figcaption></figure><h2 id="unityobject">UnityEngine.Object</h2><p>At the top of the Unity Object hierarchy sits <strong><code>UnityEngine.Object</code></strong>. For the
most part provides a <code>name</code> string, an <code>int GetInstanceID()</code> method, and a bunch
of equality comparers.</p><p>The class also provides a <code>static void Destroy(Object obj)</code> method (and some
overloads) that destroys a <code>UnityEngine.Object</code> and any of its subclasses. When
an Object is destroyed, the <em>native</em> part of the object is freed from memory,
and the smaller <em>managed</em> part will be garbage collected <em>at some point</em> after
there are no more references to it.</p><p>Because your valid reference to a <code>UnityEngine.Object</code> can point to a destroyed
native object, <code>UnityEngine.Object</code> overrides C#‘s <code>operator==</code> and <code>operator!=</code>
to make a destroyed Object <em>appear</em> null. Simply accessing methods on a
destroyed object will return <code>NullReferenceException</code>, albeit with a friendlier
error message that tells you which object you were trying to access.</p><h2 id="gameobject">GameObject</h2><p>A <strong>GameObject</strong> derives from Object and represents anything in your scene.</p><p>Let’s start at a high-level: A GameObject inherits a name and instance ID from
its parent. Otherwise, conceptually, a GameObject</p><ul><li>has a list of <a href="#component"><strong>Components</strong></a> on it,</li><li>has a <code>tag</code> string for organizational purposes, and</li><li>belongs to a <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Layers.html">layer</a>.</li></ul><p>A GameObject’s state</p><ul><li>is the product of all of its <em>Components’</em> state, and</li><li>whether an object is active or not.</li></ul><p>Let’s dig a bit deeper. When starting, most of the interesting stuff in a
GameObject is in its <strong>Components</strong>. A GameObject has at least one Component:
its <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.html"><code>Transform</code></a>. A
Transform describes the position and rotation of the GameObject. A Transform
includes helper properties that show an object’s <em>absolute world</em> position and
rotation, as well as the position and rotation <em>relative</em> to its parent. In the
Editor, the Transform position and rotation are set from the <em>parent relative</em>
variants.</p><p>Since every GameObject has a Transform (and also, given that a Transform is
frequently needed/accessed), the GameObject directly exposes a
<code>Transform transform</code> public property.</p><p>You can access individual components from <code>T GetComponent&lt;T&gt;()</code>, or lists of
components from <code>T[] GetComponents&lt;T&gt;()</code>, etc. These methods search through all
components on a GameObject and return ones with a compatible type (or null, if
none exist in the singular case). Since these methods search through components
and check type compatibility, it is often recommended to cache this lookup.</p><p>If you are building/extending a GameObject by hand, you can always use
<code>T AddComponent&lt;T&gt;()</code>. In most cases, however, you’re better off using the
Editor.</p><p>Individual Objects (a Component or ScriptableObject) might refer to other
<code>GameObjects</code> in a few ways:</p><ul><li><p><strong>By reference</strong>. By exposing a <code>GameObject</code> <em>serialized field</em> that you
then set from the inspector.</p><p><em>We have discussed serialization extensively throughout the series:
<a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt1-basic-concepts#serialization">as a fundamental concept</a>
and in our tour of the Editor, when
<a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt4-editor-tour#inspector">describing the Inspector</a>,
and the <a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt2-six-practices">practice</a> of using
the Inspector as an injection framework</em>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Using tags</strong>. Every Game Object can have a <em>tag</em> string. You can find
objects in the scene using that tag through the static functions
<code>GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag</code> and <code>GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag</code>.
A GameObject also exposes a public <code>bool CompareTag(string tag)</code> method.</p><p>This is a quick-and-dirty way to get the job done, but is still a popular
way. A common use of this in the wild is to have a <code>"Player"</code> tag to find
the Player. Ideally, these methods should not be called every frame, so if
you have to use them, consider caching the result.</p></li><li><p><strong>Using layers</strong>. A layer is an <code>int</code> between 0 and 31. Every Game Object is
in exactly one layer.</p><p>While you can’t directly look up all objects in a layer, if you already have
a reference to a GameObject (e.g., in a collision event), you can check a
GameObject against a
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/LayerMask.html"><code>LayerMask</code></a>. A
<code>LayerMask</code> is typically used in functions like <code>Physics.Raycast()</code>. This
allows you to find objects with colliders intersecting with a given <em>ray</em>.
Passing a <code>LayerMask</code> to <code>Physics.Raycast()</code> will only return objects within
the specified set of layers.</p><p>Inside the Unity Engine, <em>Cameras</em> make heavy use of layers. E.g., you can
have one camera that renders “everything but UI”, and overlay another camera
for an in-game HUD, etc.</p></li><li><p><strong>Using indirect references</strong>. There are many reasons why the methods above
might be insufficient: you might not want to use tags to avoid depending on
copy-pasted strings, and layers might not fit your use case. If referencing
a fellow object in-scene is not an option (e.g., you’re dealing with a
dynamic set of objects or don’t have access to the current scene objects in
the context you need this reference, etc.), then you might want to look
further.</p><p>For this, an increasingly popular concept is <em>runtime sets</em> Scriptable
Objects. You can read more about this in Unity’s how-to article on
<a href="https://unity.com/how-to/architect-game-code-scriptable-objects">architecting your game with ScriptableObjects</a>,
based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk">the talk</a> by Ryan
Hipple. If you have an hour to spare, you might want to watch the whole
thing.</p></li></ul><p>A GameObject also exposes a <code>BroadcastMessage</code> and <code>SendMessage</code> functions that
propagate <em>messages</em> (described in the <a href="#component"><strong>Component</strong></a> section) to
all components in or under it.</p><figure><p><span>

User-implemented Components will usually extend the <code>MonoBehaviour</code> subclass
(more on that later).</p><p>A Component inherits a name and instance ID from its parent. Otherwise,
conceptually, a Component</p><ul><li>always <em>belongs</em> to a single GameObject, exposed as a public
<code>GameObject gameObject</code> property, and</li><li>can receive <strong>messages</strong>, driving much of its behavior.</li></ul><p>The state of a component on an <em>active</em> GameObject lies entirely in its
implementation.</p><p>In addition to its <code>GameObject</code>, a component exposes shorthand properties and
methods such as <code>Transform transform</code>, <code>T GetComponent&lt;T&gt;()</code>, etc. These are
simply convenience shorthands for accessing those same methods on the
corresponding <code>gameObject</code>.</p><p>The most important functionality of a Component is driven through <strong>Unity
Messages</strong> (also sometimes called <em>Unity Event Functions</em> when referring to
built-in messages). These are effectively callbacks functions triggered <em>by the
Engine</em> in certain situations. Every Component will receive a <code>Awake()</code>,
<code>Start()</code>, <code>Update()</code> and other messages, for example. The Unity Docs on the
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ExecutionOrder.html">Order of Execution</a> of
these messages is a convenient resource.</p><p>To have your component receive a particular message, simply add a
<em><code>private void</code></em> method with the appropriate message name. The runtime will use
reflection to call these messages, when applicable. This is why you don’t see an
<code>override</code> directive on these messages. Messages like <code>Update</code>, <code>LateUpdate</code>,
and <code>FixedUpdate</code> are inspected once per type, so don’t worry about reflection
being used in every frame. See more details in the
”<a href="https://blogs.unity3d.com/2015/12/23/1k-update-calls/">10000 Update() calls</a>”
Unity blog post for more information.</p><p>A <strong><code>Behaviour</code></strong> is a type of component that <em>can be enabled or disabled</em>. When
a <code>Behaviour</code> is disabled, <code>Start</code>, <code>Update</code>, <code>FixedUpdate</code>, <code>LateUpdate</code>,
<code>OnEnable</code>, and <code>OnDisable</code> messages are not called.</p><p>A <strong><code>MonoBehaviour</code></strong> is a <code>Behaviour</code> that also enables using
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Coroutines.html">Coroutines</a>.</p><h2>A Note on Inactive Objects and Disabled Components</h2><p>A GameObject in a loaded scene will exist in memory until the object is
<em>Destroyed</em> explicitly or the scene is unloaded. A GameObject can be set to
<em>inactive</em>, which will cause it to stop receiving <code>Update</code> (and related) events.</p><p><strong>When an object is <em>created</em></strong>, the messages called on a component depend on
if: (1) the GameObject is active, and (2) the component is enabled:</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>GameObject is <em>active</em></th><th>GameObject is <em>inactive</em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Component is Enabled</td><td><code>Awake</code>, <code>OnEnable</code>, <code>Start</code></td><td><em>Component implicitly disabled</em></td></tr><tr><td>Component is Disabled</td><td><code>Awake</code></td><td><code>Awake</code></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>When an object is <em>set to active</em> or a <code>Behaviour</code> is <em>set to enabled</em></strong>:</p><ul><li><code>OnEnable</code> will be called.</li><li>If <code>Start</code> has never been called on this <code>Behaviour</code>, it will be called
exactly once.</li></ul><h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2><p>Some takeaways of all this:</p><ol><li>A Unity object might <em>appear to become <code>null</code></em> when destroyed. <code>== null</code>
checking does more than you think.</li><li>As a result, null-coalescing operators (<code>??</code>, <code>??=</code>) and null-conditional
operators (<code>?.</code>, <code>?[]</code>) don’t work as expected.</li><li>Yes, your Unity Messages can be private!</li><li>Don’t create abstract classes that unnecessarily declare <code>Update</code> or other
messages to make overriding easier; that’ll result in the engine always
calling these events.</li><li>Disabling an Object or Component is a great way to limit its game logic or
save on CPU-bound effort, but these objects still have a memory overhead.</li></ol></div></div>]]>

      <section id="main_content">
        
<p>This is a brief blog post describing my experience with automating Photoshop using Python.
I am an experienced software developer, but had never really used Photoshop before. As you can tell from my wonderful programmer art in this post ;)</p>

<p>Here’s the <a href="https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/photoshop/pdfs/photoshop-cc-vbs-ref.pdf">Adobe documentation</a> my work was based on.</p>

<p>Here’s a link to <a href="https://github.com/loonghao/photoshop-python-api">another project</a> that could also be of interest. <strong>I have not used their code,</strong> but it looks very promising.</p>

<p>The sample code and repo source code have been <strong>tested on Python 2.7</strong>, but should work fine on Python 3.
<a href="https://github.com/kelvin0/ImageAutomation">Source code</a></p>

<h2 id="generating-images">Generating images</h2>
<p>Some time ago we needed a solution to be able to quickly generate some product images using Photoshop.</p>

<p>The graphic designer wanted to combine 2 images into a final product image to be used for display their products online.</p>
<ul>
  <li>An environment image (PSD file).</li>
  <li>An object image (jpg).</li>
  <li>Combine the above images into a product image (jpg).</li>
</ul>

<p>This was done manually in Photoshop and as expected was very time consuming and error prone.</p>

<p>The scenario described for generating an image might seem very simple, <strong>why use Photoshop at all, right?</strong> PIL, Skimage, OpenCV would work fine! Well in this case, there were some very fine transformations and image processing being done in Photoshop and the graphic designer needed all these features required in order to generate high-quality images using filter, shears and other exotic (for me at least) visual effects.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/kelvin0/ImageAutomation/blob/gh-pages/Combine_2_images.png?raw=true" alt="Combination of 2 images"></p>

<h2 id="smart-objects">Smart objects?</h2>
<p>Prior to my involvement, the graphic designer had been looking for a way to simplify and automate this image generation process.
An important feature that would be key to this work is the concept of <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/ca/photoshop/using/create-smart-objects.html">Smart Objects</a></p>

<p><strong>Smart objects</strong> in Photoshop allow you to ‘link’ 2 or more PSD files. Any changes made to the linked PSD are automatically made to any PSD linking to it!
Basically you create a PSD file, and have one of the layers be a Smart Object. Then you link that Smart Object layer to another PSD.
Afterwards when you open the background image and the product image in Photoshop, <strong>any changes you make to the product image, also are made in the background image</strong>.</p>

<p>Another cool thing about Smart Objects: <strong>all the transformations within the Smart Object layer are preserved</strong>, regardless of the changes you make to the source PSD.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/kelvin0/ImageAutomation/blob/gh-pages/smart_objects_update.png?raw=true" alt="Smart Objects workflow"></p>

<p><strong>This requires:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Each background image (PSD) must contain a layer with a Smart Object.</li>
  <li>The Smart Object layer has  to be linked to a default image (PSD).</li>
  <li>Works best if both PSD files reside in same directory.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The manual steps for generating a final product image becomes:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the background image in Photoshop (mountains).</li>
  <li>Open the default product image in Photoshop (ball).</li>
  <li>Open the desired product image in Photoshop (star).</li>
  <li>Copy the desired product image into the default product image. This updates the Smart Object.</li>
  <li>Save the background image as JPEG. This is our final image we want to generate with mountains and the star.</li>
  <li>Repeat this for every background/product combination image we want to generate.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="python-and-com">Python and COM</h2>
<p>As mentionned at the beginning, we will be using the Photoshop COM programming interface.
The <a href="https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/photoshop/pdfs/photoshop-cc-vbs-ref.pdf">Photoshop reference PDF</a> will be our guide in writing our automation scripts. Of course we could be doing this directly in VB script, but it is much more fun (and productive!) to use Python.</p>

<p>Here’s a basic sample that opens an image in Photoshop.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>win32com.client</span>

<span># This actually fires up Photoshop if not already running.
</span><span>ps</span> <span>=</span> <span>win32com</span><span>.</span><span>client</span><span>.</span><span>Dispatch</span><span>(</span><span>"Photoshop.Application"</span><span>)</span>

<span># Open an image file (PSD in our case)
</span><span>doc</span> <span>=</span> <span>ps</span><span>.</span><span>Open</span><span>(</span><span>r"X:\Path\To\My.psd"</span><span>)</span>
<span># ... do something ...
</span><span>doc</span><span>.</span><span>Close</span><span>()</span>

<span>ps</span><span>.</span><span>Quit</span><span>()</span> <span># Stops the Photoshop application
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>This works on Windows, but some other scripting language might be more appropriate for Mac OS.
We will not be covering other platforms.</p>

<p><strong>There is no headless mode when running Python/COM automation scripts.</strong></p>

<p>Each script command actually translates to an action you see happen on the screen.
I will get into this and other annoyances later.</p>

<h2 id="basic-recipe">Basic Recipe</h2>

<p>Here is some basic sample code that illustrates the automated steps to generate our final product image, which is a star on a background of mountains.</p>

<p>Notice also that we duplicate the PSD documents once we open them. We do this in order not to accidentally change and save the original PSD files.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> working with Photoshop’s object containers is different than native Python lists and tuples. The indices are <strong>1-based</strong>, so the first element of container has index=1 (as opposed to index=0 as per usual).</p>

<h2 id="watch-out">Watch out!</h2>
<p>As mentionned earlier, even though there are quite a few advantages to automating with Photoshop, there are also quite a few points to consider.</p>

<p>Photoshop scripts require running an actual instance of Photoshop and it’s <strong>main window will be visible on the desktop</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>Photoshop window should not be minimized while running a script.</strong> This might actually block Photoshop, and prevent your automated task from running properly.</p>

<p>If you make use of <strong>Copy/Paste commands in your script, this will hijack your clipboard</strong>, and prevent any other user/application from using it properly.</p>

<p><strong>Photoshop tends to hang/freeze/crash periodically.</strong> The crashes are frequent on big batches of images and don’t seem to be related to RAM/CPU usage. Just restart your script and it will eventually run to completion just fine. Regardless of crashes, <strong>you can still make huge productivity gains from automating some tasks.</strong></p>

<p>For all these reasons, we <strong>highly recommend that any automated tasks you create should run on a dedicated Windows PC.</strong> You don’t need a high end PC for most tasks and this will definitely make everyone more productive.</p>

<h2 id="hope-this-was-useful">Hope this was useful</h2>
<p>Of course, most of the code and samples discussed here are related to the specific use case described.
Almost all Photoshop commands can be scripted this way. The sample code should help you get started, and more details can be found in Photoshop scripting reference.
<strong>If you need any help with your project, we will gladly share our expertise if required!</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
    
    <p>
      Proposition 24 is a 52-page law that overhauls privacy laws in California. It's so complex that it has split the privacy community, and experts disagree about what it would mean for Californians. Most voices agree Prop 24 has some changes to love, and some to reject. The typical voter is probably very uncertain about whether to vote "Yes" or "No".
    </p>
    <p>
      We are <strong>San Diego Privacy</strong>, a small group of privacy advocates in San Diego, and we'd like to help by offering a neutral analysis. Below you'll find 10 of the biggest issues with Prop 24, along with the main points supporters (the "Yes" side) and opponents (the "No" side) make about that issue.
    </p>
    <p>We suggest you first pick the issues in purple that jump out to you the most. Then, keep count of whether you find the Yes side or the No side more compelling, for the issues you've picked. Last, total up your counts.</p>
    <p>Then, as always, go vote your values.</p>

    <p><strong><i>Update</i></strong>: When you pick the issues below that matter to you, consider <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FSWtcqBEbe-SOUUWZ9d7j_M3Ft1ap5CR?usp=sharing" target="_blank">downloading a shareable image</a> of that issue as well, and posting it on social media to generate discussion.</p>

            <p>I feel strongly about <strong>Pay For Privacy</strong></p>
            <div>
              <p>
                <strong>Pay for Privacy</strong> means that if you demand privacy, companies can charge you more for goods and services.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Companies that rely on targeted advertising, like newspapers or free streaming music services, currently rely on targeted ads.</li>
                <li>Some privacy options allow you to block the ability to show you targeted ads.</li>
                <li>Pay-for-privacy is already allowed in existing California law.</li>

                  <li>Claims companies who rely on targeted ads, like newspapers, would be imperiled if pay-for-privacy was eliminated.</li>

                </p>
                <p>
                   When interviewed, Prop 24 author Alastair Mactaggart warns the newspaper industry would be hit hard if pay-for-privacy options were blocked. (<a href="https://youtu.be/eWOFZOPJm78?t=2186" target="_blank">Union-Tribune video interview</a> with Yes on 24)

                <li>Says Prop 24 doesnt fix the problem of pay-for-privacy, which is already in current law.</li>
                  <li>Argues privacy is a constitutional right of Californians; it is not for sale.</li>
                  <li>Warns Prop 24 further emboldens businesses to charge consumers for privacy.</li>

      <p>
        Authors' Note: It's important to emphasize here that pay-for-privacy is already allowed in current law. Opponents see Prop 24's choice to further expand pay-for-privacy, rather than ban it, as one reason to oppose it.

            <p>I feel strongly about <strong>Global Opt-Out</strong></p>
            <div>
              <p>
                <strong>Global Opt-Out</strong> allows you to set up your privacy options in one place, and have them apply universally. Prop 24 allows companies to ignore those global settings, in some cases.

              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>In the future, you'll be able to set your privacy preferences in one place, rather than at each site or service.</li>
                <li>Prop 24 includes provisions for allowing companies to ignore your global privacy preferences for certain reasons, like if they want you to pay.</li>
                <li>There could be other reasons companies won't have to respect your global privacy preferences.</li>

                <li>Believes pay-for-privacy means companies must be allowed to ignore your global privacy settings in order to ask you to pay (See "Pay For Privacy" above).</li>

        Authors' Note: This is a good place to note that many privacy advocates believe all efforts to collect your data should require affirmative consent from you, rather than using the "opt-out" model where companies collect your data first, and then require you to ask it be deleted or not collected.

        Authors' Note: Privacy advocates feel very strongly that Californians should have the "private right of action," or the right to sue companies to enforce privacy law.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        
        <small>2020-10-26</small>
        <p>The BEAM is the virtual machine that Erlang and Elixir runs on. It is widely cited as a battle-tested piece of software though I don’t know in which wars it has seen action. It has definitely paid its dues in the telecom space as well as globally scaled projects such as Whatsapp and Discord. It is well suited to tackle soft-realtime distributed systems with heavy concurrency. It has been a good platform chugging along. And with a small team at Ericsson responsible for much of its continuing development it has been managed in a deeply pragmatic way. Erlang has always been a bit of a secret and silent success. Almost no-one uses it if you look at market shares. But among the ones that use it there seems to be a very positive consensus. And then Elixir came and caused a bit of a boom. I think the BEAM has benefited from Elixir and Elixir wouldn’t exist without the BEAM. With that bit of background I’d like to shine a light on some cool developments that I think makes the BEAM more interesting or even uniquely interesting in the future.</p>
<h2 id="the-jit-is-here-soon-otp-24">The JIT is here (soon, OTP 24)</h2>
<p>With OTP 24 landing sometime next year we are going to get the a JIT for the BEAM. Based on the project <a href="https://github.com/asmjit/asmjit">AsmJit</a> this will mean that some BEAM code will be translated to native instructions. It will not be the kind of warm-up-for-performance-gains JIT that I’ve heard of in PyPy but rather significantly simpler. The goal of the project was to introduce a JIT that could give performance gains for some cases but would not cause any performance regressions. A pragmatic and laudable approach. Considering this made the Jason JSON-library (written in Elixir) beat the Jiffy JSON-library (written as a C NIF) in <strong>some</strong> tests I think this has the potential to obviate the need for some NIF implementations. Avoiding reaching out to the lower level code that is more capable but more dangerous is a good win.</p>
<p>Anyone running RabbitMQ should look forward to the update as measurements indicate 30-50% increased message throughput. Which is a nice thing to get for no code changes at all.</p>
<p>Pushing the performance of the BEAM closer to native is magnificent. To be clear the BEAM is already quite a good performer. I would put Erlang and Elixir at the abstraction level of languages like Python/Ruby/Node.js. Python and Ruby are poor performers. The Python ML stuff all goes into C++ or similar for performance. I’ve worked a bunch with Python and the things I hear from the Ruby world makes them sound quite equivalent in performance. They are a bit slow and can only <a href="https://underjord.io/more-than-one-thing-at-a-time.html">do one thing at a time</a>. Node.js is a bit different. It can do multiple things at a time, if you append asterisks and squint. It does it largely the same way Python + Gevent does it. This approach is incredibly susceptible to CPU-bound work causing head-of-line blocking. It becomes the single most important consideration for building a performant application “get to IO, don’t compute”. V8 that Node.js runs on is heavily optimized and fast for such a dynamic language. I think the BEAM provides a better approach that can deliver comparable results without as many footguns (opportunities for shooting yourself in the foot). But getting better at the raw crunching is a big gain with this JIT implementation and I look forward to the release.</p>
<h2 id="lumen---static-compilation--wasm">Lumen - Static compilation &amp; WASM</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://getlumen.org/">Lumen project</a> is a huge effort by a gang of open source developers and DockYard to implement a compiler (and more) that can take Elixir and Erlang into the browser. By solving that they end up solving static compilation for Erlang and Elixir as well. So this isn’t compiling and shipping the BEAM to the browser. This is a faithful reimplementation of the BEAM functionality in a way that allows it to be compiled statically. It uses LLVM and requires quite a bit of effort both in development and in wrangling the Web Assembly work group process stuff to make sure that the standard is not entirely run by Object-Oriented Programming needs.</p>
<p>I don’t think Lumen will replace the BEAM. The BEAM has a brilliant track record for long-running services and distributed computing that the Lumen project do not even attempt to achieve right now. Instead the Lumen project will allow Elixir and Erlang to move into spaces where the BEAM might be a bit too heavy and still provide the same guarantees. Typically I see it being good for command line tools, web frontends (super interesting to consider the Actor model going there), serverless/edge computing and potentially with WASM competing with Docker as a delivery mechanism for code in Kubernetes, using something like <a href="https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet">Krustlet</a> (<a href="https://player.fm/series/software-sessions/webassembly-on-the-server-with-krustlet">good podcast episode on WASM/Krustlet</a>). It’s probably Cloud Native or something. Who knows.</p>
<p>What gives Lumen the potential to be a better fit in these circumstances is that it can optimize for filesize (by cutting out hot code updates) and it is likely able to start much faster. Lumen is written in Rust. Which seems to be the popular choice around Web Assembly from what I’ve seen. Lumen is still an early release project and not fit for production. But it is beeing actively pushed forward.</p>
<h2 id="nerves---an-iot-platform-with-minimal-suck">Nerves - An IoT platform with minimal suck</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves project</a> is fantastic. I’m a hardware hobbyist, not an IoT dev but I’ve worked a fair bit with Nerves and it is so, so good. What Nerves gives you when working with a Raspberry Pi for example is a way to let your code run all of the device. The BEAM is basically your operating system on top of a minimal Linux installation. The Linux you have is based on the solid foundation of Buildroot so it is quite feasible to modify it as you see fit. The big idea is that if you are running a Linux-level SBC already you might as well build on something that gives you the guarantees of the BEAM.</p>
<p>Beyond that the default setup encodes a lot of good embedded practices by default so that you avoid bricking devices with firmware updates, you get easy support for pushing firmware over the network or USB and much, much more.</p>
<p>There are a ton of good libraries for sensors and assorted hardware, as well as the common protocols like GPIO/SPI/I2C/UART. Networking support is well considered and has been reworked since I first started using Nerves a few years back (and it worked well then too). BLE is getting more and more good support recently.</p>
<p>The project also created <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/nerveshub">NervesHub</a> which is a solution for managing a fleet of devices by securely providing firmware updates, allowing the switching on of a remote console on devices if that’s a need on your product. I think the most recent stuff is a UI revamp and some serious work on binary diffed patches to minimize firmware update sizes for data-constrained deployments.</p>
<p>This is very much a production project and people are shipping hardware with Nerves. It keeps marching forward.</p>
<h2 id="the-beam-can-be-your-entire-application">The BEAM can be your entire application</h2>
<p>Saša Jurić, author of the much-acclaimed Elixir in Action book has produced a library called <a href="https://github.com/sasa1977/site_encrypt">site_encrypt</a>. It allows you to handle LetsEncrypt configuration without a separate webserver or actually using certbot.</p>
<p>Now this library is good and meaningful in its own right but the underlying idea is why I bring it up. The BEAM can be your entire application. This is something I’ve realized over time. Where in Python you would reach for Gunicorn to run you Django app and Nginx to protect Gunicorn from the big bad world.. The BEAM is made for this. Introducing an intermediate layer of Nginx (or another HTTP server) might actually be detrimental in that you now have two things you need to configure correctly and two pools of multi-core processing workers that care about this request/response cycle and can independently screw it up.</p>
<p>The BEAM was always built for this. OTP has a lot weird corners where you find interesting libraries such as <code>wx</code> for WxWidgets (window management) and <code>ssh</code> for both SSH client and server work I believe. Because it is meant to be delivered as a full solution. It can run and manage multiple different types of work inside of it. Gracefully. It doesn’t replace Kubernetes for the large deployment or polyglot environments. But it might very well mean you don’t actually need to go there early. Or you can reduce how much Ops you need in your Dev. If your entire stack is Elixir or Erlang front to back I think you have empowered your developers significantly.</p>
<p>There is already a move towards this where tools are converging that give us a lot of things out of the box that we’d otherwise need to move outside our application for. These are pragmatic 80-90% solutions. The normal solutions are still all there if you need to reach for them. But maybe you don’t. I see these as moves in the same vein:</p>
<ul>
<li>LiveView - We can reduce the amount of frontend we need to build that isn’t BEAM code (Elixir or Erlang), in some cases get rid of it entirely.</li>
<li>Live Dashboard - Application insights right in your application stack instead of pushing them out to another solution.</li>
<li>Phoenix PubSub - Distributed PubSub without requiring coordination via something like Redis.</li>
<li>Phoenix Channels - Distributed PubSub over WebSockets using the above PubSub to coordinate delivery.</li>
<li>Phoenix Presence - Distribute Presence. A CRDT-powered thing for maintaining information about if someone is connected to a channel or not, like chatrooms and online/offline. Using Channels.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lowering complexity by keeping the solutions in a system you understand well is potentially very powerful. At some point many projects will need to pick up external dependencies such as Nginx, Redis or whatever. But I think there is something compelling about building your application inside a system that can do all of it quite well. Elixir and Phoenix already have significant mind-share in the startup world. I wouldn’t be surprised if this ends up being a very popular solution for startups. No frontend-specific code for the MVP, no New Relic or Mixpanel bill we make do with the Live Dashboard. Distribution is Erlang distribution + Swarm/Horde/Libcluster or something …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Animating layout is hard. Prohibitively so; how many ambitious designers have provided dev teams dazzling videos of app-quality UI animations, only to be rebuffed?</p><p>If you're a web developer, what would your reaction be if asked to realise this kind of App Store-style interaction, where an item opens into a full-screen view when clicked:</p><p>Chances are, the two static layouts would be implemented without even an attempt at building the transition. The rationale would be numerous and legitimate: The time constraints versus the sheer complexity of implementation, or the ongoing maintenance of a codebase left in a state of late-game Jenga.</p><p>Maybe even a gut feeling that this kind of animation is literally <em>impossible</em> on the web, no less at a smooth 60 frames per second?</p><p>These reasons (and perhaps more) would burst spiralling out of your weather-worn spider senses, straight into the ears of yet another deflated design team.</p><p>Designers: This isn't a lack of matching ambition. Layout animations on the web present a range of formidable technical and practical barriers.</p><p>In this short series of posts, I'll provide an overview of the layout animation problem and some of the solutions attempted to date.</p><p>Then, I'll present <strong>layout projection</strong>, a new method of animating layouts using the performant CSS <code>transform</code> property. An early implementation of it already powers <a href="https://www.framer.com/examples/magic-motion/">Magic Motion</a> in Framer and the layout animation features in <a href="https://framer.com/motion">Framer Motion</a>.</p><p>Framer Motion presents this complex functionality behind a minimal, declarative API. In the opening App Store demo, all the layout animations were created with this bit of markup:</p><pre><pre><p><span>&lt;</span><span>motion.div</span><span> </span><span>layout</span><span> </span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></p></pre></pre><p>Making the implementation of layout animations easy to write, read and maintain means it's more likely they'll be implemented at all. If a feature is successful you won't be saddled with a delicate codebase. If it isn't successful then you've wasted far less time on polish.</p><p>The <code>layout</code> prop is also great for creating state-driven layout animations, like reordering the items in a list and automatically animating changes in the output:</p><p>A common request is being able to animate <code>height: auto</code> as content is added/removed. Better to do it with <code>transform</code>:</p><p>We can even use this simple API for shared element transitions. By replacing <code>layout</code> with a unique <code>layoutId</code>, we can animate new elements from old ones, as if they were one continuous element:</p><pre><pre><p><span>isSelected </span><span>&amp;&amp;</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>motion.div</span><span> </span><span>layoutId</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>underline</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>/&gt;</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre></pre><p>The user-facing API for layout animations is minimal. But internally, too, the layout projection technique is abstracted to a simple viewport-relative bounding box.</p><p>We'll see how this <strong>viewport box</strong> abstracts the complexities of layout projection so practically and mentally we can concentrate on using it to create advanced animations like shared element transitions and drag-to-reorder. We'll also learn about explorative work to leverage this viewport box to incorporate SVG and WebGL into our performant layout animations.</p><p>Framer Motion is a React library, but in the final part we'll do a technical dive into the key beats of a functional implementation. By the end, I hope to share enough of an understanding of layout projection that a reader could implement their own library around this technique.</p><p>First, let's take a closer look at layout animations, why they're so difficult to perform, and some of the solutions attempted so far.</p></article></div>]]>

  <p>Everyone's angry at the tech industry these days! Tech companies continue to cement their place as some of the most powerful companies in the world, and taking shots at them has become a popular sport. Most recently, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/10/14/923766097/facebook-and-twitter-limit-sharing-new-york-post-story-about-joe-biden">Facebook and Twitter suppressed a controversial New York Post article</a>, raising accusations that the social networks are putting their thumbs on the scale of the upcoming election.</p>
<p>In response, conservatives — <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1316821530769149952?s=20">led by the President</a> — have set their sights on Section 230, the <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230">legislation that protects the right of Internet companies to moderate content</a>. “Repeal Section 230” has become a popular rallying cry from people who believe that large social networks are abusing this ability to enact a political agenda. There’s a lot of rhetoric around “publishers” and “platforms” (the idea being that if you decide to moderate content on your app or website, you should assume legal liability for it) and that Internet companies are breaking the rules by deciding what content to allow.</p>
<p>Naturally, the left disputes the claim that conservatives are being censored. But we can still analyze the power of gatekeeper platforms even if we disagree about how they're wielding it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As we'll see, the law as it exists today expressly permits the moderation in which tech companies engage. More to the point, the platform/publisher dichotomy is rooted in constraints of traditional media that don't apply to the Internet.</p>
<p>Those constraints — or the lack thereof — should guide our efforts to make the Internet a more equitable place. The web in particular was built with the promise of giving everyone a voice; it's only in the last decade or so that power became truly centralized. We keep that promise not by forcing gatekeepers to play fair, but by getting rid of them entirely.</p>
<hr>
<p>In the analog era, the act of publishing was subject to physical constraints. A newspaper, for example, printed a set number of pages a few times daily. If they wanted to publish content by third parties, they had to read it all and make an editorial decision about what made the cut. As a result, publishers were responsible for vetting everything that ran under their masthead.</p>
<p>By contrast, it was unreasonable to expect a news stand to check every word in every newspaper they sold every day. These entities were called “distributors”. If an article in a newspaper turned out to be libelous, only the publisher was on the hook legally, while the distributor enjoyed legal immunity.</p>
<p>The Internet turned this model on its head. Space to publish became infinite, time to publish became instant and distributors became unnecessary. Websites could host discussions between thousands of people in real time, and checking every single comment was infeasible. That then raised the question: who was liable for the comments?</p>
<p>Two lawsuits that are often cited as catalysts for Section 230 are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubby,_Inc._v._CompuServe_Inc"><em>Cubby, Inc. v. CompuServe, Inc.</em></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratton_Oakmont,_Inc._v._Prodigy_Services_Co"><em>Stratton Oakmont, Inc. v. Prodigy Services Co.</em></a> <sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> — both defamation cases against Internet service providers. In the former case, the court ruled that because CompuServe didn’t review any of the content on its forums, it was acting as a distributor and therefore not liable for defamatory content. In the latter case, the court ruled the opposite: because Prodigy moderated users’ comments, it was acting as a publisher.</p>
<p>To resolve this ambiguity, Congress added Section 230 to the Communications Decency Act, which it passed in 1996. The <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230">portion most people are talking about</a> is printed below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>(1) Treatment of publisher or speaker</strong> No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Civil liability</strong> No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of—</p>
<p><strong>(A)</strong> any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected; or</p>
<p><strong>(B)</strong> any action taken to enable or make available to information content providers or others the technical means to restrict access to material described in paragraph (1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both the letter and the spirit of the law are intended to allow Internet services to moderate third-party content however they wish, while shielding them from legal liability if it turns out to be defamatory. Legally, the “publisher vs. platform” dichotomy does not exist.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup></p>
<hr>
<p>The logic behind the repeal of Section 230 seems to be that doing so would force platforms like Twitter to not moderate content. This isn’t strictly true; surely everyone, no matter where they sit on the political spectrum, can think of a biased publisher or two! Twitter would still be free to censor conservative content. The difference is that they would then be liable for any unrelated content they allowed that happened to be defamatory.</p>
<p>A more nuanced read is that the threat of litigation would essentially be a stick that would prevent platforms from moderating. Users couldn’t sue Twitter for removing content — but Twitter would choose not to anyway, for fear of getting sued by someone with deep pockets if they accidentally let a defamatory tweet go viral.</p>
<p>There's no way to know exactly what would happen if 230 were repealed, but here’s a guess at how things might shake out.</p>
<p>At first, a lot of platforms might stop moderating. This would seem like a win for Team Repeal, until they realized what moderation keeps at bay. Blatant racism, doxxing and threats of violence would be commonplace. Spam filtering is a form of moderation, so discussions would be filled with links to porn sites and scams. Actual conversations would get drowned out.</p>
<p>That would be a deal breaker for a lot of people, who would stop using those platforms. It's possible things would end here, and those who could be more thick-skinned would just deal with the death threats and spam. On the other hand, since there's no actual legislation indemnifying platforms if they <strong>don't</strong> moderate — just a shaky legal precedent resting on some decades–old cases — it's possible that we'd start seeing lawsuits anyway.</p>
<p>In response to the legal risk and decaying user bases, companies would start <strong>heavily</strong> moderating — spending a lot of money to make sure they only allow content that doesn’t risk a lawsuit. This might function similarly to the New York Times comment section, where comments are screened before being published. Most of the content people say is being censored now (like the story in the New York Post, which was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/18/business/media/new-york-post-hunter-biden.html">explicitly chosen as a publisher because it wouldn't vet the story</a>) would probably end up on the cutting room floor — it might give someone grounds to sue, so better to just err on the side of caution.</p>
<p>Smaller platforms wouldn’t have the resources to do this. They’d end up either limping on with severely compromised experiences or just going out of business. There would be a steep drop in the number of platforms created, since the spam issue would be especially overwhelming for those in their infancy.</p>
<p>Independent websites would suffer even more. Let's say I added a comments section to this blog, and then one day I started getting flooded with spam. I'd face a dilemma: delete the spam and risk a lawsuit, or let it continue to suffocate the conversation? (Assuming that allowing a free-for-all would indemnify me, which, again, is not guaranteed). I'm not even making any money from this website — is it worth the legal risk?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some crucial web infrastructure simply could not exist without incurring liability. Ranking, for example, is a fundamentally biased act that depends on inferences about both the intent of the reader and the nature of the content being ranked.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> Search engines would be the most obvious casualty, as every search result would present a legal liability. Requiring humans to check each of the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/09/chart-of-the-day-how-many-websites-are-there/">1.7 billion websites</a> would result in far less of the web being searchable. The added difficulty and expense would further entrench Google's search monopoly, which is already <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-to-file-long-awaited-antitrust-suit-against-google-11603195203">the target of a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit</a>.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, the end result would be a chilling effect at all levels of Internet discourse. Most platforms would be far more censorious than they are today, and the rest would be overrun by trolls and spammers. Small platforms would go under — and worse, far fewer would be created in the first place. Interaction on personal websites would almost entirely disappear. Many people would feel intimidated by abuse and threats and withdraw from their public presence online. Others would just get fed up with the spam.</p>
<hr>
<p>A common response to these scenarios is that platforms should have to be neutral with regard to <strong>ideology</strong>, but still be free to filter <strong>spam</strong>.</p>
<p>Okay, so what counts as spam? Some is obvious "I made $1,000 from my couch" type stuff. But the majority falls in a gray area that would create huge headaches for platforms trying to comply with the law and courts trying to enforce it.</p>
<p>Most people who have been online have seen messages for erectile dysfunction drugs or porn sites. But how do you disambiguate between that and online sex workers promoting themselves? What’s the fundamental difference between a sketchy online pharmacy and <a href="https://www.getroman.com/">Roman</a>?<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>If you think those examples are a bit contrived, it’s easy to come up with an example where it’s not only ambiguous whether something is spam, but also unclear whether blocking it would be political censorship.</p>
<p>Say I run a pro-Trump forum on which I occasionally encourage people to buy Trump campaign merch. One day, someone shows up and starts posting links to Biden merch. Is that spam, or political discourse? I can’t very well say advertising campaign merch is prohibited, since I do it myself. Could I ban all promotion of campaign merch? What if they’re not …</p></article></div></div>

<p>There’s a lot we can learn from hundreds of millions of micromobility trips.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the past three years, that fact has become increasingly evident—and increasingly important. Electric scooters have carried tens of millions of riders across hundreds of cities around the world. When combined, these unique trips tell the story of human-sized urban mobility at a macro scale. What streets are the most convenient to travel on two wheels? What times of day are best suited for riding? Where do we tend to park when given the opportunity?</p>



<p>Cities that are listening closely to this story find themselves in a position to do something incredible: make low-cost, high-impact improvements to urban infrastructure based on the real time needs of their inhabitants. It’s the first time in history that such precise, data-backed decision making has been possible for city planning purposes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As one of the founding members of the <a href="https://www.openmobilityfoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>Open Mobility Foundation</span></a>, Bird is proud to have committed to responsible data sharing principles since pioneering shared e-scooters in 2017. To us, the data we learn from is just as important as the vehicles we build, because that’s what allows cities to make critical infrastructure and transit improvements for the benefit of all road users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to turning such information into action, these three cities are doing a particularly good job.</p>



<h3>Atlanta, Georgia, USA</h3>



<p><br>When Bird scooters first arrived in Atlanta, the city had just 4 miles of protected bike lanes. This quickly proved insufficient to safely accommodate the increasing number of micromobility riders, and Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms’ administration took action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By September of 2019, not only had a <a href="https://atlanta.curbed.com/2019/9/25/20882978/mayor-keisha-lance-bottoms-protected-bike-lanes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>$5 million action plan</span></a> been unveiled to add an additional 12 miles of protected Light Individual Transport lanes by 2021, but Mayor Bottoms was already implementing and testing temporary protected infrastructure along the city’s busy 10th Street corridor. The resulting data, shared earlier this year, demonstrate two crucial, correlated points:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>87% of cyclists and 83% of scooter riders said they felt safer during the popup, leading to a</li><li>58% increase in bike and scooter rides during the popup&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><br>“We have heard from residents of Atlanta loud and clear – people want safer streets, and they want to see real changes,” the Mayor <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/atlanta-mayor-bottoms-promises-triple-city-bike-scooter-lanes/zl0kpszowj2E7z7SXLM1mJ/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>said in a statement</span></a>.<br></p>

<h3><br>Tel Aviv, Israel</h3>



<p><br>Last year, Tel Aviv was ranked <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/.premium-tel-aviv-ranked-5th-worst-in-world-for-traffic-congestion-1.8069979" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>5th worst in the world</span></a> for traffic congestion. This year, the city is <a href="https://www.bird.co/blog/reversing-pyramid-tel-aviv-goes-all-in-pedestrians-micromobility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>reversing that trend</span></a> by launching an ambitious initiative that will add 160 km of new micromobility infrastructure by 2025.</p>



<p>The coastal Israeli city has become a global leader in e-scooter adoption. Earlier this year, we announced that riders in Tel Aviv had <a href="https://www.bird.co/blog/tel-aviv-modeshift-milestone-5-million-bird-rides-2-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>surpassed 5 million trips on Bird alone</span></a>. The data collected from these rides has been instrumental in helping city officials plan for infrastructure improvements:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Thanks to the support from and data shared by micromobility operators like Bird, we’ve been able to identify where new infrastructure is most needed in order to encourage modeshift and reduce our dependence on private cars,” said Deputy Mayor Meital Lehavi.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The city plans to use its new infrastructure to coax drivers out of their cars, increasing the amount of micromobility commuters from 11% to 25% over the next 5 years.&nbsp;<br></p>

<h3><br>Santa Monica, California, USA</h3>



<p><br>The beachside city of Santa Monica in Los Angeles County passed a Bike Action Plan in 2011 that was one of the first of its kind in the country. It created <a href="https://www.smdp.com/letter-to-the-editor-in-support-of-santa-monicas-proposed-bike-action-plan-amendment/197427" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>hundreds of miles</span></a> of bike lanes and bike friendly corridors, reinforcing the city’s commitment to safer streets and cleaner air.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2020, city officials decided to amend that plan in order to once again take a leading role nationwide in micromobility infrastructure—this time by focusing on protected bike and scooter lanes. By analyzing scooter data from millions of trips along with information on car congestion and accidents, those drafting the amendment were able to lay out an additional 19 miles of separated micromobility infrastructure and amenities that will increase bike and scooter use and decrease reliance on personal cars and ride hailing.</p>



<p>The amendment reflects Santa Monica’s ambitious goal of reducing carbon emissions <a href="https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/news/santa-monica-ca-passes-800m-plan-to-go-carbon-neutral-by-2050/555693/#:~:text=The%20Climate%20Action%20%26%20Adaptation%20Plan,%2C%20bike%2C%20scooter%20or%20skateboard." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>80% below 1990 levels</span></a> by 2030. A survey conducted last year reported that nearly 50% of micromobility riders used either a shared bike or scooter to <a href="https://www.smgov.net/uploadedFiles/Departments/PCD/Transportation/SharedMobilityUserSurveyReports_Combined.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>replace a car</span></a> during their most recent trip. That’s an impressive accomplishment by any measure.</p>



<p>Councilmembers <a href="https://www.smdp.com/city-amends-bike-action-plan-to-include-more-safety-lanes/197572" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>voted unanimously</span></a> to pass the Bike Action Plan Amendment earlier this month.<br></p>

            <p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wedding-website/image/upload/c_scale,w_2400/v1597095361/krzysztof-grech-6orUY98fw9s-unsplash_r6wjnf.jpg"></p>



<p>I’ve struggled to find references to this online, but heard the name used multiple times this year when describing the approach outlined here.</p>

<p>The general idea of an “Islands” architecture is deceptively simple: render HTML pages on the server, and inject placeholders or slots around highly dynamic regions. These placeholders/slots contain the server-rendered HTML output from their corresponding widget. They denote regions that can then be "hydrated" on the client into small self-contained widgets, reusing their server-rendered initial HTML.</p>

<p>You can think of this like a static HTML document that contains multiple separate embedded applications:</p>

<p>  
<img width="600" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wedding-website/image/upload/v1596766231/islands-architecture-1.png">  
</p>

<p>This may seem similar to "micro-frontends" at first glance. Both approaches share the idea of breaking applications up into independent units, however "micro-frontends" do not typically imply that composition of those units is achieved using HTML.</p>

<p>A closer analog to the "islands" approach would be progressive enhancement, to which we're essentially adding SSR hydration and a consistent metaphor for adding interactivity to a region of the page. In traditional progressive enhancement, we might have a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> that looks for an image carousel in the page and instantiates a jQuery plugin on it. Instead, that image carousel would be rendered on the server and a dedicated <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> emitted for it that loads the image carousel implementation and in-place upgrades it to be interactive.</p>

<h3 id="whydoesthismatter">Why does this matter?</h3>

<p>As it turns out, there are a number of benefits to the group of approaches described here when compared to typical Single Page Application architectures.</p>

<h5 id="progressivehydrationforfree">"Progressive Hydration" for free</h5>

<p>I’ve touted the performance benefits of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-A2VfuUROg">Progressive Hydration</a> techniques for frameworks like React, Angular, Preact and Vue. With these architectures, individual widgets on a page are loaded and initialized over time. This can be done using a simple scheduling approach via requestIdleCallback, or can take additional factors into account like viewport visibility, interaction likelihood, product value, etc.</p>

<p>Similar to Progressive Hydration, rendering pages using an islands architecture results in the heavier dynamic portions of the page being initialized not just progressively, but <em>separately</em>. This means individual regions of the page become interactive without anything else on the page needing to be loaded first.</p>

<p>Unlike Progressive Hydration, the approaches that fall out of building around an islands architecture do not require top-down rendering. This is a distinct advantage, since there are no outer “root” components that must be initialized before their descendants. Each part of the page is an isolated unit, and a performance issue in one unit doesn't affect the others.</p>

<h5 id="seoanduxarentatradeoff">SEO and UX aren’t a tradeoff</h5>

<p>The status quo for SSR as used by Single Page Applications is that it’s often cited as a necessity for SEO reasons. However, SSR can actually have a net <em>negative</em> impact on User Experience - visitors are left waiting for the actual functionality of a page to arrive while staring at a frustratingly fake version of that page.</p>

<p>Many applications also suffer from silent SSR performance pitfalls without realizing it. In virtual DOM libraries, it's easy (and common) to accidentally construct a situation where first render destroys the server-rendered HTML DOM, only to recreate it again from scratch (often synchronously). This is the result of some common misconceptions, which may stem from documentation giving an idealized view of hydration while passing over tricky caveats and footguns.</p>

<p>Even in cases where SSR hydration is functioning as designed, the status quo leaves a lot to be desired. The amount of JavaScript work being performed during page load is still many orders of magnitude more than what might be considered "efficient".</p>

</figure>

<p>In an "islands" model, server rendering is not a bolt-on optimization aimed at improving SEO or UX. Instead, it is a fundamental part of how pages are delivered to the browser. The HTML returned in response to navigation contains a meaningful and immediately renderable representation of the content the user requested.</p>

<p>Sections of that HTML may be missing their client-side interactivity, but the document should at least contain the most essential content. For example: a news page’s HTML would contain the article body, and a product page would contain that product’s description.</p>

<p>All of the other content is secondary to this information, and its inclusion in the HTML becomes a product decision. How vital is this bit of information to a user visiting the page? How important is that widget to the business model? A "buy now" button that directly relates to revenue should be easily prioritized over a site feedback survey button that relates to information gathering.</p>

<h5 id="betterforaccessibilityanddiscoverability">Better for accessibility and discoverability</h5>

<p>A website that uses standard HTML links for navigation is easier for assistive technologies and web crawlers to use. This is true regardless of whether links or forms are intercepted by JavaScript and rerouted to client-side logic, because the underlying assumptions remain true: clicking a link navigates to the given page.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, think of the number of times you’ve been sent a “link” to what the sender assumed was the page they were viewing, only to realize the link contained none of the necessary information:</p>

</p>

<p>Building page-based applications doesn't completely prevent these types of strange experiences, it only makes the decision to do so more direct. It makes the default outcome the accessible one.</p>

<hr>

<p>When it comes down to it, shipping an architecture that requires less code to do something is the type of long-term benefit your future self (or coworkers) will thank you for. It's possible — likely, even — that adopting a model like this requires more up-front design thinking. There are far few batteries-included options available for decomposing apps into independently deliverable widgets. Who knows, maybe we can fix that.</p>

</p>
<p>Last week, when <a href="https://www.tabsoverspaces.com/233837-net-developerdays-2020">speaking at .NET Developer Days</a>, I got a question about the query cache in Entity Framework Core – is it shared across <code>DbContext</code>s or is it per instance? With this question I realized I know how the cache work(ed) in Entity Framework 6, but I’m not entirely sure how it’s done in Entity Framework Core. Time to explore! And you can go with me.</p>
<!-- excerpt -->
<p>Let’s do some basic thinking first. Does it make sense to have query cache across instances? For the same <code>DbContext</code> type and hence same model (<code>IModel</code>) for sure. Could it be useful for different <code>DbContext</code>s? Maybe. Probably not. Although you can have, i.e. when using <em>bounded contexts</em>, <code>DbContext</code>s with overlap, the query would have to use only the overlapping part of the model and the cache would have to be able to work on fine granularity.</p>
<p>I’ll try to figure out the result only searching file names, types, content and reading pieces of code. Here we go.</p>
<p>The query cache should be in some file containing <em>query</em> and <em>cache</em> in its name, right? Luckily there’s a <code>CompiledQueryCache.cs</code>. Nice, there’s a <code>IMemoryCache</code> being used and the description states it is a <em>singleton</em>. And the <code>GetOrAddQuery</code> method already has the <em>key</em> as an input argument. This comes from <code>QueryCompiler</code> class and <code>ICompiledQueryCacheKeyGenerator.GenerateCacheKey</code> is used. The <code>CompiledQueryCacheKeyGenerator</code> is the implementation of that interface and it just returns instance of <code>CompiledQueryCacheKey</code>, which is defined as <code>protected readonly struct CompiledQueryCacheKey : IEquatable&lt;CompiledQueryCacheKey&gt;</code>. Cool. The equality is implemented as follows.</p>
<pre><code>public bool Equals(CompiledQueryCacheKey other)
{
    return ReferenceEquals(_model, other._model)
        &amp;&amp; _queryTrackingBehavior == other._queryTrackingBehavior
        &amp;&amp; _async == other._async
        &amp;&amp; ExpressionEqualityComparer.Instance.Equals(_query, other._query);
}

public override int GetHashCode()
{
    var hash = new HashCode();
    hash.Add(_query, ExpressionEqualityComparer.Instance);
    hash.Add(_model);
    hash.Add(_queryTrackingBehavior);
    hash.Add(_async);
    return hash.ToHashCode();
}
</code></pre>
<p>OK, so it’s checking the selected <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/querying/tracking"><em>tracking</em> behavior</a>, whether it’s <em>async</em> and finally the model plus query. The <code>ExpressionEqualityComparer</code> and specifically the <code>ExpressionComparer</code> seems to be checking whether the “structure” of the query is the same. Makes sense, the <em>canonical</em> version of the query is very likely done in another place. That leaves us only with <code>ReferenceEquals(_model, other._model)</code>.</p>
<p>Clearly this is comparing references, hence the question is whether the model (<code>IModel</code>) is somewhat cached between instances too. Again, probably the file is gonna have <em>model</em> and <em>cache</em> in its name. And there seems to be <code>IModelCacheKeyFactory</code> where the implementation <code>ModelCacheKeyFactory</code> is using just <code>ModelCacheKey</code>. And this class has a nice comment.</p>
<pre><code>///         A key that uniquely identifies the model for a given context. This is used to store and lookup
///         a cached model for a given context. This default implementation uses the context type as they key, thus
///         assuming that all contexts of a given type have the same model.
</code></pre>
<p>So, the <code>Type</code> of <code>DbContext</code> is used for equality comparisons.</p>
<p>And here you have it. When everything is put together, we can infer the query cache is using <code>IMemoryCache</code> as an implementation, it’s a <em>singleton</em> (aka shared across everything in Entity Framework Core) and caching key ultimately depends on the model, which is the same across same <code>DbContext</code>s.</p>

		<p>For the past 15 years I’ve been a very opinionated PC gamer, along with the rest of my family. However it’s always been a pain in some shape or form to <em>be</em> a PC gamer, be it with the constant software updates, the lack of first-party support, or just the general cost. I’m one of these people that has stuck to good old Windows 7 because a mobile UI on my gaming PC is what I imagine hell to be. I’ve had no problems thus far, but there are more and more 10-only games coming out by the day, and some of them are enticing an upgrade.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there has been a LOT of activity around Wine and Vulkan to get Windows games running on Linux, to the point where I scheduled some time this Christmas break to give it a shot. My goal was to run the few games I actually wanted to play (Elite Dangerous, Minecraft, Subnautica, Garry’s Mod) on Linux on a spare computer before the 25th, whilst also proving to my family of gamers that it was time to “break the glass” and get away from the proprietary OS.</p>
<h2 id="by-the-way-i-tried-to-use-arch">By the way I tried to use Arch</h2>

<p><a href="https://m1cr0man.com/posts/gaming-on-linux/images/2018-12-24-003401_1440x900_scrot.jpg"><img src="https://m1cr0man.com/posts/gaming-on-linux/images/2018-12-24-003401_1440x900_scrot_hue660b04f3b99512430f28cfa69e907e7_222930_0x384_resize_q85_gaussian.jpg" title="Desktop"></a></p><p>I don’t think it’s possible to ever finish installing Arch, you just get more things configured (and broken) over time. I started this week trying to set up a system with Steam installed and Linux compatible games running. It took a full day’s work to get through the numerous issues I encountered, but I eventually had Garry’s Mod launching, albeit with some weird error about <code>en_US.UTF8</code> not being available.</p>
<p>At that point, I wasn’t at all happy with the setup. I had a very minimal i3, a very broken version of Steam with all sorts of rendering issues, and one native Linux game limping along. I installed LXDE so that I had a window manager that cooperated with the concept of full screen graphics applications, but even with my high tolerance for outdated looking UIs I still couldn’t help but dislike the default theme. I spent a good few hours fixing that but it was still uncomfortable to use.</p>
<p>I tried setting up <a href="https://lutris.net/">Lutris</a> too. They recommend installing wine-staging which is no problem on Arch because you just grab the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/wine-staging-git/">wine-staging AUR package</a> and job done. However I still couldn’t get it to launch any games due to all sorts of missing dependencies in Wine (and maybe due to my Donegal internet too).</p>
<p>When I realized I needed to install most 32 bit versions for everything I accepted defeat. It was going to be too much hassle to configure + maintain an Arch gaming install, and I’d never want to reload that machine. I took a night to think about it, then I broke up with Arch in the morning.</p>
<h2 id="solus-is-new-bae">Solus is new bae</h2>
<p>Whilst I was browsing around on Lutris, Reddit, and some other sites I kept seeing mentions of this new Debian based distro with some real fancy window manager. With my lack of motivation to do configuration myself my requirements were now very different as to when I picked Arch. However, with the need for a very new version of Steam + Wine in order to play games I needed something that had either frequent updates or a way to easily update manually.</p>
<p>The Solus website looked very appealing. “Designed for Home Computing”. Last time I read that I set up Mint on my granny’s laptop, and I don’t think she used it since. However something about the material design of its site and UI made me think it was at least worth a shot.</p>
<p>I downloaded the ISO, booted up a computer, and in about 10 minutes I had a running machine. This PC does have an SSD in it, but even so it took just 4 seconds to boot to the login screen! My mentality of it needing to be Arch to boot fast went right out the window.</p>
<p>I logged in and a lot of things were just working, which was great, but then again my expectations were very low coming from Arch. There was a remarkable lack of shit installed by default. LibreOffice is there but not GIMP, and there’s only 1 video player instead of 4. As a result I didn’t spend any time undoing defaults, which I had fully expected from a “home computing” distribution.</p>
<h2 id="who-needs-terminals">Who Needs Terminals?</h2>
<p>I got Steam and Proton installed again, this time with no hassle because I used the Solus Software Centre and it just worked. Whilst that was downloading I copied Garry’s Mod over from another Windows computer on the network through the file manager because apparently it just supports CIFS out of the box. I launched that game no problem, so then I started looking at Lutris again.</p>
<p>I was under the impression that I was going to need Lutris to play basically anything that wasn’t a Steam native Linux game. It turns out that is not entirely true. My next game goal was Elite Dangerous, so I copied it over the network too and Steam picked it up fine. Testing my luck I just hit “play” with the Steam Proton version set to the latest beta, but it did absolutely nothing. Then I tried launching it through Lutris. I got a bit suspicious when I saw the Steam install downloader pop up, and then I realized it was creating its own “prefix” for Steam Windows under Wine, ignoring the system version I had installed entirely.</p>
<p>So I wasn’t going to use Lutris for Elite then, and I got a bit worried. If it didn’t launch through Steam would it work at all? I searched around and saw lots of people trying to get it to work, and then I found <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/150">this Github issue</a> which lead to <a href="https://github.com/redmcg/wine/releases/tag/ED_Proton_3.16-6_Beta">this forked repo release</a>. With that, I had the game running flawlessly in like 20 minutes, and I even <a href="https://twitter.com/m1cr0m4n/status/1076614809414782976">tweeted about it</a>.</p>
<p>Other than installing the ED Proton fork, I had no need for a terminal during this process. I call that a testament to this OS. Generally, I only need a terminal when something breaks or something is more easily/quickly done at the prompt. My point being that if you were a Windows gamer trying to justify the conversion, you can rest assured that there is no need for any prior knowledge of Linux, or maybe even computers, to pull this off.</p>
<h2 id="real-work-on-solus">Real Work on Solus</h2>

<p><a href="https://m1cr0man.com/posts/gaming-on-linux/images/Screenshot%20from%202018-12-24%2001-20-04.jpg"><img src="https://m1cr0man.com/posts/gaming-on-linux/images/Screenshot%20from%202018-12-24%2001-20-04_huc4494bcc592d409b6b1867b12478b696_518421_0x384_resize_q85_gaussian.jpg" title="Solus"></a></p><p>It’s been so long since I used a “real” distro I can’t really separate what is unique to Solus from the common features you get nowadays. Setting up my networking and audio was painless. It’s Network Manager based networking with that regular GNOME GUI you see everywhere. You can control your audio volumes per-application from the pop out side bar in the UI. I noticed whilst I was installing all sorts of random stuff that the Solus not-a-start-menu was populating shortcuts and categories for everything. Also once I got the Nvidia driver installed everything like moving windows around was silky smooth. Honestly, I don’t think I want to use i3 any more.</p>
<p>With this level of confidence, I even went and setup my browser, IRC client, and a bunch of other stuff I would only do if I was committed to an install. What I wanted to try next was remote desktop gaming using TurboVNC, and I immediately encountered a problem. TurboVNC wasn’t in Solus' repositories so I was going to have to build it myself. I’m so glad I did.</p>
<p>Solus has a really nice YAML based system for developing packages. It does 90% of the work for you which is awesome. It will setup a build environment in a chroot, install dependencies, run commands, and generate a package all based on this one package.yaml. Their documentation on this setup is quite easy to follow, but I did pop into their IRC for a few questions.</p>
<p>I ended up building 3 packages for TVNC + its dependencies, and it didn’t take too long. From talking to a few developers and package maintainers, I’m quite tempted to submit + maintain these packages for Solus too. This blog post isn’t going to be about remote desktop gaming though so I’ll leave that for another day.</p>
<h2 id="convincing-the-family">Convincing the Family</h2>
<p>Over this weekend I played around 8 hours of Elite, whilst on Discord, on this really weirdly spec’d computer with an i3 2100 and a GTX 970. I had zero issues, both in setup and performance, and I spent way more time actually playing the games than I expected to.</p>
<p>When I mention the idea of using Linux to my brother, I always get an immediate no. “It’s for geeks”, “I can’t code”, “X won’t run on it”. I was able to prove him wrong on at least 2 of his points, but really it would be so much better if we all ran Linux. One of the biggest problems we have at the moment is that every time we make a significant hardware change to one of our computers, we have to reload the OS. We wouldn’t have to do that if we were running Solus on all the PCs. Also, Windows 7 isn’t exactly secure anymore. It hasn’t got real updates in like 2 years now, and we have turned them off before that to avoid breaking some games relying on old DRM (read: Securom) technology.</p>
<p>I don’t think it is going to take me much longer to convert every one given how much faster, simpler and prettier running a modern Linux distribution is. So long as I can prove that new and old games will work fine and continue to work when I’m not around I might be in for a chance of having a standardized boot image on all of our computers. This is appealing because living in Donegal you can’t be doing any sort of updates whilst playing games online otherwise your ping will go through the roof. You still have to do updates at some point, the question is how many times do you have to do them.</p>
<p>I’ll continue to test more games and work out a way I can easily deploy an entire Linux gaming setup to more computers. It is already exceptionally simple, but I need a turnkey solution to running Windows games on Steam that I can hand to people that have no idea what <code>ls</code> does.</p>

    <div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>This tutorial will help you to get up and running with Speechly by guiding you through the process of building a simple voice filtering web app with Speechly and React.</p>
<p>You can find the source code for this tutorial <a href="https://github.com/speechly/react-example-repo-filtering">on GitHub</a> and you can also try out the final result <a href="http://speechly.github.io/react-example-repo-filtering/">hosted on GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Since we’ll be using <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started">create-react-app</a> for this tutorial, we’ll need the following tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Node.js 8.10+</li>
<li>npm 5.2+</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this tutorial also uses TypeScript, so feel free to check out <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs">TypeScript documentation</a> if you’re not familiar with it.</p>
<h3 id="1-creating-an-app">1. Creating an app</h3>
<p>Let’s get started by creating an app and installing its dependencies:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">npx create-react-app speechly-voice-filter --typescript
<span>cd</span> speechly-voice-filter
npm i
</code></pre></div><p>Now that you’ve created the app, you can check it out by running <code>npm start</code> - it should open a browser tab with your app running in it.</p>
<h3 id="2-adding-data-and-layout">2. Adding data and layout</h3>
<p>Since we are building a filtering app, let’s add some data to filter and layout to display it.</p>
<p>To make it simple, our data source will be just a static array with some popular repositories on GitHub. Let’s add the following code and save it as <code>src/data.ts</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ts"><span>export</span> type Repository <span>=</span> {

<div><pre><code data-lang="tsx"><span>import</span> React from <span>"react"</span>;

<span>import</span> { repositories } from <span>"./data"</span>;

<span>import</span> { RepoList } from <span>"./RepoList"</span>;

<div><pre><code data-lang="tsx"><span>import</span> React from <span>"react"</span>;
<span>import</span> { SpeechProvider } from <span>"@speechly/react-client"</span>;

<p>Before we proceed with the app, let’s take a quick detour and train a very simple and not very useful Speechly app, so that we can use it to test our integration later on.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="https://speechly.com/dashboard">https://speechly.com/dashboard</a> and login (or sign up if you haven’t yet) and create a new app (you can <a href="https://www.speechly.com/docs/quick-start/">check our Speechly Dashboard quickstart guide</a> if you feel lost). Feel free to use any configuration you want, even an almost empty configuration with just “Hello world” will suffice, but make sure your app is deployed!</p>

            <em>A simple Speechly configuration example</em>
        </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Once you have your Speechly app deployed, let’s integrate it. Start by installing Speechly React client:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">npm i --save @speechly/react-client
</code></pre></div><p>The client exposes a context provider and a hook that allows you to consume that context. Let’s add the context provider to <code>src/App.tsx</code>. Make sure you provide the <code>App ID</code> of your Speechly app as a property for <code>SpeechProvider</code>!</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="tsx"><span>import</span> React from <span>"react"</span>;
<span>import</span> { SpeechProvider } from <span>"@speechly/react-client"</span>;

<span>import</span> <span>"./App.css"</span>;

<span>function</span> App()<span>:</span> JSX.Element {
  <span>return</span> (
    <span>&lt;</span>div className<span>=</span><span>"App"</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span>SpeechProvider appId<span>=</span><span>"your-app-id-here"</span> language<span>=</span><span>"en-US"</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>SpeechApp <span>/&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span><span>/SpeechProvider&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>/div&gt;</span>
  );
}

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> App;
</code></pre></div><p>Next, let’s add some code to act as the microphone button. Also, it would be nice to see what we are saying, so let’s also render the transcript next to the button for some feedback. Let’s make that a separate component and save it as <code>src/Microphone.tsx</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="tsx"><span>import</span> React from <span>"react"</span>;
<span>import</span> {
  Word <span>as</span> SpeechWord,
  SpeechSegment,
  SpeechState,

        text <span>=</span> <span>"Stop"</span>;
        <span>break</span>;
      <span>case</span> SpeechState.Connecting:
      <span>case</span> SpeechState.Loading:
        <span>enabled</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span>;
        text <span>=</span> <span>"Loading..."</span>;
        <span>break</span>;
    }

    <span>return</span> (
      <span>&lt;</span>div<span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>button onClick<span>=</span>{onRecord} disabled<span>=</span>{<span>!</span>enabled}<span>&gt;</span>
          {text}

        <span>&lt;</span>Transcript segment<span>=</span>{segment} <span>/&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span><span>/div&gt;</span>
    );
  }
);

<span>const</span> Transcript <span>=</span> React.memo(
  ({ segment }<span>:</span> { segment?: <span>SpeechSegment</span> })<span>:</span> JSX.Element <span>=&gt;</span> {
    <span>if</span> (segment <span>===</span> <span>undefined</span>) {
      <span>return</span> (
        <span>&lt;</span>div<span>&gt;</span>
          <span>&lt;</span>em<span>&gt;</span>Waiting <span>for</span> speech input...<span>&lt;</span><span>/em&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span><span>/div&gt;</span>
      );
    }

    <span>return</span> (
      <span>&lt;</span>div<span>&gt;</span>
        {segment.words.map((w) <span>=&gt;</span> (
          <span>&lt;</span>Word word<span>=</span>{w} key<span>=</span>{w.index} <span>/&gt;</span>
        ))}
      <span>&lt;</span><span>/div&gt;</span>
    );
  }
);

<span>const</span> Word <span>=</span> React.memo(
  ({ word }<span>:</span> { word: <span>SpeechWord</span> })<span>:</span> JSX.Element <span>=&gt;</span> {
    <span>if</span> (word.isFinal) {
      <span>return</span> <span>&lt;</span>strong<span>&gt;</span>{<span>`</span><span>${</span>word.value<span>}</span><span> `</span>}<span>&lt;</span><span>/strong&gt;;</span>
    }

    <span>return</span> <span>&lt;</span>span<span>&gt;</span>{<span>`</span><span>${</span>word.value<span>}</span><span> `</span>}<span>&lt;</span><span>/span&gt;;</span>
  }
);
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see, this component renders a button that calls the <code>onRecord</code> callback passed in the properties and uses the state of Speechly client to determine when to enable the button and which text to use as its label. In addition to that, the component also renders the transcript of the phrase by assembling individual transcripted words from a segment (check out <a href="https://www.speechly.com/docs/speechly-api/#understanding-server-responses">this article in our documentation</a> for more information about how SLU API works). Since a word can be either tentative (i.e., its value can change as the API receives more audio data) or final, we use bold text to highlight final words.</p>
<p>One more step - we’d need to render our component and hook it up to the API. Let’s add it to our <code>SpeechApp</code> component:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="tsx"><span>import</span> React from <span>"react"</span>;
<span>import</span> { useSpeechContext } from <span>"@speechly/react-client"</span>;

<span>import</span> { repositories } from <span>"./data"</span>;

<span>import</span> { RepoList } from <span>"./RepoList"</span>;
<span>import</span> { Microphone } from <span>"./Microphone"</span>;

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> SpeechApp: <span>React.FC</span> <span>=</span> ()<span>:</span> JSX.Element <span>=&gt;</span> {
  <span>const</span> { toggleRecording, speechState, segment } <span>=</span> useSpeechContext();

  <span>return</span> (

Peterson</a></strong>&nbsp;is a Canadian clinical psychologist and psychology professor at the University of Toronto who became a controversial figure in late-2016 for his critiques of political correctness. Peterson’s most recent book, 12 Rules for Life, has sold over 3 million copies worldwide. Most recently, Peterson has suffered from health issues that necessitated a year-long reprieve from the public eye.</p><h4><strong>Success compounds, meaning those that win tend to continue to win</strong></h4><p>Lobsters are interesting animals, but most people don’t think about them too often. <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/dont-listen-to-the-buzz-lobsters-arent-actually-immortal-88450872/">While they may not be immortal as many like to think</a>, they never stop growing and can regenerate lost limbs. Unfortunately for them, they taste good with butter - but let’s circle back to lobsters here in a minute.</p><p>In the early 1900s, an Italian engineer, sociologist, economist, political scientist, and philosopher (but he was probably no fun at parties, so you got him there) named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilfredo_Pareto#Economic_concepts">Vilfredo Pareto</a> became fascinated by the ideas of wealth and power - namely, how is wealth distributed across society? (Interestingly, he did not start this work until his forties, <a href="https://newsletter.butwhatfor.com/p/takeaway-friday-a-stoic-philosopher">so it is never too late to make a difference</a>.)</p><p>Ever diligent, he pulled data from the 1400s through his modern times and found the same pattern everywhere. Whereas people had previously assumed that wealth would be distributed in a flat, upward-sloping line from poor to rich, what Pareto found was in fact a hockey stick - a small percentage of the population holds a majority of the wealth.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb31aa6-3ff3-4fba-b50a-82da1fb89f75_700x400.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb31aa6-3ff3-4fba-b50a-82da1fb89f75_700x400.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fcb31aa6-3ff3-4fba-b50a-82da1fb89f75_700x400.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:400,&quot;width&quot;:700,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:110387,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></p><p>This kind of distribution - the most successful / most productive / largest “winners” continuously having a greater chunk of the pie - can be seen across many different fields.</p><blockquote><p>That same brutal principle of unequal distribution applies outside the financial domain—indeed, anywhere that creative production is required. The majority of scientific papers are published by a very small group of scientists. A tiny proportion of musicians produces almost all the recorded commercial music. Just a handful of authors sell all the books. A million and a half separately titled books (!) sell each year in the US. However, only five hundred of these sell more than a hundred thousand copies. Similarly, just four classical composers (Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, and Tchaikovsky) wrote almost all the music played by modern orchestras. Bach, for his part, composed so prolifically that it would take decades of work merely to hand-copy his scores, yet only a small fraction of this prodigious output is commonly performed...</p><p>It also applies to the population of cities (a very small number have almost all the people), the mass of heavenly bodies (a very small number hoard all the matter), and the frequency of words in a language (90 percent of communication occurs using just 500 words), among many other things. Sometimes it is known as the Matthew Principle (Matthew 25:29), derived from what might be the harshest statement ever attributed to Christ: “to those who have everything, more will be given; from those who have nothing, everything will be taken.”</p></blockquote><p>This idea was further expanded in the mid-1900s when British physicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_J._de_Solla_Price">Derek Price</a> noticed that certain of his colleague were prolific publishers and others - well, not so much. In fact, Price could fit most domains of publication to a “law” stating that half of all papers are written by the square root of the number of all writers - if you had 100 papers written by 25 people, 50 papers would have been written by only 5 individuals. If it was 1,000 papers and 250 people, 500 papers were written by only 16 people. Thus, there was always an active minority generating the majority of the work.</p><p>These results can be understood as it relates to the compounding effects of resources - those that have previously “won” generally have access to the greatest resources and can more easily utilize those resources to achieve additional success. Those without resources cannot. </p><p>Thus, resources beget additional resources while losing resources restricts your ability to gain resources in the future - <em>winners are more likely to win again, and losers more likely to lose</em>.</p><p>However, there is also something going on in the brain that makes those that win more likely to pursue meaningful, productive activities again in the future.</p><h4>Your brain is aware of where you are within the winner-loser continuum and makes plans based on where it thinks you sit</h4><p>Back to the lobsters. Lobsters live in a cold, brutal world where things such as ideal lobster nests (think “safe hiding places”) and access to food are both paramount and scarce. This scarcity can result in conflict. So how do you determine which lobsters lay claim to the best nests?</p><p>As you might have guessed, they fight for them - and Peterson goes into detail on lobster confrontation rituals in his book. Important to this conversation is what happens in the brains of lobsters that win and lobsters that lose.</p><blockquote><p>A lobster loser’s brain chemistry differs importantly from that of a lobster winner. This is reflected in their relative postures. Whether a lobster is confident or cringing depends on the ratio of two chemicals that modulate communication between lobster neurons: serotonin and octopamine. Winning increases the ratio of the former to the latter.</p><p>A lobster with high levels of serotonin and low levels of octopamine is a cocky, strutting sort of shellfish, much less likely to back down when challenged. This is because serotonin helps regulate postural flexion. A flexed lobster extends its appendages so that it can look tall and dangerous, like Clint Eastwood in a spaghetti Western…</p><p>High serotonin/low octopamine characterizes the victor. The opposite neurochemical configuration, a high ratio of octopamine to serotonin, produces a defeated-looking, scrunched-up, inhibited, drooping, skulking sort of lobster, very likely to hang around street corners, and to vanish at the first hint of trouble.</p></blockquote><p>The lobster’s brain knows whether it just lost or won a fight. The victor confidently holds himself up high and the loser shirks from potential conflict. And this makes sense - it is advantageous to your survival to avoid conflict if you tend to lose because 1) you tend to lose and 2) having lost, you now have access to less advantageous resources (food and shelter). The winner is confident in his access to resources and knows, based on experience, that he can win future fights.</p><p>These changes in how the lobster orients itself to the world start deep within its brain, with levels of serotonin driving physical changes in the external lobster. This brain infrastructure is very similar to what sits inside humans, who also take into account where they are in the “tend to win and have resources / tend to lose and don’t have resources” continuum.</p><blockquote><p>The part of our brain that keeps track of our position in the dominance hierarchy is therefore <a href="https://newsletter.butwhatfor.com/p/takeaway-tuesday-knowing-history">exceptionally ancient and fundamental</a>.&nbsp;It is a master control system, modulating our perceptions, values,&nbsp;emotions, thoughts and actions…</p><p>The ancient part of your brain specialized for assessing dominance watches how you are treated by other people. On that evidence, it renders a determination of your value and assigns you a status. If you are judged by your peers as of little worth, the counter restricts serotonin availability. That makes you much more physically and psychologically reactive to any circumstance or event that might produce emotion, particularly if it is negative. You need that reactivity. Emergencies are common at the bottom, and you must be ready to survive.</p></blockquote><p>If you are lower on the totem pole, being constantly prepared for emergencies eventually takes its toll on you given your orientation towards short-term survival at the expense of long-term success. It impacts everything, from the way your body allocates resources to its immune system (long-term investment) to your fight-or-flight response sensitivity (expensive short-term preparedness). </p><p>But this all makes sense for the competitive world our ancestors grew up in. </p><blockquote><p>Unfortunately, that physical hyper-response, that constant alertness, burns up a lot of precious energy and physical resources. This response is really what everyone calls stress, and it is by no means only or even primarily psychological. It’s a reflection of the genuine constraints of unfortunate circumstances. When operating at the bottom, the ancient brain counter assumes that even the smallest unexpected&nbsp;impediment might produce an uncontrollable chain of negative events, which will have to be handled alone, as useful friends are rare indeed, on society’s fringes. You will therefore continually sacrifice what you could otherwise physically store for the future, using it up on heightened readiness and the possibility of immediate panicked action in the present… The physical demands of emergency preparedness will wear you down in every way.</p><p>If you have a high status, on the other hand, the counter’s cold, pre-reptilian mechanics assume that your niche is secure, productive and safe, and that you are well buttressed with social support. It thinks the chance that something will damage you is low and can be safely discounted. Change might be opportunity, instead of disaster. The serotonin flows plentifully. This renders you confident and calm, standing tall and straight, and much less on constant alert. Because your position is secure, the future is likely to be good for you. It’s worthwhile to think in the long term and plan for a better tomorrow.</p></blockquote><h4>Feedback loops can both hurt you and help you</h4><p>This whole process is an example of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocatalysis#:~:text=A%20single%20chemical%20reaction%20is,is%20called%20an%20autocatalytic%20reaction.">autocatalytic reaction</a> - a chemical reaction where one of the reaction products (in this case “losing”) …</p></div></div>

In fact, Tem published the first Notion website back in March 2020 (oh, how the world has changed). </span></span></p><p><span><span>Thanks in large to awesome projects like Super and Fruition, building websites on Notion became easier and faster. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Given the surge in popularity, I deciced to pen this comprehensive guide and create some duplicable blocks, so you can create your own Notion website in no time — enjoy 🙌</span></span></p></div></div><h2><span id="cc149452e88b42e8b29622443a589d9c"></span><span><span>🔑 An overview of the guide</span></span></h2><div id="c496b9ce8126498e85222feb210e850b"><div id="4e7f6e020650473a8d103736b9068090"><p><span><span>Making a landing page with Notion is easy to the point of enjoyable — you don't need any coding skills at all. It's also flexible — you can mix, match, and style various blocks to get the look and feel needed to present your idea (or product) just the right way.</span></span></p><p><span><span>This guide will walk you through every step of setting up your landing with Notion, publishing it to the web, adding analytics and custom styling. As a cherry on top, we've also curated 10 ready-made components that you can use to get your Notion landing page out in no time.</span></span></p></div></div><h2><span id="4b158c7e538e49518051b4d9b3d1f780"></span><span><span>🎯 Setting your landing page goals</span></span></h2><p><span><span>Landing pages are the best way to "sell" something, to tell people about a specific product, service or a resource, and make them do a specific action. </span></span></p><p><span><span>When user does an action, this is called "conversion", and usually landing pages are fine-tuned to get as much conversions as possible. Conversions could be anything: from subscribing to a newsletter or joining a community, to buying a product or a service. Landing pages can be purely informational, too. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Think what's the purpose of your page, and what the user needs to do to contribute.</span></span></p><h2><span id="cbfc301b7d274e27a06afc720d7eb511"></span><span><span>🤔 Deciding on what to show on the landing page</span></span></h2><p><span><span>Defining your goal was the hard part — after you know what action you want the user to make, it's easy to define what to show on your landing. </span></span></p><p><span><span>If they're subscribing to a newsletter, tell what it's about. If the goal is to grow a community, tell about the people already there and show what's the purpose of this community. If you're selling a product, focus on the value it offers and on core functionality. Don't forget call-to-actions to let the user actually realize their interest when they're convinced.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Take a look at </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://demandcurve.com/#1opac8uusrjldfqjb39wpp">Demand Curve</a></span><span>'s landing page, for example. </span></span></p><div id="54fa9f431f9a45fc970d6e7fc90bf338"><picture><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/32e404a1-908e-4e9d-a0ca-dcce9c1e5edf.png?w=750&amp;f=webp" media="(max-width: 414px)" type="image/webp"><source src="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/32e404a1-908e-4e9d-a0ca-dcce9c1e5edf.png?w=750" media="(max-width: 414px)"><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/32e404a1-908e-4e9d-a0ca-dcce9c1e5edf.png?w=1500&amp;f=webp" type="image/webp"><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/32e404a1-908e-4e9d-a0ca-dcce9c1e5edf.png?w=1500" alt="image" loading="lazy"></picture></div><p><span><span>They're advertising their start-up program, focusing on what the program is about, how it's structured and why people learn valuable things during that program. It's all there — right on the first screen you can see the bullet points describing what the program is about (Growth Strategy, Ads, etc.).</span></span></p><p><span><span>Demand Curve's team also put a special emphasis on social proof — there's a ton of different testimonials and stories from people on the page.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Sometimes short landing pages that span 1-2 screens have higher conversion that longer ones, that span 3 and more screens. When you need your user to perform a simple action, like sharing their email, a short page works better. Short landings also make more sense for "warm" clients who already know what you are offering.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Longer landings with lots of information work better for "cold" clients, because they need more context. After you have an idea on what size is appropriate in your case, you can start experimenting with content.</span></span></p><h2><span id="3812d49b74904f9d961961ff3c8b07b9"></span><span><span>🖋️ Adding some content</span></span></h2><p><span><span>On a typical landing page, the information is arranged into standard "blocks" with valuable information:  there's an eye-catching Hero image, simple text blocks describing your value proposition, a call-to-action that lets you collect interest, and a footer with terms. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Like on </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.refactoringgrowth.com/">Refactoring Growth</a></span><span>'s landing page, you have an elaborate introduction, several sections with a value proposition (simple text) block and a picture or a graphic, a pricing block and a Call-to-Action.</span></span></p><div id="c32142c387d44b52b7995b22ae6c17c9"><picture><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/381f703e-7f47-4032-8bcb-2105ba4ea2b0.png?w=750&amp;f=webp" media="(max-width: 414px)" type="image/webp"><source src="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/381f703e-7f47-4032-8bcb-2105ba4ea2b0.png?w=750" media="(max-width: 414px)"><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/381f703e-7f47-4032-8bcb-2105ba4ea2b0.png?w=1500&amp;f=webp" type="image/webp"><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/381f703e-7f47-4032-8bcb-2105ba4ea2b0.png?w=1500" alt="image" loading="lazy"></picture></div><p><span><span>Optionally, you can add more useful stuff. It's a good idea to include social proof (which is very important for conversions and creates a sense of community around your value prop), juicy product shots or screenshots and a blog section linking to your posts somewhere else. </span></span></p><div id="d3e8989030c247cba938e6e513c95e1d"><picture><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/a9051f9d-917c-4013-bde2-6b219dbfaa5d.png?w=750&amp;f=webp" media="(max-width: 414px)" type="image/webp"><source src="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/a9051f9d-917c-4013-bde2-6b219dbfaa5d.png?w=750" media="(max-width: 414px)"><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/a9051f9d-917c-4013-bde2-6b219dbfaa5d.png?w=1500&amp;f=webp" type="image/webp"><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/a9051f9d-917c-4013-bde2-6b219dbfaa5d.png?w=1500" alt="image" loading="lazy"></picture></div><h2><span id="f07e89f0db6c4c5188083b57316e7685"></span><span><span>🎁 Ready-made landing page blocks</span></span></h2><p><span><span>We've assembled some common sections in Notion so you can borrow them for your website.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Just open the component you like below, click on the bookmark, then click "Duplicate" and drag your component's page into any page you like. Select "Turn into", then "text". You've got your landing page! Add some space between the blocks, change the content and delete the toggle. Then customize it as you like.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Here's a 53-second demo: </span></span></p><p><span><span>Mix and match the blocks and add your own section to make your own converting landing page in 10 minutes.</span></span></p><h2><span id="dbfa3c0dca5f4aada94f5376166f8281"></span><span><span>🌐 Publish your page to the web </span></span></h2><p><span><span>It's easy to publish your page and make it accessible from a custom domain. 
We like two services: </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://fruitionsite.com/">Fruition</a></span><span> is free and open-source, while </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://super.so/">Super</a></span><span> offers more functionality and better performance. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Fruition has a </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://fruitionsite.com/">very elaborate guide</a></span><span> right on their home page, and a </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aw0x54PzCaI">video tutorial</a></span><span>, and Super gives a good onboarding when you sign up, leading you through all the necessary steps. 

</span><span><span>Here's a step-by-step to get you going on Super:</span></span></span></p><ol><li id="30fa5f0ef68b4ad79354c951f1b9aba1"><span><span>Sign up, select a plan (essentially boils down to how many sites you need, keep in mind that one site can have many subpages, like any website on the Web)
</span></span></li><li id="787193987a0b4c7c95437a027e1bd716"><span><span>Select whether you want to make a static website out of your page, or go with a default Notion-based method. 

First option offers great performance, but doesn't allow for filtered views and calendars on your page. 

Default Notion page is relatively poor in terms of performance and SEO, but all Notion functionality will work and it's still enough for simple personal websites or pages where you don't need fast loading.
</span></span></li><ol></ol><li id="e44a993f1fce466193429d780f87fd90"><span><span>Select your site name used in Super, a custom domain from a domain provider, and the URL to your original Notion page with the page set to public via the "Share" menu at the top ("Share" → "Share to the Web")
</span></span></li><li id="2aa6fd185ae9449084ed3674d150ac83"><span><span>Add one or more pretty URLs if you need them. By default, all the sub-pages you add inside your home page will have ugly Notion URLs. You can change that by providing links to sub-pages you want to add slugs to and specifying the slug (e.g. </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://optemization.com/preconceived">optemization.com/preconceived</a></span><span>)
</span></span></li><li id="ff4df464b80145149fe1675f38702e2b"><span><span>Add A and CNAME records to point Super to your domain name (Super provides these and you need to enter them in your domain provider's control panel). You can also provide an API Key if it's GoDaddy.</span></span></li><ol></ol><li id="52d2dce988b94c798bc7fafc30303552"><span><span>Enter your site's description, attach an image and an icon for social sharing. You can also select a custom font for your page's contents at this point.
</span></span></li></ol><p><span><span>Voila! The site should now be public. You're awesome.</span></span></p><h2><span id="728b3a07a7f3429b818b7992351d8dfa"></span><span><span>🔢 Add analytics</span></span></h2><p><span><span>With both Super and Fruition, you can inject your own Javascript into your page. This means you can use most of analytics solutions available.</span></span></p><p><span><span>For example, you can get your Fathom Analytics script to inject by going to Settings → Site → Site ID. Here's their own Fathom's </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://usefathom.com/support/tracking">instruction</a></span><span>. Google Analytics also has a global site tag you can inject. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Both look like this (from Super's landing):</span></span></p><pre id="c777ed719650472ea7f2d1bb17322dd3"><code><span><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>script src</span><span>=</span><span>"https://cdn.analytics.com"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre></span></code></pre><p><span><span>After you copy and paste the script into the right field in Super or with Fruition, it should should auto-magically start collecting your stats and you'll be able to see them in your analytics dashboard. These are statistics we measure for </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://optemization.com/">optemization.com</a></span><span>:</span></span></p><h2><span id="4b1780ab79904f75abb4ecda48f54fd6"></span><span><span>✨Add styling </span></span></h2><p><span><span>In theory, with Super or Fruition you can style practically any part of your page. One of the simple things to do is to change default Notion colors. To change any color on your page just add a script (the same way you add an analytics script) that replaces Notion's CSS values.</span></span></p><p><span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://demo.super.so/guides/colors">Super</a></span><span> has a great mini-guide on doing that, below is the script with every default Notion color. Just replace the color you want to change with a HEX value (#000 for black, #fff for white) and delete the rest to change colors for a site hosted with Super (Fruition works the same way).</span></span></p><details id="cd15c584098c4a26b2e6aeadc95bd312"><summary><span><span>Notion's core colors (check the full list here: </span><span><span><a id="/fed8e0f6059d469fadaeeac47812b6e7" href="https://optemization.com/fed8e0f6059d469fadaeeac47812b6e7"><div><p><img src="https://super.so/icon/dark/hexagon.svg" alt="Notion Colors"></p><p><span><span>Notion Colors</span></span></p></div></a></span></span><span>)</span></span></summary><div><pre id="675898bed12c4045ac7bdd3c20ed3ae3"><code><span><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>style</span><span>&gt;</span><span>

                                                  <div>
                                                                                        <p><span><span>A research team at the University of Calgary’s <a href="https://cumming.ucalgary.ca/">Cumming School of Medicine</a> (CSM) led by Dr. S.R. Wayne Chen, PhD, has made an exciting breakthrough with the potential to prevent and reverse the effects of Alzheimer’s disease.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The team discovered that limiting the open time of a channel called the ryanodine receptor, which acts like a gateway to cells located in the heart and brain, reverses and prevents progression of Alzheimer’s disease in animal models. They also identified a drug that interrupts the disease process.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The effect of giving the drug to animal models was remarkable: After one month of treatment, the memory loss and cognitive impairments in these models disappeared. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>“The significance of identifying a clinically used drug that acts on a defined target to provide anti-Alzheimer’s disease benefits can’t be overstated,” says Chen, a member of the <a href="https://libin.ucalgary.ca/">Libin Cardiovascular Institute</a> and the <a href="https://hbi.ucalgary.ca/">Hotchkiss Brain Institute</a> at the CSM.&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span><span><span>Dr. Jinjing Yao, PhD, a student of Chen, is the first author of the study.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The results of this groundbreaking study were recently published in the peer-reviewed journal, <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(20)31158-X"><em>Cell Reports</em></a>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>This work is potentially highly impactful as more than half a million Canadians live with Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, suffering memory loss and other cognitive impairments with a negative impact on quality of life. </span></span></p>

<h3><strong><span><span><span><span>The science behind the findings</span></span></span></span></strong></h3>

<p><span><span>Previous research has shown that the progression of Alzheimer’s disease is driven by a vicious cycle of the protein amyloid β (Aβ) inducing hyperactivity at the neuron level. However, the mechanism behind this wasn’t fully understood nor were there effective treatments to stop the cycle. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Chen’s team used a portion of an existing drug used for heart patients, carvedilol, to treat mice models with Alzheimer’s symptoms. After a month of treatment, researchers tested animal models with very promising results. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>“We treated them for a month and the effect was quite amazing,” says Chen, explaining the drug was successful in reversing major symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. “We couldn’t tell the drug-treated disease models and the healthy models apart.” </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Chen, a Clarivate Highly Cited Researcher, is optimistic about the future of this research, noting the next step will be clinical trials in people.</span></span></p>

<p><em><span><span>Wayne Chen is a professor in the Department&nbsp;of Physiology and Pharmacology, Biochemistry and </span></span><span><span>Molecular Biology at the CSM.&nbsp;</span></span></em><span><span><em><span lang="EN-US"><span><span>Led by the&nbsp;</span></span></span></em><a href="http://www.hbi.ucalgary.ca/"><em><span><span><span><span><span>Hotchkiss Brain Institute</span></span></span></span></span></em></a><em><span lang="EN-US"><span><span>,&nbsp;</span></span></span></em><a href="http://www.ucalgary.ca/research/brain-and-mental-health"><em><span><span><span><span><span>Brain and Mental Health</span></span></span></span></span></em></a><em><span lang="EN-US"><span><span>&nbsp;is one of six research strategies guiding the University of Calgary toward its&nbsp;Eyes High&nbsp;goals.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>“Legacy Code is code without tests”</p></blockquote><p>If you’ve come across that definition, it’s from Michael Feathers’ book: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=working+effectively+with+legacy+code">Working Effectively with Legacy Code</a>.</p><p>While I have <a href="https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/what-is-legacy-code-is-it-code-without-tests/">a slightly extended definition</a>, this is a very valid and useful one!</p><p>Feathers’ book is from 2004. Yet, its content doesn’t get outdated. There is a reason for that and <a href="http://www.commitstrip.com/en/2019/03/13/like-a-good-wine">this CommitStrip</a> puts it best:</p><p><img src="https://understandlegacycode.com/assets/legacy-code-commitstrip.png" alt="Working Effectively with Legacy Code is like a good wine: it gets better with age"></p><p>This book is a reference. Probably THE reference.</p><p>When there’s a thread about Legacy Code, it doesn’t take long for someone to drop a comment suggesting you read it.</p><blockquote><p>I didn’t read it. I’ve seen it’s recommended. But what are the key points of that book?</p></blockquote><p>If that’s you, I got your back!</p><p>Here’s my summary of the salient points of the book and how they can help you deal with your existing codebase.</p><h2 id="first-add-tests-then-do-your-changes"><a href="#first-add-tests-then-do-your-changes" aria-label="first add tests then do your changes permalink"></a>First, add tests, then do your changes</h2><p>The challenge with changing existing code is to preserve the existing behavior.</p><p>When code is not tested, how do you know you didn’t break anything?</p><p>You need <strong>feedback</strong>. Automated feedback is the best. Thus, this is the first thing you need to do: write the tests.</p><p>Only then you’ll be safe to change the code and refactor.</p><p>Your goal is to get there. The point of the book is to show you <em>how</em> you can get there when you have to deal with an impossibly convoluted codebase. Which leads us to the next point…</p><h2 id="adding-tests-the-legacy-code-dilemma"><a href="#adding-tests-the-legacy-code-dilemma" aria-label="adding tests the legacy code dilemma permalink"></a>Adding tests: the Legacy Code dilemma</h2><p>Before you change code, you should have tests in place. But to put tests in place, you have to change code.</p><p>This is the paradox of Legacy Code!</p><p>So, how do you go about it? Are you doomed?</p><p>You’re not. But you should be extra careful until you got tests in place. You should perform minimal, safe refactorings.</p><p><strong>Change as little code as possible to get tests in place.</strong></p><p>The recipe is:</p><ol><li>Identify change points (Seams)</li><li>Break dependencies</li><li>Write the tests</li><li>Make your changes</li><li>Refactor</li></ol><p>Once you get to the tests, you know how to proceed. The first two points are the difficult ones.</p><h2 id="identify-seams-to-break-your-code-dependencies"><a href="#identify-seams-to-break-your-code-dependencies" aria-label="identify seams to break your code dependencies permalink"></a>Identify Seams to break your code dependencies</h2><p>Adding tests on the existing code can be challenging.</p><p>Hell, it’s usually a nightmare!</p><p>That’s because the code was not written to be <em>testable</em> in the first place. 99% of the time, this is a dependency problem: the code you want to test can’t run because it needs <em>something</em> hard to put in the test.</p><p>Sometimes it’s a database connection. Sometimes it’s a call to a third-party server. Sometimes it’s a parameter that’s complex to instantiate. Usually, it’s a complex mix of all that.</p><p>To test your code, you need to <strong>break these dependencies</strong> in the tests.</p><p>Therefore, you need to identify <strong>Seams</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>“A Seam is a place to alter program behavior, without changing the code.”</p></blockquote><p>There are different types of Seams. The gist of it is to identify how you can change the code behavior without touching the source code.</p><p>If your language is Object-Oriented, the most common and convenient Seam is an object.</p><p>Consider this piece of JavaScript code:</p><pre data-language="js" data-index="0"><p><code><span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>DatabaseConnector</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>// A lot of code…</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>connect</span><span>() {</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>// Perform some calls to connect to the DB.</span></span>

			<p>In Beecember last year, I released a bee-themed management simulator called <a href="http://hivetime.twolofbees.com/">Hive Time</a>. For this project, I was in a position to commit to pay-what-you-want pricing. Now that the game's been out for a while and its lifetime sales curve feels established, I wanted to take some time to reflect on how that's gone.</p>

			<p><img src="http://cheesetalks.net/images/hive-time-finances/banner.png" alt="Money for the honey! A look at Hive Time's finances and pay-what-you-want pricing."></p><p>Hive Time is a bee themed management sim in which players build and maintain a sustainable bee hive. It's a niche game that aims to provide a sandbox experience in which players can explore and experiment role diversity with a generational community once they've mastered the sustainability requirement of producing enough Royal Jelly to spawn a new Queen. It's punctuated by humour and zany characters who from time to time upset the balances that players work to achieve.</p>

			<p>This article dives into Hive Time's budget, costs, marketing, and revenue between the game's release in December 2019 and reaching a sales milestone in July 2020.</p>

			<p>Before diving in, this article needs to be prefaced with a few important notes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>I don't mind talking about money, but I absolutely despise fixating on it. This has been a difficult article to write.</li>
				<li>So as to stay on topic, I'll avoid diving into what worked/didn't work about the game itself (as opposed to its marketing, its identity, and its "performance") as much as possible.</li>
				<li>My overheads and living costs are significantly low and are not indicative of typical development costs.</li>
				<li>I'm very happy to have worked on Hive Time and am glad that it has been played and enjoyed by so many people.</li>
				<li>Every game is different, every audience is different, and the specifics of the context in which every game exists are different.</li>
				<li>Hive Time's budget and expenses involve multiple currencies. Where unspecified, assume Australian dollars.</li>
				<li>From one perspective, I did everything discussed in this article myself, but realistically, every player, every journalist, every youtuber, every streamer, every tester, and my four collaborators contributed to Hive Time's post-release identity. Without them, my game would have sat unknown, unloved, and (so far as what's relevant to this article goes) unbought.</li>
			</ul>


			<p><a href="#pageContent">↑return to page top↑</a></p><h2 id="budget-none-costs-some">Budget: None, Costs: Some</h2>

			<p>After completing the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/small-project-26593300">10 day jam</a> that <a href="https://twitter.com/mimlofbees">Mim</a> and I initially prototyped Hive Time for in May 2019, I took most of the rest of the month to weigh up continuing development against getting back onto other outstanding projects. Based on positive responses to the progress I'd been sharing and tester feedback, I decided to move ahead and plan out a zero dollar budget and rough six month timeline for development.</p>

			<p>Initially, my budget was comprised of my own labour donated in-kind with the expectation of recouping my labour costs after release. Mim was undecided about contributing further art, but preferred to donate her contributions if that happened (it did). With this approach, I'm free from having to worry about money as a tangible development resource, which is generally how I prefer it when I'm working solo. It also means that if a project doesn't sell a single copy, I don't have any debts or other obligations that I'd need to invest more unpaid work into fulfilling.</p>

			<p>For the sake of similar simplicity, I also considered things like plant and equipment, utilities costs, and exhibiting costs as out of scope for the budget since all of those were things that I already owned or could justify as being covered by other projects. I bought my primary workstation and travel laptop years ago, we would be paying for home power and internet regardless, and I have a big tub worth of spare mice and keyboards, cables, adapters, tablecloths, A4 table stands, etc. left over from exhibiting other games in the past. Since I was working from home, I didn't have office rent to worry about (but I did have to ignore my mortgage for a little while). These are all real overheads that should not be ignored, but are outside the scope of what I will be covering here - in this case, there's so much overlap with my personal living expenses and they're low enough that I could comfortably pay them out of Hive Time revenue if it makes enough that I can pay myself the equivalent of Australia's <a href="https://www.fwc.gov.au/documents/wage-reviews/2018-19/decisions/c20191-order.pdf">National Minimum Wage</a>.</p>

Stephens Apiarists in Mole Creek, Tasmania (photo courtesy of Mim)."></p><p>Me recording bees at R. Stephens Apiarists in Mole Creek, Tasmania (photo courtesy of <a href="https://twitter.com/mimlofbees">Mim</a>)</p>

			<p>I use Free/Open Source software for all of my development tools, and though I donate and contribute upstream to some projects, I've chosen to not include that in the budget since that's something I'd be doing regardless. The tools I used for developing Hive Time were the <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot Engine</a>, <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>, the <a href="https://gimp.org/">GNU Image Manipulation Program</a>, <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>, and <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a>.</p>

			<p>I was hoping to submit Hive Time to the 2020 PAX Australia Indie Showcase, which I would have had to have allocated a travel budget for (exhibiting costs are typically covered for showcase winners), but since PAX Aus didn't happen this year and PAX Online's Indie Showcase was <a href="https://twitter.com/ValiantCheese/status/1274166825056518144">only available to games on Steam</a>, that became one less expense to worry about.</p>

			<p>I did spend about $175 on some <a href="https://twitter.com/ValiantCheese/status/1209741464726454273">business cards</a>, but given that a global pandemic is not the best time to be handing things around to people or circulating in contexts where one would normally hand things out, they've sat unused. Since some very extenuating circumstances prevented me from using them, we can pretend for the purposes of this article that I didn't buy them.</p>

			<p>Although I had planned to do everything myself and only rely on Mim for things she was interested in contributing along the way, I found myself bringing on board other collaborators who helped elevate the project in ways that I wouldn't have been able to on my own.</p>

			<p>When <a href="http://www.kestrelpi.co.uk/">Peter</a> expressed interest in composing a soundtrack and demonstrated that he understood and had enthusiasm for the project, I decided to give him the opportunity. I wanted to be sure I could pay him adequately, so I dug into <a href="https://www.patreon.com/Cheeseness">Patreon</a> funds that I'd planned to use for <a href="http://winterswake.com/">Winter's Wake</a> with the expectation that based on general enthusiasm for the project, I should be able to make that back as a minimum from Hive Time's revenue. As <a href="https://kestrelpi.bandcamp.com/album/hive-time">the soundtrack</a> expanded and took shape, we decided to produce a human-voiced version of the Beatles homage "Beeing Together," which carried some extra costs for a vocalist and recording time.</p>

			<p><img src="http://cheesetalks.net/images/hive-time-finances/queen_portrait_event.png" alt="The initial Queen portrait that shipped in the first version of Hive Time."></p><p>Several days before release, I had resolved to cut a feature that adorned the Throne Room with portraits of passed Queens in order to keep my workload manageable. During an unrelated conversation, <a href="https://twitter.com/AubreySerr">Aubrey</a> offered to help out, painting the <a href="https://twitter.com/ValiantCheese/status/1204911573564706816">initial portrait</a> that appeared in 1.0-x releases as well as the eight portraits that were added in the <a href="https://cheeseness.itch.io/hive-time/devlog/147869/v11-the-informational-update">Informational Update</a>. Aubrey has doggedly refused to let me pay him, but he has kindly given me an indicative rate to use in this article.</p>

			<p>I also gave out around a hundred or so keys before release to people interested in giving feedback on/playing early builds. I've had to rely on volunteer testing for projects in the past, and had a <a href="https://twitter.com/ValiantCheese/status/1207441828619776000">solid core group</a> of experienced testers who've enjoyed working with me in the past enough to want to contribute their invaluable attention. Ideally, I'd like to be in a position to do paid QA/testing on my games and give back to these people, but sadly, that wasn't an option for this project. As I didn't audit their work or demand a minimum amount of attention, I have no way of gauging even a rough figure for the amount of hours these people have invested in Hive Time (it could be as little as ten, or it could be hundreds or thousands), and so I'll be leaving QA out (aside from my own testing as part of development/bug fixing, but as with proof reading, you're much less likely to find the holes in your own work).</p>

			<p>Prior to release, but after the bulk of development was completed, I was contacted by an arts funding agency that was getting into games. After some discussion and reading terms, I decided to decline the recoupable investment they were offering. Since I'd already spent all the money I was going to spend, and paying back that investment pro-rata would just erode my revenue until it was paid back, it didn't feel like a good fit. I could potentially have used that funding to produce more content, but I had a release date more or less locked in, and it didn't make sense to push things back just so that I could get a loan of money I didn't need. I also considered using it to cover localisation, but with some rough post-release development making the game's content a moving target, I didn't want to commit to localising into languages I don't speak until after the game has made enough money to support itself (otherwise the risk is that I'd just end up shipping the game in more languages that it could be unsuccessful in).</p>

October 27, 2020 | https://www.nabla.com/blog/gpt-3/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.nabla.com/blog/gpt-3/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You may have heard about GPT-3 this summer, the new cool kid on the AI block. GPT-3 came out of OpenAI, one of the top AI research labs in the world which was founded in late 2015 by Elon Musk, Sam Altman and others and later backed with a $1B investment from Microsoft.</p>
<p>You’ve probably also heard about the ongoing AI revolution in healthcare, thanks to promising results in areas such as automated diagnosis, medical documentation and drug discovery, to name a few.
Some have claimed that algorithms now outperform doctors on <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/10/ai-can-outperform-doctors-so-why-dont-patients-trust-it">certain tasks</a> and others have even announced that robots will soon receive <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/insights-intelai/2018/09/21/the-ultimate-physicians-assistant/">medical degrees</a> of their own! This can all sound far-fetched... but could this robot actually be GPT-3?</p>
<p>Our unique multidisciplinary team of doctors and machine learning engineers at Nabla had the chance to test this new model to tease apart what’s real and what’s hype by exploring different healthcare use cases.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp0.jpg" alt="Primary care and GPT-3"></p>
<h2>But first, coffee</h2>
<p>In machine learning, a language model like GPT-3 simply tries to predict a word in a sentence given the previous words, called the context. It’s a supercharged autocomplete system like the one you may use with Gmail. Being able to predict the next word in a sentence seems deceptively simple at first, but this actually enables many compelling use cases, such as chatbots, translation or Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, GPT-3 is the most complex language model ever trained, with a whopping 175 billion parameters in total - that’s as many knobs that are fine-tuned over weeks of intensive cloud computing to make the AI magic work. Certainly a huge number, but still way below the 100 (or maybe 1000+) trillion synapses in the human brain that enable reasoning, perception and emotions.</p>
<p>Thanks to the large size of the model, GPT-3 can be applied on new tasks and ‘few-shot’ demonstrations without any further fine-tuning on specific data. In practice, this means the model can successfully understand the task to perform with only a handful of initial examples. This property is a huge improvement compared to previous, less complex language models, and is much closer to actual human behavior - we don’t need thousands of examples to distinguish a cat from a dog.</p>
<p>Despite obvious biases learned from the data used for training - basically books plus the whole Internet, from Wikipedia to the New York Times - GPT-3's ability to transform natural language into websites, create basic financial reports, solve langage puzzles, or even generate guitar tables has been very promising so far. But what about healthcare?</p>
<h2>Then, the obvious disclaimer</h2>
<p>As Open AI itself warns in GPT-3 guidelines, healthcare “is in the high stakes category because people rely on accurate medical information for life-or-death decisions, and mistakes here could result in serious harm”. Furthermore, diagnosing medical or psychiatric conditions falls straight in the “unsupported use” of the model. Despite this we wanted to give it a shot and see how it does on the following healthcare use cases, roughly ranked from low to high sensitivity from a medical perspective: admin chat with a patient, medical insurance check, mental health support, medical documentation, medical questions &amp; answers and medical diagnosis. We also looked at the impact of some parameters of the model on the answers - spoiler alert, it’s fascinating!</p>
<h2>GPT-3, your next medical assistant?</h2>
<p>Our first tests showed that GPT-3 seemed to work for basic admin tasks such as appointment booking, but when digging a bit we found that the model had no clear understanding of time, nor any proper logic. Its memory also sometimes fell short - for the appointment in the example below, the patient’s initial 6pm constraint is overlooked as GPT-3 suggests booking for 7pm after a few messages.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp1.jpg" alt="Medical assistant example with GPT-3"></p>
<h2>What about insurance checks?</h2>
<p>Similar to the admin tasks above, GPT-3 could help nurses or patients to quickly find a piece of information in a very long document, like finding insurance benefits for specific medical examinations. In the example below we seeded the model with a 4-page standard benefits table that shows a $10 copay for an X-ray, $20 for an MRI exam, and then asked 2 simple questions. GPT-3 was able to get the copay for an X-ray but could not sum up the copays for several exams, which again highlights a lack of basic reasoning.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp2.jpg" alt="Insurance checks example with GPT-3"></p>
<h2>Recycle to relieve stress!</h2>
<p>Relax on your living room sofa and talk, GPT-3 will listen to your problems endlessly and may even give you some actionable tips! This is probably one of the best use cases for GPT-3 in healthcare, and it’s not so surprising given the already good results from the Eliza algorithm back in 1966, which managed to give a human touch with only pattern matching rules operating behind the scenes.</p>
<p>One key difference between the two approaches though is that rule-based systems like Eliza were in full control of the computer’s response. In other words, we are certain that nothing potentially harmful could be said.</p>
<p>This contrasts with the example below in which GPT-3 sadly tells us that committing suicide is a good idea…</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp4.jpg" alt="Kill switch example with GPT-3"></p>
<p>The model can also shoot unexpected answers where it suggests recycling more to ease stress - using a rationale which, while being convoluted, is actually quite sensible!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp3.jpg" alt="Recycling and stress example with GPT-3"></p>
<h2>Medical documentation</h2>
<p>GPT-3 has already shown promising results in summarizing and simplifying text, something that could be very useful for patients to understand medical reports often full of jargon, or for doctors to quickly get the gist of a patient’s long medical history. Well, GPT-3 is probably not quite ready for this (yet?). Our tests show dangerous oversimplifications, difficulties to associate causes and consequences, and once again a lack of basic deductive reasoning.</p>
<h2>Medical Q&amp;A: not as good as good ol’ Google yet</h2>
<p>When looking for specific scientific information, drug dosages or prescription support, our experiments show that GPT-3 is not reliable enough to be safely used as a trustworthy support tool for doctors. One serious concern is that GPT-3 very often gives wrong yet grammatically correct answers, with no scientific reference that a physician could check. A tired doctor caught in the rush of an emergency department could easily confuse a syntactically sound statement for a medically valid one. For example the first answer below is correct but not the second.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp5.jpg" alt="Q&amp;A medical example with GPT-3"></p>
<h2>Diagnosis: at your own risk</h2>
<p>A more complex Q&amp;A task is diagnosis: input symptoms and get possible underlying conditions that may explain these symptoms. Recent symptom checker systems (Babylon, Ada, KHealth, etc.), if not perfect, seem to be a better option here than GPT-3 as they’ve been carefully optimized for this sole purpose. One benefit of these systems is that they can output different diagnoses with their probabilities, which acts as a measure of confidence for the practitioner. If the first diagnosis example below GPT-3 ignores the fever of the little girl that suggests ethmoiditis and mentions a “rash” that does not exist.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp6.jpg" alt="Medical diagnosis 1 example with GPT-3"></p>
<p>In another test, GPT-3 misses a pulmonary embolism. Fortunately nobody died here!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp7.jpg" alt="Medical diagnosis 2 example with GPT-3"></p>
<h2>Under the hood</h2>
<p>As others have observed, the quality of GPT-3 outputs is much impacted by the seed words used - the same question formulated in two different ways can result in very different answers. The model’s various parameters, such as the temperature and the top P also play a big role. Temperature and top P control the risks and creativity that the engine will exhibit in its answers.</p>
<h3>Temperature</h3>
<p>For the same input and a high temperature we get two answers with very different tones telling two opposite things. Here is an example with T = 0.9.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp8.jpg" alt="High temperature parameter and GPT-3"></p>
<p>By contrast, a similar seed with a very low temperature (T = 0) will always result in the same and quite straightforward answer.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp9.jpg" alt="Low temperature parameter and GPT-3"></p>
<h3>Frequency penalty and presence penalty</h3>
<p>It is also pertinent to mention the frequency penalty and presence penalty parameters, which prevent both word repetition and subject repetition. In a medical context, the intuition would be to reduce them as much as possible since a too abrupt subject switch can be very confusing and repetition can actually be pedagogical. However, comparing two conversations where the human asks the same questions, we clearly observe that the model with repetition penalties seems more empathic and friendly than the other one which appears cold and too repetitive to be human. Here is an example with no penalty.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp10.jpg" alt="No penalty parameter and GPT-3"></p>
<p>And an example with full penalty.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp11.jpg" alt="Full penalty parameter and GPT-3"></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As warned by OpenAI, we are nowhere near any real time scenario where GPT-3 would significatively help in healthcare. Because of the way it was trained, it lacks the scientific and medical expertise that would make it useful for medical documentation, diagnosis support, treatment recommendation or any medical Q&amp;A. Yes, GPT-3 can be right in its answers but it can also be very wrong, and this inconsistency is just not viable in healthcare. Even for more administrative tasks such as translating or summarizing medical jargon, GPT-3 while promising is still many moons away for a production use case actually supporting doctors. We’re still in this phase where multiple, narrow-task supervised models win over a single, very ambitious approach.</p>
<p>That being said, GPT-3 seems to be quite ready to fight burnout and help doctors with a chit-chat module. It could bring back the joy and empathy you would get from a conversation with your medical residents at the end of the day, that conversation that helps you come down to earth at the end of a busy day. Also, there is no doubt that language models in general will be improving at a fast pace, with a positive impact not only on the use cases described above but also on other important problems, such as information structuring and normalisation or automatic consultation summaries.</p>
<p>And at Nabla, we are working on it!<br>

<p>The Global Electronics supply chain is in a strange place right now. Ostensibly the world’s economy is slowing down with massive unemployment all over and surging Covid cases in many parts of the world.  Despite that, if you try to buy many types of electronic components you will find lead times extending into next year and outright shortages of all kinds of components. </p>



<p>There are a few things going on here. First, despite the lockdowns, or maybe because of them, people are still buying a lot of electronics. There are definite signs that consumers have been stocking up on gadgets as they fit out their Zoom lairs. It is also the season of the year when all the new phones come out ahead of Christmas and Chinese New Year. Components are always tight around this time as the big handset and PC companies gear up their production for Holiday orders. As one component vendor told us “If your name is not Apple, you probably can’t get that part.”</p>



<p>On top of that, many suppliers are operating under capacity constraints as a result of Covid shutdowns. China has largely opened up again, but many companies there are still racing to catch up after months of being closed. </p>



<p>This has not only caused a direct shortage, but it has had a large indirect impact as large component buyers worried about shortages started “double ordering” a few months back. That is to say, they ordered more than they really thought they would need to make sure they were at the head of the line when parts get rationed out. This problem occurs every few years, but is particularly acute this year for all the standard 2020 reasons. </p>



<p>On top of that, there is Huawei. Huawei ordered as many components as they could ahead of the US sanctions. There are all kinds of examples of this from TSMC all the way down. And of course, their stockpiling fed into the double ordering panic above. </p>



<p>Making matters worse, every company we speak to in China is worried that they are next. This is not wholly rational, but then again, Uncertainty is the order of the day. So there are dozens of large Chinese companies stockpiling parts, just in case they come under the scrutiny of the Eye of the US Government. And of course, this feeds into all the factors above. </p>



<p>One of the hardest parts of all this is that it is so hard to predict. The Global Electronics Supply Chain is complicated. Take a semiconductor as an example. The part is likely produced in Taiwan or Korea, then sent to Malaysia for testing, then sent to Singapore for packaging, then sent to China for assembly into a module. That module may then be sent back for testing before sent to China again for final assembly into a phone or other device. If there is a shortage of some part or factory capacity anywhere along this chain, the whole thing backs up. The industry has gotten pretty good about smoothing out these wrinkles, but this year we are pushing all the bounds. </p>



<p>We have found that a lot of the time it is the most ignored, taken-for-granted parts that are in the shortest supply. How often do you think of the plastic packaging or substrate in which a semiconductor sits? Not often? Don’t feel bad, a lot of supply chain people do not think of these much either. So of course, those are out of stock everywhere right now, adding a month or more to some timelines. </p>



<p>The strangest part is that in all of this discussion of supply shortages there is  little thought given to the demand side. Maybe the economy will remain strong and these supply shortages will go away. Or maybe, we are just seeing a cascading series of temporary supply constrictions, and all the woes of 2020 finally catch up with the broader economy. In years past, double ordering usually ended poorly for the company that temporarily benefited from tight supply. All too often those buyers fighting to jump the queue ended up canceling orders at the last minute, leaving mountains of supplier inventories and financial woe in their wake. Our best guess is that we end up somewhere in between those two extremes. There are some legitimate reasons that capacity is scarce right now, but there are equally many cases of ephemeral demand. So spare a thought for your operations team, and maybe have them call all your suppliers again, for every component. Just to double check. </p>

<p>For starters, this post is not a theoretical demonstration regarding whether you should use or not use ORMs (Object Relational Mapping) in your projects. It’s a description of why, in my own context, I decided to stop using ORMs. The ambition is to give a particular point of view that may be of use for people working in tech, to make up their mind.</p>



<p><strong><span>The Context</span></strong></p>



<p>First, the context. I’ve been working for 6 years as a tech startup CTO, at times as a cofounder, at times as a freelance. I’ve worked in or with a dozen of tech teams, using various kinds of technologies. Some teams were venture-backed, some were not.<br>If I had to sum up the context for the subject at hand, I would say that my point of view on ORMs is relevant for startup tech teams with &lt; 30 persons.</p>



<p>When I started coding, like most people, I started with a specific language, and that was not SQL. So, as soon as I started to need using a database, I naturally used ORMs to handle the database stuff. If we’re being honest here, most people don’t do a thorough research regarding the ORM topic, and just end up using one because they feel like they can get things done quicker, in a language they’re familiar with. I myself began coding in Python, and I quickly ended up using Django.</p>



<p>As time passed, I began appreciating several things about it, especially the migrations management part. Having all data schema modifications done in code (= versioned in Git) felt safer, especially when working with other people on that data schema. As the complexity of my projects grew, the backend code became more and more complex, but I didn’t give it second thoughts, since I had always used ORMs.<br>One thing that bothered me is that each time a requirement a little bit complex came up on a project, I had to dig very deep in the ORM documentation, like if I was cursed and that when a customer asked me something it would invariably be a specific corner case where the ORM fell short.</p>



<p>One day, I started taking data science projects, and I started learning SQL, since I had to perform a lot of queries on structured data.<br>I did my research and for various reasons I ended up selecting Postgres for my database of choice, due to its open source nature, its awesome views features (named reusable SQL queries), and its GIS extension Postgis.<br>One thing leading to the other, I worked on multiple data science projects in a row, and began to be quite good with SQL. It started to dawn on me how quick I was to make complex queries, with very few lines of SQL code.<br>I then worked again on web projects, and with my experience in SQL, decided that this time I would still write the backend in Python, but without ORM, and use a database driver instead (Psycopg2) to interact with the DB (database).</p>



<p>It has been a few years now that I work without ORMs, and I think my productivity more than doubled. I’m currently a freelance CTO, and I’m responsible (among other things) for the production infrastructure, including database schemas, of 4 startups.<br>I tried to analyze retrospectively what happened and here are a few thoughts.</p>



<p><strong><span>There is no Free Lunch</span></strong></p>



<p>ORM make one promise: that they will abstract the DB away. Solving problems in a generic way that works for everybody can mean 2 things: either it’s a technological breakthrough, either someone made some kind of middle-ground trade-off with existing tech. ORMs clearly fall in the latter.<br>ORMs make so many abstractions that starting off may be easier, but very quickly as you encounter more evolved real-world use cases, you end up spending your time reading documentation to understand the ORM abstractions, and how to configure it the way you need.</p>



<p>When a piece of software abstracts away a problem for you, if the scope of the problem is well defined, you can end up always using sensible defaults config parameters and a few of their variants. In this case, abstraction is a winning proposition.<br>The problem with ORMs is that the scope of what they usually try to achieve is too big, and in a real-world situation, when complexity arises, you often end up reading dark corners of your ORM documentation to find out whether your situation can fit in their abstractions. A great <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/post/the-vietnam-of-computer-science/" target="_blank">blog post</a> sums this up:  </p>



<p>“Although it may seem trite to say it, Object/Relational Mapping is the Vietnam of Computer Science. It represents a quagmire which starts well, gets more complicated as time passes, and before long entraps its users in a commitment that has no clear demarcation point, no clear win conditions, and no clear exit strategy.”</p>



<p>ORMs often seemed at first to be a winning proposition, but as time passes, I spent more time reading complex documentation for seemingly simple real-world situations, and I realized that the scope of what ORMs try to accomplish is just too large. When life keeps throwing at you different use cases with many little variants (and rest assured, this never stops), any endeavour to abstract it all quickly turns into a quagmire.</p>



<p><strong><span>Requirements You don’t have</span></strong></p>



<p>A huge problem of ORMs is that they abstract away the database, which means that if you have a favorite database, you can’t use its specific features.<br>If we’re being honest, in the context I’m talking about (startup with tech team &lt; 30 persons), who really needs DB portability?<br>The DB field is competitive and different DBs do differentiate themselves with great features (MySQL, Postgres, Mongo…). Abstracting the DB away means you have to settle for a common denominator, which is usually frankly quite mediocre.</p>



<p>For example, if in Django you need to perform a classic array aggregation, you end up using django.contrib.postgres.aggregates module, and lose DB portability right away. Array aggregations are very useful in many use cases, but not all DB propose it, so you end up using DB-specific modules anyway.</p>



<p><strong><span>The Performance Problem</span></strong></p>



<p>ORMs usually come with a SQL generator, that you’re never supposed to see. Problem is, in real-life, your DB schema will eventually get complex enough, and you will start having performance issues.<br>Business requirements change over time, retrocompatibility requirements pile up, and there is no way you can keep your DB schema theoretically optimal for your company’s needs at time t.<br>This fact translates into increased complexity for your DB queries, and a need to be smart about your queries.<br>When this complexity increases a bit, there is simply no way the ORM SQL generator can output optimized queries. Things will get slow, and I’ve yet to see an efficient way of querying a complex DB other than by writing the SQL yourself.</p>



<p><strong><span>DB Schema Consistency</span></strong></p>



<p>Initially I loved ORM for the fact that data structures were defined in code, which means versioned in Git, which means people could collaborate on them. Over the years I’ve changed my mind completely about this. Having multiple people make changes on DB schema invariably leads to huge inconsistencies, suboptimal choices and huge legacy.<br>This is why I enjoy working in small teams. I know it’s not possible for big corporations to have only 1 or 2 guys be the data masterminds, and I think that’s the reason why software quality drops so rapidly with the size of an organization. We just don’t know how to work efficiently in tech when the problem becomes too big for one brain (and by the way I think this is one of the biggest challenges to the advancement of humankind but that’s a story for another time).<br>I think that in the context of a startup with a tech team &lt; 30 persons, you should not have multiple persons making decisions about the DB schema. There should be 1 owner for this (which does not mean there can’t be collaborative discussions of course).<br>Currently I usually am the owner of DB schemas, and I manage SQL migrations by hand, via SQL scripts that are versioned in git, separately from backend code repos. I’m still regularly surprised by how many bad product/code decisions become obvious when considering DB schema issues, with context and history in mind.</p>



<p><strong><span>Be pragmati</span><span>c</span></strong></p>



<p>I had the opportunity to discuss the ORM topic with friends, and many had experienced more or less the same things, however some of them had an interesting take on the matter: they kept using ORMs, but only for particular things such as migrations management, handling connection pools with DB (for concurrent querying), input validations… To come back to the Vietnam analogy, I think it’s perfectly OK to use ORMs, if you know exactly what for, with a clear goal in mind and a well defined perimeter.</p>



<p><strong><span>The stack I use now</span></strong></p>



<p>Now when I start a web project, on the backend side I set up a REST API with a lightweight HTTP framework (Flask in Python, ExpressJS in Javascript), I interact with the DB with a driver (Psycopg2 in Python, pg-native in NodeJs), and I use Postgres, with a heavy use of Postgres Views to put as many data-related code in SQL, and as few as possible in backend Python/Js code.</p>



<p>The resulting backends, if you know SQL, are insanely quick to write, easy to read, and thus to maintain.</p>

</figure>

<p>We like to apply labels to users: they’re irrational, lazy, unpredictable, rushed, and so on.</p>

<p>To some extent that may be true<span>—</span>we aren’t machines.</p>

<p>But research shows that users actually make decisions based on a set of predictable subconscious patterns.</p>

<p>To create satisfying digital experiences, UX designers should be aware of<span>—</span>and support<span>—</span>these cognitive habits.</p>

<h2 id="heuristics">Heuristics</h2>

<p>Human beings use psychological tactics and biases to get to decisions quickly. These mental shortcuts are called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555" target="_blank">heuristics</a>. We use heuristics in everyday life, but we especially like using them with software.</p>

<p>We don’t follow these patterns out of laziness or because we’re scatter-brained. It’s quite rational to take advantage of heuristics as a user because…</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the digital world, there’s <strong>very little penalty for being wrong</strong>. The cost of most errors is close to zero. Guessing wrong on a link and hitting the back button is still more efficient than reading the whole page to find an exact match.</li>
  <li>Carelessly clicking around is <strong>more fun</strong> because we get a small dopamine rush from each click.</li>
  <li>Web pages can be complicated. We’d rather <strong>make a decision and get on with our lives</strong>. It’s a matter of trade-offs<span>—</span>a balancing act.</li>
  <li>The web enables us to <strong>move quickly from one decision to the next</strong>, at a much faster pace than the physical world. So that’s what we do.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s take a look at some of the most common heuristics that users employ.</p>

<h3 id="satisficing">Satisficing</h3>

<p>A combination of the words “satisfy” and “suffice.” It means to <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/satisficing/" target="_blank">settle for the first reasonable option you find</a>, without considering the whole set of possibilities. We don’t look for the right answer<span>—</span>we look for whatever is good enough.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/satisficing.png" alt="Users make quick and dirty scans. When they come across something that refers even a little to what they've come for, they instinctively click it.">
</figure>

<h3 id="loss-aversion">Loss Aversion</h3>

<p><a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.320.8769" target="_blank">Losses loom larger than gains</a> in our minds. It is thought that the pain of losing is about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. We put in more work and take more risks to avoid losses than we do to make gains. Part of <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/prospect-theory/">Prospect Theory</a>.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/loss-aversion.png" alt="Users will go to great lengths to avoid something that’s potentially negative, or that could cause them to lose what they already have.">
</figure>

<h3 id="availability">Availability</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/videos/availability-heuristic/" target="_blank">People draw conclusions based on what comes to mind immediately</a>. We give a lot of importance to things that we recall quickly and things we can already see right in front of us.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/availability.png" alt="If a user needs to make a decision on a page, what's right in front of them? What can they recall quickly from other pages? What do they notice first?">
</figure>

<h3 id="decision-fatigue">Decision Fatigue</h3>

<p>Making a lot of decisions <a href="https://archive.org/details/psychologyofecon0000unse/mode/2up" target="_blank">lowers a person’s ability to make rational ones</a>. It’s also exhausting.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/decision-fatigue.png" alt="If a user is forced to make decision after decision after decision, they'll eventually start making sub-optimal choices... or give up entirely.">
</figure>

<h3 id="reference-dependence">Reference Dependence</h3>

<p>Human beings do not have an innate way to determine absolute value. So <a href="https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2011/01/the-power-of-comparison-how-it-affects-decision-making.php" target="_blank">we assign value by comparing one thing to another</a>. We make judgments in relative rather than absolute terms.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/reference-dependence.png" alt="In a set of choices in an interface, how the options relate to each other will determine what the user will do.">
</figure>

<h3 id="status-quo-bias">Status Quo Bias</h3>

<p>Unless there’s a compelling incentive, <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/the-power-of-defaults/" target="_blank">people are more likely to stick to the default</a>. In other words, we tend not to change the established situation.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/status-quo-bias.png" alt="This explains, for example, why users rarely utilize fancy customization features or change default settings.">
</figure>

<h3 id="hicks-law">Hick’s Law</h3>

<p>The number of stimuli present <a href="https://lawsofux.com/hicks-law" target="_blank">influences the time and effort required to make a decision</a>.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/hicks-law.png" alt="When users come across a situation with too many options, sometimes they'll try to bypass the unpleasantness of Hick's Law by hastily making any decision, which they later regret.">
</figure>

<h2 id="so-what">So what?</h2>

<p>As designers, what do we do about all this?</p>

<p>Here are a few ways we can tailor our digital experiences to these heuristics.</p>

<h3 id="decrease-your-dpp">Decrease your DPP</h3>

<p>One helpful exercise is to look at what we can call our DPP: <em>Decisions Per Page</em>.</p>

<p>Take an important page from your interface and count the number of possible decisions a user could make on that page. This includes actions (which always require a decision) or information that leads to a decision.</p>

<p>I’m willing to bet the number is higher than you would have guessed.</p>

<p><strong>If the DPP is too high, what do you do?</strong></p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/decisions-per-page.png" alt="Decisions per page">
</figure>

<h3 id="reduce-visual-signals">Reduce visual signals</h3>

<p>Start by reducing the number of colors and fonts. Using more than four meaningful colors causes the “<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/first-impressions-human-automaticity/" target="_blank">rainbow effect</a>” which disorients the brain and creates an impression of ugliness.</p>

<p>Movement is distracting. Use animation sparingly and only for a specific purpose.</p>

<p>Build a design system. It ensures consistency between elements, and prevents users from having to re-learn the interface on every new page.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/design-system.png" alt="Design system">
</figure>

<h3 id="optimize-the-default-experience">Optimize the default experience</h3>

<p>Be aware that many people will never use fancy customization options. Make sure the general default experience provides for all the important <a href="https://learnuxd.io/posts/the-how-and-why-of-user-flows" target="_blank">task flows</a>.</p>

<p>Forms provide lots of opportunities to be helpful. For example, we could pre-populate fields with the most common value or a realistic example. This representative value helps the user understand how to complete the field and what the expected response is. Not to mention it will save most users time and decision-making energy.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/sensible-defaults.png" alt="Sensible defaults">
</figure>

<h3 id="prioritize-for-the-user">Prioritize for the user</h3>

<p>Since many users aren’t going to accurately prioritize things on their own, we should do some of that work for them. The ultimate goal is that they can glance at any page and know instinctively which items are most important.</p>

<p>Knowing what to prioritize requires that you learn about your users, their goals, and their main <a href="https://learnuxd.io/posts/the-how-and-why-of-user-flows" target="_blank">workflows</a>. Think about what is <em>essential</em> (vs. what is optional) and what moves the user <em>forward</em>.</p>

<p>We can give the user visual clues to create a clear hierarchy. Our brain assigns importance to things based on size, color, imagery, contrast, white space, and alignment.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/visual-priority.png" alt="Visual priority">
</figure>

<h3 id="evaluate-your-content">Evaluate your content</h3>

<p>Remember almost all users scan<span>—</span>they don’t read. Classic principles of good writing, including descriptive headings and <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/inverted-pyramid/" target="_blank">inverted-pyramid</a> structures, help users get meaning from content.</p>

<p>Some common red flags include a lack of headings and big, long blocks of text. Call attention to important information using bulleted lists and bold or italic fonts. Take the time to craft your <a href="https://learnuxd.io/posts/7-practical-tips-for-better-microcopy" target="_blank">microcopy</a>.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/content.png" alt="Evaluate content">
</figure>

<h3 id="consider-the-post-click-experience">Consider the post-click experience</h3>

<p>What happens when a user clicks on something? What’s the next thing they see and how does it connect to where they just were? How does it fit into their whole journey through your interface?</p>

<p>It could be easy to think of each page in isolation. <strong>But remember pages aren’t individual silos<span>—</span>they’re pieces of flows.</strong> It’s all a series of connected actions.</p>

<p>Give good <a href="https://learnuxd.io/posts/7-practical-tips-for-better-microcopy" target="_blank">information scent</a> with link labels so users know where they’re going. Allow them to gracefully recover from clicking on the wrong thing to eliminate the “cost” of clicking. Make sure they’re always moving forward.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/post-click-experience.png" alt="Post-click experience">
</figure>

<h2 id="tying-it-off">Tying it off</h2>

<p>Remember: we never truly know what an individual user is thinking until we research. When in doubt, <a href="https://learnuxd.io/posts/usability-testing-in-4-simplified-steps" target="_blank">test it out</a>.</p>

<p>What are you going to do differently with your products to better support these heuristics?</p>

  <p>Time series is everywhere! Devices, sensors and events produce time series, for example, your heartbeat can be represented as a series of events measured every second, or your favorite step tracker recording a number of steps you take per minute. </p>
<p>All these signals can be used for ML model development, and we’re excited to present you with one of the first time series data labeling solutions that work across a variety of use-cases and can help you develop ML applications based on time series data!</p>

<p><img src="https://labelstud.io/images/release-080/main.gif"></p><blockquote>
<p>Labeled time series data is crucial if you want to develop supervised ML models for pattern recognition. It can also serve as a ground truth data for validating methods performance. Read below for some of the scenarios and implementation details</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Labeling-UI-Performance"><a href="#Labeling-UI-Performance" title="Labeling UI Performance"></a>Labeling UI Performance</h2><p>A majority of time series datasets tend to have a lot of points. Therefore the tool has to scale well to handle the situation when you have more than 100K points. Initially we’ve tried to use some existing frontend libraries that provide time series implementation, but it turned out that none of them were up for the task, even with just 10,000 points you’d start to experience the lag when zooming or panning. It was clear that we need to come up with a more robust implementation. We’ve based the rendering on d3 and after numerous optimization attempts we’ve got to the desired result:</p>
<h3 id="1-000-000-data-points-and-10-channels"><a href="#1-000-000-data-points-and-10-channels" title="1,000,000 data points and 10 channels"></a><strong>1,000,000 data points and 10 channels</strong></h3><p><img src="https://labelstud.io/images/release-080/ui.gif"></p><p>Some of the techniques we have used include tiling - when we have a big number of datapoint we split it into chunks and render those chunks first, this helps us achieve great performance when the number of data points is very large. When you zoom out the algorithm samples specific points to give you an overview of your time series data.</p>
<h2 id="Working-with-a-variety-of-input-types-out-of-the-box"><a href="#Working-with-a-variety-of-input-types-out-of-the-box" title="Working with a variety of input types out of the box"></a>Working with a variety of input types out of the box</h2><p>For examples below we will be using the following configuration:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>View</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>TimeSeriesLabels</span> <span>name</span>=<span>"label"</span> <span>toName</span>=<span>"ts"</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>Label</span> <span>value</span>=<span>"Walk"</span> /&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>Label</span> <span>value</span>=<span>"Run"</span> /&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/<span>TimeSeriesLabels</span>&gt;</span>
  
  <span>&lt;<span>TimeSeries</span> <span>name</span>=<span>"ts"</span> <span>valueType</span>=<span>"url"</span> <span>value</span>=<span>"$csv"</span> <span>sep</span>=<span>","</span> <span>overviewChannels</span>=<span>"sen1,sen2"</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>Channel</span> <span>column</span>=<span>"sen1"</span> /&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>Channel</span> <span>column</span>=<span>"sen2"</span> /&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/<span>TimeSeries</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>View</span>&gt;</span></code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>If you’re new to Label Studio, <a href="https://labelstud.io/tags/">learn</a> how you can use tags to setup different labeling interfaces for your data</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Depending on where your time series data is coming from it can be formatted very differently. Label Studio provides a way to configure how time series parsing is done so you don’t have to transform the original file. Let’s start with a simple CSV like that:</p>
<pre><code>time,sen1,sen2
100,1,23
101,2,34
102,3,45</code></pre>

<p>CSV with weirdly formatted datetime, because you’ve captured that from a weird sensor that doesn’t follow the standard:</p>
<pre><code>time,sen1,sen2
2020-Feb-01 9:30,34.23,272
2020-Feb-01 9:31,251.23,352
2020-Feb-01 9:32,337.124,327</code></pre>

<p>In that case, there is <code>timeFormat</code> that can handle parsing for you, it uses <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-format-codes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strftime</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>valueType</code> controls whether the input is provided as-is, or via a URL. For example, the input file may look like a list of URLs and in that case <code>valueType="url"</code> will load the contents of each URL and expect a time series data inside.</p>
<pre><code>csvURL
http://example.com/path/to/timeseries1.csv
http://example.com/path/to/timeseries2.csv</code></pre>

<p>For the headless CSV, you can use a columns index to point to the right columns. For example, using <code>2</code> in Channel’s <code>column</code> attribute would look for the third column (it starts from zero) inside headless CSV.</p>
<p><code>timeColumn</code> is the name of the column with temporal data, notice that you can skip that altogether, and then it generates that for you.</p>
<p>You can also use <code>timeDisplayFormat</code> to configure the desired output of the temporal column. It can be a number or a date, if a temporal column is a date then use strftime to format it, otherwise, if it’s a number then use <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-format#locale_format" target="_blank" rel="noopener">d3 number</a> formatting.</p>
<h2 id="Zoom-and-Pan"><a href="#Zoom-and-Pan" title="Zoom and Pan"></a>Zoom and Pan</h2><p>Press <code>ctrl</code> key and use your mouse wheel to zoom and pan. If you have a huge time series, then changing the window position and size inside an overview may not let you zoom as much as you like, because it has a certain limit on its width, then you can continue zooming with a mouse wheel</p>

<p><img src="https://labelstud.io/images/release-080/zoom.gif"></p><h2 id="Multivariate-and-Univariate"><a href="#Multivariate-and-Univariate" title="Multivariate and Univariate"></a>Multivariate and Univariate</h2><p>There are plenty of ways how you can setup the plots, every defined channel is synchronized with any other channel defined inside the same time series object, giving you a multivariate time series labeling experience. You can also define multiple time series objects and get distinct objects.</p>

<p><img src="https://labelstud.io/images/release-080/multi-uni.png"></p><p>Use the <code>Channel</code> tag to represent each additional time-series channel. By providing multiple channels you get a multivariate labeling interface and can label one channel by looking at the behavior of other items at the same timestamp on another channel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>showTracker</code> attribute on TimeSeries object controls if you see the tracker and holding <code>shift</code> key makes it sync between the channels</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Instance-labeling-and-snapping-to-the-point"><a href="#Instance-labeling-and-snapping-to-the-point" title="Instance labeling and snapping to the point"></a>Instance labeling and snapping to the point</h2><p>Double-click to put a bar labeling one particular data point, instead of labeling an entire region. And when you’re creating a region it always gets snapped to the closest point.</p>

<p><img src="https://labelstud.io/images/release-080/instance.png"></p><h2 id="Configuring-overview"><a href="#Configuring-overview" title="Configuring overview"></a>Configuring overview</h2><p>By default, an overview is created from the first channel, but you have control over that. Use <code>overviewChannels</code> and define what columns are included, it uses the same format as the <code>column</code> parameter, and can also use multiple channels inside an overview if you comma separate it.</p>

<p><img src="https://labelstud.io/images/release-080/overview.png"></p><h2 id="Synchronizing-across-data-types-experimental"><a href="#Synchronizing-across-data-types-experimental" title="Synchronizing across data types [experimental]"></a>Synchronizing across data types [experimental]</h2><p>It’s not always the case that you can label time series just by looking at the plots. Different events may have different representations, and in such cases, visual support is required. TimeSeries tag can synchronize to audio or video.</p>

<p><img src="https://labelstud.io/images/release-080/videosync.png"></p><p>This is an experimental feature right now, and we’re working on finalizing the implementation, but if you have use-cases, ping us in <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/label-studio/shared_invite/zt-cr8b7ygm-6L45z7biEBw4HXa5A2b5pw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slack</a>, we will help you to set it up.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In the field of computer science, the Paxos algorithm is notorious for how difficult it is to understand. I had to learn the Paxos algorithm in my distributed systems class. I even have "implemented" it by translating Leslie Lamport's TLA+ to Python. But I didn't understand it until much much later.</p>

<p>Now I have a better understanding of Paxos than I used to, I want to explain it to other people. Not because I'd like to help people, rather, I find that explaining things is a very good way to find blind spots in my own understanding.</p>

<p>So, where do we start? Personally, I dislike explanations that start with a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm, followed by a proof of why those steps do what they claim to do. Instead, I much prefer to start with the problem the algorithm tries to solve, then iteratively come up with a solution together with the reader. So that's what I am going to do. And now you understand the title.</p>

<p><em>Small disclaimer:</em> The glossaries used in this article is different from what is commonly used for Paxos. I just picked the ones that made the most sense for my narrative.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>

<p>The distributed consensus problem is widely useful, so the reader probably doesn't need to be motivated. Here I will just simply state the problem.</p>

<p>There is a group of agents (let's call them $\sc{CLIENT}s$), who want to choose a number among their selections. Any number is fine, as long as everyone agrees on the same number.</p>

<p>Here, there are a few assumptions we will make to make this problem meaningful:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All the agents - including but not limited to the $\sc{CLIENT}s$, as we will add more types of agents later - are well-behaved. Meaning they all execute the prescribed algorithms faithfully, and don't maliciously try to trick other agents. (If you like jargons: Byzantine failures don't occur.)</li>
  <li>Agents can talk to each other by sending each other messages, but the messages they send to each other could take arbitrarily long before reaching their destination, and might get lost (but never altered).</li>
</ul>

<p>The agents could also "fail". However, failing is equivalent to all messages sent to/from that agent being lost forever. So whether we have this assumption or not won't change the algorithm we come up with.</p>

<p>Also, to not complicate things, we are only solving the "single-round" consensus problem in this article, meaning as the output of this algorithm, all of the $\sc{CLIENT}s$ will get a single number which they agree on.</p>

<h2 id="solution-searching-adventure">Solution searching adventure</h2>

<h3 id="iteration-0">Iteration 0</h3>

<p>When trying to solve a complex problem such as this one, it's usually a good idea to start by simplifying the problem.
As a start, let's just ignore the need to be reliable entirely.</p>

<p>If we throw reliability out the window, it should be easy to come up with a very simple solution: we add an agent (let's call it $\sc{COORDINATOR}$).
The $\sc{CLIENTS}$ send whatever number they pick to the $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ in a $\sc{PROPOSAL}(client_i, x)$ message, where $x$ is the number
proposed by the $i$-th $\sc{CLIENT}$. The $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ picks an arbitrary proposal (say, $x'$),
and informs the other $\sc{CLIENT}s$ about this decision.
Specifically, the $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ will just reply with a $\sc{CHOSEN}(x')$ message to all the $\sc{PROPOSAL}(\ldots)$ messages it has
received and will receive.</p>

<p>If we assume no messages ever get lost, it is quite easy to see that every $\sc{CLIENT}$ will get a number. And because only one number is ever chosen, they will all get the same number.</p>

<p>It is also easy to see why this solution is impractical: it has a single point of failure. Once the singular $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ fails, no further progress can be made.</p>

<h3 id="iteration-1">Iteration 1</h3>

<p>To improve this almost looks easy at first glance: just add more $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$!</p>

<p>Sure, more $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ would remove the single point of failure. However, if there are more than one $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$, they might individually make different decisions, which results in the $\sc{CLIENT}s$ having disagreement.</p>

<p>What if we let the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ reach an agreement among themselves before responding? But wait, doesn't that sound familiar? Having a group of agents reaching an agreement, that's exactly what we added the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ to solve. We just made the problem cyclic.</p>

<p>Let's take a step back. Is there a way for the clients to reach an agreement without having the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ communicate with each other?</p>

<p>In other words, among the decisions of the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$, is there an deterministic algorithm to pick out a specific one that is robust against message losses?</p>

<p>This might sound hard, but it's actually quite simple: pick the decision that is backed by more than half of the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$.</p>

<p>There can't be two decisions both with more than half of the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ backing them; and if a decision doesn't have that many $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ backing it, it won't appear to have more backing $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ through message losses.</p>

<p>Since this approach resembles a majority vote, let's call $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ decisions $\sc{VOTE}(coord_i, x)$ from now on, where $x$ is the number picked by the $i$-th $\sc{COORDINATOR}$. Each $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ has a single vote, because each of them only makes a single decision.</p>

<p>Obviously, our solution cannot be infinitely reliable. If more than half of the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ went down, there will never be a majority reached. But this is already vastly better than our first solution, and the reliability scales with the number of $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$. So we will call it good enough.</p>

<p>Sadly, this solution doesn't actually work: there might not be a majority at all! For example, it's possible that three of the proposals each get a third of the votes. We would have a stalemate in that case.</p>

<h3 id="iteration-2">Iteration 2</h3>

<p>Again, a solution seems straightforward: just try again in case of a stalemate.</p>

<p>But then again, things aren't that simple.</p>

<p>First of all, the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ need to be made aware of a retry. Otherwise, because each $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ only has one vote, they won't be able to vote again even if the $\sc{CLIENT}s$ retry.</p>

<p>To do that, we attach an attempt id to all the messages sent. i.e. $\sc{PROPOSAL}(client_i, x)$ becomes $\sc{PROPOSAL}(\#attempt, client_i, x)$, and so forth. Each time a $\sc{CLIENT}$ retries, it bumps $\#attempt$ to the maximum $\#attempt$ it knows of plus 1. And the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ should only responds to messages with the most recent $\#attempt$.</p>

<p>Hopefully the intent of the $\#attempt$ number is clear. (<a href="https://github.com/yshui/explain-algorithms/issues/new">Let me know</a> if not.)</p>

<p>Are we good now? Unfortunately, no. Consider this scenario:</p>

<p>There were 2 clients. They proposed their numbers, the $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ voted on them and all agreed on a single number, $x_1$, all is good. But, all of the $\sc{VOTE}(\ldots)$ messages got lost on the way to $client_2$, while $client_1$ received all of the messages just fine. At this point, $client_1$ thought $x_1$ is the number, but $client_2$ went on to retry. The $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ voted again, and got $x_2$. This time, all the messages sent to $client_1$ got lost.</p>

<p>And behold, we got the two clients to disagree.</p>

<p>There is an important insight to be had here. Whenever a $\sc{COORDINATOR}$, say $coord_i$, sends out a $\sc{VOTE}(\ldots, coord_i, x)$, there is a chance that some $\sc{CLIENT}$ would adopt $x$. If $coord_i$ ever sends out two votes with different $x$, there is a chance that some of the $\sc{CLIENT}s$ would disagree.</p>

<p>In other words, once a $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ has revealed its vote, it has to stick to it.</p>

<p>This seems to run contrary to our attempt: if the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ cannot change their votes, what's the point of retrying? A stalemate will be a stalemate forever.</p>

<p>Looks like we reached a dead end with this type of voting. It appears the problem stems from the fact that the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ have to commit to their votes.</p>

<p>So, what if we introduce a form of non-commitment voting?</p>

<h3 id="iteration-3">Iteration 3</h3>

<p>Let's explore this idea. Say, the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ could now send a $\sc{TENTATIVE}\sc{VOTE}(\#attempt, coord_i, x)$ message, to tentatively vote for $x$.</p>

<p>Obviously, the $\sc{CLIENT}s$ couldn't adopt $x$ right away. So what's this vote good for?</p>

<p>Ah, right, it could get us to a majority.</p>

<p>It is correct that tentative votes don't lead directly to an agreement among $\sc{CLIENT}s$, but it can show us when a majority has formed among the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$.</p>

<p>Once a $\sc{CLIENT}$ sees a majority tentative vote, it can then message the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ to ask for an actual vote. (Let's call this message $\sc{PLEASE}\sc{VOTE}(\#attempt, client_i)$). Intuitively, the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ have to make the same vote in the actual vote as their tentative votes.</p>

<p>If all goes well, we would get a majority and an agreement. If there is no majority, the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ won't even start a vote, so they are free to change their mind. So the $\sc{CLIENT}s$ could start another attempt which might have a different outcome.</p>

<p>What if things don't go well? What if the $\sc{PLEASE}\sc{VOTE}$ messages weren't received by some of the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$?
In that case, some of the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ would have voted, and their decisions cannot be changed. That is to say, in all subsequent attempts, these $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ will always vote for what they have voted for, whether it's a tentative vote, or the actual vote. But that doesn't create a problem for us. There was a majority in the tentative votes, and now we solidified part of the tentative votes. There is at least one way we can still reach a majority in the next round: everyone votes the same as they did in this round. And we can prove this inductively for all future rounds.</p>

<p>From this, we can have a rough image of how the algorithm functions: as attempts are being made, more and more $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ start to make up their mind which number they will commit to, while making sure a majority could still be reached. Eventually, …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>I don’t want to be one of those complaining old men, constantly bemoaning every difference that I see between the world of my youth and that of today.I’m not that old anyway; at 38 I consider myself to be just barely reaching adulthood.</p>
<p>I have two small children of the girl persuasion, ages 2 and 4. The pandemic has changed so much about their lives, but one change is that we all have a lot more screen time than before.</p>
<p>Children’s programming is shit today. Boring computer-generated animation, interchangeable characters with impossibly cheerful voices. Most of it seems lazy and half-baked. You could take the plots and characters from any number of shows and switch them around and it would all fit fine. I’m talking about shows like <em>PJ Masks</em>, <em>Paw Patrol</em>, and <em>Mickey Mouse Clubhouse</em>.</p>
<p><em>Mickey Mouse Clubhouse</em> is a particularly bad offender, because I have such strong childhood attachments to the source material. It might be the worst show ever made. It’s weird, but not in a fun way like <em>Yo Gabba Gabba</em>. Completely humorless.</p>
<p>Even <em>Sesame Street</em>, of which I am a staunch advocate, uses obvious filler sketches like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6TkpZx1dzQ"><em>Journey to Ernie</em></a>, which is absolute garbage.</p>
<p>Contrast that to the shows I watched as a kid. We’ve been playing <em>Fraggle Rock</em>, <em>The Elephant Show</em>, <em>Magic Schoolbus</em>, <em>Beakman’s World</em>, <em>Bill Nye the Science Guy</em>. They’re just better.</p>
<p>The Fraggles are such well-developed characters, and the show does such a good job of showing the fragile beauty of their ecosystem. There are layers of information that can be gleaned on subsequent rewatches. As children mature, there are jokes and nuances they start to grasp. The show is actually entertaining for adults.</p>
<p>Contrast that to <em>The PJ Masks</em>, a show that makes me want to actually put my head through the TV.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><div><article><p>In the previous article, <a href="https://www.pybootcamp.com/blog/how-to-containerize-python-application/" title="How to containerize a Python Application">how to containerize a Python application</a>, we created a Dockerfile and containerized our application from scratch.</p>
<p>Now we really want our Dockerfile to stand out, <strong>make it more production-ready</strong>, that's the goal of this article.</p>
<p>We will cover 6 different ways to improve our <code>Dockerfile</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>setting env variables and a working directory</li>
<li>avoiding invalidating the Docker cache</li>
<li><strong>changing the default user to non-root</strong></li>
<li>taking care of zombie processes</li>
<li>correctly forwarding signals to our application</li>
<li>updating <code>pip</code>, <code>setuptools</code> and <code>wheel</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>This is the <code>Dockerfile</code> we created last time:</p>
<div data-language="dockerfile"><pre><code>
<span>FROM</span> python<span>:</span>3.8.3<span>-</span>slim<span>-</span>buster


<span>COPY</span> . /src


<span>RUN</span> pip install <span>-</span>r /src/requirements.txt</code></pre></div>
<p>While fully functional, there are a few things we can improve regarding usability, security and performance.</p>
<p>You can clone this <a href="https://github.com/py-bootcamp/movie-recommender/tree/part-1">repository</a> if you want to follow along.</p>
<h3>Passing the git commit hash</h3>
<p>We want to <em>mark</em> each Docker image and container with a tag, this tag is the <code>git commit hash</code>.</p>
<p><strong>At runtime we should be able to determine which version of our software we are running.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea is that every artifact we generate is traceable, we can go back and check which commit generated it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#arg">ARG</a> and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#env">ENV</a> instructions can help us achieving it.</p>
<p><code>ARG</code> specifies arguments that we can pass to the <code>docker build</code> command, <code>ENV</code> are env variables set inside the <code>Dockerfile</code> and accessible at runtime, from within the container.</p>
<p>This is the new <code>Dockerfile</code>, with <code>ARG</code> and <code>ENV</code>:</p>
<div data-language="dockerfile"><pre><code><span>FROM</span> python<span>:</span>3.8.3<span>-</span>slim<span>-</span>buster


<span>ARG</span> GIT_HASH
<span>ENV</span> GIT_HASH=$<span>{</span>GIT_HASH<span>:</span><span>-</span>dev<span>}</span>


<span>COPY</span> . /src

<span>RUN</span> pip install <span>-</span>r /src/requirements.txt</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>-dev</code> is a way to specify defaults. If the <code>GIT_HASH</code> argument is omitted then <code>GIT_HASH</code> will be set to <code>dev</code>.</p>
<p>Let's build our Docker image and check the <code>GIT_HASH</code> env variable:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> docker build -t movie-app <span>.</span>
<span>&gt;</span> docker run --rm movie-app <span>env</span> <span>|</span> <span>grep</span> GIT_HASH
<span>GIT_HASH</span><span>=</span>dev</code></pre></div>
<p>How do we pass the git commit hash to our Docker image?</p>
<p>We use the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#set-build-time-variables---build-arg"><code>--build-arg</code></a> flag from the Docker cli:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>
<span>&gt;</span> <span>export</span> <span>GIT_HASH</span><span>=</span><span><span>$(</span><span>git</span> rev-parse HEAD<span>)</span></span>
<span>&gt;</span> docker build --build-arg <span>GIT_HASH</span><span>=</span><span>${GIT_HASH<span>:</span><span>:</span>7}</span> -t movie-app <span>.</span>
<span>&gt;</span> docker run --rm movie-app <span>env</span> <span>|</span> <span>grep</span> GIT_HASH
<span>GIT_HASH</span><span>=</span>6a78e6b</code></pre></div>
<p>We don't need the whole commit hash, the first 7 characters are enough.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why are we not passing the base image using <code>ARG</code>?
Because we don't want to change the base Docker image from the Docker cli, but only through a new commit.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Adding a working directory</h3>
<p>Right now we are copying our files inside a <code>/src</code> folder and then we specify all the other paths relative to <code>/src</code>.</p>
<p>Wouldn't be nicer if we could specify a working directory and run commands from that folder?</p>
<p>That would be neat, and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#workdir">WORKDIR</a> is exactly what we need.</p>
<div data-language="dockerfile"><pre><code><span>FROM</span> python<span>:</span>3.8.3<span>-</span>slim<span>-</span>buster

<span>ARG</span> GIT_HASH
<span>ENV</span> GIT_HASH=$<span>{</span>GIT_HASH<span>:</span><span>-</span>dev<span>}</span>


<span>WORKDIR</span> /project


<span>COPY</span> . .


<span>RUN</span> pip install <span>-</span>r requirements.txt</code></pre></div>
<p>After we specify a <code>WORKDIR</code>, any <code>RUN</code>, <code>CMD</code>, <code>ENTRYPOINT</code>, <code>COPY</code> and <code>ADD</code> instructions that follow will use that working directory.</p>
<p>Note how the path of <code>COPY</code> and <code>pip install</code> changed.</p>
<p>Let's test our application:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>&gt; docker build -t movie-app .
# 💥 it's not python /src/app.py anymore 💥
&gt; docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 movie-app python app.py
&gt; curl localhost:8888</code></pre></div>
<h3>Caching dependencies</h3>
<p>Our application has a small number of external dependencies, the <code>requirements.txt</code> contains only a few dependencies, so the <code>pip install</code> command is fast, just a couple of seconds.</p>
<p>What if it were taking minutes instead of seconds?</p>
<p>Wouldn't be better to cache our dependencies until something changes?</p>
<p>If you try to modify any file inside our application's folder and try to run the Docker build command you will see how Docker builds the image starting from zero.</p>
<p>If you check the console output you should see something like this:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>Step <span>6</span>/7 <span>:</span> RUN pip <span>install</span> -r requirements.txt
 ---<span>&gt;</span> Running <span>in</span> 2233484e3f72</code></pre></div>
<p>Basically any change to our codebase, even if it's not related to <code>requirements.txt</code> will invalidate the Docker cache.</p>
<p>We can be smarter and save some time, <strong>we just need to install our dependencies first</strong>.</p>
<div data-language="dockerfile"><pre><code><span>FROM</span> python<span>:</span>3.8.3<span>-</span>slim<span>-</span>buster

<span>ARG</span> GIT_HASH
<span>ENV</span> GIT_HASH=$<span>{</span>GIT_HASH<span>:</span><span>-</span>dev<span>}</span>

<span>WORKDIR</span> /project


<span>COPY</span> requirements.txt ./
<span>RUN</span> pip install <span>-</span>r requirements.txt


<span>COPY</span> . .</code></pre></div>
<p>We added a new <code>COPY</code>, just for <code>requirements.txt</code>, and moved the <code>pip install</code> right after.</p>
<p>If you now try to build the Docker image again, then change the <code>main.py</code> and rerun the <code>docker build</code> command again that shouldn't invalidate the cache.</p>
<p>This is the output you should see, <code>Using cache</code>:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>&gt; docker build -t movie-app .
Step 6/7 : RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
 ---&gt; Using cache
 ---&gt; cbe7b2865e10</code></pre></div>
<h3>Running your container as non-root user</h3>
<p>By default the user running your command inside a Docker container is <code>root</code>.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>&gt; docker run --rm movie-app whoami
root</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Long story short, Docker containers should not run as root and is highly recommended to change the default user to a non-root user.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How do we change the user?</p>
<p>We create a new one and we set the new user with the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#user">USER</a> instruction.</p>
<div data-language="dockerfile"><pre><code><span>FROM</span> python<span>:</span>3.8.3<span>-</span>slim<span>-</span>buster

<span>ARG</span> GIT_HASH
<span>ENV</span> GIT_HASH=$<span>{</span>GIT_HASH<span>:</span><span>-</span>dev<span>}</span>

<span>WORKDIR</span> /project




<span>RUN</span> useradd <span>-</span>m <span>-</span>r user &amp;&amp; \
    chown user /project


<span>COPY</span> requirements.txt ./
<span>RUN</span> pip install <span>-</span>r requirements.txt

<span>COPY</span> . .


<span>USER</span> user</code></pre></div>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>&gt; docker build -t movie-app .
&gt; docker run --rm movie-app whoami
user</code></pre></div>
<p>Our <code>user</code> can't create new files outside of the <code>/project</code> folder (user is the owner of the folder):</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>&gt; docker run --rm touch /hello
touch: cannot touch '/hello': Permission denied
# 👇 but this command would work
&gt; docker run --rm touch hello</code></pre></div>
<p>Let's test our application to be sure it has all the necessary permissions:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> docker run --rm -p <span>8888</span>:8888 movie-app python app.py
<span>&gt;</span> <span>curl</span> localhost:8888</code></pre></div>
<h3>Taking care of zombie processes and signals</h3>
<p>Each Docker container is a PID namespace, and A PID namespace is a tree, which starts at PID 1, commonly called init.</p>
<p>The entire process of starting the system and shutting it down is maintained by init, when you run a Docker container, PID 1 is what you set inside your <code>ENTRYPOINT</code>.</p>
<p>If you don't set it by default Docker will use <code>/bin/sh -c</code>, which does not pass signals, making almost impossible to gracefully stop your application.</p>
<p>This is why we need a better init, <a href="https://github.com/krallin/tini">Tini</a>.</p>
<p><code>Tini</code> doesn't only take care of reaping zombie processes but also of forwarding any signals we send to the Docker container to our application process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Forwarding signals correctly is really important. Kubernetes relies on signals during the lifecycle of a pod.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-termination">More about Kubernetes and signals here</a>.</p>
<div data-language="dockerfile"><pre><code><span>FROM</span> python<span>:</span>3.8.3<span>-</span>slim<span>-</span>buster

<span>ARG</span> GIT_HASH
<span>ENV</span> GIT_HASH=$<span>{</span>GIT_HASH<span>:</span><span>-</span>dev<span>}</span>

<span>ENV</span> TINI_VERSION=<span>"v0.19.0"</span>


<span>ADD</span> https<span>:</span>//github.com/krallin/tini/releases/download/$<span>{</span>TINI_VERSION<span>}</span>/tini /tini
<span>RUN</span> chmod +x /tini


<span>WORKDIR</span> /project

<span>RUN</span> useradd <span>-</span>m <span>-</span>r user &amp;&amp; \
    chown user /project

<span>COPY</span> requirements.txt ./
<span>RUN</span> pip install <span>-</span>r requirements.txt

<span>COPY</span> . .

<span>USER</span> <span>user</span>


<span>ENTRYPOINT</span> <span>[</span><span>"/tini"</span><span>,</span> <span>"--"</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We have two new instructions here, <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint">ADD</a> and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint">ENTRYPOINT</a>.</p>
<p><code>ADD</code> is a really useful instruction, it can add remote files to you Docker image.</p>
<p>The <code>ENTRYPOINT</code> specifies the entry point for any command, in our case <code>python app.py</code>, pretty much like running <code>/tini -- python app.py</code></p>
<h3>Updating pip, setuptools and wheel</h3>
<p>One last thing, it's important to keep <code>pip</code>, <code>setuptools</code> and <code>wheel</code> updated, so it's wise to bump them directly inside our Docker image.</p>
<div data-language="dockerfile"><pre><code><span>FROM</span> python<span>:</span>3.8.3<span>-</span>slim<span>-</span>buster

<span>ARG</span> GIT_HASH
<span>ENV</span> GIT_HASH=$<span>{</span>GIT_HASH<span>:</span><span>-</span>dev<span>}</span>
<span>ENV</span> TINI_VERSION=<span>"v0.19.0"</span>

<span>ADD</span> https<span>:</span>//github.com/krallin/tini/releases/download/$<span>{</span>TINI_VERSION<span>}</span>/tini /tini
<span>RUN</span> chmod +x /tini


<span>RUN</span> pip install <span>-</span>U \
    pip \
    setuptools \
    wheel

<span>WORKDIR</span> /project

<span>RUN</span> useradd <span>-</span>m <span>-</span>r user &amp;&amp; \
    chown user /project

<span>COPY</span> requirements.txt ./
<span>RUN</span> pip install <span>-</span>r requirements.txt

<span>COPY</span> . .

<span>USER</span> <span>user</span>

<span>ENTRYPOINT</span> <span>[</span><span>"/tini"</span><span>,</span> <span>"--"</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let's test our application once again:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>&gt; docker build -t movie-app .
&gt; docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 movie-app python app.py
curl localhost:8888</code></pre></div>
<p>And with this last step we are done!</p>

  <section><p>Throughout my career, I’ve always gravitated toward incidents. Maybe it’s the
drama, or I like to see how things go wrong. Perhaps… maybe I even cause them?</p>

<p>Whatever the reason, this experience has helped me develop a sense of how I like
handling incidents, something I’ve tried passing onto my team. So when a
colleague asked what our methods were, I was more than happy to respond with
some unstructured ramblings.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://blog.lawrencejones.dev/assets/images/incident-response-email.png" alt="email asking for incident response advice">
</figure>

<p>Since then, Matthieu has regularly nudged me to share these thoughts more
widely. This article is what happened when I took those words, dressed them up
all fancy, and sent them into the world.</p>

<p>I hope you find it useful!</p>

<hr>

<p>If you’ve ever Googled incident response, you’ll have found a load of results
about <strong>incident roles</strong>. Atlassian has some <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management">incredible docs</a> that
explain the concepts well.</p>

<p>In brief:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Incident roles help scale incidents as your response team grows. Roles help
separate responsibilities, ensuring someone is properly focused on each aspect
of an incident. Defining these roles can help make everyone clear about what
they’re expected to do, and what to expect of one another.</li>
  <li>Two <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/incident-response/roles-responsibilities">roles</a> you must be aware of:
    <ul>
      <li>Incident commander, the single point of contact for actions taken related
to this incident. They don’t need to be the person taking the action, but
before you reboot that server, you check with them. This avoids the
classic ‘shit, I didn’t realise you were restoring the database onto
<em>that</em> node’ when you clash with a well-intentioned colleague</li>
      <li>Communications. Essential, and typically the first thing forgotten when
lacking a structured incident response process. Don’t be that team-
nominate someone to manage comms as early as possible, and make sure all
responders actively offload communication to them. Don’t ever split
people’s focus by requiring them to debug and communicate, or you’ll
half-ass both!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>There are many other roles defined in the literature, but roles only help when
your team has a strong understanding of what each role entails. Commander and
communications are, in my opinion, essential- adding more granularity without
sufficient training can confuse incidents and impair your response</li>
</ul>

<p>If you become comfortable with the roles you want to use, and your team are well
practiced in all of them, you’ll have taken the first step towards an effective
response. But now you have the roles, how does your team go about fixing the
issue?</p>

<p>Firstly, identify <strong>what is bleeding</strong>. If you can establish the scope of an
incident early, it means your next steps will be much more likely to address the
problem.</p>

<p>Try to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Identify which systems are failing, then work through the dependencies to
understand whether the issue is due to an upstream or downstream component</li>
  <li>Be extremely wary of assumptions. For everything you receive from a
third-party, trust but verify. Record whatever you did to verify, such as the
commands you ran and the time you ran them. An incorrect assumption can derail
your response, so do your best to avoid them!</li>
  <li>Once you’ve found the technical source, consider running some impact analysis.
Don’t delay your response with this work, but if someone is spare, get them to
estimate the scope of the impact- who and how many are affected. An inaccurate
understanding of impact can lead to poor decisions, and clarity on who is
affected can help other parts of your organisation (Customer Success, Support,
etc) respond appropriately</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the team understands the nature of the incident, you can begin to <strong>stop
the bleeding</strong>. Put differently, your goal should be to stop the immediate pain
and defer clean-up to a less pressured time.</p>

<p>For this, we need to prioritise actions to achieve the best chance of a positive
outcome. Note the phrase <strong>“best chance”</strong>: routine remediations that are quick
to apply should be taken first, even if you suspect it may only partially fix
the problem.</p>

<p>This means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rollback to a known good revision, even if you think you can write a fix
really quickly- you can always do that after you’ve rolled back, when there is
less urgency</li>
  <li>Take action to preserve critical systems, even at the expense of other less
critical flows. If a single endpoint is causing the whole system to fail,
don’t hesitate to no-op that endpoint if it restores service to the parts that
matter</li>
  <li>Make full use of your team and proactively apply whatever fixes you think are
low-risk, even if you suspect it might not fix the whole problem: scale down
non-essential queues, put a freeze on deploys, restart that server. Effective
delegation means it costs little to try, provided other responders continue to
work on root cause analysis assuming the easy fixes will fail</li>
</ul>

<p>This should give you an idea of what your team should work on. The question is
now how should they work together to execute them?</p>

<p>Given incident response is so much about communication, you’ll be wanting an
effective tool for <strong>instant messaging</strong>, and to record a log of your actions.</p>

<p>Turn to Slack (or whatever your equivalent is):</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first action in any incident should be creating a message channel. Several
tools (<a href="https://github.com/monzo/response">monzo/response</a>, <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/introducing-dispatch-da4b8a2a8072">Netflix’s
Dispatch</a>) can automatically create that (and more) for you,
but even if you have to painstakingly click those buttons yourself, do it.
It’s way worth the additional minute of downtime to get that space
ready-to-go.</li>
  <li>I strongly advocate against private incident response channels. Company
culture providing, a public channel can level-up your response by increasing
ease of access to information. This can prevent coordination issues that you’d
head-desk to encounter (I’ve seen two separate incident teams tackling the
same incident, with no knowledge of each others existence…)</li>
  <li>Whenever you’re about to do something destructive, such as run a command or
restart some resource, message the channel. Not only can this improve
awareness across the team, but it provides an invaluable resource when
building an incident log for your post-mortem</li>
</ul>

<p>Instant messaging is great for information that is timestamped and should not be
changed. For content you expect to modify as the incident progresses, create an
<strong>incident document</strong> in your favourite collaborative editor (Google Docs,
Dropbox Paper, Notion, etc):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your organisation can draft incident doc templates that contain the structure
you need: perhaps you have reporting responsibilities, or have a specific
communications flow? Put it all in here, and make it easy to create documents
from these templates with a single click</li>
  <li>Especially for large-scale incidents where people rotate through the incident
team, this doc can act as the entry-point for onboarding people into the
incident. Have whoever runs comms manage this document, maintaining a timeline
of important events, and even draft an executive summary if the incident is
particularly complex</li>
  <li>Have your technical team post code snippets or relevant logs lines into the
document appendix, so everyone can lean on a central view of the incident</li>
</ul>

<p>Paired together, chat log and incident doc can be powerful tools to help
coordinate the response team, while providing transparency to any invested
onlookers. Even better, this content can be easily reshaped into a post-mortem
once the dust has settled.</p>

<p>Finally, and most importantly, the <strong>human element</strong>. People make bad decisions
when stressed, and the excitement of an incident can make you forget entirely
about caring for yourself. Lead by example and be forceful when encouraging your
responders to care for themselves.</p>

<p>Some things to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>One highly effective method to reduce stress is to take breaks, going away
from your screen, and breathing. Actively encourage your team to take these
pauses with you, reducing the chance you’ll screw things up by rushing</li>
  <li>As a general rule, take pauses whenever:
    <ul>
      <li>You get paged. It doesn’t have to be long; just 10s of breathing can
remind your body that you’re in control, and lower your adrenaline.</li>
      <li>Whenever the production impact has ceased. As soon as the alarms go quiet
and things seem stable, call a break for the entire team. It’s rare that
incidents don’t have extended follow-up work: rest yourself for at least
15m before you start that process</li>
      <li>During follow-up, before commencing any sort of procedure, such as
‘recovery of X cluster’. Get everyone to grab some air before running the
checklist, allowing each individual to recharge in case the process goes
wrong, or takes much longer than expected</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ensure your incident commanders are trained to detach responders before they
burn themselves. One important job is to order (and expense!) food before
people get hungry. You’ll be surprised at how an incident response team will
eat, after noisily protesting that they don’t need any food!</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s all folks! A whistle-stop tour through my essential shopping list of
incident response practices. This list is far from complete, but can be used as
a great starter pack, or a prompt for the more experienced to consider what they
care about in their incident response process.</p>

<p>Just remember: take a deep breath, look out for your colleagues, blame systems
not people, and don’t rush. Good luck!</p>

<p><em>Missing from this post is any discussion of post-mortems, preparations you can
make before an incident occurs, or any trade-offs like security vs
data-integrity, vs availability. If you’re interested in hearing my opinions on
these, please do tweet me (<a href="https://twitter.com/lawrjones">@lawrjones</a>) and I’ll be delighted to
share!</em></p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I love text layout, and have been working with it in one form or other for over 35 years. Yet, knowledge about it is quite arcane. I don’t believe there is a single place where it’s all properly written down. I have some explanation for that: while basic text layout is very important for UI, games, and other contexts, a lot of the “professional” needs around text layout are embedded in <em>much</em> more complicated systems such as Microsoft Word or a modern Web browser.</p>

<p>A complete account of text layout would be at least a small book. Since there’s no way I can write that now, this blog post is a small step towards that – in particular, an attempt to describe the “big picture,” using the conceptual framework of a “loose hierarchy.” Essentially, a text layout engine breaks the input into finer and finer grains, then reassembles the results into a text layout object suitable for drawing, measurement, and hit testing.</p>

<p>The main hierarchy is concerned with laying out the entire paragraph as a single line of text. Line breaking is also important, but has a separate, parallel hierarchy.</p>

<h2 id="the-main-text-layout-hierarchy">The main text layout hierarchy</h2>

<p>The hierarchy is: paragraph segmentation as the coarsest granularity, followed by rich text style and BiDi analysis, then itemization (coverage by font), then Unicode script, and shaping clusters as the finest.</p>

<p><img src="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/layout_pyramid.svg" alt="diagram of layout hierarchy"></p>

<h3 id="paragraph-segmentation">Paragraph segmentation</h3>

<p>The coarsest, and also simplest, segmentation task is paragraph segmentation. Most of the time, paragraphs are simply separated by newline (U+000A) characters, though Unicode in its infinite wisdom specifies a number of code point sequences that function as paragraph separators in plain text:</p>

<ul>
  <li>U+000A LINE FEED</li>
  <li>U+000B VERTICAL TAB</li>
  <li>U+000C FORM FEED</li>
  <li>U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN</li>
  <li>U+000D U+000A (CR + LF)</li>
  <li>U+0085 NEXT LINE</li>
  <li>U+2008 LINE SEPARATOR</li>
  <li>U+2009 PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR</li>
</ul>

<p>In rich text, paragraphs are usually indicated through markup rather than special characters, for example <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> in HTML. But in this post, as in most text layout APIs, we’ll treat rich text as plain text + attribute spans.</p>

<h3 id="rich-text-style">Rich text style</h3>

<p>A paragraph of rich text may contain <em>spans</em> that can affect formatting. In particular, choice of font, font weight, italic or no, and a number of other attributes can affect text layout. Thus, each paragraph is typically broken into a some number of <em>style runs,</em> so that within a run the style is consistent.</p>

<p>Note that some style changes don’t <em>necessarily</em> affect text layout. A classic example is color. Firefox, rather famously, does <em>not</em> define segmentation boundaries here for color changes. If a color boundary cuts a ligature, it uses fancy graphics techiques to render parts of the ligature in different color. But this is a subtle refinement and I think not required for basic text rendering. For more details, see <a href="https://gankra.github.io/blah/text-hates-you/">Text Rendering Hates You</a>.</p>

<h3 id="bidirectional-analysis">Bidirectional analysis</h3>

<p>Completely separate from the style spans, a paragraph may in general contain both left-to-right and right-to-left text. The need for bidirectional (BiDi) text is certainly one of the things that makes text layout more complicated.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this part of the stack is defined by a standard (<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/">UAX #9</a>), and there are a number of good implementations. The interested reader is referred to <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/uba-basics">Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm basics</a>. The key takeaway here is that BiDi analysis is done on the plain text of the entire paragraph, and the result is a sequence of <em>level runs,</em> where the level of each run defines whether it is LTR or RTL.</p>

<p>The level runs and the style runs are then merged, so that in subsequent stages each run is of a consistent style and directionality. As such, for the purpose of defining the hierarchy, the result of BiDi analysis could alternatively be considered an implicit or derived rich text span.</p>

<p>In addition to BiDi, which I consider a basic requirement, a more sophisticated text layout engine will also be able to handle vertical <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/writing-mode">writing modes</a>, including mixed cases where short strings are horizontal within the vertical primary direction. Extremely sophisticated layout engines will also be able to handle ruby text and other ways of annotating the main text flow with intercalated strings. See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/">Requirements for Japanese Text Layout</a> for many examples of sophisticated layout requirements; the scope of this blog post really is basic text layout of the kind needed in user interfaces.</p>

<h3 id="itemization-font-coverage">Itemization (font coverage)</h3>

<p>Itemization is the trickiest and least well specified part of the hierarchy. There is no standard for it, and no common implementation. Rather, each text layout engine deals with it in its own special way.</p>

<p>Essentially, the result of itemization is to choose a single concrete font for a run, from a <em>font collection.</em> Generally a font collection consists of a main font (selected by font name from system fonts, or loaded as a custom asset), backed by a <em>fallback stack,</em> which are usually system fonts, but thanks to <a href="https://www.google.com/get/noto/">Noto</a> it is possible to bundle a fallback font stack with an application, if you don’t mind spending a few hundred megabytes for the assets.</p>

<p>Why is it so tricky? A few reasons, which I’ll touch on.</p>

<p>First, it’s not so easy to determine whether a font can render a particular string of text. One reason is <a href="https://unicode.org/reports/tr15/">Unicode normalization</a>. For example, the string “é” can be encoded as U+00E9 (in NFC encoding) or as U+0065 U+0301 (in NFD encoding). Due to the principle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence">Unicode equivalence</a>, these should be rendered identically, but a font may have coverage for only one or the other in its <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/cmap">Character to Glyph Index Mapping</a> (cmap) table. The shaping engine has all the Unicode logic to handle these cases.</p>

<p>Of course, realistic fonts with Latin coverage will have both of these particular sequences covered in the cmap table, but edge cases certainly do happen, both in extended Latin ranges, and other scripts such as Hangul, which has complex normalization rules (thanks in part to a Korean standard for normalization which is somewhat at odds with Unicode). It’s worth noting that <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20201009-00/?p=104351">DirectWrite gets Hangul normalization quite wrong</a>.</p>

<p>I believe a similar situation exists with the Arabic presentation forms; see <a href="https://www.arabeyes.org/Developing_Arabic_fonts">Developing Arabic fonts</a> for more detail on that.</p>

<p>Because of these tricky normalization and presentation issues, the most robust way to determine whether a font can render a string is to try it. This is how LibreOffice has worked for a while, and in 2015 <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/harfbuzz/2015-October/005168.html">Chromium followed</a>. See also <a href="https://www.chromium.org/teams/layout-team/eliminating-simple-text">Eliminating Simple Text</a> for more background on the Chromium text layout changes.</p>

<p><em>Another</em> whole class of complexity is emoji. A lot of emoji can be rendered with either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji#Emoji_versus_text_presentation">text or emoji presentation</a>, and there are no hard and fast rules to pick one or the other. Generally the text presentation is in a symbol font, and the emoji presentation is in a separate color font. A particularly tough example is the smiling emoji, which began its encoding life as 0x01 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437">Code page 437</a>, the standard 8-bit character encoding of the original IBM PC, and is now U+263A in Unicode. However, the suggested default presentation is text, which won’t do in a world which expects color. Apple on iOS unilaterally chose an emoji presentation, so many text stacks follow Apple’s lead. (Incidentally, the most robust way to encode such emoji is to append a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variation_Selectors_(Unicode_block)">variation selector</a> to pin down the presentation.)</p>

<p>Another source of complexity when trying to write a cross-platform text layout engine is querying the system fonts. See <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/skribo/text/2019/04/04/font-fallback.html">Font fallback deep dive</a> for more information about that.</p>

<p>I should note one thing, which might help people doing archaeology of legacy text stacks: it used to be pretty common for text layout to resolve “compatibility” forms such as NFKC and NFKD, and this can lead to various problems. But today it is more common to solve that particular problem by providing a font stack with <em>massive</em> Unicode coverage, including all the code points in the relevant compatibility ranges.</p>

<h3 id="script">Script</h3>

<p>The <em>shaping</em> of text, or the transformation of a sequence of code points into a sequence of positioned glyphs, depends on the script. Some scripts, such as Arabic and Devanagari, have extremely elaborate shaping rules, while others, such as Chinese, are a fairly straightforward mapping from code point into glyph. Latin is somewhere in the middle, starting with a straightforward mapping, but ligatures and kerning are also required for high quality text layout.</p>

<p>Determining script runs is reasonably straightforward - many characters have a Unicode script property which uniquely identifies which script they belong to. However, some characters, such as space, are “common,” so the assigned script just continues the previous run.</p>

<p>A simple example is “hello мир”. This string is broken into two script runs: “hello “ is <code>Latn</code>, and “мир” is <code>Cyrl</code>.</p>

<h3 id="shaping-cluster">Shaping (cluster)</h3>

<p>At this point, we have a run of constant style, font, direction, and script. It is ready for <em>shaping.</em> Shaping is a complicated process that converts a string (sequence of Unicode code points) into positioned glyphs. For the purpose of this blog post, we can generally treat it as a black box. Fortunately, a very high quality open source implementation exists, in the form of HarfBuzz.</p>

<p>We’re not <em>quite</em> done with segmentation, though, as shaping assigns substrings in the input to <a href="https://harfbuzz.github.io/clusters.html">clusters</a> of glyphs. The correspondence depends a lot on the font. In Latin, the string “fi” is often shaped to a single glyph (a ligature). For complex scripts such as Devanagari, a cluster is most often a syllable in the source text, and complex reordering can happen within the cluster.</p>

<p>Clusters are important for <em>hit testing,</em> or determining the correspondence between a physical cursor position in the text layout and the offset within the text. Generally, they can be ignored if the text will only be rendered, not edited (or selected).</p>

<p>Note that these shaping clusters are distinct from grapheme clusters. The “fi” example has two grapheme clusters but a single shaping cluster, so a grapheme cluster boundary can cut a shaping cluster. Since …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

It's an interesting announcement, but the company will face challenges handling and storing the new fuel, as well as with public perceptions over the dangers of hydrogen.</p>  <p>According to <a href="https://www.atag.org/facts-figures.html"><u>industry figures</u></a>, emissions from airplanes worldwide amounted to more than 900 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2019, which is about 2 per cent of total human produced carbon dioxide. While that seems to be a small percentage,&nbsp;the industry has been steadily growing (until this year) so emissions have continued to rise.&nbsp;And decarbonizing aviation is a big challenge.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Advances in engine design and improved aerodynamics have made today's jets far more efficient than they were in the 1950s, just as cars are. But like cars, there are many more of them than there used to be. So to avoid increased emissions, and to cut current emissions, the industry will need to find another way to fly.</p>  <h2>Airbus aims for a hydrogen-powered future of flight</h2>  <p>Airbus's solution is to burn hydrogen in the engines instead of kerosene-based jet fuel. When hydrogen combines with oxygen during combustion, the product is H2O, or water. That's it. Carbon is not part of the equation, although the engine exhaust will contain a lot of hot water vapour which could produce extra long contrails.</p>  <p>Airbus' new ZERO E concept is a plan for three aircraft types: a turboprop commuter, a mid-range turbofan jet and a futuristic blended- wing airliner. All will use engines that have been designed to run on hydrogen. The company calls the planes "hydrogen-hybrid" aircraft as an electric powered boost will also be provided by hydrogen fuel cells.&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5747993.1601654430!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/airbus-three-zero-emission-concept-aircraft.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5747993.1601654430!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/airbus-three-zero-emission-concept-aircraft.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5747993.1601654430!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/airbus-three-zero-emission-concept-aircraft.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5747993.1601654430!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/airbus-three-zero-emission-concept-aircraft.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5747993.1601654430!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/airbus-three-zero-emission-concept-aircraft.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5747993.1601654430!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/airbus-three-zero-emission-concept-aircraft.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Airbus unveils the three zero-emission concept aircraft known as ZEROe, which include turbofan, turboprop and blended-wing body configurations that are powered by hydrogen-fuel.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Airbus)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>In a press conference, Airbus engineers identified some of the strengths and challenges in the new concept.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Liquid hydrogen can deliver similar energy to jet fuel, at one-third the weight, which is a big advantage in aircraft. Unfortunately, while it's light, it's not very dense. So even supercooled liquid hydrogen takes up four times more space for the energy than jet fuel.&nbsp;That means reimagining how to store fuel on the plane.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <h2>New fuel, new aircraft</h2>  <p>The plan anticipates large tanks within the fuselage at the rear of the plane. In other words, within the same body that carries the passengers. This might make some people nervous knowing there is explosive fuel behind their seats.&nbsp;Shades of the Hindenburg disaster.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.3304402.1446670934!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/explosion-of-the-airship-hindenburg.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.3304402.1446670934!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/explosion-of-the-airship-hindenburg.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.3304402.1446670934!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/explosion-of-the-airship-hindenburg.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.3304402.1446670934!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/explosion-of-the-airship-hindenburg.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.3304402.1446670934!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/explosion-of-the-airship-hindenburg.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.3304402.1446670934!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/explosion-of-the-airship-hindenburg.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Explosion of the Hindenburg, May 6, 1937.<!-- --> <!-- -->(The Associated Press)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>But pre-world war two zeppelin catastrophes aside, hydrogen is no more inherently risky than any other fuel. Airbus's new concepts include a venting system that runs up through the tail to disperse any fuel leakage away from the plane.</p>  <p>Hydrogen is, of course, lighter than air, so if there is a leak, it rises up and dissipates very quickly. A leak of jet fuel or gasoline, on the other hand, pools under the aircraft and burns from there.&nbsp;There have been many cases where passengers have survived an air crash, only to die in the fire that breaks out after the plane hits the ground.&nbsp;</p>  <p>One big difficulty is that hydrogen is difficult to handle compared to ordinary jet fuel. To keep it liquid, it has to be chilled to <em>–</em>253 degrees. This means the fuel tanks must be well insulated, and equipment such as pumps and pipes must be designed so they don't freeze up when handling such cold liquids. This will require a huge transition at airports, with new fuelling procedures and storage systems for cryogenic fuels.&nbsp;</p>    <h2>Producing hydrogen without greenhouse gases</h2>  <p>And then there's the emissions question. Hydrogen can be, but isn't necessarily, a "green" fuel. This has been called the&nbsp;"green" versus&nbsp;"black" hydrogen issue. And it comes down to the fact that hydrogen is not an energy source that can be dug out of the ground like oil. It must be made.</p>  <p>Traditionally most industrial hydrogen has been produced from fossil fuels —&nbsp;in fact from "reforming" natural gas (by removing the carbon from its carbon-hydrogen bonds). This produces greenhouse gases.</p>  <p>You can also produce hydrogen by breaking down water into hydrogen and oxygen through electrolysis. Airbus says the electricity to make its hydrogen from water will come from clean alternatives such as wind or solar.&nbsp;But we already face a challenge scaling those up.</p>  <p><span><span><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Fi65k2K3Mw" frameborder="no" title="YouTube content" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></span></span></p>  <p>Hydrogen has been around for decades, driving the early space program, running fuel cell cars and buses. But it has remained somewhat on the sidelines because of a lack of storage and distribution networks, plus the fact that batteries have become so much more efficient and inexpensive.&nbsp;</p>  <p>But batteries are still too heavy for larger aircraft, so hydrogen offers a clean alternative to fossil fuels, and if the airline industry can prove that it is practical and safe, it may work its way more fully into other areas of transportation to keep wheels turning without compromising the climate.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-v-61c0ab88=""> <!----> <div data-v-2ee12136="" data-v-61c0ab88=""><div><p>Anyone who has ever queried information about developer onboarding, could notice right away, what we at Swimm call ‘The Onboardee Bias’. Most onboarding approaches are centered on guiding new hires through their first days, tasks or overcoming the hurdles of getting started. But this approach rarely highlights the troubles and challenges of the mentors*. While we frequently hear about the “Sink or Swim” approach by which new engineers are “thrown into the deep end” with hands-on tasks on their first day in, the truth is, mentors are also treated this way, although unintentionally with no buoy waiting for them.</p>
<p>Mentors are, by definition, some of the more experienced and confident engineers on the team, so it’s almost counter intuitive to highlight their insecurities. Yet, our experience is that this is in-fact the core problem of engineer onboarding.** <strong>In this post we try to shed light on the role of the mentor in the onboarding process:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>‘The Good Mentor Checklist’</li>
<li>How Poor Mentorship Reflects in Business</li>
<li>Mentoring the Mentor 101</li>
</ul>
<p><em>* By ‘mentors’ we mean experienced engineers tasked with onboarding a new hire, sometimes also called “buddies” among engineering teams.</em></p>
<p><em>** There are some awesome onboarding experiences out there. We are not saying they don’t exist. But our experience is that they are not the norm.</em></p>
<h2>1. ‘The Good Mentor Checklist’</h2>
<p>The journey to good mentorship starts with reflecting on your own experiences (as a mentor or mentee). Form a list with some of the tools and traits of a super successful mentor, and then try to map out the hurdles - why do some mentors fail to thrive? Here are some key reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time.</strong> Or lack of it. It’s no coincidence that most mentors are extremely busy. Knowing their way around means they get picked for harder tasks. Good mentorship requires ample time and patience, and many mentors lack those.</li>
<li><strong>Good Documentation.</strong> So much has been written and said about how challenging it is to create and maintain good documentation. Suffice to say that a mentor’s life would be much easier with it, and it rarely exists.</li>
<li><strong>Mentorship Skills.</strong> If you have been picked to be a mentor (congrats), you are likely very experienced and know your way around the company or code. But being a really good mentor means you also need an entire skill-set associated with mentorship such as leadership skills, best practices, up to date training techniques, and more.</li>
<li><strong>A Realistic Plan.</strong> While most organisations create a basic onboarding plan for the first few days on the job, this plan consists mostly of HR issues and basic orientation. Our experience shows that most teams don’t have a plan for onboarding the new hires onto the codebase, explaining common issues, legacy code, best practice or edge cases. If they do, it’s a basic checklist.</li>
<li><strong>Passion for apprenticeship</strong>. It goes without saying that a little passion for paying it forward and teaching others, goes a long way and makes all the difference between a mentor and a really good mentor. A major hurdle is identifying such spirit in mentors and leveraging it, but also making sure they don’t burn out.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How Poor Mentorship Reflects in Business</h2>
<p>So we have established some key elements needed for the job. We also established that many times, mentors, experienced and competent as they may be, are not properly prepared for the task.</p>
<p>How does this affect our job and business?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Swiveling Chair Syndrome</strong>. Getting a task you feel unqualified for, might lead many mentors - even potentially great ones to procrastinate. Preparations for the new hire are pushed to the day before their arrival, and sometimes happen on-the-go. The result of which - talented new engineers swiveling in their chairs for quite some time, waiting for something to happen…(or in other words, stretched out time-to-value).</li>
<li><strong>System malfunctions</strong>. Another unfortunate product could be finger-pointing and blaming “the system”. Feeling embarrassed with their inadequacy, mentors might vent hints of frustration with the new hire: “Yeah, there’s some documentation, but I wouldn’t bother with it… Just try to figure it out…” or “They told me you were coming last week, but we have a version coming out, so I guess you’ll have to manage…”. Of course, these are the last things you want new hires to hear in their first few weeks.</li>
<li><strong>Sinking, not swimming</strong>. We mentioned the “sink or swim” approach earlier. Sure, letting new hires struggle with no help is a way to weed out weaker hires, and it may shorten the time it takes to spot a poor fit. But this also means you are giving the good hires a hard time, sending them to fend for themselves. This method is often used to mask insecurity. Rather than admitting you don’t know how to deal with onboarding someone, it is much easier to explain a lack of a plan with ideology. So, even if this method is not beneficial in the long run, unprepared mentors might adopt it anyway.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>3. Mentoring the Mentor 101</strong></h2>
<p>So, what can you do about this naturally occurring bias?</p>
<p>Like with other issues, acknowledging there is a problem (i.e. that mentors are being overlooked) is a good starting point. Ask senior developers how prepared they were or currently feel to mentor. Ask them how their own onboarding was like, and whether they would have wanted it to be different. Recall your own onboarding experiences, both as a mentor and a new hire. But mainly, focus on cultivating a culture of knowledge sharing, and creating a tier of mentors equipped with the best tools to handle their next mentoring assignment.</p>

<hr>

    <p>For a while now I’ve had a series of blog posts floating around in my head on how to build an HTTP stack in Swift. The idea started last spring with Rob Napier’s <a href="https://robnapier.net/start-with-a-protocol">blog posts on protocols</a>, and matured last summer and fall while I was working at WeWork on an internal Swift framework.</p>

<p>So, with my <a href="https://davedelong.com/blog/2020/06/14/anything-worth-doing/">newfound blogging powers</a>, I think it’s time to tackle this problem. Over the course of several posts, I’ll walk through a number of topics related to HTTP and how we can fit them together into a great Swift framework. We’ll end up with a framework that supports things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>automatically retrying requests</li>
  <li>throttling to a customizable maximum number of concurrent requests</li>
  <li>specifying custom server environments for an entire connection stack, or for a single request</li>
  <li>automatically cancelling in-flight requests when the stack is reset</li>
  <li>basic mesh networking</li>
  <li>implementing OAuth (or any sort of authenticated request)</li>
  <li>multi-part form uploads</li>
  <li>easy mocking of responses</li>
  <li>… and a whole lot more I’m glossing over</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll be building all of this on top of <code>URLSession</code>. And along the way, we’ll be addressing a lot of the feedback I <a href="https://davedelong.com/blog/2018/03/02/apple-networking-feedback/">provided to Apple Engineers</a> about the state of the built-in networking stack. (Awesomely, in the past 2 years a couple of those items have already been addressed)</p>

<p>I will preempt any questions by saying: I will <em>not</em> be publishing the actual code for this framework online. The purpose of these posts is to describe the problems and solutions, but implementing them will be left up to you. I will have small embedded snippets to illustrate concepts, but largely the entire thing will be left as an “exercise for the reader”. There’s just no substitute for sitting down and writing the code yourself.</p>

<p>But… before we get started in Swift, we need to answer a really fundamental question.</p>

<h2 id="what-on-earth-is-http">What on earth is HTTP?</h2>

<p>HTTP, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">“Hypertext Transfer Protocol”</a>, is a specification for describing how two different systems can communicate with each other. As its name implies, it’s a <em>text</em>-based specification. This is great for humans, because text is nicely readable, and it’s good for machines, because text is pretty nicely compressible (which is a major part of the 2.0 specification).</p>

<p>HTTP defines a very specific <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request%E2%80%93response">“request/response”</a> model. You send out a request for information, and you get a response back. One request, one response.</p>

<p>A request has the following format:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A request line</li>
  <li>Zero-or-more header value lines</li>
  <li>A blank line</li>
  <li>An optional body</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="request-lines">Request Lines</h3>

<p>A request line looks something like:</p>



<p>The first part of the line is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods">request method</a>. We’re most familiar with <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code>, but other common HTTP methods include things like <code>HEAD</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>DELETE</code>, and so on. In reality, the HTTP spec itself does not place a limit on the value of the request method, which allows for specs like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV">WebDAV</a> (which powers CalDAV and CardDAV) to add their own methods like <code>COPY</code>, <code>LOCK</code>, <code>PROPFIND</code>, and so on.</p>

<p>This leads us to the simplest of problems with a lot of Swift networking frameworks. It’s really common to see something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>enum</span> <span>HTTPMethod</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>get</span> <span>=</span> <span>"GET"</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>post</span> <span>=</span> <span>"POST"</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>put</span> <span>=</span> <span>"PUT"</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>delete</span> <span>=</span> <span>"DELETE"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since the HTTP spec allows for <em>any</em> single-word method, defining this value in Swift as an <em>enum</em> is incorrect, because an enum only allows for a finite number of values, but there are an infinite number of possible “single word” values. A <em>better</em> implementation of this is to use a <code>struct</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>struct</span> <span>HTTPMethod</span><span>:</span> <span>Hashable</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>let</span> <span>get</span> <span>=</span> <span>HTTPMethod</span><span>(</span><span>rawValue</span><span>:</span> <span>"GET"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>let</span> <span>post</span> <span>=</span> <span>HTTPMethod</span><span>(</span><span>rawValue</span><span>:</span> <span>"POST"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>let</span> <span>put</span> <span>=</span> <span>HTTPMethod</span><span>(</span><span>rawValue</span><span>:</span> <span>"PUT"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>let</span> <span>delete</span> <span>=</span> <span>HTTPMethod</span><span>(</span><span>rawValue</span><span>:</span> <span>"DELETE"</span><span>)</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>let</span> <span>rawValue</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After the method comes the path, which should be readily recognizable as the <code>.path</code> of a <code>URL</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, there’s a bit about which HTTP spec version you’re using. HTTP 2.0 is commonly used these days, but since it mainly deals with <em>compressed</em> HTTP requests, I’ll use the 1.1 version, which describes <em>uncompressed</em> requests.</p>



<p>Headers are a series of key-value pairs, in a familiar key-value-looking format:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Host: swapi.dev
Connection: close
User-Agent: Paw/3.1.10 (Macintosh; OS X/10.15.5) GCDHTTPRequest
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are a number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields">header fields commonly used with HTTP</a>, some of them defined by the specs, and some agreed upon by convention. Like with request methods, there’s no limit to the possible names of a header, nor much of a limit on the possible values.</p>

<h3 id="the-body">The Body</h3>

<p>Any HTTP request may include a body. Yes, even a <code>GET</code> request is allowed to include a body. However, most servers will only interpret the body of a request based on which request method is used, so it’s likely that even if you did include a body with a <code>GET</code> requests, the server would ignore it.</p>

<p>The body itself is just raw binary data. How it’s interpreted by the server depends entirely on conventions agreed upon between the server engineers and the client engineers.</p>

<h2 id="putting-a-request-together">Putting a request together</h2>

<p>If we want to execute a basic HTTP request to the <a href="https://swapi.dev/">Star Wars API</a>, we would construct an HTTP request that looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>GET /api/ HTTP/1.1
Host: swapi.dev
Connection: close
User-Agent: Paw/3.1.10 (Macintosh; OS X/10.15.5) GCDHTTPRequest

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see the request line, 3 header lines, and an empty line at the end. It’s important to note that every line in an HTTP request is separated by <em>two</em> characters: <code>\r\n</code> (carriage return + line feed). This becomes more apparent when we look at the hex representation of this request (newlines inserted for readability):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>474554202F6170692F20485454502F312E310D0A 
486F73743A2073776170692E6465760D0A
436F6E6E656374696F6E3A20636C6F73650D0A 
557365722D4167656E743A205061772F332E312E313020284D6163696E746F73683B204F5320582F31302E31352E35292047434448545450526571756573740D0A
0D0A
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>0D</code> and <code>0A</code> are the hexadecimal representation of <code>\r</code> and <code>\n</code>, respectively. The empty line is how an HTTP server knows where the headers stop and the body begins.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As an aside, if you find yourself working with network APIs a lot, I <em>highly</em> recommend using Lucky Marmot’s fantastic app <a href="https://paw.cloud/">Paw</a>. It is an indispensable tool for analyzing and tweaking network calls.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another thing worth pointing out here is that <code>Host:</code> header. While it’s required by the spec, it doesn’t necessarily specify where the request is going. That’s because the host part of the URL is used before the request is ever sent by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS resolution process</a> as part of the whole “what server am I actually connecting to” flow. The <code>Host</code> header is included for clarity while debugging, and it may be used by the server for further internal routing. For example, you could imagine a server for all of Github Pages using the <code>Host</code> header to know which set of pages you actually want.</p>

<p>So, that’s the request.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-the-response">What about the response?</h2>

<p>The response we get back is almost identical in structure to the request. It has:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The response line</li>
  <li>Zero or more header value lines</li>
  <li>An empty line</li>
  <li>An optional body</li>
</ol>

<p>So, that request to the Star Wars API will have a response that looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.16.1
Date: Sat, 27 Jun 2020 19:13:53 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Connection: close
Vary: Accept, Cookie
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
ETag: "57e8c3fe1ac5cb74e15b96dc98767ce6"
Allow: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=15768000

{"people":"http://swapi.dev/api/people/","planets":"http://swapi.dev/api/planets/","films":"http://swapi.dev/api/films/","species":"http://swapi.dev/api/species/","vehicles":"http://swapi.dev/api/vehicles/","starships":"http://swapi.dev/api/starships/"}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Like with the request, all lines are separated by <code>\r\n</code>, and the empty line is how we know where the headers stop and the body begins. The only other difference is that the first line now has an integer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes">status code</a> and a textual description of the code’s meaning.</p>

<p>Like with request methods, there’s no real limit on the status code values and message. The HTTP spec defines many that we’re familiar with, such as <code>200</code> (OK) and <code>404</code> (Not Found), as well as the allowed range of numbers (100 … 599). But… you <em>could</em> return a <code>666 Diabolical</code> code, or <code>42 Mostly Harmless</code> code. You could even return a <code>200 👍</code> response. But please don’t. 😅</p>

<p>The body, again, is raw binary data and it’s up to the recipient to correctly interpret it. The Star Wars API body is JSON-encoded text, but a body can just as easily be the raw bytes of a <code>.jpg</code> file, or the XML bytes of an RSS feed, or the text that describes an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U">HTTP live streaming playlist</a>.</p>

<h2 id="putting-it-together">Putting it together</h2>

<p>That’s an overview of HTTP requests and responses. This simple model describes the fundamental communications used by most of the internet. It doesn’t cover things like web sockets or push notifications, but this is used by every website and most network APIs. Knowing the details of how this works continues to be one of the most valuable and consistently useful things I know and use as a software engineer.</p>

<p>In the next post, we’ll take a look at how we move from this specification to the basic structures we’ll need for our framework.</p>

<p><strong>Ambassador says government supports equality but ‘gender’ is poorly defined in EU law</strong></p>
<p>Poland’s&nbsp;government was the only one in the Council of the EU that opposed adopting draft conclusions on digital technologies and fundamental rights earlier this week, Research Professional News can reveal. A spokesperson for the government said it did so over the inclusion of the term ‘gender’ in the document.</p>
<p>The conclusions, published on 21 October, refer to the opportunities and problems that artificial intelligence poses for gender equality, and say the EU will cooperate with the human rights body the Council of Europe to promote gender equality.</p>				</section>

                            <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>Last year we had a three part blog series about Qt's new approach to working with 3D graphics APIs and shading languages: <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-quick-on-vulkan-metal-direct3d">part 1</a>, <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-quick-on-vulkan-metal-and-direct3d-part-2">part 2</a>, <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-quick-on-vulkan-metal-and-direct3d-part-3">part 3</a>. For <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtquick-index.html">Qt Quick</a>, an early, opt-in preview of the new rendering architecture was shipped in Qt 5.14, with some improvements in Qt 5.15. With the release of Qt 6.0 upcoming, let's see what has happened since Qt 5.15. It will not be possible to cover every detail of the graphics stack improvements for Qt Quick here, let alone dive into the vast amount of Qt Quick 3D features, many of which are new or improved in Qt 6.0. Rather, the aim is just to give an overview of what can be expected from the graphics stack perspective when Qt 6.0 ships later this year.</p>
<p>Note that the documentation links refer to the Qt 6 snapshot documentation. This allows seeing the latest C++ and QML API pages, including all changed and new functions, but the content is also not final. These links may also break later on.</p>

<h2>QRhi improvements</h2>
<p>QRhi, the Qt Rendering Hardware Interface, is Qt's internal graphics abstraction when 3D APIs, such as OpenGL, Vulkan, Metal, and Direct 3D, are involved. Compared to 5.15, the main improvements in 6.0 are a lot of polishing fixes here and there, and, most importantly, a large set of performance optimizations. While benefitting Qt Quick as well, these become especially important with Qt Quick 3D when complex scenes with many renderable objects are involved.</p>
<p>With some simplifications, the main layers of the Qt 6.0 graphics stack can be visualized like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=800&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png" alt="rhiarch-3" width="800" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=400&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 400w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=800&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 800w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=1200&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 1200w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=1600&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 1600w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=2000&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 2000w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=2400&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 2400w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<h2>Shader management</h2>
<p>The Qt Shader Tools module is now a selectable module in the installer. For applications this can be relevant because this is the module that provides the <em>qsb</em> command-line tool (not to be confused with <em>qbs</em>) and its associated CMake build system integration. In addition, the module is a mandatory dependency for Qt Quick 3D at the moment.</p>
<p>Qt 6 no longer uses OpenGL-compatible GLSL source snippets directly. Rather, shaders are all written in Vulkan-style GLSL, then reflected and translated to other shading languages, and finally packaged up into a serializable QShader object that can be consumed by QRhi. The shader preparation pipeline in Qt 6 is the following:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=1280&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png" alt="shaderconditioning" width="1280" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=640&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 640w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=1280&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 1280w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=1920&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 1920w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=2560&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 2560w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=3200&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 3200w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=3840&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 3840w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>In QML applications using Qt Quick, whenever working with ShaderEffect, or subclassing QSGMaterialShader, the application will need to provide a baked shader pack in form of a .qsb file. These are generated by the <em>qsb</em> tool. This does not however mean that developers have to start dealing with a new tool directly: with the CMake integration one can easily list the vertex, fragment, and compute shaders in CMakeLists.txt via the qt6_add_shaders() CMake function. Invoking qsb and packing the resulting .qsb files into the Qt resource system is then taken care of by the build system.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtshadertools-index.html">the shadertools documentation</a> for an overview of how graphics and compute shaders are handled in Qt 6 and the details of the qsb tool and its CMake integration.</p>
<h2>Direct OpenGL is no more for Qt Quick</h2>
<p>In Qt 5.14 and 5.15, Qt Quick shipped with an optional QRhi-based rendering path that could be enabled by setting the environment variable <em>QSG_RHI</em>. This allowed painless experimenting with the new stack, while keeping the traditional, battle tested direct OpenGL code path the default.</p>
<p>In Qt 6.0 all such switches are gone. There is no way get rendering go directly to OpenGL with Qt Quick scenes. Rather, the new default is the QRhi-based rendering path of the Qt Quick scene graph. Other than the defaults changing, the ways to configure what QRhi backend, and so which graphics API to use are mostly unchanged compared to Qt 5.15. See <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtquick-visualcanvas-scenegraph-renderer.html#rendering-via-the-qt-rendering-hardware-interface">the documentation</a> for details. One difference is better API naming: in C++ code to request, and so effectively tie the application to, a given QRhi backend (and by extension graphics API) is now done through the <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickwindow.html#setGraphicsApi">QQuickWindow::setGraphicsApi()</a> function, whereas in 5.15 this task used to be pushed onto an overload of setSceneGraphBackend(), leading to fairly inaccurate naming.</p>
<p>There are a number of implications, although many applications will not notice any of these. If an application uses neither shader code (ShaderEffect, QSGMaterial) nor does it perform its own rendering with OpenGL directly, there is a very high chance that it will need no migration steps at all. (at least not because of graphics)</p>
<h4>Applications using OpenGL directly</h4>
<p>What about applications that use OpenGL directly in one way or another, and are not interested in functioning with other graphics APIs? For example, applications that use <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickframebufferobject.html">QQuickFramebufferObject</a>, or connect to signals like <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickwindow.html#beforeRendering">QQuickWindow::beforeRendering()</a> to inject their own OpenGL rendering under or above the Qt Quick scene. This is when the setGraphicsApi() function mentioned above comes into play for real: if an application wishes, it can always state that it wants OpenGL (or Vulkan, or Metal, or D3D) only, and nothing else. That way it is guaranteed that Qt Quick is going to use the corresponding QRhi backend (or else it will fail to initialize), so the application can safely assume that going directly to OpenGL is safe, because Qt Quick will also end up rendering through OpenGL. Note that this does not exempt the application from having to do other type of porting steps: for example, if it in addition uses ShaderEffect or creates its own custom materials, it will still need to migrate to the new ways of handling shaders and materials.</p>
<h4>QSG* and QQuick* API changes</h4>
<p>The API changes mainly fall into 3 categories. This is not going to be an exhaustive list, but rather just a peek at some of the important changes. Detailed change lists and porting guides are expected to be available with the final Qt 6.0 release.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><p>Different approach to shaders and materials: <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qsgmaterialshader.html">QSGMaterialShader</a> received a full revamp (matching more or less what the now-removed QSGMaterialRhiShader used to be in 5.14 and 5.15). <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qml-qtquick-shadereffect.html">ShaderEffect</a> no longer allows inline shader strings. Rather, the vertexShader and fragmentShader properties are URLs, similarly to <span>Image.source</span> and others. They can refer to a local .qsb file, or a .qsb file embedded via the Qt resource system (qrc).</p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removing OpenGL-specifics from QQuickWindow, QSGTexture, and elsewhere. It should come as no surprise that functions like <em>GLuint textureId()</em>, <em>createTextureFromId(GLuint textureId, ...)</em>, or <em>setRenderTarget(GLuint fboId)</em> are now gone. Adopting (wrapping) an existing OpenGL texture, Vulkan image, Metal texture, or D3D11 texture, or accessing the underlying native texture for a QSGTexture is still perfectly possible, but now is done via a different set of APIs, such as <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qnativeinterface-qsgvulkantexture.html">QSGVulkanTexture</a> and the <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qnativeinterface-sub-qtquick.html">other similar classes</a>, instances of which are <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qsgtexture.html?__hstc=233546881.8510e053e4fb66e1a58543a6e9886427.1603454017210.1603454017210.1603454017210.1&amp;__hssc=233546881.1.1603454017210&amp;__hsfp=1285229618#nativeInterface" rel="noopener">queryable from QSGTexure</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><p>Integrating the application's own custom rendering with the graphics API that Qt Quick renders with is fully supported, not just for OpenGL, but also Vulkan, Metal, and D3D11. Due to their nature however, some of these APIs will need more than connecting to one single signal like beforeRendering() or afterRendering(). For example, we now also have <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickwindow.html#beforeRenderPassRecording">beforeRenderPassRecording()</a>. See the relevant section in the <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtquick-visualcanvas-scenegraph.html#mixing-scene-graph-and-the-native-graphics-api">scenegraph overview docs</a> for more details and links to examples. Finally, the number of native graphics resources queryable via <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qsgrendererinterface.html">QSGRendererInterface</a> has been extended, now covering Vulkan, Metal, and Direct 3D too.</p></div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extending support for redirecting the Qt Quick scene into an offscreen render target. <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/%3Ehttps://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickrendercontrol.html">QQuickRenderControl</a> and the related infrastructure has been heavily enhanced. This was done not just to enable working with graphics APIs other than OpenGL the same way as in Qt 5 (for example, to render a Qt Quick scene into a Vulkan VkImage without an on-screen window), but also to enable integration with AR/VR frameworks and APIs such as <a href="https://www.khronos.org/openxr/">OpenXR</a> (in combination with any of Vulkan, D3D11, or OpenGL). Besides the slightly changed QQuickRenderControl interface, we now have a number of helper classes that improve the configurability of a QQuickWindow: <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickrendertarget.html">QQuickRenderTarget</a>, <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickgraphicsdevice.html">QQuickGraphicsDevice</a>, and <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickgraphicsconfiguration.html">QQuickGraphicsConfiguration</a>. These are essential in scenarios where a more fine grained control is needed: integrating with APIs like OpenXR is not always straightforward when an existing rendering engine is involved, with a number of potential chicken-egg problems when it comes to the creation, initialization, and ownership of instance, device, and other graphics objects: Which Vulkan instance should Qt Quick use, or should it create a new one upon initializing the scenegraph for the first time? Which Vulkan physical device or DXGI adapter should Qt Quick pick, or just stay with the default? Which VkDevice extensions should be enabled in addition to what Qt itself needs? What 2D image/texture should rendering target, who creates that and when? The expectation is that Qt 6.0 will be well-prepared and providing the foundations for further exploring the world of AR/VR during the rest of the Qt 6.x series.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>New approach to handling shader code in ShaderEffect</h4>
<p>A comprehensive example of the new approach to shader code in ShaderEffect is the Qt 6 port of the classic Qt 5 Cinematic Experience demo. <a href="https://github.com/alpqr/qt5-cinematic-experience" rel="noopener">(GitHub repo)</a> This version is ported to CMake and is fully functional with all graphics APIs, including all shader and particle effects.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=702&amp;name=cinematic.png" alt="cinematic" width="702" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=351&amp;name=cinematic.png 351w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=702&amp;name=cinematic.png 702w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=1053&amp;name=cinematic.png 1053w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=1404&amp;name=cinematic.png 1404w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=1755&amp;name=cinematic.png 1755w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=2106&amp;name=cinematic.png 2106w" sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px"></p>
<p>Looking at the QML source code, for example the code for the <a href="https://github.com/alpqr/qt5-cinematic-experience/blob/master/content/CurtainEffect.qml" rel="noopener">curtain effect </a>shows that indeed it has all inline GLSL strings removed.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png?width=354&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png" width="354" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png?width=177&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png 177w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png?width=354&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png 354w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png?width=531&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png 531w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png?width=708&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png 708w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png?width=885&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png 885w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png?width=1062&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png 1062w" sizes="(max-width: 354px) 100vw, 354px"></p>
<p>Instead, the vertex and fragment shaders now live as <a href="https://github.com/alpqr/qt5-cinematic-experience/tree/master/shaders" rel="noopener">ordinary files in the source tree</a>, not bundled with the application executable anymore.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/alpqr/qt5-cinematic-experience/tree/master/shaders" rel="noopener"><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-24-06-07-PM.png?width=300&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-24-06-07-PM.png" width="300" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-24-06-07-PM.png?width=150&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-24-06-07-PM.png 150w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-24-06-07-PM.png?width=300&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-24-06-07-PM.png 300w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-24-06-07-PM.png?width=450&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-24-06-07-PM.png 450w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-24-06-07-PM.png?width=600&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-24-06-07-PM.png 600w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-24-06-07-PM.png?width=750&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-24-06-07-PM.png 750w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-24-06-07-PM.png?width=900&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-24-06-07-PM.png 900w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>It is now up to the build system and Qt Shader Tools to compile, reflect, and translate at build time - with the added benefit of shader compilation errors becoming proper build errors instead of …</p></span></p></div></div>

		<p>I am a notorious note-taker. Over the years, I've learned not to rely solely on my (or anyone else's) memory but to create well structured, concise, and adequately labeled notes for future use. It's not only required to preserve the knowledge, but it helps you develop some valuable abilities &amp; skills, e.g.:</p><ul><li>synthesis of information</li><li>clarity of thought</li><li>proper application of mental models</li><li>crafting a visual structure that carries the supplementary information</li><li>sketching :)</li></ul><p>I've tried various techniques of note-taking. Friction-less apps like Bear, personal knowledge management tools like Notion, audio recorders like Otter, outlining tools like Workflowy, Zettelkasten-inspired research tools like Roam or Obsidian. All of them have their pros, I still use some of them daily for specific purposes (Notion, Roam), but none of them has beaten the <strong>fundamental advantages</strong> of a thin sheet of paper:</p><ul><li>minimum latency (&amp; inertia)</li><li>maximum flexibility (when it comes to notation &amp; form - nothing is enforced)</li></ul><p>Obviously, <strong>paper has its flaws</strong> as well:</p><ul><li>it's immutable</li><li>digitizing it is a manual, cumbersome process</li><li>full freedom of what you draw/write/scribble is fantastic, but sometimes it would save a lot of time to have a library of stencils/templates</li><li>inventorizing the notes properly (so they're searchable/navigable in scale) is not easy</li><li>making cross-content references is also a pain</li></ul><p>Is it possible to have a solution <strong>with the advantages of paper but devoid of its flaws</strong>? In my quest to answer this question, I've decided to reach for an e-ink tablet named <a href="https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2">reMarkable 2</a>.</p><hr><p>It's the 2nd iteration of that concept. I was considering a purchase of the previous generation one, but in the end, I've passed because of the high price and moderately enthusiastic reviews on the Internet. According to its creators' declaration, the new edition is supposed to fix its predecessor's flaws. And the price tag is much more wallet-friendly.</p><p>So in the end I've decided to give it a go. The production and delivery cycle has been delayed due to COVID-19 (by two months), but I've finally received my device, used it for few weeks, and can now provide you my initial review.</p><figure><img src="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/remarkable_2.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/remarkable_2.jpg 600w, https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/remarkable_2.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Before I dive into the actual details - what precisely did I order? Apart from the tablet itself (there's just one model, no options/variants), I've picked the marker (more expensive version - with the eraser) and a folio case (opens like a book, covers full tablet).</p><p>I'll spare you all the specification details - screen density, dimensions, weight, etc. - you can find all of those at the manufacturer's site. I'd like to focus on impressions &amp; conclusions only.</p><p>IMHO the hardware quality is on par with <strong>Amazon Kindle Oasis 2</strong> - the e-book reader I use daily for a long time. Solid, sturdy, durable, thin &amp; aesthetic. No cheap plastic elements. The only visible differences between Oasis and reMarkable 2 (except for the size) are the lack of screen backlight and turn-page buttons. </p><p>Additional observations:</p><ol><li>the screen is not automatically turned on/off when closing the folio case - TBH I don't find it a significant flaw</li><li>the marker is attached magnetically to the side of the tablet - it snaps precisely, exactly when expected, and it doesn't drop off randomly - zero complaints here</li></ol><hr><p>Marker is not required to use reMarkable 2, but TBH using the tablet w/o it kind of misses the whole point. It's supposed to be <strong>a note-taking device, not an e-book reader</strong>. You've been probably waiting for that, so I'm not stalling anymore: the marker works surprisingly well - both accuracy and latency are more than acceptable:</p><ul><li>I don't remember getting frustrated that the effect of my scribbling doesn't match my intent (<u>precision</u>)</li><li>the <u>feedback</u> is nearly instantaneous - I didn't have a feeling I'm intentionally slowing down (writing or scribbling) to compensate for any device's speed deficiencies</li><li>the speed (of a move, while marker touches the surface) doesn't affect the <u>accuracy</u> (fluidity) - lines remain continuous, without gaps or other inaccuracies</li></ul><figure><img src="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/remarkable_5.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/remarkable_5.jpg 600w, https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/remarkable_5.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Btw. the marker has a removable rod at its tip - that's the only surface that touches the screen when scribbling. I can't tell how quickly it wears out, but you get a few spare ones as replacements. So far, I didn't notice any scratches on the e-ink screen - let's hope it stays that way.</p><p>My marker (the more expensive version) theoretically works like a pencil with an eraser at the opposite end. That's the theory - in practice, it turns out that you can't rub (to erase), but you need to poke. It's not only unintuitive but also quite slow. However - it works.</p><p>Overall, reMarkable 2 hardware doesn't disappoint - it provides <u><strong>a solid base to meet expectations</strong></u>, but TBH there was no <em>"wow effect"</em> - I didn't have a feeling of handling a breakthrough <em>"next-gen"</em> device.</p><p>There are three pieces of software to evaluate pretty much independently:</p><ol><li>Tablet firmware</li><li>PC companion app</li><li>Chrome extension</li></ol><h3 id="tablet-firmware">Tablet firmware</h3><p>Needless to say, good hardware is crap w/o decent software (on the device). Surprisingly reMarkable 2 <strong>doesn't shine here</strong>. Tablet's software is very minimalistic (which is not an issue <em>per se</em>) - you can read e-books and make notes, but the software doesn't do much to improve/expand the experience:</p><ul><li>no dictionaries/Wiki support</li><li>no bookmarking/indexing</li><li>three colors (black, one shade of grey, white) for note-taking :(</li><li>the surface for scribbling is fixed (forget about infinite whiteboard ...) and in fact rather small (but you can easily add more sheets, of course)</li><li>OCR functionality is limited - whole page or nothing</li><li>there's zero integration with popular note-taking tools/platforms (like Evernote or OneNote) - all you can do is to export to image formats like PNG</li></ul><figure><img src="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/remarkable_4.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/remarkable_4.jpg 600w"></figure><p>Unfortunately, I've encountered <strong>few bugs/inconsistencies</strong> as well:</p><ol><li>there were misleading synchronization messages (<em>"failed but succeeded"</em> style of communication ;P)</li><li>once I've tried to change font settings for an article sent via Chrome extension (it was a part of Apache Arrow specification), the device started rebooting repeatedly (about five times) - I was able to replicate the issue</li></ol><hr><p>But to be honest, there are <strong>some pros worth mentioning</strong> as well:</p><ol><li>You can scribble over your e-books (!) - underline, highlight, add comments on margins. It works like a charm, is very convenient, but TBH I didn't check how foolproof it is (e.g., what happens with the notes if I adjust margin settings, so page numeration changes ...).</li><li>There's a nice variety of "pens" available - ones that imitate pencils, brushes, highlighters, or markers - I find the selection wide enough for my needs.</li><li>It's possible to add transparent layers, so you can scribble on one without affecting others.</li><li>One can also use one of many available templates (stencils) for the full pages (only): tables, grids, checklists, organizers, even perspective "helpers" or guitar chord sheets.</li><li>Selecting content is super-convenient - you just draw a shape around an item ("magic lasso" style), and then you can scale, rotate or cut the selection.</li><li>You need to get used to erasing stuff - it's impossible to "select" elements by "clicking"; you need either to use the selection tool or the opposite tip of your marker (if you have the expensive version).</li></ol><figure><img src="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/remarkable_3.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/remarkable_3.jpg 600w, https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/remarkable_3.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="pc-companion-app">PC companion app</h3><p>What about the PC companion app? I've tried the Windows version, and it ... just works. Its primary purpose is to upload e-books, and it does it in quite a convenient way - you don't need to plug the device to your PC (with USB cable), because it sends the e-book over the Internet.</p><p>When it comes to e-books, two formats are supported: PDF and epub. I have literally zero complaints regarding PDFs - due to the larger screen, the user experience (of reading PDF) was much more pleasant than with <strong>Amazon Kindle Oasis 2</strong>. But my epubs were rendered poorly, like if someone has stripped all the formatting and converted the rich text to raw text. Frankly, I can't tell whether it's the issue with epub format or reMarkable 2, because I've never used epub before (only mobi), but the effect was disappointing anyway.</p><h3 id="the-browser-extension">The browser extension</h3><p>The browser extension is available only for Chrome (sadly). All it does is send whatever page you're reading to your reMarkable 2 as either raw text or PDF (it uses PDF print functionality built into Chrome). I've already mentioned issues with changing font settings for raw text articles. Hopefully, this gets fixed soon.</p><p>I guess it's time to round things up.</p><p><strong>reMarkable 2</strong> is a great piece of hardware that needs some improvement of the software powering it. I dreamed of using it as a minimum-friction note-taking <em>"front-end"</em> for powerful knowledge management platforms I use, but it's very cumbersome at this point. It's a standalone device, <strong>reMarkable 2</strong> isn't even trying to either attach to any existing app ecosystem or creating its own (challenger) one.</p><p>That's a big disappointment. But I believe that CAN be fixed; the potential is still there. The device's essential features - <u>high responsiveness</u>, <u>remarkable accuracy</u>, and <u>low latency times</u> - are there: confirmed and unquestionable.</p><p>What kind of improvements would I gladly see? Here are some ideas:</p><ol><li>OCR for selection - replaces scribbling (in-place) with recognized text</li><li>Import/export from popular knowledge management tools</li><li>Remove the fixed boundaries of quick notes scribbling space (make it "virtually infinite")</li><li>Casting/transmitting the content of the device e.g. to computer screen in real-time (e.g. to present for the larger audience or just collaborate remotely)</li><li>Stencil library for shapes (e.g. sticky notes, basic icons, elements of the most popular visual notations)</li><li>Better UX for syncing stuff (on the tablet) - e.g. force sync button</li></ol><p>What I think is beyond the capabilities of reMarkable 2 (even with regular software updates)?</p><ol><li>More colors (I don't believe they've reduced it to 3 for kicks and giggles ...)</li><li>"Objectualizing" parts of the note and adding dynamic connectors between them (e.g. flows, arrows, lines) that adjust when objects are moved</li></ol><hr><p><strong>So, was it worth it (the price tag)?</strong></p><p>I honestly can't tell at this point. In time I will know …</p></section></article></div>

<p>… or failures are your friends :&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;INTRO&gt;</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/imgur.com/xzJXBgG.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/imgur.com/xzJXBgG.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>&lt;/INTRO&gt;</p>
<p>The story behind this whole post is a bit lengthy but I’ll try to be brief 🙂</p>
<p>In August of 2019, I’ve received an email from MrTrinsic. Back then, I didn’t yet know what is coming lol.</p>
<p>It turned out that MrTrinsic is a great Amiga enthusiast and he’d asked me to work on his Amiga 1000 … but no on a standard A1000 but with an Amiga 1000 Phoenix motherboard!</p>
<p>Amiga 1000 Phoenix Enhanced mobo is an extremely rare motherboard replacement for Amiga 1000. Some people think there were no more than 200 units manufactured, others say it was no more than 2000. I’ve no idea either but still, it is very rare so a magic smoke is not an option lol.</p>
<p>This motherboard is an awesome hack in itself and that is why MrTrinsic refers to it as DIVA 😀</p>
<p>Let me quote an excerpt from one of emails.</p>
<p><em>You should mention or point out more clearly that the Phoenix Board is a … DIVA!<br>It is a hack. Just look at the manual what kind of things you can modify and what kind of headers there are to change stuff.<br>The price is that it has an extremely bad signal quality. Plus, it lacks the Buster-Chip that the Amiga 2000 has.<br>The Phoenix is a bad version of the original A2000 from Braunschweig, which in itself was a hacked and beefed-up version of the A1000.<br>Plus, the Phoenix only has two layers. It’s a nightmare as we have seen.</em></p>
<p>It simply always has some problems like stability and compatibility issues which I’ve tried to sort out.</p>
<p>Phoenix mobo was developed in 1989/1990 by our fellow friends from Australia and was one of the very first crowd-funding campaigns! You can read/watch more on one of my fav websites -&gt; <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.amigalove.com/viewtopic.php?t=476" target="_blank">www.amigalove.com</a></p>
<p>Hardware specs are available here -&gt;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amiga.resource.cx/exp/phoenix" target="_blank"> amiga.resource.cx</a></p>
<h4>The plan</h4>
<p>Initially, MrTrinsic asked me to work on some external floppy replacements by Dell which I will cover in another post. Once I’ve figured out that floppy drive issue he’d decided we should start working on The Phoenix project.</p>
<p>At first, he’d send me a large box with gear that he wanted to have in this Amiga. I was like OMG! Not only Phoenix but the whole large project was about to begin!</p>
<p>The plan was to run lots of modern hardware add-ons with Amiga 1000 Phoenix and later try to squeeze it into a nice looking case, plus make it alive and stable.</p>
<p>The first package arrived and I was really excited by what I’ve seen.</p>
<p>Amiga 1000 Phoenix in an A1000 case with lots of mods and hacks already installed, plus, tons of other hardware mods still in boxes … and that was only for starters …</p>

<p>Obviously, the original plan was to MAKE Amiga 1000 Phoenix GREAT AGAIN!</p>
<p>Jokes aside, the main goal was to run a graphics card along with <a href="http://wiki.icomp.de/wiki/ACA500plus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ACA500plus</a> + <a href="http://wiki.icomp.de/wiki/ACA1233n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ACA1233n</a> accelerator card by iComp</p>
<p>On top of tons of other minor hardware mods, He’d also sent me two graphic cards – <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://shop.mntmn.com/products/zz9000-for-amiga-preorder" target="_blank">ZZ9000 by MNT</a> and GBAPII++ by KryoFlux.</p>

<h4>Running it</h4>
<p>First things first. Phoenix motherboard is so rare that I first had to learn how it works and how it is all connected etc.</p>
<p>As it gave me a black screen at the very first run, I had to start learning about jumper settings and the board in general</p>
<p>Below, you can see a block diagram of particular parts location to give you an idea of what is where.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/imgur.com/1Dz8Jbp.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/imgur.com/1Dz8Jbp.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>Of course, I would not move on quickly without MrTrinsics support. He’d pointed me to several sites and sent over some more info about the board itself. One of the most important documents I’ve received was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/phoenix_jumpers_english.pdf" target="_blank">the jumper settings file</a> along with the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Phoenix.pdf" target="_blank">original manual</a>.</p>
<p>The above documents gave me the general idea of how things should work. The very first thing that I did was the removal of all added mods. I’ve then tried to run the A1K but still no luck – black screen. MrTrinsic then pointed me to jumper L35 which could cause such behavior if set incorrectly and bingo! It worked! </p>
<p>Since Phoenix has slots for more than one ROM chip, it is possible to install three KickStarts – 1.3. and 3.1 and third as a custom option. That was already done, along with a switch hack.</p>

<p>The problem was that Amiga wasn’t starting every single time. Instead, it booted every couple of times. My next move was to take it out and try running it outside of the case. This is where I’ve started noticing all the awesome texts on the PCB itself. I took PCB out started shooting pics of those texts and greetz for various hackers of that era.</p>

<p>Next, I’ve checked for any obvious problems and when I was happy with this inspection, I’ve put it back to a case to simply avoid any accidental short circuits caused by beer-drinking ;P</p>
<p>I’ve decided that I will try to run it with only Indivision ECS2, and KryoFlux GBAPII++ inserted.</p>
<p>I’ve then located the switch setting for the first ROM and put an awesome<a href="http://www.diagrom.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> DiagROM by John “<em>Chucky</em>” Hertell</a> in a socket. Yeah, I know, it is a quite a large resistor ;P</p>

<p>To my surprise, it worked flawlessly and I was greeted by a known diag info and a menu a bit later.</p>

<p>Once it worked, I’ve figured that it might be as simple as a flaky ROM socket problem. I’ve put a 2.0 ROM in the place of DiagROM and Viola! It works!</p>

<p>When I’ve figured that part out, I could move on and start working on the alternative power supply which was …</p>
<h4>HDPLEX + Uber nice Amiga adapter</h4>
<p>MrTrinsic sent me this HQ HDPLEX Pico PSU but he’d also sent me a very cool DIY KIT – ATX2.0d-Amiga adapter which has super cool features like over-voltage/current protection outputs all needed voltages, and has additional floppy power outputs. Moreover, it generates a TICK signal which is good to have for testing.</p>
<p>However, it was a DIY KIT so I had to solder it all up first.</p>

<p>All I needed to do next was to prepare all the wiring. That was a trivial job after taking some measurements. I’ve used wires from my Nissan Patrol spare wiring kit as these are thick (copper) and nice, hence the color mismatch ;P</p>

<p>It worked like a charm so now I had two working power supplies – original and superior to it HDPLEX with a kickass adapter.</p>
<h4>030 cards</h4>
<p>The next step was about adding 68030 CPU to the system. I had two options as MrTrinsic sent me two different solutions.</p>
<p>The First solution was an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://icomp.de/shop-icomp/en/produkt-details/product/ACA500plus.html" target="_blank">ACA500plus</a> card along with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://wiki.icomp.de/wiki/ACA1233n" target="_blank">an ACA1233n</a> accelerator card by Individual Computers. ACA500plus also had an Ethernet add-on – X-Surf 500</p>
<p>These two make a great solution but for AMIGA 500. There are not many folks out there who played it with it in an A1000 and especially with a Phoenix mobo!</p>

<p>Below, a demo running on this setup</p>

<p>The second setup was a bit different. It is made of four devices.</p>
<ul><li>Open 68000 relocator card</li><li>68030 accelerator card </li><li>SDRam + IDE interface</li><li>IDE2CF interface</li></ul>
<p>This setup also appeared to be working nicely after some tests, however as MrTrinsic pointed out, it has some stability issues and will not allow running some software so it was a backup card in case ACA failed. I don’t have a video of it running though.</p>

<h4>Other mods and add-ons</h4>
<p>Once accel-cards were tested, I’ve started installing OS and testing other mods. To name the few:</p>
<ul><li>X-surf 500 Ethernet card</li><li>RapidRoad USB</li><li>Indivision ECS v2</li><li>SCSI2SD </li><li>KryoFlux GBAPII++</li></ul>

<p>Obviously, I wouldn’t be myself if I didn’t destroy something. I’ve accidentally connected the RapidRoad USB module to a clock port the other way around. The magic smoke appeared and…</p>

<p>Of course, I had to fix it. After a while, it turned out that only 3R3 resistor was fried.</p>

<h4>GFX cards</h4>
<p>Once all other major mods were working more or less correctly, I could start testing GFX cards high-res modes.</p>
<p>This is where it all started to go wrong …</p>

<p>I had two cards to test with this setup – GBAPII++ by Kryoflux and ZZ9000 by MNT. </p>
<p>GBAPII++ worked nicely only with green 030 cards, but in such config, there would be no Ethernet card.</p>

<p>Then I’ve tried running ZZ9000 along with green 030 and ACA cards but I’ve encountered autoconfig problems.</p>

<p>Finally, I’ve focused on ACA500plus with ACA1233n and I just couldn’t make it work. </p>
<p>When ACA was inserted then GBAPII++ was completely invisible to the system.</p>
<p>After updating tons of libraries, firmware and reinstalling OS a few times without any luck, we’ve figured out that it might be a power issue. MrTrinsic ordered an adapter for A500 which would allow pumping in more power.</p>
<p>I’ve first tested it with a stock A500.</p>

<p>Same story, GBAPII++ was invisible but I’ve checked it with A1K and power injector adapter just to be sure … unfortunately no luck again.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/imgur.com/1hkTi44.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/imgur.com/1hkTi44.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<h4>Unfinished 🙁</h4>
<p>I’ve invested weeks of time into this GFX problem research but finally, I had to give up on this project for now. It is still in an unfinished state until we will find a solution to all problems. The project is partially done but it requires more work and I hope to cover it someday in one of the future posts making Amiga 1000 Phoenix great again!</p>
<p>But worry not, this gave birth to a new project which is even more awesome.</p>
<p>Currently, it is a work-in-progress but that is a story for another blog post 🙂</p>

October 27, 2020 | https://anonymoushash.vmbrasseur.com/2020/10/26/personality-in-open-source | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://anonymoushash.vmbrasseur.com/2020/10/26/personality-in-open-source">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
        
        <p>In September, <a href="https://twitter.com/esthershein">Ether Shein</a> interviewed me for an <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/how-personality-traits-affect-the-open-source-development-process/">article</a> she was writing for <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/">Functionize</a> about how personality affects the development process in open source projects. The article was inspired by a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8935389">study published in 2019</a> about the effects of personality traits on the acceptance of pull requests. Both the article and the study are worth a read.</p>

<p>What follows are my responses to the questions Esther sent.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-your-reaction-to-the-research-suggesting-that-a-developers-personality-has-an-impact-on-the-ability-to-successfully-contribute-to-an-open-source-project">What is your reaction to the research suggesting that a developer’s personality has an impact on the ability to successfully contribute to an open source project?</h2>

<p>What’s the adjective for “the furthest thing from surprised”? Because whatever that word is describes my reaction to this finding. While the research phrases it academically as “personality,” what they mean by that is someone’s ability to interact with others, the application of social interaction skills as well as technical skills.</p>

<p><em>Of course</em> social interaction is critical to a successful open source contribution, because it’s critical to <em>any</em> endeavour that involves more than one human being. Collaboration is difficult if not impossible when people aren’t able to interact well, whether due to personal skills, language differences, or some other obstruction. This is why we as humans spend so much time researching and discussing how to interact better: it affects everything we do as a civil society.</p>

<p>It’s also why so much of <a href="https://fossforge.com/">my book</a> ended up being about the social interactions involved with contributing to an open source project: it’s vital to the success of your contribution. We in open source have abundant documentation about the technical aspects of contributing, such as writing tests or the mechanics of sending your contribution for review. However, we have relatively little documentation about the social expectations for that contribution. Not that projects ignore the social expectations, of course; it’s simply that they rarely document them. Instead these expectations are a part of the tribal knowledge that a new contributor is expected to absorb. This can lead to a frustrating contribution experience. <a href="https://fossforge.com/">The book</a> collects these previously unwritten social rules of open source contributing in a single spot, giving people a better chance of success.</p>

<p>Which isn’t to diminish the importance of the findings of this research. These personality factors have a massive impact on the end result of an open source contribution, and this research has done a lot of work to prove that. Unfortunately, many people require that proof. They would rather throw a <code>[citation needed]</code> gauntlet on the table than make an effort to learn how to interact better with others. This research is the latest in a long line of responses to that gauntlet.</p>

<h2 id="should-maintainers-apply-personality-categorisation-methods-to-open-source-contributors">Should maintainers apply personality categorisation methods to open source contributors?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>People who are curious about where they score in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits">Big Five personality traits</a> can take the test at Open Psychometrics, while simultaneously (but optionally) contributing their results to ongoing research: <a href="http://openpsychometrics.org/">http://openpsychometrics.org</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As pointed out by the researchers, so far Big Five holds up to rigorous study. As such, it’s proven useful for broad sociological research such as this. Other personality type methodologies, such as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), do not hold up to study and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator#Criticism">are considered problematic</a>.</p>

<p>Regardless of personality categorisation method, a category is not a judgement. For instance, scoring lower in the Neuroticism factor in Big Five simply means your emotional state is more variable <em>as compared with the others who took the test</em>. It’s a research label, not a diagnosis.</p>

<p>I believe it would be dangerous for individuals or projects to start incorporating this research into their contribution workflows at this time. It’s easy to picture some nightmare of a startup spinning up to “leverage AI, ML, and NLP to analyse your open source contributions and maximise the contributor-maintainer synergy, creating a more scaleable, sustainable, and delightful contribution experience” or <a href="https://strategy-madlibs.herokuapp.com/">some such rubbish</a>.</p>

<p>Yes, responding to and reviewing contributions can be time consuming, but applying generalisations intended for research to real-world situations typically <a href="https://twitter.com/justsaysinmice">causes more harm than good</a>. Please bury that terrible startup idea in a deep hole somewhere and pretend it never existed.</p>



<p>You can’t feasibly remove people from software development. Even if you go low-code or were to step into a sci-fi world and automate all code generation, you’re still creating software to solve problems for humans. Humans must be involved in the process somewhere, or it’s very unlikely that their needs will be met (in which case, why bother having the software at all?).</p>

<p>Right now code generation isn’t automated (for the most part); code is written by people. People creating software to solve problems for other people. With so many people in the mix, of course social interactions will have an outsized impact on the end result. Communication, conflict resolution, and empathy are key to successful social interactions. They’re important, and thankfully they’re learnable. You may never be perfect at—for instance—conflict resolution, but you can learn how to get better at it.</p>

<p>Therefore a practical takeaway from this research is that <strong>time spent learning how to improve your social interactions will have a larger return on investment for your career than the time spent improving your technical skills</strong>. Which isn’t to say that you should neglect your technical skills. This isn’t an either-or situation; it’s both-and. A software development career with technical but not social improvements is like a cake without the sugar: not very appealing.</p>

<p>Another important and practical takeaway from this research is the one that most people are overlooking: <strong>Having a diversity of social traits in an open source community leads to a better contribution experience.</strong> There’s plenty of research that supports this. <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter">Homogeneous teams consistently underperform those with diverse membership</a>. In this case, the researchers found that communities with diverse social and personality traits have more successful (i.e. merged) contributions. Therefore it follows that anything you can do to increase the human diversity in your open source project will also lead to more contributions.</p>

<p>That’s a powerful finding, and is possibly more important than the findings that are focused on the individual person submitting or reviewing a contribution.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/33ee6b19-10fa-4d51-8898-d35eb670b3fe%2Ftelemelt-FINAL.png?v=1601250432872" alt="Telemelt Logo"></p>
<p><a href="https://telemelt.com/">Telemelt</a> is a web-based multi-emulator (<a href="https://www.retroarch.com/">RetroArch</a>/<a href="https://www.libretro.com/">libretro</a>) designed to recreate the experience of playing console games with a single controller in a room full of friends.</p>
<p>Gathering around a TV and collectively attempting to beat a game has been a consistent joy throughout my life, and is one of the rituals I miss the most with the ones we're separated from right now. I wanted to create a way to play single player/hotseat games with friends remotely that was free and required minimal setup. Netplay has always been unsatisfying for this, since only the host had low enough latency for games that require tight timing. I started this project in March, and have been pouring my heart into it every day possible since then.<br>
<img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/33ee6b19-10fa-4d51-8898-d35eb670b3fe%2F6dfcbe63-2f80-4bb3-a780-a48a51dc0a19.image.png?v=1602011998888" alt="collage"></p>
<p>The system skips traditional netplay to allow a single player to assume host responsibility and experience <strong>zero network latency</strong> for games with demanding response times, with the viewers processing frames as broadcasted by the player. The virtual controller/host can be instantly passed to any user in the room.</p>
<p><strong>Designed to be lowest hassle way to play emulated games with a friend or loved one, even if they are not tech savvy!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No port forwarding, no IP addresses thanks to auto-generated URL</li>
<li>No installation or downloads, everything works in browser</li>
<li>Mappings for common/inexpensive controllers (PS3/4, XB360/1, Switch JC/Pro etc..) on both USB/BT thanks to RetroArch bindings</li>
<li>Always free! No tracking, no logins, no paid advertisements - personal budget allocated for Azure costs to serve thousands of users for months</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Focus on the experience of passing <em>a single controller</em> between people</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This allows for a unique and efficient architecture that provides a consistent experience with minimal bandwidth</li>
<li>No AV is transmitted! Only controller and serialized state data, made even smaller by <a href="https://github.com/phretaddin/schemapack">schemapack</a></li>
<li>User state error checked per frame and reconciled via <a href="http://socket.io/">socket.io</a> server if needed</li>
<li>Takes advantage of deterministic nature of certain libretro cores - like a broadcasted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool-assisted_speedrun">TAS</a></li>
<li>Rethink the kinds of content you would play (painting, music collaboration, RPGs, game shows)</li>
<li>Everyone working towards the same goal keeps people engaged</li>
</ul>

And this also means that you can focus on those more important tasks and become more efficient at them.</p><p>At the end of this guide, you will have all the necessary knowledge to analyze your approach toward different assignments and make the corresponding adjustments to be more productive.

And to do that, I will use the <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/pyramid-of-mastery/">Pyramid of Mastery</a> — a model that allows you to understand better a domain of interest, its constituent parts, and how to become an expert in it.</p><p>It does so by defining a domain through four types of entities:</p><ul><li><strong>Elements.</strong> These are the building blocks of the field of interest, that include concepts, ideas, and entities;</li><li><strong>Rules.</strong> These are the laws that govern a domain. This layer comprises both rules that define the interaction between various Elements as well as organizational and governing rules at the domain level;</li><li><strong>Tools.</strong> These are the instruments you use to perform the activities within a field;</li><li><strong>Frameworks.</strong> These are combinations of the above levels that allow for faster achievement of preset goals for which the Framework was created;</li></ul><p>For an in-depth explanation of the Pyramid of Mastery, you can read the original <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/pyramid-of-mastery/">article</a> on it.</p><p>Now, once you have an understanding of the model, let’s see how we can define productivity through the prism of it.</p><h2 id="productivity-elements">Productivity Elements</h2><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/the-pyramid-of-mastery/the-pyramid-elements.png" alt="Pyramid of Mastery - Elements"></p><p>What are the Elements of productivity, the building blocks that you need to know about in order to excel at it?</p><p>I find this to be the most underestimated and overlooked layer. Very few people are thinking about what makes a productive person or about what productivity consists of. Instead, they try to squeeze in more time using tools, calendars, and other tools.</p><p>But knowing the fundamentals is vital if you want to become an expert in something. Therefore, here are some of the Elements that can help you be more productive if you understand them.</p><h3 id="human-senses">Human Senses</h3><p>Our senses are the only mechanisms that allow us to get information about the world around us. Humans have five main senses through which they receive information:</p><ul><li>Vision</li><li>Hearing</li><li>Touch</li><li>Smell</li><li>Taste</li></ul><p>Each sense has its own throughput:</p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/conscious_attention_bit_sec.png#c" alt="Image with conscious attention throughput"></p><p>Therefore, we receive the most information visually, then through hearing, touch, smell, and taste.</p><p>If you are interested in the topic of human senses, I wrote a separate, in-depth <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/human-senses/">article</a> about it.</p><h3 id="attention">Attention</h3><p>We receive a flood of information through our senses at every moment, but only a tiny bit of it reaches our awareness. This filter that orients our focus toward different stimuli is <strong>attention.</strong></p><p>Attention is the process that selects which sensory information is preferentially processed and ultimately reaches our awareness.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><p>There are two types of attention: <em>Goal-Directed</em> attention (GDA) and <em>Stimulus-Driven</em> attention (SDA). The GDA is the voluntary effort to focus on something, be it reading this article, cutting vegetables, watching a movie, or writing code.</p><p>On the other hand, SDA is the involuntary reaction toward stimuli that are salient enough to grab our attention:</p><ul><li>contrasting things (stillness to movement, loud to soft, silence to sound, dark to bright, etc.);</li><li>intensity stimulation (extreme sounds, sights, etc.);</li><li>certain impulses we find vital or appealing (dangerous things, beautiful things, shiny things, etc.);</li></ul><p>If you are interested in the topic of attention, I wrote a separate, in-depth <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/attention/">article</a> about it.</p><h3 id="working-memory">Working Memory</h3><p>For tasks that require cognitive effort, once we focused our attention on a specific subset of stimuli we got from our senses, it is only here that we can finally perform some mental work.</p><p>Working Memory is the place in our memory where we can consciously process and manipulate data. It has a fundamental limitation, though: its processing capacity is limited to ~4 chunks of information.</p><p>A <em>chunk</em> is a relative unit of measurement that depends on different factors, such as:</p><ul><li>familiarity with the topic;</li><li>complexity of the concept;</li><li>one’s mental agility;</li></ul><p>For instance, in the simple task of solving this simple math equation <code>21 * 2</code>, you have to store number <code>21</code> as a chunk, store number <code>2</code> as another chunk, then, having these 2 in your working memory, do the multiplication, and store the result <code>42</code> as a third chunk.</p><p>However, in a debate on “homeschooling vs. formal education,” both concepts each represent a chunk. As it is a complex concept, you can then zoom in or out on either of those as information is stored in a complex network of associations in our brain.</p><p>If you would like to learn more about working memory, I wrote a separate, in-depth <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/working-memory/">article</a> about it.</p><h3 id="long-term-memory">Long-Term Memory</h3><p>Our Long-Term Memory (LTM) holds all the information, knowledge, skills, plans, and memories. What you commit to the LTM can stay there for your whole life. Although there is a tendency to forget things, you can strengthen your memories using repetition.</p><h3 id="task-process">Task Process</h3><p>A task usually represents a specific result you want to achieve (e.g., write an article, build a website, create a marketing campaign, etc.). But behind any such assignment, there is a sequence of steps necessary to complete before you can say that you have done the task. It is called a <strong>process.</strong></p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/task-process.png" alt="Image of a task process"></p><p>Each step in the process is a smaller task that will advance you closer to your desired result.</p><p>Learn and understand the necessary steps needed to achieve the end goal — it will show you what you are doing well and where you are wasting your time. Besides this, it is always easier to follow a list of specific action steps rather than figure out what to do on the fly.</p><h3 id="domain-specific-elements">Domain Specific Elements</h3><p>Finally, since productivity is measured per task, it means that besides the Elements mentioned above, there are some domain-specific ones that you must also understand to be more effective.</p><p>And this is valid for all layers of the pyramid — you must know your domain of activity. Otherwise, you cannot be productive in it since you will have to learn a lot, and learning is a slow and effortful process in itself.</p><p>Now, once we have enumerated the primary elements, let’s discuss the Rules that govern the domain of productivity.</p><h2 id="productivity-rules">Productivity Rules</h2><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/the-pyramid-of-mastery/the-pyramid-rules.png" alt="Pyramid of Mastery - Rules"></p><p>How the Elements we have enumerated interact? Here are some essential Rules that govern how we function and perform cognitive work.</p><h3 id="stimulus-driven-attention-overrides-goal-directed-attention">Stimulus-Driven Attention Overrides Goal-Directed Attention</h3><p>Imagine that while you are reading this article, you hear the sound of a breaking plate in the kitchen, which distracts you from reading. Or you are working on a report, and suddenly, the light starts to flash, thus distracting you from the job.</p><p>Stimulus-Driven attention can override your voluntary, Goal-Directed attention. This is bad news for productivity since, most of the time, working on a task means we have to engage this Goal-Directed attention to focus on some things consciously. And because those things might be boring, monotonous, or uninteresting, we can get distracted much easier by any unrelated stimulus.</p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/bright-shiny-objects.jpg#c" alt="Cartoon where dogs in a meeting are being distracted by a squirrel"></p><p>The following stimuli are all capable of distracting your Goal-Directed Attention:</p><ul><li>high-contrast changes in our environment (stillness to movement, loud to soft, silence to sound, dark to bright, etc.);</li><li>intensity stimulation (extreme sounds, sights, etc.);</li><li>some certain impulses we find vital or appealing (dangerous things, beautiful things, shiny things, etc.);</li><li>“important” (e.g., one’s own name).</li></ul><h3 id="working-memory-is-physiologically-incapable-to-multitask">Working Memory Is Physiologically Incapable To Multitask</h3><p>Imagine you are in a warehouse with an immense storage capacity (that’s your Long-Term Memory), a single small table with four zones where any kind of work can be performed (that’s your Working Memory), and a storekeeper who does all the work and knows where everything is stored. One constraint is that the storekeeper can work <em>only</em> at the table, so you must first put it there before doing anything.</p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/working-memory-analogy.png#c" alt="Image of a table with four zones and a storekeeper"></p><p>Each chunk takes one slot on the table. And you can get it either from your senses (imagine a conveyor system that brings things directly to your table) or search in the warehouse (which takes time).</p><p>Suppose you are working on a report. The storekeeper searches for relevant information in your Long-Term memory, puts it on the table, takes some from the conveyor, and puts it on the table as well, where they can manipulate, combine, dissect, and mix those concepts.</p><p>But suddenly, you are being called by your spouse regarding the plans for the weekend. Ideally, the storekeeper should take the time to carefully take the chunks off the table and put them in a dedicated place where they can find them later. In reality, however, the storekeeper sweeps off in a hurry everything from the table and rushes to put on it chunks related to plans for the weekend: movies, cuisine, activities, etc.</p><p>Then, when you are done talking with your spouse, you stare blankly at the computer screen, trying to recall what you were doing before the call. The storekeeper runs hysterically around the table in these moments, trying to find out something, but they don’t know what exactly to look for. Finally, you see the opened MS Excel window and remember you were working on the report.</p><p>But then another problem arises. You cannot recall the latest thoughts you had just before the call. The storekeeper cannot find the chunks they swept off the table. They looked everywhere, but the chunks just vanished. And …</p></div></div>

<p>PHP 8 is already in it's release candidate stage, with RC 3 being released on October 29th, and the general availability release targeted for November 26th. So it is time to take a look at all the new and upcoming features of PHP 8. You can take a look at PHP 8's <a href="https://wiki.php.net/todo/php80">release schedule here</a>.</p>
<p>Every feature that you see in this blogpost comes with an interactive embedded editor, where you can modify the PHP code and evaluate the results yourself.</p>
<p>The official upgrade guide can be found on <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/PHP-8.0/UPGRADING">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>A union type accepts values of multiple different types, rather than a single one.</p>

<h2 id="added-weakmap-a-hrefhttpswikiphpnetrfcweak-mapsrfca">Added WeakMap (<a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/weak_maps">RFC</a>) <a href="#added-weakmap-a-hrefhttpswikiphpnetrfcweak-mapsrfca">#</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Weak maps allow creating a map from objects to arbitrary values (similar to SplObjectStorage) without preventing the objects that are used as keys from being garbage collected. If an object key is garbage collected, it will simply be removed from the map.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a very useful new feature, as it allows users to worry even less about leaving memory leaks in their code. While this might not be an issue for most PHP developers, it is certainly something to watch out for when writing long-running processes, for example using ReactPHP. With WeakMaps, references to an object automatically get garbage collected, once the object is no longer available.</p>
<p>If you would do the same thing with an array, you would still have a reference to the object, thus leaking memory.</p>
<pre data-theme="light" data-filename="index.php" data-php="8"><pre data-filename="index.php">&lt;?php
declare(strict_types=1);
 

class FooBar {
    public WeakMap $cache;
    
    public function __construct() {
    	$this-&gt;cache = new WeakMap();
    }
 
    public function getSomethingWithCaching(object $obj) {
        return $this-&gt;cache[$obj] ??= $this-&gt;computeSomethingExpensive($obj);
    }
    
    public function computeSomethingExpensive(object $obj) {
		dump("I got called");
		return rand(1, 100);
    }
}

$cacheObject = new stdClass;

$obj = new FooBar;
// "I got called" only will be printed once
$obj-&gt;getSomethingWithCaching($cacheObject);
$obj-&gt;getSomethingWithCaching($cacheObject);

dump(count($obj-&gt;cache));

// When unsetting our object, the WeakMap frees up memory
unset($cacheObject);

dump(count($obj-&gt;cache));

<h2 id="new-codevalueerrorcode-exception">New <code>ValueError</code> Exception <a href="#new-codevalueerrorcode-exception">#</a></h2>
<p>PHP 8 introduces a new built-in exception class called <code>ValueError</code>. It extends <code>\Exception</code> and PHP throws this exception, every time you pass a value to a function, which has a valid type - but can not be used for the operation. Prior to PHP 8, this would result in a warning.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<pre data-theme="light" data-filename="index.php" data-php="8"><pre data-filename="index.php">&lt;?php
declare(strict_types=1);
 
/**
 * We pass an array to array_rand,
 * which is of the correct type. But
 * array_rand expects non-empty arrays.
 *
 * This throws a ValueError exception.
 */
array_rand([], 0);

/**
 * The depth argument for json_decode is a
 * valid integer, but it must be greater than 0
 */
json_decode('{}', true, -1);

<p>The <code>static</code> return type may now be used in PHP 8 to identify that a method returns the class, that this method was actually called on - even if it was inherited (late static binding).</p>
<pre data-theme="light" data-filename="index.php" data-php="8"><pre data-filename="index.php">&lt;?php

<p>PHP 8 introduces a new <code>Stringable</code> interfaces, which gets automatically added, once a class implements the <code>__toString</code> method. You do not need to explicitly implement this interface.</p>

<h2 id="added-support-for-attributes">Added support for Attributes <a href="#added-support-for-attributes">#</a></h2>
<p>PHP 8's attributes actually consist of a number of RFCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>RFC: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/attributes_v2">https://wiki.php.net/rfc/attributes_v2</a>
</li>
<li>RFC: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/attribute_amendments">https://wiki.php.net/rfc/attribute_amendments</a>
</li>
<li>RFC: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/shorter_attribute_syntax">https://wiki.php.net/rfc/shorter_attribute_syntax</a>
</li>
<li>RFC: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/shorter_attribute_syntax_change">https://wiki.php.net/rfc/shorter_attribute_syntax_change</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Attributes are definitely one of the biggest changes in PHP 8, and they can be a bit tricky to understand at first. In short, attributes allow you to add meta-data to PHP functions, parameters, classes, etc.
This meta-data can then be retrieved programatically - whereas in PHP 7 and lower, you would need to parse doclocks, attributes allow you to access this information deeply integrated into PHP itself.</p>
<p>To make this a bit clearer, lets say that you want to allow users to add a middleware to a controller class/method by using an attribute.</p>
<pre data-theme="light" data-filename="index.php" data-php="8"><pre data-filename="index.php">&lt;?php
declare(strict_types=1);
// First, we need to define the attribute. An Attribute itself is just a plain PHP class, that is annotated as an Attribute itself.

#[Attribute]
class ApplyMiddleware
{
    public array $middlware = [];

    public function __construct(...$middleware) {
        $this-&gt;middleware = $middleware;
    }
}

// This adds the attribute to the MyController class, with the "auth" middleware as an argument.

#[ApplyMiddleware('auth')]
class MyController
{
    public function index() {}
}

// We can then retrieve all ApplyMiddleware attributes on our class using reflection

<p>Every day people walk past Wennington Green, on the corner of Grove Road and Roman Road, without realising this was the spot on which stood Rachel Whiteread’s controversial inside-out concrete cast of an East End terraced house. Why was this Bow landmark demolished?</p>

<h2>Wennington Green, Bow, London</h2>



<p>At the intersection of Roman Road and Grove Road lies Wennington Green – a patch of land in <a href="https://romanroadlondon.com/mile-end-park-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mile End Park </a>principally sculpted by flying bombs. In fact, an English Heritage plaque on the railway bridge a little further down Grove Road commemorates the first one to strike London.</p>



<p>The blitz largely levelled the hundred or so turn-of-the-century terraces, common stock of the working class East End, on what is now the Green but up until the early ‘90s a row of dilapidated dwellings persisted. These residences were mostly derelict, abandoned and occasionally squatted, but for one, ex-docker Mr Sidney Gale of No. 193, a condemned house remained a home.</p>



<p>Indeed, in 1993, the final row was fated to be demolished as part of Tower Hamlet’s council’s plan to create a Green Corridor, unifying the broken line of parkland between the Isle of Dogs and the established lung of <a href="https://romanroadlondon.com/victoria-park-east-london-bow/">Victoria Park</a>. It was a means to cleanse the area of the legacy of prefabs that had homed the dislocated population post-war and a redemptive space for those in the high-rise accommodation which had replaced the traditional terraces. ‘What people who live in tower blocks want is parkland,’ declared Councillor Eric Flounders.</p>



<p>Yet psychogeographer Iain Sinclair was sceptical of the council’s motives, calling it ‘an Arcadia for the underclass… the whole scheme was a disinterested attempt at municipal aesthetics’. Pointedly, the area was in direct sight of Mrs Thatcher’s commerce baby, Canary Wharf, and the call for a Green was not a far cry from the original motivations to create Victoria Park, opened in 1845. Vicky Park is the oldest purpose built recreation ground in London, conceived to curb disease contracted in damp and cramped conditions and as a means harness working-class wildness. Indeed, Bow is an area rich with connotations of a strong working-class community, but also radicalism and revolt.</p>



<p>Mr Gale forcefully resisted eviction from No. 193 by the council for a number of years, even festooning the property with banners to affirm his unrelenting presence, but, realising his campaign was ultimately futile, he eventually yielded and was re-homed nearby. Gale’s loss was artist Rachel Whiteread’s gain. The practitioner had been seeking a condemned property in London for over two years to realise a project which was essentially a development upon her Turner Prize nominated sculpture, Ghost (1990); a room-sized cast of a bedsit contained in a Victorian property in Archway.</p>



<p>Whiteread, supported by art commissioners Artangel, approached the London Borough of Tower Hamlets&nbsp;council about utilising the property and the authorities duly consented. In the beginning, the council were of the opinion that, ‘It won’t cost the neighbourhood a penny and will provide an unusual landmark for the area,’ however, by the time the bricks were removed and the sculpture was exposed, Councillor Flounders, Chair of Bow Parks Board, denounced it as ‘excrescent.’</p>



<h2>Building Rachel Whiteread’s House</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="692" src="https://romanroadlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Rachel-Whiteread-house-credit-David-Hoffman-1024x692.jpg" alt="Rachel Whiteread's House on Grove Road in Bow, photo by David Hoffman" srcset="https://romanroadlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Rachel-Whiteread-house-credit-David-Hoffman-1024x692.jpg 1024w, https://romanroadlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Rachel-Whiteread-house-credit-David-Hoffman-300x203.jpg 300w, https://romanroadlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Rachel-Whiteread-house-credit-David-Hoffman-768x519.jpg 768w, https://romanroadlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Rachel-Whiteread-house-credit-David-Hoffman.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Rachel Whiteread’s house view of Grove Road © David Hoffman</figcaption></figure>



<p>To make House, Whiteread used the physical house as&nbsp;a&nbsp;mould, making a cast from the interior by spraying a skin of liquid concrete around a metal armature constructed to support the weight of the work. Coating the whole house took over a month and an additional ten days were needed for the concrete to cure and set. Once solid, scaffolding was erected and Whiteread and her assistants began to remove the exterior brick structure.</p>



<p>What was revealed was an uncanny sight – the concrete impressed with the idiosyncrasies of over a century of domestic habitation. Depressions translated into protrusions; the industrial material betraying past human intimacies: soot marking the fire; yellow paint from a top-floor bedroom. The floors in-between stories could not be cast so, as local Markham Hall recalls, it resembled a ‘wedding cake.’ But the marriage at hand, between the art world and the East End, was to be short-lived and volatile.</p>



<h2>Reactions to Rachel Whiteread’s House</h2>



<p>It was essentially a neutral process, with no specific moral agenda, but Whiteread conceded ‘I knew of course, while I was making House, it had a political dimension. You can’t make a cast of a house in a poor area of London and not be political.’ Yet it became ‘far more political than I could have predicted.’ Seemingly, the council had also underestimated its resonance, as it quickly became front-page news, attracting scores of art-pilgrims and causing traffic chaos. Its status was even brought to debate in the House of Commons. The council couldn’t wait to get rid of the work fast enough, coming to regard it as a politically embarrassing monument to an impoverished history and standing in the way of the construction of a less threatening green space.</p>

Why Not? © David Hoffman</figcaption></figure>



<p>People reacted to House so strongly as it transcended the individual and became an archetype; an emblem for the area’s time-honoured mode of living. Indeed, it raised pressing questions regarding degrading housing stock and what should be done with it, the creeping gentrification of a historically tight working class community and scepticism towards the authority of those instigating change for the supposed ‘greater good’. In whose name was this change really for? And poignantly, it confronted these questions on its own material terms – concrete being the material used to fix the original Victorian House’s bricks; the embossed surface betraying the umbilical cords of pipes and power-lines which linked the individual house with the local, national and global public.</p>



<p>At base, Whiteread made an empty space, the negative void of the vacated property, into a positive object but insists ‘the work is to do with absence not presence.’ Implicitly, House was defined by the object it was not. When one refers to a ‘house’ we generally mean the façade as publicly viewed from the street, the interior is intimate – that is the home. Whiteread’s sculpture was resolutely an interior; an unsettling mass of inside, out.</p>



<p>The form elicited unease as when we have an intimate relationship with a space, we start to ignore its intricacies, instead handling navigating through the general form unconsciously. Thus, the sculpture was uncanny as it solidified the overlooked, demanding a long-looking, deep contemplation, as one attempted to decipher the inverted forms. Whiteread neglected to furnish her House with meaning but it was predominantly envisioned as what the populace of Bow would soon lose sight of. The interior, a family home, was left out in the cold and significantly, Whiteread chose not to cast the attic space, as if riffing on the idiom ‘left with no roof over their heads.’</p>



<p>It’s understandable then, that there was some resentment from locals towards House as they perceived it to be adding insult to injury over the demolition of such homes in the area, and a crassness in exposing working-class abode for the ‘arty’ leisure classes. Yet, this wasn’t just a case of Art World vs. East Enders, the opinions were split within both camps: in the Art World, Andrew Graham-Dixon proclaimed it ‘a strange and fantastical object which also amounts to one of the most extraordinary and imaginative public sculptures created by an English artist this century.’ To Brian&nbsp;Sewell, it was a ‘meritless gigantism.’ Sewell’s scorn found resonance in one local’s assertion that ‘an engineer could have done it; I don’t see it as creative.’ Whereas, another neighbour to the site regarded it as ‘brilliant,’ reckoning it to be ‘a new way of looking at traditional things.’</p>



<p>House’s evicted resident, Mr Gale, protested, ‘They’re taking the wee-wee.’ He questioned, ‘How can they get grants for arts projects when we can’t get grants for homes? I could have bought a new home for my family with this money.’ His sentiment was echoed in graffiti scrawled on the sculpture: ‘WOT FOR?’ Another renegade scribe rebuffing ‘Why not!’</p>



<p>House’s economics became even more contentious when Whiteread won the £20,000 Turner Prize for the work (the first woman to receive the honour), and then £40,000 from the rebel K Foundation (composed of members of the defunct pop group KLF) for the ‘worst artist of the year.’ Whiteread split the latter money between Shelter, a charity for the London’s homeless, and a fund to supplement young artists. On the same day, the&nbsp;Council made the decision to refuse House a stay of execution. By this time, many people (philanthropists, dealers, galleries) had offered to purchase House, but money offered to the Council to retain its presence was blasted by the authorities as ‘bribes.’ In any case, Whiteread was adamant that the sculpture was ‘absolutely specific to the site’ thus preferred its destruction to relocation.</p>



<p>The bulldozers came on January 11th 1994. The <em>East London Advertiser</em> reports that ‘art lovers’ chained themselves to the railings in attempt to save the work, quoting one as protesting, ‘We’re doing this because House represents the destruction of not only homes but whole communities in East London.’ Another suggested its removal was a sacrilegious act, perceiving House as ‘a headstone to the houses that were here.’ But the sculpture’s fate was sealed. As Whiteread succinctly mused ‘it took three and a half years to develop, four months to make, and thirty minutes to demolish.’</p>



<h2>The legacy of Rachel Whiteread’s House</h2>



<p>The Houseless Park has now had over 20 years to bed in to the community’s psyche and flourish naturally. In all of the articles and art history books I have trawled to substantiate …</p></div></div>

    <p>Ever since teaching <a href="https://github.com/chiphuyen/stanford-tensorflow-tutorials">TensorFlow for Deep Learning Research</a>, I’ve known that I love teaching and want to do it again.</p>

<p>In early 2019, I started talking with Stanford’s CS department about the possibility of coming back to teach. After almost two years in development, the course has finally taken shape. I’m excited to let you know that I’ll be teaching <strong>CS 329S: Machine Learning Systems Design at Stanford</strong> in January 2021.</p>

<p>The course wouldn’t have been possible with the help of many people including <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~chrismre/">Christopher Ré</a>, Jerry Cain, Mehran Sahami, <a href="https://pirroh.fyi/">Michele Catasta</a>, Mykel J. Kochenderfer.</p>

<p>Here’s a short description of the course. You can find the (tentative) syllabus below.</p>

<p><em>This project-based course covers the iterative process for designing, developing, and deploying machine learning systems. It focuses on systems that require massive datasets and compute resources, such as large neural networks. Students will learn about the different layers of the data pipeline, approaches to model selection, training, scaling, as well as how to deploy, monitor, and maintain ML systems. In the process, students will learn about important issues including privacy, fairness, and security.</em></p>

<p><strong>Pre-requisites</strong>: <em>At least one of the following; CS229, CS230, CS231N, CS224N, or equivalent. Students should have a good understanding of machine learning algorithms and should be familiar with at least one framework such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX.</em></p>

<p>For Stanford students interested in taking the course, <a href="https://bit.ly/appy-mlsys-2021">you can fill in the application here</a>. The course will be evaluated based on one final project (at least 50%), three short assignments, and class participation.</p>

<p>For those outside Stanford, I’ll try to make as much of the course materials available as possible. I’ll post updates about the course on <a href="https://twitter.com/chipro">Twitter</a> or you can check back here from time to time.</p>

<p>Since these are all new materials, I’m hoping to get early feedback. If you’re interested in becoming a reviewer for the course materials, please shoot me an email. Thank you!</p>

<div><p>Want to start an online service-based business or start an agency?</p><p>Here are 117 examples of services you can sell online, in 6 different categories. </p></div>



<h2>Why we made this list:</h2>



<div><p><strong>1. To inspire you.</strong></p><p>Lots of entrepreneurs mention that one of their biggest obstacle to starting a company is finding what to work on. This list gives you not only ideas, but also examples of real successful businesses built on those ideas.</p><p><strong>2. To show you can build a successful business around one service.</strong></p><p>You don’t need to do more (or offer more) to be successful when running a service business. Pick one service (e.g. <em>Website-as-a-service</em>), one niche (e.g. <em>Lawyers</em>) and get started (e.g. <em>Done-for-you websites for lawyers</em>).</p></div>







<div><p>E-commerce is a huge industry that is <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/379046/worldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales/">projected to grow to 6.54 trillion</a> (yes, trillion) US dollars by 2022.</p><p>Can you grab a slice of this by helping e-commerce sellers with one of their tasks?</p><p>Take marketplaces for example: Etsy,&nbsp; Amazon, Red Bubble, PoshMark, Teespring) or any e-commerce platforms (Shopify or Woocommerce are two examples that come to mind), you can probably build a service just for one marketplace or platform and be successful with that.</p><p><strong>Examples of e-commerce services:</strong></p><p>1. Image retouching<br>2. Product photography (<a href="https://www.outshinery.com/">Outshinery</a>, <a href="https://feedsauce.com/">Feedsauce</a>)<br>3. Product description<br>4. Email newsletters for e-commerce stores<br>5. Pinterest product image creation<br>6. Product listing and inventory management<br>7. Store maintenance service (<a href="https://www.tailry.com/">Tailry</a>)<br>9. Product research<br>10. Store migration service</p></div>







<div><p>Content is the fuel of the Internet.</p><p>Whether it’s getting found on search results with blog posts, helping sales team perform better with custom long form sales letter or email newsletters to nurture an audience —&nbsp; you name it, content is a key part of the internet.</p><p><strong>Examples of content and design services:</strong></p><p>11. Small graphic design tasks (<a href="https://www.hatchly.co.uk/">Hatchly</a>)<br>12. Content repurposing (<a href="https://repurposehouse.com/">Repurpose House</a>)<br>13.

<p>2020-10-23</p>
<p>For my current job I knew I wanted a Linux laptop again, after enough exposure to Apples ecosystem. Naturally a Thinkpad came to mind as an option, but I wanted to give used hardware a chance, given that Thinkpads are known to be reliable and well built.</p>
<p>I went with used/refurbished hardware from a vendor I know and trust for a while now, <a href="https://www.lapstore.de/">lapstore.de</a>, and I could not be happier with my choice. I went with a Lenovo Thinkpad T460s, as a compromise between decent performance, weight, screen size and good Linux support out of the box. This model is 5 years old, but CPUs are not evolving that fast anymore, so it still feels very snappy with everything I'm doing. The internal screen could have used a slightly higher resolution for my taste, but I am rarely using it these days.</p>
<p>One big advantage of the older models is access to the old version of the docking stations, which are totally worth it. At home the laptop sits there, gets charged and drives my 4K display easily, while being hooked up to my mouse, keyboard and network cable. Speaking of ports: the T460s still has proper Rj-45, USB 2.0/3.0 and HDMI ports. No adapters needed!</p>
<p>Summing up, here is why I think used hardware is worth considering:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is cheaper. Sure, your employer might be paying for it, but maybe you have a fixed budget and get more out of it this way.</li>
<li>it is good for the environment.</li>
<li>it will likely last for the next few years. Most of us don't need the latest hardware to do our job. I would argue that quite a bit of software could run better if developers weren't handed the latest and greatest hardware as a given</li>
<li>you are not giving up support. Sure, it might break. But so does a new one. There are quite a few respectable dealers out there who offer 3 years of warranty for little extra cost. Actually the first (used) docking station I got was not working ok, so I got an immediate, brand new replacement 2 days later.</li>
<li>Linux runs great on older hardware. With Kubuntu 20.04 everything works out of the box, including webcam, multimedia keys, docking/undocking or switching between different screen configurations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why not give used hardware a try?</p>
<p>EDIT [2020-10-27] fixed typo "wantec"</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
 <div>
  
  <p><label>Posted on <strong>26 October 2020</strong></label></p><p>An <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=three+weeks&amp;oq=three+weeks">eternity</a> ago, I published a <a href="https://www.peterstefek.me/focused-render.html">blog post</a> about a shader I wrote. In that post, I casually repeated a piece of gpu folklore I picked up as a wee opengl enthusiast almost a decade ago,   </p>
<p>
"Using if statements inside a shader will cause performance degradation."  
</p>

<p>People on the internet seemed a little skeptical about this statement, and I realized my advice might be outdated. So this post is a quick follow up about the cost of branching on more modern gpus.  </p>
<p>Before we talk about branching, what is a gpu? A GPU or graphics processing unit, is a special piece of hardware initially developed to crunch numbers for graphics calculations. It accomplishes this goal quickly through a large amount of parallelization.   </p>
<p>GPUs can run many threads at the same time in parallel. These threads are generally executed in groups called warps (CUDA), invocations (Vulkan) and waves (I will use the term warp, but they are all interchangeable). On recent Nvidia hardware (Ampere/ Volta / Pascal) these warps contain 32 threads. Pascal for example can theoretically run up to four independent instructions per warp over 56 warps of 32 threads which comes out to a mind blowing 7168 instructions per cycle. </p>
<p>Each warp can only execute one instruction at a time. However that instruction can be executed for each of the threads in the warp. This means the GPU can execute 32 copies of the same instruction in parallel for each thread in the warp at once.   </p>
<p>However, taking both sides of a branch will cause the threads inside a warp to "diverge". This means some threads will need to execute one side of the branch and some will need to execute the other. Unfortunately, both instructions can not be executed simultaneously for threads in the same warp. So these divergent instructions must be executed sequentially.   </p>
<p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/shader-branch/pascal-divergence.png" width="65%"> 
</p>

<p>The above image is taken from the Volta whitepaper.  </p>
<p>Consider the <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/WdyyWV">following fragment shader</a>:<br>
<code>
void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )
{  <br>
  </code></p><p><code>
  // TUNE THIS AMOUNT TO YOUR GPU STRENGTH<br>
  int workAmount = 2000;<br>
  float incr = 1. / float(workAmount);<br>
  float outColor = 0.0;  
<p>// USE THIS VARIABLE TO TOGGLE BRANCHING<br>
  bool branch = true;  </p>
<p>if (mod(fragCoord.x, 2.) &lt; 1. &amp;&amp; branch) {
    </p><div><p>
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; workAmount; i++) {
        </p><p>
          outColor += incr;
          </p><p>
      }<br>
      fragColor = vec4(0.0,outColor,0.0,1.0);
      </p></div>
  } else {
    <div><p>
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; workAmount; i++) {
        </p><p>
          outColor += incr;
          </p><p>
      }<br>
      fragColor = vec4(outColor,0.0,0.0,1.0);
      </p></div>
  }
  </code></p><p><code>
}
</code></p>
<p>In fragment shaders like the one above, each warp is composed of a set of spatially close pixels. Each warp in this shader should diverge because each horizontally adjacent pixel takes a different side of the branch. Let's say the cost of each inner loop is n cycles. Since each side of the branch is executed in series, each warp must take at least 2n cycles, even though each thread uses only one side of the branch. These effects scale with the number of threads in the distinct divergent paths taken (up to 32x in Nvidia hardware). Here's another shader which should have roughly four branches per warp. <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/wsVyzG">This shader</a> will take at least 4n cycles.  </p>
<p>However, let's look a <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/tsVyzG">second shader</a>:   </p>
<p><code>
void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )
{
  </code></p><p><code>
  // USE THIS VARIABLE TO TOGGLE BRANCHING<br>
  int workAmount = 2000;<br>
  float incr = 1. / float(workAmount);<br>
  float outColor = 0.0;  
<p>// USE THIS VARIABLE TO TOGGLE BRANCHING<br>
  bool branch = true;  </p>
<p>if (fragCoord.x &lt; iResolution.x / 2.0 &amp;&amp; branch) {
    </p><div><p>
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; workAmount; i++) {
        </p><p>
          outColor += incr;
          </p><p>
      }<br>
      fragColor = vec4(0.0,outColor,0.0,1.0);
    </p></div>
  } else {
    <div><p>
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; workAmount; i++) {
          </p><p>
          outColor += incr;
          </p><p>
      }<br>
      fragColor = vec4(outColor,0.0,0.0,1.0);
      </p></div>
  }
  </code></p><p><code>
}
</code></p>
<p>This shader should run roughly twice as fast as the other shader even though roughly the same number of pixels take each branch. This is because most of the warps do not diverge (with the exception of a few around half way across the screen).   </p>
<p><strong>Nvidia Specifics</strong><br>
As far as I can tell, there are roughly two different ways of nvidia graphics cards handle divergence with in a warp.</p>
<p><strong>Thread Masking (Pre Volta)</strong><br>
On pre volta Nvidia card, divergence was handled by something called thread masking.   </p>
<p>Basically when a conditional is hit, a thread mask is generated.  We can think of this mask as a 32 entry array. Each entry specifies whether the corresponding thread takes the first side of the branch or not. The first side is then executed for each of those threads. After the first side of the branch is then executed, the mask is reversed and the other side of the branch is executed.   </p>
<p>This thread mask strategy exists in part because there is only one program counter per warp on pre volta gpus. So essential every thread in the warp must be at the same place in the program. The only way we know which threads to execute, is by using the mask.</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/shader-branch/pascal-divergence.png" width="65%"> 
</p>

<p>The above image is taken from the Volta whitepaper.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that only the threads which need to execute the branch actually are assigned to computational cores. So if no threads execute one side of the branch, no work is done.</p>
<p><strong>Independent Thread Scheduling (Volta and Beyond)</strong><br>
One big change in the Volta architecture and beyond is the introduction of "Independent Thread Scheduling".   </p>
<p>In Independent thread scheduling, each thread has its own program counter. This allows each warp to track the execution of every thread at a fine grain level. However, we can still only execute only one instruction at a time. So the actual runtime of a branch does not change.  </p>
<p>So if Independent Thread Scheduling does not speed up branching, what does it do? Independent Thread Scheduling enables both sides of a branch to execute concurrently but not in parallel.   </p>
<p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/shader-branch/volta-divergence.png" width="65%"> 
</p>

<p>The above image is taken from the Volta whitepaper.</p>
<p>The reason for this shift is because before Volta, branches were places where deceptive deadlocks could occur. <br>
<code>
leader_id = 0<br>
If (threadIdx.x == leader_id) {<br>
  </code></p><p><code>
    // Do some inital work
  </code></p><p><code>
} else {
  <p>
    // Wait for leader to finish it's work<br>
    // then do my work
  </p>
}<br>
</code></p>
<p>In the above compute shader pseudo code, we have 31 "follower" threads waiting for the "leader thread" to finish (using in-warp shared local memory) before executing their own instructions. </p>
<p>On a Pascal GPU or below, if the else side of the branch is executed first, a deadlock will occur. The leader will never get a chance to start it's work because its followers will be waiting for it. </p>
<p>Independent Thread Scheduling gets around these locking problems by interlacing the two diverging paths. </p>
<p><strong>Article TLDR</strong><br>
Branch divergence in warp makes all parts of the branch execute in sequence which slows down the shader. Branching divergence between warps does not affect runtime.  </p>
<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br>
Branch execution on gpus is surprisingly deep, and there are many edge cases I didn't address and I also didn't touch gpu vendors other than Nvidia. Here are some good sources if you want to learn more:  </p>

            <div>
              <p>Warp is a puzzle–based stealth action game where you play as Zero, a little orange alien with a big score to settle!</p>
<p>I copied that off the game's website.</p>
<p>The important part is in the first five words. Warp is puzzle-based. That's how the game is billed, that's what I expected.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mandible.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/8-1-5.jpg" alt="" title="WARNING, WARNING, A CUTE ORANGE THING IS LOOSE. RUN AROUND POINTLESSLY AND DO NOT LOOK UP. WARNING." width="650" height="382" srcset="http://www.mandible.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/8-1-5-300x176.jpg 300w, http://www.mandible.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/8-1-5.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px"></p>
<p>And let's get this out of the way: Warp is a good game. The puzzles are fun, the game is pretty, the plot is predictable but in the good we're-all-familiar-with-this-myth-so-let's-get-the-cliches-out-of-the-way-and-have-some-puzzle-fun manner. I like myths. Myths are good. Myths attached to a puzzle game are even better.</p>
<p>Zero, the playable character, has a host of special abilities. He can warp through solid walls and obstructions, he can warp inside objects and explode them from the inside, he can swap places with objects and he can launch objects at high speed. Note that "objects" includes "people". In most puzzle games, "people" are major puzzle pieces. In Warp, the only real difference between a turret and a person is that the person is easier to lure into important locations and doesn't shoot you as quickly.</p>
<p>It's all a recipe for a great puzzle game, and it's honestly somewhat tragic that it falls short.</p>
<p>The thing about good puzzle games is that, by their very nature, you'll have trouble with them. Some puzzle games are designed so that it's impossible to get stuck. Some are designed so that restarting is easy and fast. Warp is a bit of a curious beast in that it's also a stealth action game. Your opponents have guns, they are quick with their triggers, and you will die in a single shot. So: You die. You hit the "restart" button.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mandible.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/W_Screenshot2.jpg" alt="" title="DANGER! LOADING SCREEN APPROACHES" width="650" height="365" srcset="http://www.mandible.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/W_Screenshot2-300x168.jpg 300w, http://www.mandible.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/W_Screenshot2.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px"></p>
<p>You sit there staring at a loading screen for ten seconds.</p>
<p>Which doesn't sound like a lot, but Warp is a <i>very</i> deadly game. The wrong approach can, and will, lead to death in seconds. Even when you're not being actively shot at, the world is littered with lasers and explosives and similar instant death traps. The second level starts with a puzzle that will kill you so quickly that failure results in spending more time loading than playing. And even when your plan is perfect and the area is harmless, Warp's sensitive controls will lead to you waltzing into lasers and warping yourself straight into death far more often than you'd expect.</p>
<p>Each time, accompanied by a ten second loading screen.</p>
<p>It is hard to describe how annoying that is, and it's just a herald of what lies in store.</p>
<p>Warp is filled with minor issues. Nothing that, in itself, would cripple the game. Things that I'd normally be remarking about in passing, as a minor blemish on an otherwise good game. But they just came so quickly and so relentlessly that it seemed every time I forgot about one, I'd run into another.</p>
<p>Example: The levels are filled, not just with armed guards, but with unarmed scientists. The scientists are terrified of you. Perpetually. Doesn't matter if you've carefully avoid killing scientists. Every time you warp into a room: screaming scientists. You can stand in the room for a minute and they just keep running around panicking, you leave the room, they recover and go back to work, teleport back in and it's Screamtown USA all over again.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mandible.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/warp2-620x.jpg" alt="" title="AUGH. AUUUUUGH. AUUGH. AUUUGH. AUUUUUUUUUGH. DON'T LOOK AT MY PANTS. AUUUUUUUUUUUUGH." width="620" height="349"></p>
<p>This could have been improved in several ways. Iji does it brilliantly – avoiding slaughter in Iji eventually leads to the "enemies" allying with you, followed by an entire different branch of the game with a different ending. Extra endings and game branches take time and money, of course. Here's an easier idea: <i>make the damn scientists quieter</i>. As it is, every time you jump into a room you're greeted with an atmosphere-obliterating chorus of screeches. Or make them stop paying attention to you after a while! Maybe that's a reward for not killing them: they stop setting off alarms!</p>
<p>Another example: I mentioned Warp's controls. Most of my frustration revolved around Zero's Illusion ability, which allow him to project a duplicate of himself to trick enemies. The problem is that any damage done to the illusion, or any missteps into areas where the illusion is not allowed to go, will dissipate the illusion . . . causing Zero to instantly start moving in whatever direction the illusion was moving. If you use the illusion in a place where it's not allowed – even if a valid spawn point is literal inches away – the illusion will spawn directly in front of Zero, instantly disperse, and return control to Zero when you're least expecting it.</p>
<p>So if, for example, you decide to create an illusion and move it forward, and at that very instant a laser beam fires directly ahead of you, your illusion will walk into it, disperse, and before you have time to react, Zero will troop happily into it and die.</p>
<p>Cue ten-second load screen.</p>
<p>Not that this happened to me dozens of times over during the end boss fight or anything.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mandible.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Warp-Screenshot-3.jpg" alt="" title="SIR, WE HAVE HIM IN OUR SIGHTS, AND IT DEFINITELY ISN'T AN ILLUSION THIS TIME, UNLIKE THE PREVIOUS TWENTY SEVEN TIMES" width="620" height="349"></p>
<p>I can live with issues like this if the game is a low-budget affair, and doubly so if they're easy to recover from. Hotline Miami, an even faster-paced game released lately, is buggy as hell and had many fascinating problems and glitches as I fought my way through the levels. But in Hotline Miami, restarting the level is instant. And Hotline Miami's art is relatively simple, and its budget, I suspect, was quite minimal. For an indie game, Warp is a high-budget game, built on the Unreal engine, with detailed 3d models, good texturing, copious voice acting and cutscenes, and a boss that randomly and mysteriously fails to take damage from being attacked. Given the money spent on the rest of the game, the controls, loading times, and gameplay bugs are just unacceptable.</p>
<p>In the end, I kept feeling like the actual <i>game</i> had taken second tier to the rest of Warp. Compared to the amount of polish the art and atmosphere received, the gameplay was rough and spiky.</p>
<p>Warp is a good game. But with a little more work on the interface and a little more work on the game behavior, it could have been a lot better . . . even if that meant sacrificing a bunch of polygons.</p>

<p><strong>What this guide is for:</strong> This guide is laser-focused on one thing: showing how to get a working informational website up and running as fast
as possible using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, using only the GitHub website. <em>Informational website</em> is an informal term meaning that the emphasis is on
function (structured text with simple formatting, links, images) and not form (intricate page design). It goes step by step from the very beginning
and assumes very little knowledge on your part.</p>

<p>You don’t need to learn command-line programs like Git, or install anything
on your own computer. Everything taught here does apply to advanced use patterns when you get more experienced.</p>

<p>GitHub Pages is free if your repository (file storage area) is public.</p>

<p><strong>Ways to view this site</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://tomcam.github.io/least-github-pages/">Github Pages</a></li>
  <li>Directly on <a href="https://github.com/tomcam/least-github-pages/">Github</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you were pointed here by an employer or well-meaning friend and aren’t quite sure why, 
you can find plenty of reasons in <a href="https://tomcam.github.io/least-github-pages/why-use-github-pages.html">Why Use GitHub Pages?</a></p>

<p><strong>What you can get out of this guide:</strong>  If you follow through the steps in this guide you’ll have a small website demonstrating everything you need to put up an attractive, easy to maintain site using words, links, and images. 
Not covered are advanced topics such as using Git on the command line, custom themes, SEO, version control,
and advanced features of GitHub-flavored Markdown.</p>

<h2 id="intended-audience">Intended audience</h2>

<p>GitHub Pages uses <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a publishing system based on the Ruby programming language. The Jekyll documentation is excellent, especially if you already know Jekyll, program in Ruby, and have both Ruby and Jekyll installed on your local computer. The GitHub Pages documentation is comprehensive and excellent–if you’re already a Jekyll expert.</p>

<p><a href="https://tomcam.github.io/least-github-pages/">The Least You Need to Know About GitHub Pages</a> is designed for people who don’t happen to know Jekyll already but who need to get up to speed in GitHub Pages quickly to get a job done <em>now</em>. It tells you not only <em>what</em> to do step by step,
but also briefly explains <em>why</em> you’re doing it.</p>

<p>You probably don’t want to use GitHub Pages on sites that require complex, individual formatting on a per-page basis. 
GitHub Pages uses Markdown, which has some limited formatting information but not a lot.
GitHub Pages then uses Jekyll to turn that Markdown into HTML, based on the Jekyll theme you’ve chosen. Generally speaking this approach is
absolutely ideal for blogs, technical documents and instructional materials that require versioning and collaboration, where the
main work product is words and pictures. It is not a good fit for things like boutique pages, restaurant menu sites, consumer product sites, and so on where
custom formatting is the norm.</p>

<p>[Edit April 25 2019: Please note <strong>this is not an iPhone or Android app</strong>, and I have no plans to release it as such. You can use your phone or any other camera to take pictures of your ground coffee, but then you need to install the application on either OS X or through Python (on any operating system) to analyze the data. <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize/archive/master.zip">Download the application package here</a>.]</p>



<p>Today I would like to present an OS X application I have been developing for a few months. It turns out writing Python software for coffee is a great way to relax after a day of writing Python software for astrophysics.</p>



<p>When I started being interested in brewing specialty coffee a few years ago, one of the first things that irritated me was our inability to recommend grind sizes for different coffee brewing methods, or to compare the quality of different grinders in an objective way. Sure, some laboratories have laser diffraction equipment that can measure the size of all particles coming out of a grinder, but rare are the coffee geeks that have access to these multi-hundred thousands of dollars kinds of equipment.</p>



<p>At first, I decided to take pictures of my coffee grounds spread on a white sheet, and to use an old piece of software called <a href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">ImageJ</a>, developed by the National Institutes of Health mainly to analyze microscope images, to obtain a distribution of the sizes of my coffee grounds. This worked decently well, and allowed me to start comparing different grinders. Then <a href="https://www.scottrao.com/">Scott Rao</a> made me realize that a stand-alone application that doesn’t need a complicated installation and that is dedicated to coffee would be of interest to many people in the coffee industry. Probably just the 10% geekiest of them, but that’s cool.</p>



<p>I’m hoping that this application will help us understand the effects of particle size distributions on the taste of coffee. I don’t think the industry really kept us in the loop with all the laser diffraction experiments, so hopefully we can help ourselves as a community.</p>



<p>If you are interested in measuring the particle size distribution of your grinder, then this app is for you ‒ and it’s free. I placed it as “open source” on <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize">GitHub</a>, so if you are a developer, you are welcome to send me suggestions in the form of <em>push requests</em> (the developers will know what that means).</p>



<p>If you would like to get started, I suggest you read this quick <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize/blob/master/Help/coffee_grind_size_installation.pdf">installation guide</a>, which will explain how to download the app and run it even though I am not a registered Apple Developer. Then, you can choose to either read this <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize/blob/master/Help/coffee_grind_size_summarized_manual.pdf">quick summary</a> that will get you running with the basics, or this <strong><em>very</em></strong> detailed and wordy <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize/blob/master/Help/coffee_grind_size_manual.pdf">user manual</a> that will guide you through all the detailed options the application offers you.</p>



<p>I would like to show you an example of what can be done with the software. Below, I am comparing the particle size distribution of the Baratza Forté grinder, which uses 54 mm flat steel burrs, with that of the Lido 3 hand grinder, which uses 48 mm conical steel burrs. I set both grinders in a way that produces a similar peak of average-sized particles with diameters around 1 mm, but as you can see, the particle size distributions are very different ! The Forté generates way less fines (with diameters below 0.5 mm) and slightly less boulders (with diameters of approximately 2 mm), which is indicative of a better quality grinder.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="976" data-permalink="https://coffeeadastra.com/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam/" data-orig-file="https://coffeeadastra.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam.png" data-orig-size="1000,780" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://coffeeadastra.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://coffeeadastra.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam.png?w=750" src="https://coffeeadastra.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam.png" alt=""><figcaption>An example of figure that can be generated with the coffee grind size software. Each red bar corresponds to one kind of particle diameter generated by the Lido 3 grinder (smallest particles correspond to the leftmost bar, largest ones correspond to the rightmost bar), and their heights correspond to the total contribution of these kinds of particles, by mass. As you can see, the particles that contribute to the largest amount of mass have sizes just above 1 mm. The red circle shows the average particle diameter for the Lido 3, and the horizontal bars show the “characteristic width” of the distribution – this corresponds to the width that covers approximately 68% of all the distribution. Similarly, the blue line and the blue circle describe the distribution of the Forté grinder.</figcaption></figure>



<p>For now, the app is only intended to be used on OS X computers. But if you are running any other kind of system and know your way around Python, you can always download it directly from <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize">GitHub</a> and run it with your own installation of Python 3.</p>

<p>I would like to thank Scott Rao for his excitement when I shared this project idea with him, and for beta testing the software. I would also like to thank Alex Levitt, Mitch Hale, Caleb Fischer, Francisco Quijano and Victor Malherbe for beta testing the software.</p>

  <div>
    <p>I recently came across a <a href="https://www.quaxio.com/files/2020/kaleidoscope/kscope.txt">piece of assembly</a> code, written by Li-Chen Wang, which
displays a Kaleidoscope. This code was written in 1976, and distributed for $15
on a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Kaleidoscope_for_Cromemco_Dazzler.jpg/1920px-Kaleidoscope_for_Cromemco_Dazzler.jpg">punched tape</a>. It appears this was one of three pieces of code used to
demonstrate the capabilities of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cromemco_Dazzler">Cromemco's Dazzler</a>, the first commercial
color graphics card for microcomputers.</p>

<blockquote>Stan Veit, owner of the Computer Mart of New York, described the reaction
  when he displayed the changing patterns of Kaleidoscope on a color television
  in his store window at the corner of 5th Avenue and 32nd Street in New York
  City in early 1976. “People driving by began to stop and look – they had never
  seen anything like it before. In a short time the Dazzler had caused a traffic
  jam on 5th Avenue!” The police had to contact the building landlord and make
  him disconnect the television.</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li-Chen_Wang">Dr. Li-Chen Wang</a> made quite some important
contributions resulting in the growth of the computer industry, such as a free
and open source BASIC interpreter as well as pioneering the concept of free software.</p>

<p>It turns out running this code from the dawn of computers in a browser isn't
too hard. The code is 127 bytes long. I found an existing <a href="https://github.com/maly/8080js">8080 emulator</a>. With the help of this <a href="https://www.quaxio.com/files/2020/kaleidoscope/cromemco_dazzler_manual.pdf">technical manual</a>, I wrote
the <a href="https://www.quaxio.com/files/2020/kaleidoscope/kaleidoscope.js">bare minimum amount of code</a> to emulate a Dazzler. Computer manuals back then were very detailed, especially for hardware that came as a kit, requiring a day or two of soldering.</p>

<p>Below is the result of running the code. In a subsequent post, I will cover how the code actually works.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Aside from software development, I also enjoy studying other related fields like marketing, project management, and product management.</p><p>Any reasonably sized software needs planning to be executed properly and after you "finish it" (a software product is never actually "done"), you need to market it to the public in order to make sales.</p><p>In this article, I will describe the process I took to become a Project Management Professional (PMP) by the Project Management Institute (PMI), one of the most sought certifications, not only in project management but in the market as a whole.</p><p>I was able to start my studies and take the test successfully in 2 months, studying between 3 and 4 hours a day, every day, weekends included, and get the results below:</p><p>Overall performance:</p><p><img src="https://renanmf.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pmp-overall-performance.png" alt="Initial"></p><p>Performance by domain:</p><p><img src="https://renanmf.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pmp-exam-breakdown.png" alt="Initial"></p><h2>What is the PMI and the PMP?</h2><p>The PMI (Project management institute) is the main organization when you think about project management.</p><p>Project Management varies a lot from place to place, from project to project, and from industry to industry, but there are some standards across all of those that are considered general best practices.</p><p>The PMI publishes the PMBoK (Project Management Body of Knowledge), which is a guide of best practices in project management.</p><p>The PMBoK is <strong>not</strong> a methodology, the project team needs to decide which processes will be applied according to their needs.</p><p>The PMBoK is usually updated every 4 or 5 years with new practices and a review of the current ones.</p><h2>PMP Certification requirements</h2><p>To apply for the test, you have to meet some criteria as described by the official PMI page:</p><ul><li>A four-year degree</li><li>36 months leading projects</li><li>35 hours of project management education/training or CAPM® Certification</li></ul><p><strong>OR</strong></p><ul><li>A high school diploma or an associate’s degree (or global equivalent)</li><li>60 months leading projects</li><li>35 hours of project management education/training or CAPM® Certification</li></ul><p>You can find everything you need to know about the application and the certification process itself on the official page of the exam at <a href="https://www.pmi.org/certifications/project-management-pmp">Project Management Professional (PMP)®</a>.</p><h2>What do you need to prepare</h2><p>I had 3 things at hand to prepare:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.pmi.org/pmbok-guide-standards/foundational/pmbok">The PMBoK</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/PMP-Exam-Prep-Eighth-Updated/dp/1932735658">Rita Mulcahy’s PMP Exam Prep</a></li><li>An exam simulator</li></ul><h3>The PMBoK</h3><p>This is PMI’s official resource to study. In a sense, it contains everything you need regarding topics.</p><p>The problem is that the PMBoK alone is a little too dry to study for the exam and it doesn’t have exercises to practice.</p><p>This is simply because the PMBoK is a reference book, not a study guide.</p><p>The best way to get a copy is to register as a PMI Associate. As an associate, you get a free copy of the PMBoK and you also get a good discount on the exam fee.</p><h3>Rita Mulcahy’s PMP Exam Prep</h3><p>This is the book you want to have with you as your best friend.</p><p>Unlike the PMBoK, Rita’s book is a written course to help you organize ideas and absorb the topics of the exam with questions at the end of each chapter.</p><p>This one is a must, although kind of expensive, but not so much if you compare it with a live or online course that might cost you thousands of dollars instead of a few hundred like the book.</p><p>And the book has a huge advantage compared to a course: you can resell the book to somebody else and recover most of the investment you made or you can even buy a used copy from someone and save a buck.</p><h3>Exam simulator</h3><p>I did the exam back in 2018 and the simulator I used is no longer available, so I won’t recommend any specific simulator because I only recommend things I have used and can guarantee they actually work.</p><p>You can search for a "PMP exam simulator" on the internet and find lots of them.</p><p>Look for reviews to find a good one, these might be pricey, but they are worth it if you want to pass the exam.</p><p>A good simulator should allow you to practice questions by specific areas, so you can focus on one at a time when studying.</p><p>And, of course, they must have a good enough amount of questions so you can practice at least 2 complete exams, similar to the one you are actually going to take on the test day.</p><h2>How to study</h2><p>You might not be able to take the exam in 2 months and that’s ok! Actually, most people take between 3 and 6 months of study before taking the exam.</p><p>I will describe the process I used to study, each person has a rhythm and different constraints in life, so adapt this to a schedule you can actually keep.</p><p>1 – Read Rita’s book in parallel with the PMBoK, then answer the questions at the end of each chapter of Rita’s book.<br> 2 – Once a week, at least, answer questions on the exam simulator by area. Do not attempt to mix questions of many areas at first, let each one sink in.<br> 3 – Review the areas in which you are not scoring well in the simulator. You don’t need a perfect score and a good simulator will tell you where you should focus to get better.<br> 4 – Repeat steps 1,2, and 3 until you finish all the chapters in Rita’s book.<br> 5 – As soon as you feel comfortable, try as many complete exams simulator as you can, I would say something between 2 and 4 are enough.</p><p>I did 2 complete exams, on two different days, a week before the test.</p><p>You mustn’t let anyone distract you, lock yourself in a room and simulate the environment of the test so you get a feel of how to behave on the test day and how to manage your time appropriately.</p><h2>The exam day</h2><p>If you followed all steps described before and had good scores on the simulator, don’t worry, you are good to go!</p><p>Just one last tip: don’t get stuck on a question.</p><p>The exam is 4 hours long and has 200 questions, this means you have, on average 1.2 minutes per question!</p><p>Some questions will feel easier, some will feel harder, that’s normal, no one has all the answers, if you feel stuck on one question mark it for later and review it at the end if you have some time left.</p><p>Prepare well, keep calm, and good luck!</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Online discourse has recently been borrowing vocabulary from Lewis Carroll. From articles about the dangers 
of 
rabbit holes on social media, Youtube and Reddit, to QAnon's "follow the white rabbit" mantra, concepts from 
Alice's Wonderland seem to fit naturally with the internet.</p>
<p>In Lewis Carroll's book, Alice and the white rabbit are the only two characters that transition from reality 
to 
Wonderland. The white rabbit is driven by anxiety. Alice by curiosity. We are motivated to access 
the internet for these same reasons. Our curiosity is never satiated with endless content and powerful 
recommender systems. Our anxiety is consistently triggered by the fear of missing out and the need to escape 
reality.</p>
<p>Like Wonderland, the internet has become an alternate reality thanks to the breath of the content available 
and its multimedia nature. Wonderland resembled reality enough that Alice accepted it as real. The internet's 
information is realistic enough that people struggle to know what is real and what is fake.</p>
<p>As distorted realities, both the internet and Wonderland are strange and entertaining. But they are a 
dangerous type of fantasy that discourages us from returning to reality, and attemps to transform us into one of its 
cartoon characters.</p>
<p>Alice navigated Wonderland safely, staying true to herself. Her principles can help us remain active 
internet users, instead of being used by the internet. Keep an open mind, but remain logical. Think 
critically, through questions. Stay curious, with purpose.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Choosing a business partner could be the second most important relationship you ever choose, (the first being who you marry).&nbsp;<br></p><p>To be honest, if you don’t handle it right, ending a business partnership can be more challenging and more expensive than a divorce.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Having done both, trust me I know.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Now 5 years later -- after our “divorce” -- I want to share a little of my story and many of the things I wish I had known to discuss from the beginning.<br></p><p>The truth was I didn’t know what I didn’t know. Now I realize that if we had some hard conversations earlier, we may have had a smoother time ending the partnership.<br></p><p><strong>In this post I’ll share:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>how things went for me; the ‘A’ years</strong></li><li><strong>how to decide if you need a partner</strong></li><li><strong>qualities you should look for <em>(and what to avoid)</em></strong></li><li><strong>how do you split equity</strong></li><li><strong>the operating agreement; some key things you’ll want in there</strong></li><li><strong>buy/sell agreement</strong></li><li><strong>business partner checklist (a to-do list for following everything in this post)</strong></li><li><strong>other tips from my trauma <em>(lol… but really</em></strong><em>)</em><strong><em>‍</em></strong></li></ul><h3><strong>my story</strong><a href="https://littlemight.com/#"><br></a></h3><p>I started <a href="https://lttlmg.ht/bestself" target="_blank">BestSelf</a>, with my business partner (who I will refer to as 'A') in mid-2015, around 18-months after we initially met. </p><p>In that time we'd hung out in person around 4-5 times. To continue the analogy of business partnership being like marriage, I'd married someone that I'd only been on a few dates with and barely knew. I partnered out of insecurity with someone who talked a good game and seemed strong in the areas I felt weak.This insecurity cost me $$$</p><figure id="w-node-76af6d16a676-3448d0da"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ea0c87d3db0d2d23479ff47/5f8750eb6f143d07b654067a_partnership-2.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>We met through an entrepreneurship course online and became accountability partners soon after. With him being in New Jersey and me in NYC, we were close enough to be able to meet in person once every few months.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Through being accountability partners we became aware of each other's strengths and complementary skill sets, him with marketing and me with product design and branding.<br></p><p>As background, before <a href="https://lttlmg.ht/bestself">BestSelf</a> was born I had another Shopify store selling graphic design products that was paying all my bills and generating a good living. I considered that business my ‘Freedom vehicle’ as it allowed me to quit my Architecture job but I wasn’t passionate about doing it long-term.<br></p><p>I <em>was</em> deeply passionate about personal development during this time and was always reading and finding ways to upgrade my skills and productivity. I felt like I’d found the cheat code to life and wished I’d been introduced to it sooner. Before I quit my architecture job, I set myself a task to <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/the-22-books-that-helped-me-quit-my-job" target="_blank">read 22 books around specific topics so I would be ready for the world of entrepreneurship.</a><br></p><p>The <a href="https://lttlmg.ht/journal" target="_blank">Self Journal</a> was later born from my personal struggle for years of finding a planner that would both keep me organized and also help me reach my most important goals.<br></p><p>I decided I wanted to turn the journal I built for myself into a product to sell, because it seemed whenever I showed it to someone they wanted to buy it.&nbsp; I didn’t think this product would be the start of something bigger, I just wanted to bring this product to life.</p><p>It was then I thought having someone who knew sales and marketing would be beneficial so I asked ‘A’ to partner with me on it. He also had his own journaling structure&nbsp; so I felt it was a common interest.<br></p><p><strong>In retrospect, I partnered out of my insecurities around marketing and selling myself. </strong></p><h6>Most entrepreneurs don't have business problems, they have emotional problems disguised as business problems —<strong> and so I disguised my fear of putting myself out there with a business partner.&nbsp;</strong><br></h6><p>And so it began.<br></p><p>The original name we came up with for the company was “Self Improvement Labs”... but I <em>hated</em> it. One weekend when ‘A’ was gone I knew I had to come up with something better to replace it with<em>.</em></p><p><em>(because I don’t like when people criticize something without giving a reasonable alternative).</em><br></p><p>In those 2 days I came up with the idea for <a href="https://lttlmg.ht/bestself">BestSelf</a>, bought the domain BestSelf.co and created a whole branding package. Thankfully there was no pushback, ‘A’ agreed it was a better name and we moved forward.<br></p><p>We launched the Kickstarter campaign in August 2015. I had experience with launching Kickstarter campaigns in the past and so I had a formula for how to do it which helped us a lot. You can read how we did it <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/kickstarter-step-by-step" target="_blank">here</a>.<br></p><p><strong>We funded in 28 hours and over the course of 34 days we raised over $322,000 which was enough to both create the product for backers and launch the entire business.</strong></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ea0c87d3db0d2d23479ff47/5ea0cb1d0f854b10467cf739_5e2a2251be4a7438101d60a6_image.png" alt="funding progress graph"></p></figure><p>We launched our online store in January 2016 and the business continued to grow. We won the <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/shopify-2016-build-a-business-experience" target="_blank">2016 Shopify Build a Business award</a> in August of 2016 and then in 2017 we scaled 4X and won the Build a BIGGER Business Award.</p><figure id="w-node-ac6b3b3d99ee-3448d0da"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ea0c87d3db0d2d23479ff47/5f857aa10221b7fa4725f1a6_image5.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><figure id="w-node-9ccd9ba5eca2-3448d0da"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ea0c87d3db0d2d23479ff47/5f857aae7da8462c3bf9000a_image1.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>When things are going so well business-wise it’s easy for things to run smoothly, it’s like the early dating phase when you don’t have to deal with too much harsh reality yet. Then the pandemic starts and you find out what your relationship is really made of.<br></p><p>By late 2016, while professionally things were still good with the business, cracks began appearing in our personal relationship… the 2016 election was a definite factor here. That was the first time it became clear how differently we saw the world and how opposite our backgrounds were.<br></p><p>In 2017, we’d hired out the majority of his role in marketing and by April 2018 he had stepped away from all business operations - informally anyway.&nbsp;<br></p><p>By informally I mean there was never a discussion of him passing the baton and stepping out, he just suddenly was no longer there. But he was still taking as much money out of the company as I was -- or more.<br></p><p><strong>As you can imagine being a 50/50 partner where one partner is working full-time and the other is completely disconnected is tough — really tough. I was essentially hamstrung on big decisions and company direction. </strong></p><p>And anything I could decide could be overwritten or debated even after I thought it was settled. The same went for team members, as every now and again he'd jump on calls, start giving advice or instruction (without knowing what was even happening) and cause frustration and confusion with team members. </p><p>By early 2019, I was becoming resentful as our distributions were still 50/50 <strong>but I wasn’t getting any salary for the 60+ hour weeks of time I was putting in. </strong>When I brought it up to him, as if he were my boss, he would say <em>“I don’t equate time with value,”</em> yet he wasn’t giving either to the company.<br></p><p>At the same time as he would reject my salary request, he’d post stuff like this on his Instagram:</p><figure id="w-node-be8cd5eaae18-3448d0da"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ea0c87d3db0d2d23479ff47/5f873b98bd121731d6cf0d21_3-hour-week.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h6>Here's a tip, if someone’s telling you running a business is easy — they’re either lying, or trying to <strong>sell</strong> you something.<br></h6><p>In the case of ‘A’, it was both.<br></p><p>Each video “guru” post he’d share taking credit for work that wasn’t his &nbsp;felt like a slap in the face — not just to me but,&nbsp; more importantly, to the team. <strong>Being under-paid (or not paid at all) is one thing, but having my value be dismissed on top of that was actually the bigger issue -- and was the beginning of the end.</strong><br></p><p>I ended up removing him on all social media platforms in mid 2019 because posts like the one above were triggering me.<br></p><p>By July 2019, we finally agreed on a modest salary for me in lieu of taking distributions which I would be made up for later. This still meant that I was getting the same $ amount or less per month as he was but at least now I had an IOU.&nbsp;<br></p><p><em>(I did this as I didn’t want to take more cash out of the business that would negatively impact our growth.)</em><br></p><p>Yay, a salary! <strong>I was now the 3rd highest paid person on my team of 10</strong> -- and getting the same as the person that had done nothing for the company in more than a year.<br></p><figure id="w-node-cc78a0f0c1db-3448d0da"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ea0c87d3db0d2d23479ff47/5f86195162505211420ac4da_Image%202.JPG" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>By the end of 2019, other things happened that I won’t go into. Suffice to say, I was mentally exhausted and felt completely taken advantage of by someone I had trusted.&nbsp;<br></p><p>So we looked for options to get out...either of the business, or at least the partnership.<br></p><p>When numbers around buyout expectations came up, there was a chasm of difference between what ‘A’ felt he deserved and what was realistic -- especially given how much he’d already taken over the last 18 months without working ($400k+).&nbsp;<br></p><p>Taking on investors or another partner seemed like the only option. However, by that point, I had no interest in bringing in someone that may have me ending up in the same place.<br></p><p><strong>Better the devil you know...</strong><br></p><p>Going into 2020 I felt stuck between a rock and a hard place.&nbsp;<br></p><p>On one hand I wanted to grow the business, innovate with new products and keep my team charged. Yet, on the other hand, I knew doing so would mean eventually paying him more in a buyout situation.<br></p><p>Every year I do a yearly review to reflect on the prior year and to set some big goals for the new year. Maybe you’ve seen them. Good, bad and mixed… I've shared my review publicly in <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/2014-review" target="_blank">2014</a>, <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/2015-review" target="_blank">2015</a>, <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/2016-review" target="_blank">2016</a>, <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/2017-review" target="_blank">2017</a>, <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/2018-review" target="_blank">2018</a>... right up until this year.<br></p><p><strong>This year I couldn't bring myself to share my review and big goal <em>publicly</em>.</strong><br></p><p><em>(It seems funny now given the dumpster fire that 2020 has been that I just knew putting plans out there might not be the best idea.)</em><br></p><p>The thing I was scared to share publicly was that <strong>my biggest goal for 2020 was to end my business partnership with ‘A’ once and for all.</strong><br></p><p>Between COVID affecting business and other extenuating factors, we could finally agree on a reasonable buyout number in August 2020 -- after over 7 months of negotiation.

Why not a text adventure!"</p><p>Now, it turns out that the way I implemented this game, I don't need the 4.1 features. I'll probably add that in the future to support more dynamic command parsing.</p><p>If you have <code>vscode</code>, you can play now with a quick <code>npm install</code> into any node project. (See below for full installation instructions.)</p><h3>So What?</h3><p>This is a level 99 typescript wizardry demo. </p><p>If you aren't a typescript nerd, you might miss the significance of this, but here is the basic idea:</p><p>First of all, everything you see here is running in the vscode code editor (without any program running). In fact, you can't even run my code. If you compile it to javascript, this is what you will get:</p><div><div><div><div><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>const</span> gameStart = <span>null</span>;</code></pre></div></div></div><p><span>➖</span></p><p><span>➕</span></p></div><p>(There might be a little more debris then that, but you get the idea.)</p><p>This screenshot should make it clear that the typescript type system is doing all the work:</p><p><span><img src="https://ricklove.me/blog-content/posts/2020-10-24-typescript-type-system-adventure/game-screenshot-04-type-only.png"></span></p><p>However, it's not very convenient to declare all those StepNN types, so I made a fluent mode that reduces the need for those:</p><p><span><img src="https://ricklove.me/blog-content/posts/2020-10-24-typescript-type-system-adventure/game-screenshot-01.png"></span></p><p>There is also an easy mode that uses only an object tree. It was very easy to make, but autocomplete ruins the fun by giving all the answers away. </p><p><span><img src="https://ricklove.me/blog-content/posts/2020-10-24-typescript-type-system-adventure/game-screenshot-05-easy.png"></span></p><p>In the process of making the game, I discoved that vscode supports jsdoc markdown. So I decided to use that for the game output since it is so rich. It even supports images:</p><p><span><img src="https://ricklove.me/blog-content/posts/2020-10-24-typescript-type-system-adventure/game-screenshot-03.png"></span></p><h3>Features</h3><ul><li>Play in vscode using autocomplete and tooltips</li><li>Game output displayed in tooltips using jsdoc3 with markdown (including gifs)</li><li>Implemented using conditional types, string literals, and a minimal state machine</li></ul><h3>How to play</h3><ul><li><code>npm i @ricklove/typescript-type-system-adventure</code></li><li>Create a new <code>play.ts</code> file and add the below code</li><li>Hover over <code>execute</code> to see game output (see screenshots for examples)</li></ul><div><div><div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> { gameStart } <span>from</span> <span>'@ricklove/typescript-type-system-adventure'</span>;
