<p>One of the Amazon reviewers of "Sun Performance and Tuning: Java and the
Internet" gave it 3/5 stars. While still a nice introduction, the book by
Adrian Cockcroft has become dated — claimed Roland in 2003, which believe it
or not was 18 years ago. The book Roland reviewed was published in 1998, and it
is a second edition. The first edition (1994) has a significantly different
title: "<a href="https://archive.org/details/sunperformancetu00cock_0">Sparc &amp; Solaris</a>",
is the focus instead of "Java and the Internet". Other than reflecting a major
shift in Sun’s focus happened between '94, and '98, the two editions also have
a different price tag. "Java and the Internet" costs 15.97 EUR, while one can
get "Sparc &amp; Solaris" used in allegedly <strong>Very Good</strong> conditions for 1.94.  If
I’m buying an outdated book I’m gonna get the most outdated version possible, I
figured, plus imagine the embarrassment if someone would find a book about Java
in my bookshelf. Shipping is 3 bucks, for a grand total of 4.94 EUR the book is
in my hands 15 days after placing the order.</p>

</div>
<p>"The Porsche Book" is quick to explain the analogy between UNIX and the Porsche
911 featured on the cover: both were created in the '60s, in a form similar to
the current one. Both represent the latest and greatest of products still around
in 1994, and indeed 2021, despite their quirks.</p>
<p>A valid question at this point clearly is: why do you care about a book
published 30 years ago when there’s so much recent and surely more useful
material? One reason is that I find the history of Sun Microsystems
particularly interesting.  I’ve read and very much enjoyed
<a href="https://archive.org/details/highnoon00kare">High Noon</a> as well as
<a href="https://archive.org/details/sunburstascentof00hall">Sunburst</a> — dealing with
recent history there’s the privilege of having plenty of primary sources
readily available, which is great. When it comes to the Porsche book, I find it
fascinating to read about the most common usage scenarios of Sun servers in the
'90s, and I can’t help but feel sorry for the admin who didn’t know that for
SunOS 4, only filenames up to 14 characters long are cached in the Directory
Name Lookup Cache (DNLC). In this article, however, I want to focus on the
information contained in the book which is still valid today.  In a world that
moves as quickly as the world of computing, you could argue that all books are
outdated to begin with. If some of the information in "Sun Performance and
Tuning" was valid in 1994 and is still valid in 2021, there’s a good chance
that it will still be valid 30 years from now.</p>
<p>It seems to me that we can categorize tech knowledge as follows: theoretical
knowledge, generic practical information, and implementation details. Of the
three, theoretical knowledge is the most likely to stay relevant with time,
followed by generic practical information which might still apply some years
later, and finally implementation details which are very likely to become
irrelevant as time goes by. Those details are far from being useless however:
in fact they provide the distinction between novice and experienced
practitioner. To give an example: the chapter about Networks opens with a
description of the built-in <strong>le</strong> network interface, pointing out that it shared
its DMA connection with the SCSI interface. Crucially, the network interface had
higher priority: heavy network activity was likely to reduce disk throughput. In
1994 you would have needed to see multiple workstations with bad disk
performance before concluding that network traffic had anything to do with it — or read the book.</p>
<p>But what is the content that stood the test of time?</p>
<div>
<h2 id="_configuration_factors_and_levels">Configuration Factors and Levels</h2>
<div>
<p>When performing a set of tests, there are multiple settings and knobs one can
work with, each having various options to choose from. Which filesystem are we
using?  What’s the version of the application we’re testing? Kernel buffer
size?</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td><b>Factor</b></td><td><b>Level</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Filesystem type</td><td>ext4, xfs, btrfs,...</td></tr>
<tr><td>OS version</td><td>5.10.16, 5.11, ...</td></tr>
<tr><td>vm.dirty_ratio kernel setting</td><td>20, 40, 60, ...</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>To measure every combination of 6 different factors with 4 levels each would
take 4^6 = 4096 measurements, which clearly is madness. By reducing the levels
we consider to 2, still evaluating all 6 different factors in all possible
combination, we get down to 2^6 = 64 measurements instead.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_throughput_response_time_utilization">Throughput, Response Time, Utilization</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Throughput</strong> — the amount of work performed in a given amount of time — was a
thing in the '60s, it’s the same thing today, and it will still be <strong>work/time</strong>
in 2050. Your web server might have a maximum throughput of 10000 requests per
second (rps), that’s something you can use to compare it with another one.
<strong>Response time</strong> (latency) is defined as the amount of time the user has to
wait.  For example, how long did a given database transaction take.
<strong>Utilization</strong> is how much of the computer’s resources were used to do the work.
The values reported by <code>sar</code> and <code>iostat</code>, two tools very much still in use
today, are an example of Utilization measures.</p>
<p>The author suggests taking multiple <code>sar</code> Utilization measurements at various
load levels and combine them with <code>awk</code> to get an overview of how the system
behaves. We do have <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a>,
<a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a>, and friends nowadays, but the <code>sar | awk</code> idea
is a useful reminder that quick, simple measurements can go a long way too!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_vmstat_sar_and_iostat_rules">vmstat, sar and iostat Rules</h2>
<div>
<p><code>vmstat</code> and <code>sar</code> are described in detail, with a focus on runnable queue,
blocked queue, swap usage, and so forth. The Linux versions of <code>vmstat</code> and
<code>sar</code> from <a href="https://gitlab.com/procps-ng/procps">procps</a> and
<a href="http://sebastien.godard.pagesperso-orange.fr/">sysstat</a> are a bit different than
the Solaris ones, but the main ideas still apply.</p>
<p>The three commands are also used in the <strong>Rules and Tunables Quick Reference
Tables</strong> section. For each subsystem (Disk, Network, Memory, CPU), the author
specified a list of Rules involving the commands and the action to take if the
rule applies. Rules consist in the name of the command with any options, then a
"." followed by the name of the variable to take into account. For example, the
following indicates a disk bottleneck: <code>35%  &lt; iostat-D30.util &lt; 65%</code>. The
action to take is to try balance the I/O load on other disks too, or get more
disks.</p>
<p>A contemporary version of those rules for Linux would be great to have.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_interrupt_distribution_tuning">Interrupt Distribution Tuning</h2>
<div>
<p>Interrupts in Solaris 2.2 were load-balanced among all available CPUs. The
drawback was that, in case of heavy interrupt load from a given device, cache
hit rate would suffer: the OS allowed to statically assign IRQs to CPUs as an
improvement instead.</p>
<p>Nowadays a very similar problem occurs with the <code>irqbalance</code> daemon on Linux,
which on systems doing lots of network activity should not be used. SMP
affinity should instead be configured to ensure the interrupts of multiqueue
network cards are statically mapped among CPUs.</p>
<p>There’s more information in "Sun Performance and Tuning" that can still provide
valuable lessons today, as well as some true historical gems for those into
such things. Go <a href="https://archive.org/details/sunperformancetu00cock_0">check it
out</a> on the Internet Archive if you’re interested!</p>

<p>Should we worry about AI?</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/NPCollapse">Connor Leahy</a> is an AI researcher at <a href="https://eleuther.ai/">EleutherAI</a>, a grass-roots collection of open-source AI researchers. Their current ambitious project is GPT-Neo, where they’re replicating currently closed-access GPT-3 to make it available to everyone.</p>

<p>Connor is deeply interested in the dangers posed by AI systems that don’t share human values and goals. I talked to Connor about <strong>AI misalignment and why it poses a potential existential risk for humanity</strong>.</p>

<h3>Notes and insights</h3>

<p>1/ Researchers who think about existential risks to humanity believe that artificial general intelligence (AGI) is the most potent threat facing us and the <strong>damage done by a superintelligence can dwarf anything else we’ve seen or imagined so far</strong>.</p>

<p>This is a view shared by <a href="https://twitter.com/fhioxford?lang=en">Nick Bostrom</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/chai_berkeley">Stuart Russel</a> among others.</p>

<p>2/ <em>Prima facie</em>, this sounds odd. Why would AGI – a mere software – pose a bigger threat than other deadly technologies such as nuclear weapons?</p>

<p>3/ To answer that question, you have to first define what artificial general intelligence is? </p>

<p>Perhaps a good starting point to that question is defining intelligence.</p>

<p>4/ Different people define intelligence differently and you can do endless debates on which definition best captures our intuitions.</p>

<p>However, I love the way Connor defined intelligence. To him, <strong>intelligence is simply the ability to win.</strong></p>

<p>5/ More generally, you can think of <strong>intelligence as a process to choose your actions such that you make your preferred future more likely than </strong>not. </p>

<p>6/ Say you love ice-cream, but all you have is lemonade. Intelligence, then, is your ability to persuade someone with ice-cream to give you some in exchange for your lemonade. </p>

<p>7/ <strong>Most types of biological intelligences are <em>specific</em></strong>. If a human is locked in a dark cave and <a href="https://invertedpassion.com/jobs-to-be-done/">wants</a> to get out, it’ll struggle and hence its intelligence isn’t particularly useful in that context. However, a bat, thanks to echolocation, will have no issue in finding its way out.</p>

<p>8/ That was a contrived example and I know that humans exhibit more types of intelligence in various contexts.</p>

<p>But <strong>there’s no reason to believe humans exhibit maximally general intelligence</strong>. We fail at difficult projects all the time, so there’s a limit to our intelligence.</p>

<p>9/ Imagine that we are able to make an AI that’s 10x, 100x, or 1000x more capable than a human to figure out how to win. </p>

<p>You give it a task and it figures out of achieving that task in ways you could have never thought of by yourself.</p>

<p>We don’t yet know how to build such a superintelligent system, but it’s possible in near future we’d be able to build one.</p>

<p>10/ And that’s where the risk is.</p>

<p><strong>A sufficiently intelligent entity may even wipe out humanity if it determines that humanity stands in its way to achieve the given goal.</strong></p>

<p>Sounds outlandish?</p>

<p>It isn’t.</p>

<p>11/ The reason it isn’t outlandish is because <strong>dumb machines cause harm to humans all the time. Think of bridge collapses, train wrecks, airplane malfunctions or accidents like the </strong>Chernobyl disaster.</p>

<p>Machines cause harm because they’re nothing but blind order following systems. A train doesn’t even realize what it is doing when it derails. It’s simply following the mechanism we humans built into it.</p>

<p>12/ Machines are dumb and that’s why they’re dangerous.</p>

<p>But AGI is riskier because it’s super-intelligent and <strong>intelligence doesn’t automatically imply alignment to human values</strong>. A self-guided intercontinental ballistic missile that finds its target is intelligent but it’ll blindly kill thousands.</p>

<p>13/ In fact, the idea that AGI can be supremely dangerous can be understood by reflecting that <strong>humans who don’t share your moral values can be supremely dangerous as well.</strong></p>

<p>Think of terrorists who blew up the Twin Towers on 9/11. Their intelligence was what made them more dangerous than dumb terrorists who easily get caught.</p>

<p>14/ An AGI, by definition, will be so intelligent that it can wreck unimaginable harm to achieve what it is programmed to achieve.</p>

<p>It will follow orders blindly but follow them so cleverly that it becomes literally unstoppable.</p>

<p>15/ Perhaps the most famous example of cleverness gone bad is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence#Paperclip_maximizer">paperclip maximizer</a>. This is an AI tasked by a factory owner to find ways to maximize the number of paperclips. It figures out that the best way to do that is to convert the entire Iron core of Earth into paperclips. </p>

<p>(Of course, humanity decimates when the Earth crust blows off).</p>

<p>15/ This may still sound alarmist and several first-order objections come to the mind.</p>

<p>Let’s tackle them one by one.</p>

<p>16/ WHY CAN’T WE ASK AGI TO AVOID HARM?</p>

<p>What is harm? </p>

<p>Is eating ice-cream harmful? No. Is eating too much ice-cream harmful? Yes. </p>

<p>Is killing humans bad? Yes. Is killing a suicide bomber who’s about to blow himself bad? No.</p>

<p>17/ We can go on and on. The point is: <strong>defining good and bad, harm and benefit is difficult because these are nebulous concepts.</strong> </p>

<p>If we learn anything from philosophical debates about ethics, it is that even we collectively can’t agree on what our values should be. </p>

<p><strong>And if we don’t know our values, how should we code them in the AI?</strong></p>

<p>17/ WHY CAN’T WE ANTICIPATE WHAT AGI IS GOING TO DO AND PREVENT IT FROM DOING THAT?</p>

<p>No, we can’t do that because by definition it is super-intelligent. If we knew what it is going to do, we’d be as intelligent as it. </p>

<p>Just like with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_Zero">AlphaGo Zero</a> (AI Chess or Go engine by Deepmind), <strong>what we know for sure is that it is going to win, but we don’t know what’s the next move it is going to make</strong>.</p>

<p>17/ WHY CAN’T WE SWITCH IT OFF WHEN THINGS GO BAD?</p>

<p>If we can think of this, an AGI would likely think of this as well. There are several ways it can prevent from getting switched off:</p>

<ul>
<li>It can distribute its copies across the Internet.</li>
<li>It can bribe / incentivize people to not switch it off</li>
<li>It can pretend to have learned its lesson and promise not do harm in future</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember: there are dumb things – like <a href="https://invertedpassion.com/bitcoin-is-mother-of-all-network-effects/">bitcoin</a> – right now which are so distributed that they’re literally impossible to kill (even if we wanted to).</p>

<p>18/ WHAT IF THERE ARE LIMITS TO INTELLIGENCE AND HENCE LIMITS TO HARM AGI CAN CAUSE?</p>

<p>This is a sensible objection. There are problems that are practically unsolvable because they require more computation power than possibly available in the universe.</p>

<p>Examples of such problems include breaking encryption or predicting long-range weather or stock market trends.</p>

<p>19/ It’s true that for such unbreakable problems, AGI will be powerless but the important point to remember is that an <strong>AGI doesn’t have to be infinitely more intelligent to cause a lot of harm. </strong></p>

<p>It simply has to be more intelligent than humans or collectives of humans. </p>

<p>20/ That amount of intelligence (which surpasses humans) is certainly within the realm of possibility.</p>

<p><strong>Human brains are limited by our biological constraints. No such constraints may apply to AGI.</strong> In theory, we may be capable of building an AGI with more computation and inter-connectedness than a human brain.</p>

<p>21/ So, in nutshell, even if an AGI can’t break encryption to launch a nuclear weapon, it can very well convince a human with encryption keys to launch the weapon.</p>

<p>22/ IF IT IS SO DANGEROUS, SHOULD WE STOP OR BAN AI RESEARCH?</p>

<p><strong>Banning AI research is like banning computers. It won’t work</strong>. You can’t possibly monitor all software progress to figure out which one is AGI and which one, say, is simply a new web browser. </p>

<p>Even if you have some <a href="https://invertedpassion.com/professional-success-and-personal-success-two-independent-dimensions/">success</a> with this, since AGI promises power and riches, different nations will have incentives to continue researching and making progress.</p>

<p>23/ IF THINGS GOES BAD, WOULDN’T GOVERNMENT DO SOMETHING?</p>

<p>If history teaches us something, the answer to this question is negative. <strong>Governments have a terrible track record when it comes to tackling the consequences of technology.</strong> </p>

<p>Governments have failed so far to make any substantial nudge towards preventing climate catastrophe. What gives us confidence that it can prevent humanity from the AGI risk?</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This small ebook is here to teach you a programming language called Forth. Forth is a
language unlike most others. It’s not functional <em>or</em> object oriented, it doesn’t
have type-checking, and it basically has zero syntax. It was written in the 70s, but
is still used today for
<a href="http://www.forth.com/resources/apps/more-applications.html">certain applications</a>.</p>

<p>Why would you want to learn such an odd language? Every new programming
language you learn helps you think about problems in new ways. Forth is very
easy to learn, but it requires you to think in a different way than you’re used
to. That makes it a perfect language to broaden your coding horizons.</p>

<p>This book includes a simple implementation of Forth I wrote in JavaScript. It’s by
no means perfect, and is missing a lot of the functionality you’d expect in a real
Forth system. It’s just here to give you an easy way to try out the examples. (If
you’re a Forth expert, please
<a href="https://github.com/skilldrick/easyforth">contribute here</a> and make it better!)</p>

<p>I’m going to assume that you know at least one other programming language, and have
a basic idea of how stacks work as a data structure.</p>

<h2 id="adding-some-numbers">Adding Some Numbers</h2>

<p>The thing that separates Forth from most other languages is its use of the
stack. In Forth, everything revolves around the stack. Any time you type a
number, it gets pushed onto the stack. If you want to add two numbers together,
typing <code>+</code> takes the top two numbers off the stack, adds them, and puts
the result back on the stack.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at an example. Type (don’t copy-paste) the following into the
interpreter, typing <code>Enter</code> after each line.</p>

<pre><code>1
2
3
</code></pre>



<p>Every time you type a line followed by the <code>Enter</code> key, the Forth interpreter
executes that line, and appends the string <code>ok</code> to let you know there were no
errors. You should also notice that as you execute each line, the area at the
top fills up with numbers. That area is our visualization of the stack. It
should look like this:</p>

<p>1 2 3 &lt;- Top</p>

<p>Now, into the same interpreter, type a single <code>+</code> followed by the <code>Enter</code> key. The top two
elements on the stack, <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>, have been replaced by <code>5</code>.</p>

<p>1 5 &lt;- Top</p>

<p>At this point, your editor window should look like this:</p>

<p>1  <span>ok</span>
2  <span>ok</span>
3  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>ok</span>
</p>

<p>Type <code>+</code> again and press <code>Enter</code>, and the top two elements will be replaced by 6. If
you type <code>+</code> one more time, Forth will try to pop the top two elements off the
stack, even though there’s only <em>one</em> element on the stack! This results in a
<code>Stack underflow</code> error:</p>

<p>1  <span>ok</span>
2  <span>ok</span>
3  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>Stack underflow</span>
</p>

<p>Forth doesn’t force you to type every token as a separate line. Type the
following into the next editor, followed by the <code>Enter</code> key:</p>

<pre><code>123 456 +
</code></pre>



<p>The stack should now look like this:</p>

<p>579 &lt;- Top</p>

<p>This style, where the operator appears after the operands, is known as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">Reverse-Polish
notation</a>. Let’s try
something a bit more complicated, and calculate <code>10 * (5 + 2)</code>. Type the
following into the interpreter:</p>

<pre><code>5 2 + 10 *
</code></pre>



<p>One of the nice things about Forth is that the order of operations is
completely based on their order in the program. For example, when executing <code>5
2 + 10 *</code>, the interpreter pushes 5 to the stack, then 2, then adds them and
pushes the resulting 7, then pushes 10 to the stack, then multiplies 7 and 10.
Because of this, there’s no need for parentheses to group operators with lower
precedence.</p>

<h3 id="stack-effects">Stack Effects</h3>

<p>Most Forth words affect the stack in some way. Some take values off the stack,
some leave new values on the stack, and some do a mixture of both. These “stack
effects” are commonly represented using comments of the form <code>( before -- after
)</code>. For example, <code>+</code> is <code>( n1 n2 -- sum )</code> - <code>n1</code> and <code>n2</code> are the top two numbers
on the stack, and <code>sum</code> is the value left on the stack.</p>

<h2 id="defining-words">Defining Words</h2>

<p>The syntax of Forth is extremely straightforward. Forth code is interpreted as
a series of space-delimited words. Almost all non-whitespace characters are valid
in words. When the Forth interpreter reads a word, it checks to see if a
definition exists in an internal structure known as the Dictionary. If it is
found, that definition is executed. Otherwise, the word is assumed to be a
number, and it is pushed onto the stack. If the word cannot be converted to a
number, an error occurs.</p>

<p>You can try that out yourself below. Type <code>foo</code> (an unrecognized word)
and press enter.</p>



<p>You should see something like this:</p>

<p>foo  <span>foo ?</span></p>

<p><code>foo ?</code> means that Forth was unable to find a definition for <code>foo</code>, and it
wasn’t a valid number.</p>

<p>We can create our own definition of <code>foo</code> using two special words called <code>:</code>
(colon) and <code>;</code> (semicolon).  <code>:</code> is our way of telling Forth we want to create
a definition. The first word after the <code>:</code> becomes the definition name, and the
rest of the words (until the <code>;</code>) make up the body of the definition. It’s
conventional to include two spaces between the name and the body of the
definition. Try entering the following:</p>

<pre><code>: foo  100 + ;
1000 foo
foo foo foo
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> A common mistake is to miss out the space before the <code>;</code> word. Because Forth
words are space delimited and can contain most characters, <code>+;</code> is a perfectly
valid word and is not parsed as two separate words.</p>



<p>As you’ve hopefully figured out, our <code>foo</code> word simply adds 100 to the value on
top of the stack. It’s not very interesting, but it should give you an idea of
how simple definitions work.</p>

<h2 id="stack-manipulation">Stack Manipulation</h2>

<p>Now we can start taking a look at some of Forth’s predefined words. First,
let’s look at some words for manipulating the elements at the top of the stack.</p>

<h3 id="dup--n----n-n-"><code>dup ( n -- n n )</code></h3>

<p><code>dup</code> is short for “duplicate” – it duplicates the top element of the stack. For example,
try this out:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 dup
</code></pre>



<p>You should end up with the following stack:</p>

<p>1 2 3 3 &lt;- Top</p>

<h3 id="drop--n----"><code>drop ( n -- )</code></h3>

<p><code>drop</code> simply drops the top element of the stack. Running:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 drop
</code></pre>

<p>gives you a stack of:</p>

<p>1 2 &lt;- Top</p>



<h3 id="swap--n1-n2----n2-n1-"><code>swap ( n1 n2 -- n2 n1 )</code></h3>

<p><code>swap</code>, as you may have guessed, swaps the top two elements of the stack. For example:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 4 swap
</code></pre>

<p>will give you:</p>

<p>1 2 4 3 &lt;- Top</p>



<h3 id="over--n1-n2----n1-n2-n1-"><code>over ( n1 n2 -- n1 n2 n1 )</code></h3>

<p><code>over</code> is a bit less obvious: it takes the second element from the top of the
stack and duplicates it to the top of the stack. Running this:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 over
</code></pre>

<p>will result in this:</p>

<p>1 2 3 2 &lt;- Top</p>



<h3 id="rot--n1-n2-n3----n2-n3-n1-"><code>rot ( n1 n2 n3 -- n2 n3 n1 )</code></h3>

<p>Finally, <code>rot</code> “rotates” the top <em>three</em> elements of the stack. The third
element from the top of the stack gets moved to the top of the stack, pushing
the other two elements down.</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 rot
</code></pre>

<p>gives you:</p>

<p>2 3 1 &lt;- Top</p>



<h2 id="generating-output">Generating Output</h2>

<p>Next, let’s look at some words for outputting text to the console.</p>

<h3 id="n-----period"><code>. ( n -- )</code> (period)</h3>

<p>The simplest output word in Forth is <code>.</code>. You can use <code>.</code> to output the top of
the stack in the output of the current line. For example, try running this
(make sure to include all the spaces!):</p>

<pre><code>1 . 2 . 3 . 4 5 6 . . .
</code></pre>



<p>You should see this:</p>

<p>1 . 2 . 3 . 4 5 6 . . . <span>1 2 3 6 5 4  ok</span></p>

<p>Going through this in order, we push <code>1</code>, then pop it off and output it. Then
we do the same with <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>. Next we push <code>4</code>, <code>5</code>, and <code>6</code> onto the stack.
We then pop them off and output them one-by-one. That’s why the last three
numbers in the output are reversed: the stack is last in, first out.</p>

<h3 id="emit--c----"><code>emit ( c -- )</code></h3>

<p><code>emit</code> can be used to output numbers as ascii characters. Just like <code>.</code> outputs
the number at the top of the stack, <code>emit</code> outputs that number as an ascii
character. For example:</p>

<pre><code> 33 119 111 87 emit emit emit emit
</code></pre>



<p>I won’t give the output here so as to not ruin the surprise. This could also be
written as:</p>

<pre><code>87 emit 111 emit 119 emit 33 emit
</code></pre>

<p>Unlike <code>.</code>, <code>emit</code> doesn’t output any space after each character, enabling you
to build up arbitrary strings of output.</p>

<h3 id="cr-----"><code>cr ( -- )</code></h3>

<p><code>cr</code> is short for carriage return – it simply outputs a newline:</p>

<pre><code>cr 100 . cr 200 . cr 300 .
</code></pre>



<p>This will output:</p>

<p>cr 100 . cr 200 . cr 300 .<span>
100
200
300  ok</span></p>

<h3 id="section"><code>." ( -- )</code></h3>

<p>Finally we have <code>."</code> – a special word for outputting strings. The <code>."</code> word works
differently inside definitions to interactive mode. <code>."</code> marks the beginning of
a string to output, and the end of the string is marked by <code>"</code>. The closing <code>"</code>
isn’t a word, and so doesn’t need to be space-delimited. Here’s an example:</p>

<pre><code>: say-hello  ." Hello there!" ;
say-hello
</code></pre>



<p>You should see the following output</p>

<p>say-hello <span>Hello there! ok</span></p>

<p>We can combine <code>."</code>, <code>.</code>, <code>cr</code>, and <code>emit</code> to build up more complex output:</p>

<pre><code>: print-stack-top  cr dup ." The top of the stack is " .
  cr ." which looks like '" dup emit ." ' in ascii  " ;
48 print-stack-top
</code></pre>



<p>Running this should give you the following output:</p>

<p>48 print-stack-top <span>
The top of the stack is 48
which looks like '0' in ascii   ok</span></p>

<h2 id="conditionals-and-loops">Conditionals and Loops</h2>

<p>Now onto the fun stuff! Forth, like most other languages, has conditionals and
loops for controlling the flow of your program. To understand how they work,
however, first we need to understand booleans in Forth.</p>

<h3 id="booleans">Booleans</h3>

<p>There’s actually no boolean type in Forth. The number <code>0</code> is treated as false,
and any other number is true, although the canonical true value is <code>-1</code> (all
boolean operators return <code>0</code> or <code>-1</code>).</p>

<p>To test if two numbers are equal, you can use <code>=</code>:</p>

<pre><code>3 4 = .
5 5 = .
</code></pre>

<p>This should output:</p>

<p>3 4 = . <span>0  ok</span>
5 5 = . <span>-1  ok</span></p>



<p>You can use <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> for less than and greater than. <code>&lt;</code> checks to see if the
second item from the top of the stack is less than the top item of the stack, and
vice versa for <code>&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>3 4 &lt; .
3 4 &gt; .
</code></pre>

<p>3 4 &lt; . <span>-1  ok</span>
3 4 &gt; . <span>0  ok</span></p>



<p>The boolean operators And, Or, and Not are available as <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>invert</code>:</p>

<pre><code>3 4 &lt; 20 30 &lt; and .
3 4 &lt; 20 30 &gt; or .
3 4 &lt; invert .
</code></pre>

<p>The first line is the equivalent of <code>3 &lt; 4 &amp; 20 &lt; 30</code> in a C-based language.
The second line is the equivalent of <code>3 &lt; 4 | 20 &gt; 30</code>. The third line is the
equivalent of <code>!(3 &lt; 4)</code>.</p>

<p><code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>invert</code> are all bitwise operations. For well-formed flags
(<code>0</code> and <code>-1</code>) they’ll work as expected, but they’ll give incorrect results for
arbitrary numbers.</p>



<h3 id="if-then"><code>if then</code></h3>

<p>Now we can finally get onto conditionals. Conditionals in Forth can only be
used inside definitions. The simplest conditional statement in Forth is <code>if
then</code>, which is equivalent to a standard <code>if</code> statement in most languages.
Here’s an example of a definition using …</p></section></div>

<p><em>Guest post originally published on <a href="https://elastisys.com/top-5-cloud-to-cloud-migration-woes-and-how-to-solve-them/">Elastisys’s blog</a> by Lars Larsson, Senior Cloud Architect and Branch Manager</em> at <em>Elastisys</em></p>



<p>All companies that use cloud services do so for a reason. But those reasons may change. Whether motivated by the need for a multi-cloud strategy, expenditure minimization, legislative or regulatory demands, or simply to get closer to end users, many organizations find themselves migrating from one cloud to another. Cloud-to-cloud migration for a non-trivial application contains a lot of unknown unknowns. This causes stress and uncertainty for a CTO. To help shed some light based on years of experience in the field, we have asked senior cloud architect Lars Larsson at Elastisys, to list some of these issues.</p>



<h2>Executive summary</h2>



<ul><li>Cloud providers offer a wide range of services, each with their own associated costs. Make sure to fully understand the situation as you make your calculations.</li><li>Providers tend to lock in customers via well-integrated services. These may make migration more difficult.</li><li>Make clear inventory of features and functionality your application requires of a managed service. These may or may not match what other cloud providers offer.</li><li>Also make an inventory of the tools and services supporting your organizational processes.</li><li>Take all these inventories into account to calculate your total cost of ownership for any cloud-to-cloud migration.</li><li>Use cloud native technologies to decouple your application and organization from the services offered by a particular cloud provider. This makes migration easier in the future.</li></ul>



<h2>1. Pricing models vary wildly</h2>



<p>Most companies have been hit by that one cloud bill that surprised them. Some services or features wound up costing far more than originally anticipated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Are you considering a cloud-to-cloud migration to reduce operational costs? If so, please take a long and hard look at the various costs in each of the clouds. Because each service has a different cost model, making it very difficult to compare accurately. You really need to get to the bottom of it.</p>



<p>Compute and storage costs are often easy enough to compare, because those are the most obvious two. But what about other services? How much are you spending on, e.g., log handling or monitoring? Good services such as AWS CloudWatch come at a cost, especially if you use it for log handling too (AWS CloudWatch Logs). Are you heavily using a managed database service? A queueing or pub/sub service?</p>



<p>Avoid feeling like that one time the surprise cloud bill hit you in the face by doing your homework this time. You are wiser from the experience, after all.</p>



<p>Network transfers in and out of the cloud can also vary by quite a large amount. The three major providers will give you incoming network traffic for free, but charge you for the outgoing traffic. Smaller, regional, cloud providers will often have higher compute and storage costs, but not charge you for network traffic. Or include a much larger amount of it in a free tier offering.</p>



<p>Overwhelming? I get it. It sure looks that way at first glance! But it doesn’t have to be. My trick is to look at your past few detailed billing statements, and map those costs to your new cloud provider options.</p>



<ul><li><em>Key takeaway: Deeply take all aspects of your current cloud billing into account. Find the differences between offerings, and make a more informed decision.</em></li></ul>



<h2>2. Cloud vendor-specific integrations</h2>



<p>Tell me, did you adopt Kubernetes to make yourself less dependent on cloud providers? Reduce vendor lock-in? Are you now surprised at finding out that you are still locked in, but on a different level?</p>



<p>What I’ve seen is that most organizations will make sure they have highly portable application definitions. By relying on Kubernetes, the application definitions work across cloud providers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what I’ve also seen is that if you are using a managed Kubernetes service, your users and permissions handling is perhaps tied not to Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) features, but rather, to cloud-specific offerings. Like AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). Great service, but ties you to the AWS platform.</p>



<p>Fully-managed Kubernetes services, if offered by cloud vendors themselves, serve to offer a highly integrated experience. The cost of that integration is that migration to another cloud provider becomes just that certain amount more difficult.</p>



<p>As a community, we’ve tried to fix this. But as a community of engineers, those fixes are technical. Kubernetes dictates standards for certain components or aspects. Networking has to work according to the Container Network Interface (CNI) standard. Storage according to Container Storage Interface (CSI). And so on. Great. But the business people have put in much more clever ways of locking you to the platform. This means that other less obvious aspects are more difficult to freely migrate from one cloud to another.</p>



<p>So what is the option? Do you have to manage Kubernetes yourself? No. Of course not. But it may make sense to investigate managed Kubernetes offerings that are not tied to a particular cloud provider to reduce the risk of vendor lock-in. Without having to take on the task of day-to-day operations on your own, of course.</p>



<ul><li><em>Key takeaway: Investigate the ways in which cloud providers make migration more difficult due to incompatible integrations. Choose third-party vendors that are not tied to any particular cloud provider, and can offer their services on top of other cloud providers if need be.</em></li></ul>



<h2>3. The devil is in the (technical) details</h2>



<p>Almost all organizations I’ve talked to say the same thing. They went to the cloud because they wanted to get infrastructure or platform functionality on an as-a-Service basis. That is the whole point of the cloud, is it not?</p>



<p>So, of course, all cloud providers will offer certain services. It used to be just infrastructure as a service (virtual machines, network, and storage) but we are starting to also take, e.g., object storage and queuing services for granted. Many such services will claim to offer an “S3 compatible API” or similar. And that is a great starting point! But beware, because what does such a compatibility claim really mean?&nbsp;</p>



<p>AWS S3, for example, was, until December 2020, merely eventually consistent. Since&nbsp;<a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/12/aws-s3-strong-consistency/">their announcement</a>, it is read-after-write consistent (strong consistency). Which level of consistency would a service that is “S3 compatible” have? The old one? Or the new one? And do you have aspects of your applications that depend on that answer being one or the other? Would you know off-hand?</p>



<p>If you don’t, by the way, you’re in excellent company. Most people’s eyes gloss over when consistency guarantees are discussed. But then again, you don’t want to get bitten by a bug caused by wrongful assumptions, so somebody has to stay awake to figure this stuff out. Hopefully not past midnight!</p>



<p>Ready for another unexciting example? Queuing services, such as AWS SQS, offer certain delivery guarantees. SQS standard queues offer “at least once” guarantees. That means that a message can be delivered to your application more than once, and must have logic in place for dealing with duplicates. An application that is not prepared for this will start showing strange behavior. Especially under heavy load, because that is when the risk for multiple deliveries is higher. This is because high load means there is less time to do housekeeping for the queuing service. (Note that while SQS offers FIFO queues that have “exactly once”&nbsp;<strong>processing</strong>&nbsp;guarantees, however, that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ably.io/blog/sqs-fifo-queues-message-ordering-and-exactly-once-processing-guaranteed">does not imply exactly once delivery</a>.) So confusing for an application that was coded with assumptions of RabbitMQ’s “at most once” delivery guarantees!</p>

<p>The point I am making here is that you must make an inventory of all the cloud services you use, and what features in these are key to your applications working the way they are intended. Because&nbsp;<strong>your</strong>&nbsp;use case is the one that matters.</p>



<p>Cloud providers offer services that make certain trade-offs to ensure the scalability and availability&nbsp;<em>of their service</em>. From the perspective of individual customers and applications, the ideal trade-off choice might have been different. If you use a software such as RabbitMQ, you can configure it perfectly for your use case and requirements. Not the ones of the cloud providers. There are companies that offer managed services in a cloud-agnostic way. Especially on top of Kubernetes, which deserve your consideration.</p>



<ul><li><em>Key takeaway: Make a clear inventory of all cloud services you use, along with the required features of each for your use case. To make a cloud-to-cloud migration easier, start depending on software not tied to any particular provider.</em></li></ul>



<h2>4. Tools supporting your processes (may) change</h2>



<p>Industry wisdom and rule of thumb says that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.econnectivity.se/app-maintenance-cost-can-be-three-times-higher-than-development-cost/">about 70% of software costs</a>&nbsp;are in maintenance. Not development. Just keeping the thing running as intended. How do you address that? My take on it is to rely on smart tools and automation as much as possible. The less your staff has to work on rote menial tasks, the better. Everything they do is a process. So let’s talk about those processes.</p>



<p>Operating your mission-critical cloud application? A bunch of processes. And most, if not all, of these are supported by tools. Continuous integration and deployment, monitoring, notifications and alerting. These are the tools your operations staff is using to analyze and optimize your application deployment.</p>



<p>Great tools like AWS CloudWatch offer insight into monitoring, logging (CloudWatch Logs), and containerized workloads (CloudWatch Container Insights). Your team probably depends on them. But they are specific to a particular cloud vendor.</p>

</p>


<h2><span id="Kill_the_alarm_clock.21">Kill the alarm clock!</span></h2>
<h3><span id="Alarm_clock_epidemic">Alarm clock epidemic</span></h3>
<p>Few upwardly mobile people in the modern rat-race society can live without an alarm clock. With a shot of strong coffee and round-the-clock stress, most people learn to live and survive with an alarm clock. Half of the population wakes up with an alarm, 9% are woken by a partner, 4% by pets, 3% by children, etc. That leaves a minority that wake up naturally. Increasingly, time becomes the most precious commodity in society where achievement is often associated with speed and perfect time-management. However, alarm clocks introduce harmful side effects: stress, sleep debt, and worst of all, disruption of the natural physiological sleep function. At worst, those factors will result in physical damage to the brain (e.g. such sensitive structures as the hippocampus, your memory switchboard, may literally <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/If_you_do_not_sleep,_you_die!" title="If you do not sleep, you die!">lose neurons as a result of disrupted sleep</a>).
</p><p>The art of time-management makes it possible to live at a high speed with an alarm clock at your side, and still be free from <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Factors_that_affect_sleep#Stress" title="Factors that affect sleep">stress</a>. However, the societal damage inflicted by alarm clocks and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_deprivation" title="Sleep deprivation">sleep deprivation</a> is unforgivable. An alarm clock that interrupts your sleep damages your memories, your ability to learn, your creativity, your mood and temper, your relationships with other people, your ability to focus, and your overall intellectual performance!
</p><p>Dr Robert Stickgold has shown that people who learn a skill during the day do not show significant improvement until they get 7-8 hours of good sleep<sup id="cite_ref-stickgold-2005_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-stickgold-2005-1">[1]</a></sup>. There was a noticeable correlation between the degree of improvement and the quality of sleep received. My own work with <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_habits#SleepChart_in_SuperMemo" title="Sleep habits">SleepChart</a> also shows that the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_and_learning#Alarm_clock_vs._learning" title="Sleep and learning">use of alarm clocks can dramatically reduce memory recall and consolidation</a>. Forgetting is so painless that we rarely notice its effects. In a natural way, forgetting will proceed even if you get as much sleep as you need, and it is difficult to point to specific memories lost as a result of not sleeping enough. Moreover, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_optimization_in_sleep#Neural_optimization_in_sleep" title="Memory optimization in sleep">sleep deprivation may leave your memories intact while their storage will be sub-optimum</a>. The difference may be impossible to spot without measurement. We are more likely to notice sleepiness, reduced mental agility, or bad mood.
</p><p>Disrespect for sleep has reached biblical proportions. This is most noticeable in the US and other highly industrialized nations. <i>Men's Health's</i> Dan Vergano writing for <i>ABC News</i> in <i>"No More Rude Awakenings"</i> suggests a seven-day system for fighting sleepiness: <i>"The secret is to fuel that arousal system so it can <b>beat the pants off the sleep system</b>. By creating the kind of feel-good expectations that trigger hormones to wake the brain, you’ll override the need to sleep and be able to jump out of bed like a man on fire"</i>. The article suggests a "fresh" mind method that capitalizes on the fact that stress hormones help keep you alert. However, the only rational remedy for <i>"rude awakenings"</i> is simple: get enough sleep! Jumping <i>like a man on fire</i> is not likely to have a positive effect on your creative potential!
</p><p>You may often notice that waking up with an alarm clock gives you a jumpstart for the day. You may then come to believe that using the alarm clock might help you stay alert later in the day. This is not the case. The alarm signal simply scares your brain into wakefulness, disrupting the carefully planned process of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_optimization_in_sleep#Neural_optimization_in_sleep" title="Memory optimization in sleep">neural optimization</a> that occurs in sleep. As a result, you get an immediate injection of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenaline">adrenaline</a> and your levels of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACTH">ACTH</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol">cortisol</a> also increase. This is cortisol that peaks at awakening in natural sleeping rhythm that provides you with the fresh-mind impression. With passing time, this cheaply gained alertness will wear thin unless you continue abusing your physiology with more "remedies". You may use more scare tactics for keeping yourself alert, abuse caffeine, or even get a more profound effect with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modafinil">modafinil</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine">cocaine</a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamines">amphetamines</a>. Alertness should be achieved with the help of sufficient sleep, not despite the lack of sleep! Apart from your reduced ability to learn new things, all unnatural anti-drowsiness methods will produce a great deal of side effects that can be pretty damaging to your health in the long run.
</p><p>All efforts to overcome sleepiness by means other than sleep itself can be likened to a chase of the first high in the use of psychoactive substances. If you drink buckets of coffee, do pushups, pour cold water over your head, or slap your face, you only dip into the last reserves of your alertness hormones that only worsen the effects of deprivation after the effects of the stimulation wear off, which is usually a matter of minutes. Rarely can you get a boost lasting more than an hour, and the more you perk up, the lower you fall in the aftermath.
</p>
<h3><span id="Insomnia_trap">Insomnia trap</span></h3>
<p>If your life without an alarm clock may seem like an impossibility, you will probably need to use all methods in the book to be sure you get enough sleep and minimize the damage. If you need to wake up early at the cost of your brain, avoid the <b><a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Insomnia" title="Insomnia">insomnia trap</a></b>! Insomnia trap is a vicious circle of:
</p>
<ol><li> going to sleep too early to get more sleep,</li>
<li> failing to fall asleep in time (or worse, waking up prematurely),</li>
<li> feeling even more tired on the next day, and</li>
<li> going to sleep even earlier on the next day to catch up with the lost sleep.</li></ol>
<p>It is better to go to sleep at a natural hour (i.e. a bit later), wake up early, suffer a degree of sleep deprivation, and hope for a phase reset that will make it possible to continue on the <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/05/how-to-become-an-early-riser/">designer schedule</a>. For a solution to the insomnia trap see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Curing_DSPS_and_insomnia" title="Curing DSPS and insomnia">Curing DSPS and insomnia</a>.
</p><p>If you cannot reset your phase and still feel tired when getting up early on a regular basis, consider choosing a job that is acceptable for your body, not the other way around. Your long-term health and well-being is at stake. If you absolutely cannot live without an alarm clock, you can at least start from changing your mindset about the importance of sleep and ensure you do not impose wrong habits on your children. Perhaps the young ones will be lucky enough to work in a flex-time system that will make it possible to get sufficient amount of undisturbed sleep. At least, do not set a bad example!
</p>
<h3><span id="Wake_up_the_President">Wake up the President</span></h3>
<p>President Bill Clinton was woken up twice by telephone during the night of April 22, 2000 before the infamous I.N.S. raid on the home of Miami relatives of the young Cuban exile Elian Gonzales. He was probably the most often disrupted and sleep deprived president in history. Only after a heart surgery did Clinton take diet, sleep and (real) exercise seriously. Those interrupted nights would definitely influence his performance and the quality of his decisions! Has anybody thought of a rule: <i>Do not wake up the president?</i> A rule that could only be revoked in a true national emergency? President G. W. Bush (b. 1946) was woken up when an American spy plane landed in China in 2001. He was also woken up after a suicide bombing in Jerusalem in 2002. George H. W. Bush (b. 1924) and Hilary Clinton made "waking up in the middle of the night" part of their presidential campaign and prowess. It seems that only Ronald Reagan had pretty strong rules for protecting his own sleep. He also famously napped during some cabinet meetings. He slept through a couple of international events without an apparent negative impact on his somewhat delayed decision-making. Critics would say he slept through the entire <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair">Iran-Contra affair</a>. Was Reagan so protective of sleep because he understood the role of sleep better, or perhaps he was just a bit lazier than other presidents? I don't know. However, he sure set a good example.
</p>
<h3><span id="Alarm_clock_monsters">Alarm clock monsters</span></h3>
<p>Andrea K. wrote to me with skepticism: 
</p>
<blockquote><p><i>"Take the alarm clock away from a typical person and they won't just wake up on their own at their desired time and they will miss work, school, or whatever. An alarm clock can't be that bad for you because of the simple fact that most people use it and I never noticed any problem with them&nbsp;:) Everyone in my family has been using one since they were children, and no one suddenly went crazy or began to mutate into a monster (yet)!"</i></p></blockquote> 
<p>When you use an alarm early in the morning in order to get to work or to school, you cut off the later stages of sleep. If the intrusion into natural sleep is not large (e.g. from minutes to an hour), the damage may be limited and hard to notice. Alarm clock will do far more damage if it cuts deep into the middle of the night sleep. You can compare the use of alarm clocks to smoking or eating hot dogs. The harm is not great enough to be instantly noticeable. It took the public many years to largely accept that "smoking is bad" or "fast food is bad". It is hard to quantify the degree of damage. However, as we move to knowledge society where our intellectual performance becomes increasingly important, the effects of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_deprivation" title="Sleep deprivation">sleep deprivation</a> will come under closer scrutiny and alarm clocks are bound to gradually fall out of favor. Unlike hot dogs, they are already universally hated by their users. Most people are able to somewhat adapt their sleep to their schedules if their routines are regular enough. When those people need to resort to the use of the alarm clock, they cut less of their sleep and the damage is proportionally smaller. Nevertheless, we should always strive at eliminating alarm clocks altogether. Most of all, we should protect our kids from suffering interrupted sleep!

<p><em>CubeSat GPS antennas and GNSS systems are important for effective navigation, coordination, and payload operation. This article gives an overview of antennas that have been developed for nanosatellites, CubeSats and other small satellite form factors that are available on the global space marketplace.</em></p>



<p><em>The article begins with a brief introduction to GNSS systems and technology, but if  you would like to skip straight to the product listings, <a href="#products">please click here</a>.</em></p>



<hr>



<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>As the range of applications that small satellites can carry out grows, and the systems themselves get smaller thanks to electronic miniaturization, it is increasingly important for operators to be able to access accurate information on their position while in orbit.</p>



<p>Effective attitude control systems enable responsive position fixes in orbit, while communications systems (operating in the <a href="https://blog.satsearch.co/2020-02-27-an-overview-of-satellite-x-band-transmitters-available-on-the-global-marketplace">X-</a>, <a href="https://blog.satsearch.co/2020-05-19-s-band-antennas-on-the-global-marketplace-for-space">S-</a>, or <a href="https://blog.satsearch.co/2020-12-16-satellite-uhf-and-vhf-transceivers-and-transmitters">UHF band</a> for example) that connect to the ground also allow satellite operators to take more active, manual control by sending commands to the relevant actuators.</p>



<p>Another option is for a small satellite to make use of the regionally or globally available satellite positioning systems that were primarily developed for navigation on Earth.</p>



<p>The general term for such networks is Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) with the Global Positioning System (GPS) being the most well-known.</p>



<hr>



<h2>How satellite GNSS networks operate</h2>



<p>GNSS networks are constellations of large satellites in higher Earth orbits; typically Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), at altitudes of approximately 2,000 – 35,000 km, or Geosynchronous Orbit (GSO) at an altitude of 35,786 km.</p>



<p>These constellations produce global signals, across a range of frequency bands, which are picked up by terrestrial GNSS receivers in order to give accurate position information on the ground.</p>



<p>These are the signals used by your car’s satnav, your fitness tracking app when out for a run, or that give live location information on an expected parcel’s delivery.</p>

<p>By adapting ground-based equipment, or by basing new designs for space on them, sub-system manufacturers have developed <a href="https://blog.satsearch.co/2019-11-12-an-overview-of-gps-receivers-for-small-satellites" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GNSS receiver systems for satellites</a> that enable navigation information and positing activities on a CubeSat or other small satellite.</p>



<p>There are various structural differences between terrestrial and space-based GNSS equipment.</p>



<p>For example, on Earth such devices are usually built from low-cost, widely-available, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) parts. To operate effectively in space such components may need to be adapted to meet the huge thermal and mechanical stresses of launch, radiation-hardened, and made suitable for operating in a vacuum.</p>



<p>CubeSat GPS antennas and GNSS antennas play an important role in the acquisition and translation of the GNSS signal originating at one or more of the existing networks.</p>



<hr>



<h2>GNSS networks</h2>



<p>There are several GNSS networks giving coverage across one or more countries and territories. Such networks have been launched by sovereign nations, international organizations, and even private companies.</p>



<p>Global satellite-based navigational systems play a fundamental role in many aspects of industrial activity, military operations, and in consumer products.</p>



<p>Satellite GNSS equipment will often have the ability to connect to multiple networks as needed, in order to extend coverage spatially, and to provide redundancy in the case of one signal being unreachable.</p>



<p>This list below gives an overview of the different networks that a small satellite antenna may be able to interact with: </p>

<p><strong>GPS</strong></p>



<p>The <em>Global Positioning System (GPS)</em> is the most common GNSS around the world. It is owned by the United States government and plays a major role in a wide variety of industrial processes, consumer products, defence applications, and intelligence services.</p>



<p>Note that GPS is often used synonymously with GNSS, but in fact <em>GPS is simply a type of GNSS</em>, in the same way that a <a href="https://blog.satsearch.co/2019-07-25-reaction-wheels-an-overview-of-attitude-control-systems-available-on-the-global-marketplace-for-space">reaction wheel</a> is a type of attitude control system.</p>



<p>The GPS is operated and maintained by the U.S. Air Force and more in-depth information is available at <a href="https://www.gps.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GPS.gov</a>, a website maintained by the National Coordination Office for Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing.</p>



<p>CubeSat GPS antennas enable systems to connect to the primary GPS frequency in the L-Band, between 1 and 2 GHz. </p>

<p><strong>GLONASS</strong></p>



<p>The <em>Globalnaya Navigazionnaya Sputnikovaya Sistema</em>, or <em>Global Navigation Satellite System</em>, is typically referred to as <em>GLONASS</em>. Initially covering the former Soviet Union, GLONASS now has worldwide coverage and enables satellite navigation systems to use it alongside GPS for faster, more accurate position fixing.</p>



<p>GLONASS is a major part of the Russian space agency Roscosmos’ operations and operates <a href="https://www.everythingrf.com/community/glonass-frequency-bands" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the following bands</a>:</p>



<ul><li><strong>G1 Band</strong>: 1589.0625 MHz to 1605.375 MHz</li><li><strong>G2 Band</strong>: 1242.9375 MHz to 1248.625 MHz</li><li><strong>G3 Band</strong>: 1201 MHz</li></ul>



<hr>



<p><strong>Galileo</strong></p>



<p>A GNSS created by the European Union (EU) through the European Space Agency (ESA) and now operated by <a href="https://www.gsc-europa.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the European GNSS Agency (GSA)</a>.</p>



<p><em>Galileo</em> was created to enable Europeans to access a global positioning system independent of GPS or GLONASS, and is freely available worldwide to an accuracy of 1 meter, which can be increased to 1 centimeter in an encrypted form for commercial customers, in the High Accuracy Service (HAS).</p>



<p>Galileo operates in the 1.1 to 1.6 GHz band; a frequency range that is well-suited to mobile navigation and communication services.</p>



<p>Each Galileo satellite is designed to broadcast 10 different navigation signals making it possible for Galileo to offer open (OS), safety-of-life (SOL), commercial (CS) and public regulated services (PRS).</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>BeiDou</strong></p>



<p>The <em>BeiDou Navigation Satellite System</em> is generally referred to as <em>BeiDou</em>, or simply <em>BDS</em>, and is a worldwide GNSS created and run by the People’s Republic of China. The system was formerly called Compass and began its life by offering regional coverage in China before branching out globally.</p>



<p>Now in its third phase of development, the BeiDou system provides connectivity in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeiDou" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the following open service channels</a>:</p>



<ul><li><strong>B1I</strong>: 1561.098 MHz</li><li><strong>B1C</strong>: 1575.42 MHz</li><li><strong>B2I</strong>: 1207.14 MHz</li><li><strong>B2a</strong>: 1176.45 MHz</li><li><strong>B2b</strong>: 1207.14 MHz</li><li><strong>B3I</strong>: 1268.52 MHz</li></ul>

<p><strong>IRNSS</strong></p>



<p>The<em> Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS)</em> is a regional GNSS owned and operated by the Government of India via the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It also has the operational name <em>Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC)</em>.</p>



<p>NavIC satellites use dual frequency bands that provide signals in the L5-band and S-band. The system is designed to provide accurate position information in a primary service area that covers India and a region extending up to 1,500 km from the country’s borders.</p>



<p>It also offers a level of coverage in an extended service area that lies between the primary service area and area enclosed by a rectangle from Latitude 30 deg South to 50 deg North, Longitude 30 deg East to 130 deg East. You can find out more about the system <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/irnss-programme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the ISRO site</a>.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>QZSS</strong></p>



<p>The <em>Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS)</em> is also a regional GNSS, in this case owned by the Government of Japan and operated by QZS System Service Inc. (QSS).</p>



<p>It is designed to complement GPS coverage in Oceania and East Asia and is sometimes referred to as <em>the Japanese GPS</em>. The constellation provides the following signals:</p>



<ul><li><strong>L1C/A</strong>, <strong>L1C</strong>, <strong>L1S</strong>, and <strong>L1Sb</strong> with a center frequency of 1575.42 MHz</li><li><strong>L2C</strong> with a center frequency of 1227.60 MHz</li><li><strong>L5</strong> and <strong>L5S</strong> with a center frequency of 1176.45 MHz</li><li><strong>L6</strong> with a center frequency of 1278.75 MHz</li><li><strong>S-band</strong> operating in the 2 GHz band</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://qzss.go.jp/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Find out more about the QZSS at the official website here</a>.</p>



<p>More information on each of these GNSS networks is available on the operators’ websites and <a href="https://blog.bliley.com/the-differences-between-the-5-gnss-satellite-network-constellations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in this excellent article by Bliley Technologies</a>.</p>



<p>Now that you have been introduced to the use cases for GNSS and GPS connectivity in small satellites, and gained an understanding of the major GNSS constellations which they may access – let’s next take a look at what you may want to consider when selecting a small satellite GNSS or CubeSat GPS antenna for your individual needs.</p>



<hr>



<h2>Understanding your requirements</h2>



<p>We recommend a simple four-step approach for the preliminary selection of any new piece of hardware or software for a satellite or other space system.</p>



<p>Note that this is just a basic guide based on what we’ve learned helping hundreds of buyers select products within our marketplace and get rapid responses from suppliers.</p>



<p>It is just meant to help engineers make an initial assessment and shouldn’t replace formalised systems engineering approaches such as the <a href="https://www.incose.org/incose-member-resources/working-groups/Application/space-systems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">INCOSE Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) CubeSat frameworks</a>.</p>



<ol><li>Specify your currently known mission parameters,</li><li>Record all currently known overall design specifications of the system,</li><li>Consider the range of technology that will be used in the satellite and in ancillary sub-systems, and</li><li>Take into account the key performance criteria of the kind of product you wish to procure.</li></ol>



<p>These criteria are explained in more detail below.</p>



<hr>



<h3>Mission parameters</h3>



<p>The first step is to fully understand the currently known mission parameters, including both the critical applications and desirable, but not necessarily essential, objectives.</p>



<p>Typically the more precise mission parameters will only be established later in the process – usually iterated upon in a number of loops by considering the “system of systems.”</p>



<p>But having an idea of what functions your selected technology is likely to need to perform, and on what schedule and duration, will make selecting the most suitable model mch easier.</p>



<p>Also consider the launch stresses, testing processes and regulatory compliance that the product will need to go through in order to make it …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In this post I'll outline 8 image loading optimization techniques to minimize both the bandwidth used for loading images on the web and the CPU usage for image display. I'll present them in the form of an annotated HTML example to make it easy for folks to reproduce the results. Some of these techniques are more established, while others are somewhat novel. Ideally, your favorite mechanism for publishing web documents (like a CMS, static site generator, or web application framework) implements all of these out-of-the-box. I'll keep a <a href="#tools">list updated at the end of this posts</a> with technologies that provide <em>all</em> of the optimizations outlined here.</p><p>Together the techniques optimize all elements of <a href="https://web.dev/vitals/">Google's Core Web Vitals</a> by</p><ul><li>Minimizing the <a href="https://web.dev/lcp/">Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)</a> through reducing bytes, caching, and lazy loading.</li><li>Keeping <a href="https://web.dev/cls/">Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)</a> to zero.</li><li>Reducing <a href="https://web.dev/fid/">First Input Delay(FID)</a> through reduced (main-thread) CPU usage.</li></ul><p>View the source of this sample image to see all the techniques in action:</p><p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf-1920w.avif 1920w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf-1280w.avif 1280w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf-640w.avif 640w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf-320w.avif 320w" sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf-1920w.webp 1920w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf-1280w.webp 1280w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf-640w.webp 640w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf-320w.webp 320w" sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf-1920w.jpg 1920w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf-1280w.jpg 1280w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf-640w.jpg 640w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf-320w.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="4032" src="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf.jpg" height="2268" alt="Sample image illustrating the techniques outlined in this post."></picture></p><h2 id="responsive-layout">Responsive layout <a href="#responsive-layout">#</a></h2><p>This is a well understood technique to make an image use the available horizontal space up until its maximum size while retaining the aspect ratio. New in 2020 is that web browsers will reserve the correct vertical space for the image before it loads if the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes are provided for the <code>img</code> element. This avoids <a href="https://web.dev/cls/">Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)</a>.</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>style</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><br>  <span>img</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>max-width</span><span>:</span> 100%<span>;</span><br>    <span>height</span><span>:</span> auto<span>;</span><br>  <span>}</span><br></span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>style</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br><br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>img</span> <span>height</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>853<span>"</span></span> <span>width</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>1280<span>"</span></span> <span>…</span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre><h2 id="lazy-rendering">Lazy rendering <a href="#lazy-rendering">#</a></h2><p>The second technique is more cutting edge. The new CSS attribute <code>content-visibility: auto</code> instructs the browser to not bother layouting the image until it gets near the screen. This has all kinds of benefits, but the most important one might be that the browser will not bother decoding our blurry placeholder image or the image itself unless it has to, saving CPU.</p><h3 id="update-01%2F27%2F2021-contain-intrinsic-size-no-longer-needed">Update 01/27/2021 contain-intrinsic-size no longer needed <a href="#update-01%2F27%2F2021-contain-intrinsic-size-no-longer-needed">#</a></h3><p>An earlier version of this post explained how to use <code>contain-intrinsic-size</code> to avoid CLS impact of <code>content-visibility: auto</code> but as of Chromium 88 this is no longer needed for images that provide <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> as explained above. Other browser engines do <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=content-visibility">not yet (01/27/2021) implement <code>content-visibility: auto</code></a> and would presumably follow Chromium's lead on this special case. So, yaihh, this is much simpler now!</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>style</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><br>  <br>  <span>main img</span> <span>{</span><br>    <br>    <span>content-visibility</span><span>:</span> auto<span>;</span><br>  <span>}</span><br></span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>style</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre><h2 id="avif">AVIF <a href="#avif">#</a></h2><p><a href="https://jakearchibald.com/2020/avif-has-landed/">AVIF</a> is the most recent image format that has gained adoption in web browsers. It is currently supported in Chromium browsers, and available behind a flag in Firefox. Safari support isn't available yet, but given that Apple is a member of the <a href="http://aomedia.org/">group</a> that is behind the format, we can expect future support.</p><p>AVIF is notable because it very consistently outperforms JPEG in a very significant way. This is different from WebP which doesn't always produce smaller images than JPEG and may actually be a net-loss due to lack of support for progressive loading.</p><p>To implement progressive enhancement for AVIF, use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture"><code>picture</code> element</a>.</p><p>The actual <code>img</code> element is nested in the <code>picture</code>. This can be quite confusing, because the <code>img</code> is sometimes described as fallback for browsers without picture support but basically the <code>picture</code> element only helps with <code>src</code> selection but has no layout itself. The element that is drawn (and which you style) is the <code>img</code> element.</p><p>Until very recently it was relatively difficult to actually encode AVIF images on the server-side, but with the latest version of libraries like <a href="https://github.com/lovell/sharp">sharp</a> it is now trivial.</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>picture</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>source</span><br>    <span>sizes</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px<span>"</span></span><br>    <span>srcset</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span><br>      /img/Z1s3TKV-1920w.avif 1920w,<br>      /img/Z1s3TKV-1280w.avif 1280w,<br>      /img/Z1s3TKV-640w.avif   640w,<br>      /img/Z1s3TKV-320w.avif   320w<br>    <span>"</span></span><br>    <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>image/avif<span>"</span></span><br>  <span>/&gt;</span></span><br>  <br>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>img</span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><br><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>picture</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre><h2 id="load-the-right-number-of-pixels">Load the right number of pixels <a href="#load-the-right-number-of-pixels">#</a></h2><p>You might have noticed the <code>srcset</code> and <code>sizes</code> attributes in the snippet above. Using the <code>w</code> selector it tells the browser which URL to use based on the physical pixels that would be used if the image was drawn to the user's device given the width calculated from the <code>sizes</code> attribute (which is a media query expression).</p><p>With this the browser will always download the smallest possible image that provides the best image quality for the user. Or it may select a smaller image if, for example, the user has opted into some kind of data-saving mode.</p><h3 id="fallbacks">Fallbacks <a href="#fallbacks">#</a></h3><p>Provide more source elements with <code>srcset</code>s for browsers that only support legacy image formats.</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>source</span><br>  <span>sizes</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px<span>"</span></span><br>  <span>srcset</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span><br>    /img/Z1s3TKV-1920w.webp 1920w,<br>    /img/Z1s3TKV-1280w.webp 1280w,<br>    /img/Z1s3TKV-640w.webp   640w,<br>    /img/Z1s3TKV-320w.webp   320w<br>  <span>"</span></span><br>  <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>image/webp<span>"</span></span><br><span>/&gt;</span></span><br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>source</span><br>  <span>sizes</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px<span>"</span></span><br>  <span>srcset</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span><br>    /img/Z1s3TKV-1920w.jpg 1920w,<br>    /img/Z1s3TKV-1280w.jpg 1280w,<br>    /img/Z1s3TKV-640w.jpg   640w,<br>    /img/Z1s3TKV-320w.jpg   320w<br>  <span>"</span></span><br>  <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>image/jpeg<span>"</span></span><br><span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre><h2 id="caching-%2F-immutable-urls">Caching / Immutable URLs <a href="#caching-%2F-immutable-urls">#</a></h2><p>Embed a hash of the bytes in the image in the URL of the image. In the examples above I'm doing that with the <code>Z1s3TKV</code> in the image URLs. That way the URL will change if the image changes and respectively you can apply infinite cache expiration for your images. You want your caching headers to look something like this <code>cache-control: public,max-age=31536000,immutable</code>.</p><p><code>immutable</code> is the semantically correct <code>cache-control</code> value, but unfortunately it isn't widely supported in browsers (I'm looking at you, Chrome). <code>max-age=31536000</code> is the fallback to cache for a year. <code>public</code> is important to allow your CDN to cache the image and deliver it from the edge. But only use that if it is appropriate from a privacy perspective.</p><h2 id="lazy-loading">Lazy loading <a href="#lazy-loading">#</a></h2><p>Adding <code>loading="lazy"</code> to the <code>img</code> instructs the browser to only start fetching the image as it gets closer to the screen and is likely to actually be rendered.</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>img</span> <span>loading</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>lazy<span>"</span></span> <span>…</span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre><h2 id="asynchronous-decoding">Asynchronous decoding <a href="#asynchronous-decoding">#</a></h2><p>Adding <code>decoding="async"</code> to the <code>img</code> gives the browser permission to decode the image off the main thread avoiding user impact of the CPU-time used to decode the image. This should have no discernible downside except that it cannot always be the default for legacy reasons.</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>img</span> <span>decoding</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>async<span>"</span></span> <span>…</span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre><h2 id="blurry-placeholder">Blurry placeholder <a href="#blurry-placeholder">#</a></h2><p>A blurry placeholder is an inline image that provides the user some notion of the image that will load eventually without requiring fetching bytes from the network.</p><p><img width="1280" src="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/blurry.svg" height="853" alt="Sample blurry placeholder"></p><p>Some notes on the implementation provided here:</p><ul><li>It inlines the blurry placeholder as a <code>background-image</code> of the image. This avoids using a second HTML element and it naturally hides the placeholder when the image loads, so that no JavaScript is needed to implement this.</li><li>It wraps the data URI of the actual image in a data URI of a SVG image. That is done because the blurring of the image is done at the SVG level instead of through a CSS filter. The result is that the blurring is only performed once per image when the SVG is rasterized, instead of on every layout saving CPU.</li></ul><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>img</span><span><span><br>  <span>style</span></span><span>="</span><br><span>      …</span><br><span>      <span>background-size</span><span>:</span> cover<span>;</span></span><br><span>      <span>background-image</span><span>:</span> </span><br><span>        <span>url</span><span>(</span>'<span>data</span><span>:</span>image/svg+xml<span>;</span>charset=utf-8<span>,</span>%3Csvg xmlns=\'http%3A//www.w3.org/2000/svg\'</span><br><span>        xmlns%3Axlink=\'http%3A//www.w3.org/1999/xlink\' viewBox=\'0 0 1280 853\'%3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'.5\'%3E%3C/feGaussianBlur%3E%3CfeComponentTransfer%3E%3CfeFuncA type=\'discrete\' tableValues=\'1 1\'%3E%3C/feFuncA%3E%3C/feComponentTransfer%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage filter=\'<span><span>url</span><span>(</span>%23b<span>)</span></span>\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' height=\'100%25\' width=\'100%25\' </span><br><span>        xlink%3Ahref=\<span>'data%3Aimage/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAkAAAAGCAIAAACepSOSAAAACXBIWXMAAC4jAAAuIwF4pT92AAAAs0lEQVQI1wGoAFf/AImSoJSer5yjs52ktp2luJuluKOpuJefsoCNowB+kKaOm66grL+krsCnsMGrt8m1u8mzt8OVoLIAhJqzjZ2tnLLLnLHJp7fNmpyjqbPCqLrRjqO7AIeUn5ultaWtt56msaSnroZyY4mBgLq7wY6TmwCRfk2Pf1uzm2WulV+xmV6rmGyQfFm3nWSBcEIAfm46jX1FkH5Djn5AmodGo49MopBLlIRBfG8yj/dfjF5frTUAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'%3E%3C/image%3E%3C/svg%3E'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>    </span><span>"</span></span><br>  <span>…</span><br><span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre><h3 id="(optional-ish)-javascript-optimization">(Optional-ish) JavaScript optimization <a href="#(optional-ish)-javascript-optimization">#</a></h3><p>Browsers may feel obliged to rasterize the blurry placeholder even if the image is already loaded.

I find that with posters the creator has to be clever with their use of space and this leads to some wonderful shapes and arrangements.</p><p>There is a website by the artist Mike Joyce called <span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.swissted.com/">swissted.com</a></span> that has a plethora of amazing posters with intricate and exciting layouts. I highly recommend checking it out if you want to get inspiration or just have a layout you want to practice.</p><hr><p>This tutorial will cover the re-creation of a poster with straight up <code>HTML</code>, <code>CSS</code> and <code>JavaScript</code>. We'll use <code>[GSAP](https://greensock.com/)</code> to animate elements of our poster and also learn how to load a custom font. The poster in question can be seen below, it is created by Mike Joyce and taken from their <span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.swissted.com/products/pixies-at-the-rat-1986">site</a></span>.</p><p>The finished project can be view here: <span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://css-grid-and-gsap-poster-layout.netlify.app/">css-grid-and-gsap-poster-layout.netlify.app</a></span>.</p><p>The source code can be viewed here: <span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/molebox/css-grid-and-gsap-poster-layout">github.com/molebox/css-grid-and-gsap-poster-layout</a></span></p><p>We are not going to need to install anything, open vscode (or your choice of IDE) and create the following:</p><ul role="list"><li>A <code>font</code> folder</li><li>A <code>styles</code> folder.

We have given our <code>html</code>a basic structure of how we want the poster to be laid out.</p><p>Styling</p><p>Before we start implementing our classes to define how our poster will look we can do a global reset of the margin, padding and box size. We'll also add our posters colours as css variables so that we can access them within our file in different places without having to repeat ourselves.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span></span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>margin</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>padding</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>box-sizing</span><span>:</span><span> border-box</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>:root</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>--white-color</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>#dee2d5</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>--green-color</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>#5ebd44</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>Thinking about our poster we will want it to have the shape of a poster, that means that it wont take up the whole width of our viewport.

We want it to be the height of the viewport and the margin centers our content. We have set the overflow to hidden as we will be doing some positioning later on and this will hide some of the overflowing elements.</p><p>main-grid</p><p>Looking at the poster we could go for a flexbox layout and use a direction of column, stacking all the elements vertically. That would be a viable solution, but to have a little more control over the size of each column and its placement we can instead use the grid. We are setting an explicit height on the top section and the title section then saying the rest (which is made up of the circles) should take up the rest of the available space, or 1 fractional unit.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>.main-grid</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>display</span><span>:</span><span> grid</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>grid-template-rows</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>50</span><span>px</span><span> </span><span>200</span><span>px</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>fr</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>info-section</p><p>The top section of the poster, with the two paragraphs of text will also utilize the grid. Flexbox would indeed be a good solution here, we could have used <code>justify-content: space-between</code> and then a padding on the horizontal of each text section to push them to the edges of the pages but with some padding from the actual edge. In keeping with using grid however, we can use a nifty feature of the <code>auto</code>cloumn size to set a defined width on the elements on the edges but an auto size in between, pushing the outer elements apart. The left and right section of text use flexbox with a direction of column.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>.info-section</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>grid-row</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>display</span><span>:</span><span> grid</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>grid-template-columns</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>300</span><span>px</span><span> auto </span><span>300</span><span>px</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>padding</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>em</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>  p</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>font-size</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0.8</span><span>em</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>.section-left</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>grid-column</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>display</span><span>:</span><span> flex</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>flex-direction</span><span>:</span><span> column</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>padding</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>em</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>.section-right</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>grid-column</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>display</span><span>:</span><span> flex</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>flex-direction</span><span>:</span><span> column</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>padding</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>em</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>title-section</p><p>We are on a roll with grid! Let's use another one. Here we will be defining the width of each text section whilst also setting the rows height to that of the given second section in the <code>main-grid</code> class. The subtitle, that is, the text on the right which is split into three rows, was a little more fiddly to get right. Our final result is ok but it's not 100% accurate.</p><p>Due to the size of the title text on the left we use a cheeky <code>margin-top</code> to push the three rows down a tad, this gives our eyes the impression that these three rows are centered to the big text on the left. That's not actually true due to the dots on the <code>i</code> raising the height of the title text.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>.title-section</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>grid-row</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>display</span><span>:</span><span> grid</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>grid-template-columns</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>400</span><span>px</span><span> auto </span><span>300</span><span>px</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>grid-template-rows</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>200</span><span>px</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>align-items</span><span>:</span><span> center</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>padding</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>em</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>height</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>100</span><span>%</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>.title</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>grid-column</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>font-size</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>em</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>font-weight</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>500</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>letter-spacing</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>px</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>.subtitle</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>grid-column</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>color</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--white-color</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>display</span><span>:</span><span> flex</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>flex-direction</span><span>:</span><span> column</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>padding</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>em</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>font-size</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1.3</span><span>em</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>font-weight</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>100</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>justify-content</span><span>:</span><span> space-evenly</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>height</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>150</span><span>px</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>margin-top</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>em</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>circles-grid</p><p>Our final class is the most "complicated". If we take a look at the original poster we can count how many circles we see, it's an 11x11 grid. The <code>repeat()</code> function allows us to set a repeating pattern of sizes in one short statement. For the columns we are saying that there should be 11 columns, each taking up the available space until they reach each end of the parent container. We do the same for the rows except that we explicitly state the height of the rows so that the child elements sizing more closely resemble that of the original poster.</p><p>Remember we set the <code>overflow: hidden</code> on the <code>outer-cointainer</code>? Here we can see why. When looking at the original poster we can see the circles on the horizontal edges are cut off, they are semi-circles. Now, rather than creating some special semi-circle shapes we set the width of this section (this grid) to be slightly larger than the parent container, and by hiding the overflow we give the illusion that the circles are semi-circles contained within our bounderies.</p><p>We use another little trick with the before pseudo element to give the illusion that the top of the grid is cut off and thus the circles look like semi-circles. The pseudo element here is creating a 20px high block which has the same colour as the poster. It's got an absolute position and lays on top of the <code>circles-grid</code>.</p><p>The nested <code>circle</code> class is the base circle that will be used to generate a circle dynamically using JavaScript. The <code>white-circle</code> will be used as an override to colour the white circles on the poster.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>.circles-grid</span><span>

        <p>Firmware developers are generally accustomed to using logging for execution
information. On microcontrollers, this is usually done through a serial
interface attached to a terminal on the host.</p>

<p>But one might need more advanced features from the host! I was in this position
not long ago 🤨.</p>

<p>When working on camera firmware, and particularly on the image processing
algorithm, I constantly needed to transfer images from the camera to my host
machine to make sure everything was working fine. So I started using
semi-hosting! It has greatly facilitated not only my development but also the
debugging of my embedded software.</p>

<p><strong>Semihosting</strong> is one of the many interesting features available on ARM Cortex
microcontrollers. It allows an embedded program to take advantage of the
capabilities of an attached computer when the debugger is running.</p>

<!-- excerpt start -->
<p>This post introduces semihosting and shows how to use it and integrate it into
your own embedded projects.
<!-- excerpt end --></p>



<h2 id="what-is-semihosting">What Is Semihosting</h2>

<p>According to ARM documentation<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, <strong>semihosting</strong> is <em>a mechanism that enables
code running on an ARM target to communicate and use the Input/Output facilities
on a host computer that is running a debugger</em>.</p>

<p>In other words, an ARM based MCU can run C library functions, such as
<code>printf()</code>, <code>scanf</code>, or even <code>fopen</code>, and have these interact directly with the
host computer attached to the device. By doing so, it can benefit from the
screen, the keyboard, or the disk of the host.</p>

<p>
  <img width="600" src="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/img/semihosting/semihosting_overview.png">
</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h2>

<p>This is done by halting the CPU target by the debugger agent, either by running
into a breakpoint instruction (<code>BKPT 0xAB</code>  for ARMv6-M or ARMv7-M) or by
sending a supervisor call instruction (<code>SVC 0xAB</code> or <code>SVC 0x123456</code>) depending
on the target architecture or processor.</p>

<p>This indicates to the host that the target is requesting a semihosting
operation.</p>

<p>The debugger agent then figures out the operation requested by the target by
reading the content of <code>r0</code>, and, if necessary, accesses all other function
parameters pointed by <code>r1</code>.</p>

<p>While the CPU is still halted, the host will execute the requested operation and
return the result in <code>r0</code> before allowing the processor to continue running its
program.</p>

<p>The following is a list of the semihosting operations defined by ARM<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/* File operations */</span>
<span>SYS_OPEN</span>        <span>EQU</span> <span>0x01</span> <span>//Open a file or stream on the host system.</span>
<span>SYS_ISTTY</span>       <span>EQU</span> <span>0x09</span> <span>//Check whether a file handle is associated with a file or a stream/terminal such as stdout.</span>
<span>SYS_WRITE</span>       <span>EQU</span> <span>0x05</span> <span>//Write to a file or stream.</span>
<span>SYS_READ</span>        <span>EQU</span> <span>0x06</span> <span>//Read from a file at the current cursor position.</span>
<span>SYS_CLOSE</span>       <span>EQU</span> <span>0x02</span> <span>//Closes a file on the host which has been opened by SYS_OPEN.</span>
<span>SYS_FLEN</span>        <span>EQU</span> <span>0x0C</span> <span>//Get the length of a file.</span>
<span>SYS_SEEK</span>        <span>EQU</span> <span>0x0A</span> <span>//Set the file cursor to a given position in a file.</span>
<span>SYS_TMPNAM</span>      <span>EQU</span> <span>0x0D</span> <span>//Get a temporary absolute file path to create a temporary file.</span>
<span>SYS_REMOVE</span>      <span>EQU</span> <span>0x0E</span> <span>//Remove a file on the host system. Possibly insecure!</span>
<span>SYS_RENAME</span>      <span>EQU</span> <span>0x0F</span> <span>//Rename a file on the host system. Possibly insecure!</span>

<span>/* Terminal I/O operations */</span>
<span>SYS_WRITEC</span>      <span>EQU</span> <span>0x03</span> <span>//Write one character to the debug terminal.</span>
<span>SYS_WRITE0</span>      <span>EQU</span> <span>0x04</span> <span>//Write a 0-terminated string to the debug terminal.</span>
<span>SYS_READC</span>       <span>EQU</span> <span>0x07</span> <span>//Read one character from the debug terminal.</span>

<span>/* Time operations */</span>
<span>SYS_CLOCK</span>       <span>EQU</span> <span>0x10</span>
<span>SYS_ELAPSED</span>     <span>EQU</span> <span>0x30</span>
<span>SYS_TICKFREQ</span>    <span>EQU</span> <span>0x31</span>
<span>SYS_TIME</span>        <span>EQU</span> <span>0x11</span>

<span>/* System/Misc. operations */</span>
<span>SYS_ERRNO</span>       <span>EQU</span> <span>0x13</span> <span>//Returns the value of the C library errno variable that is associated with the semihosting implementation.</span>
<span>SYS_GET_CMDLINE</span> <span>EQU</span> <span>0x15</span> <span>//Get commandline parameters for the application to run with (argc and argv for main())</span>
<span>SYS_HEAPINFO</span>    <span>EQU</span> <span>0x16</span>
<span>SYS_ISERROR</span>     <span>EQU</span> <span>0x08</span>
<span>SYS_SYSTEM</span>      <span>EQU</span> <span>0x12</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="how-to-use-it">How to Use It</h2>

<p>In this example, I run the program on an STM32 and use the <code>arm-none-eabi</code>
toolchain along with <strong>openOCD</strong> <code>gdbserver</code>. Other tools may be used instead
depending on your hardware, for more details on which debug interface to use, it
would be wise to read <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/a-deep-dive-into-arm-cortex-m-debug-interfaces">this article</a>.</p>

<p>Once you are all set, we can start coding.</p>

<p>First, to enable semihosting, you need to link:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<code>libc.a</code>, the standard C library (<em>newlib</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> for <code>arm-none-eabi-gcc</code>),</li>
  <li>and <code>librdimon.a</code>, a part of the <em>libgloss</em><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> library (for platform-specific
code) to your project.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is done by adding a few options to the ARM linker:</p>
<ul>
  <li>removing <code>-nostartfiles</code> flag to allow linking standards libraries,</li>
  <li>adding <code>-lc -lrdimon</code> flags,</li>
  <li>and changing the <em>spec strings</em> file<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> to <code>--specs=rdimon.specs</code> to use the
semihosted version of the <em>syscalls</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The last point essentially means that the system calls can be used when a
debugger is attached (note that the CPU may crash if a debugger is not present).</p>

<p>Now on the C code side, you need to call <code>initialise_monitor_handles()</code> before
starting a semihosting operation.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#ifdef SEMIHOSTING
</span><span>extern</span> <span>void</span> <span>initialise_monitor_handles</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>);</span>
<span>#endif
</span>
<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
<span>#ifdef SEMIHOSTING
</span>  	<span>initialise_monitor_handles</span><span>();</span>
<span>#endif
</span>
  	<span>// other tasks ...</span>

<span>#ifdef SEMIHOSTING
</span>    <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"hello world!</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"hello world!</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
<span>#endif
</span>
    <span>// other tasks ...</span>

  	<span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you are using <code>crt0</code> initialization function, <code>initialise_monitor_handles()</code>
has already been called for you before <code>main()</code>.</p>

<p>Once you have done this, you can compile and program your microcontroller as
usual, however, once the microcontroller flashed it should be halted and not run
yet.</p>

<p>In my case, I launch <em>OpenOCD</em> <code>gdbserver</code> in one terminal, to flash, reset and
halt the CPU. And run <code>gdb</code> from another terminal to connect to the server, and
enable the semihosting in the server side<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>arm-none-eabi-gdb <span>-ex</span> <span>"target extended-remote localhost:3333"</span> <span>-ex</span> <span>"monitor reset halt"</span> <span>-ex</span> <span>"monitor arm semihosting enable"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>If <code>initialise_monitor_handles()</code> is called before enabling the semihosting in
the server, a <code>HardFault</code> may occur due to an unexpected debug event.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once semihosting is enabled, you can run your program from <code>gdb</code>, and the
semihosting operation will be handled by the <code>gdbserver</code>.</p>

<p>Isn’t it great? 😋</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I hope it was fun reading this post, semihosting is not commonly used in
embedded development because it slows down the execution speed, but
nevertheless, it can be very handy in some cases.</p>

<p>I look forward to your remarks, tips, and comments.</p>

<p>If you are interested in API design and performance, this talk highlights how different approaches like stateless vs stateful APIs can affect performance and how to minimize the number of API calls through careful design.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://technically.dev/images/analytics/all_logos_no_padding.svg"></p><p>Not many people know this, but before Tolstoy released <em>War and Peace</em> in its entirety in 1869, he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqS1Ty79mOE">originally titled it</a>: <em>Analytics: what is it good for</em>. And here at Technically, we often wonder the same thing. Since Snowflake broke the internet with a <em>checks notes</em> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%24snow&amp;oq=%24snow&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0i433i457j0j46i175i199j0l3j0i395l4.3372j1j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">$80B market cap</a>, everyone – in tech, finance, and misc. industries alike – have been paying closer attention to the analytics stack. And they have questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are these data analysts using? </li>
<li>What is this “analytics engineer” title that keeps popping up?</li>
<li>Why would you use Snowflake over BigQuery or Redshift?</li>
<li>What does Segment do? And what is Fivetran?</li>
<li>What happened to Looker, and what’s dbt?</li>
</ul>
<p>Fear not - while I may not have learned much during my Data Science major, a few years working on analytics teams has given me the requisite knowledge to illuminate this thick darkness of harmful jargon. </p>
<h2>Some disclaimers</h2>
<p>As always, a few notes in advance so that I won’t have to deal with angry comments:</p>
<p><strong>→ Analytics stacks are highly company dependent</strong></p>
<p>I’ve worked with data at 5+ different companies, all with very different analytics stacks. The infrastructure you choose depends <strong>highly</strong> on your budget, technical history, stakeholder needs, and types of people on staff. It is <strong>not</strong> one size fits all. </p>
<p><strong>→ Analytics stacks are very different from Data Science stacks</strong></p>
<p>Data <em>Science</em> – or in my personal definition, the practice of creating and utilizing predictive models to drive business value – is distinct from analytics, and that distinction is beyond the scope of this post. Suffice it to say that Machine Learning is its own beast with its own tools, and I won’t be covering those tools here. But, having said that, Machine Learning stacks will usually <strong>overlap</strong> with analytics stacks, and rely on some of the same tools (e.g. data warehouses). </p>
<p><strong>→ The universe is constantly changing - don’t read this in the future</strong></p>
<p>In my few, scant years in the workforce, tooling for analytics has undergone drastic change. Hell, the entire analytics practice – especially team organization and roles – is completely different than it was when I graduated undergrad. I believe it was Yogi Berra who said that “change is the only constant,” and his wisdom extends to this domain as well. </p>
<p><strong>→ This content is not exhaustive</strong></p>
<p>There are thousands of available tools in the data ecosystem, and it’s impossible to cover them all. I have also not used them all, and am not aware of them all. So if you think I missed something, just <a href="mailto:justin@technically.dev">get in touch</a>!</p>
<h2>The analytics stack - 10K feet up</h2>
<p>The goal of any analytics stack is to be able to <strong>answer questions about the business with data</strong>. Those questions can be simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many active users do we have?</li>
<li>What was our recurring revenue last month?</li>
<li>Did we hit our goal for sales leads this quarter?</li>
</ul>
<p>But they can also be complex and bespoke:</p>
<ul>
<li>What behavior in a user’s first day indicates they’re likely to sign up for a paid plan?</li>
<li>What’s our net dollar retention for customers with more than 50 employees?</li>
<li>Which paid marketing channel has been most effective over the past 7 days?</li>
</ul>
<p>Answering these questions requires a whole stack of tools and instrumentation to make sure the right data is in place. You can think of the <strong>end product</strong> of a great analytics stack as a nicely formatted, useful data warehouse full of tables like “user_acquisition_facts” that make answering the above questions as simple as a basic SQL query.  \</p>
<p>But the road to getting there is unpaved and treacherous. The actual data you need is <strong>all over the place</strong>, siloed in different tools with different interfaces. It’s <strong>dirty</strong>, and needs reformatting and cleaning. It’s <strong>constantly changing</strong>, and needs maintenance, care, and thoughtful monitoring. The analytics stack and its associated work is all about getting that data in the format and location you need it.</p>
<p>The basics:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Where data comes from</strong>: production data stores, instrumentation, SaaS tools, and public data</li>
<li><strong>Where data goes</strong>: managed data warehouses and homegrown storage</li>
<li><strong>How data moves around</strong>: ETL tools, SaaS connectors, and streaming</li>
<li><strong>How data gets ready</strong>: modeling, testing, and documentation</li>
<li><strong>How data gets used</strong>: charting, SQL clients, sharing</li>
</ol>
<p>For each section, we’ll note a few sample tools that are popular for getting the job done.</p>
<h2>Where the data comes from</h2>
<p>All of that nice, formatted, joined data in the data warehouse – the data that makes up the dashboards, the models, and the slide decks – has to originate from somewhere. And it usually comes from one of four places:</p>
<h5>1. Production data stores</h5>
<p><img src="https://technically.dev/images/analytics/logos_1.svg"></p><p>Pretty much every app is backed by a database, a series of databases, a stream; just data of some sort. If you’re using an app that lets you log in, there’s a database to store user information. Your emails in Gmail are stored in a database. Your tweets are stored in a database. In many cases, this data is actually pretty useful for analytics. You may be able to answer “how many active users do we have?” from the users database, and so on and so forth. </p>
<p>In terms of tools, there are literally thousands of databases on the market, from relational ones (Postgres, MySQL, MSSQL, etc.) to NoSQL ones (MongoDB, Firebase, DynamoDB) to streaming ones (Kafka, although apparently <a href="https://materialize.com/kafka-is-not-a-database/">Kafka is not a database</a>). </p>
<h5>2. Instrumentation</h5>
<p><img src="https://technically.dev/images/analytics/logos_2.svg"></p><p>Much more in vogue these days is <strong>instrumenting</strong> your product, or firing little “events” every time a user does something in the product. Those events go into a database, and can be used to answer questions down the road. If a user clicks on the “settings” tab in your app, you might automatically fire an event like this:</p>
<pre><code>{
  name: “settings_tab_clicked”,
  user_id: “e2uirh2837yrfh4ur3f34”,
  user_email: “justin@technically.dev”,
  created_at: “2021-01-01”,
} 
</code></pre>
<p>Now, if I’m curious how often users click on the “settings” tab, I can just aggregate these events with basic SQL. The move towards getting information out of events instead of production databases is getting called <em>Event Driven Analytics</em> and it’s <a href="https://www.littlemissdata.com/blog/givemedata">picking up steam</a>. </p>
<p>Instrumentation is mostly done in code, and teams will often (usually?) do it manually. But <a href="https://technically.substack.com/p/what-does-segment-do">Segment</a> also provides a library and infrastructure for firing and managing these events, and it’s getting quite popular. </p>
<h5>3. SaaS tools</h5>
<p><img src="https://technically.dev/images/analytics/logos_3.svg"></p><p>Businesses run operations on tools like Salesforce, Hubspot, and Stripe, and those tools output valuable data that’s essential to answering key business questions. If you’re running your billing through Stripe, <em>that’s</em> where your revenue data is going to come from. Salesforce has interesting information on how your deals pass through the sales process, demographic data on your leads, etc.</p>
<p>The hard part is getting data <strong>out</strong> of these Saas tools and <strong>into</strong> a place where you can analyze it along with all of your other data, i.e. the warehouse. More on that in a later section.</p>
<h5>4. Public places / demographic data</h5>
<p>It’s less common, but teams will sometimes source data from public sources or use enrichment providers like Clearbit to get information on their customers or site visitors. We’re also starting to see domain-specific providers like <a href="https://docs.askiggy.com/docs">Iggy</a> that provide high quality data as a service. </p>
<h2>Where the data goes to</h2>
<p>Common knowledge today is that for analytics, you want a <strong>data warehouse</strong> with all of the data you need centralized in <strong>one location</strong>, and optimized for <strong>large queries</strong> to <strong>run fast </strong>(for more on why you can’t just query what already exists, <a href="https://technically.substack.com/p/whats-a-data-warehouse">read up here</a>).</p>
<p>Generally, building and maintaining warehouses was pretty annoying, and required specialized infrastructure and expertise. But today (thankfully) we’re in a golden age of managed data warehouses, where you can pay Snowflake or BigQuery to manage that tedium for you (for a hefty price, of course).</p>
<h5>1. <strong>Managed data warehouses</strong></h5>
<p><img src="https://technically.dev/images/analytics/logos_4.svg"></p><p>The three big players in the space are <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/">Snowflake</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery">BigQuery</a> (from Google), and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/?whats-new-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&amp;whats-new-cards.sort-order=desc">Redshift</a> (from Amazon), with a new entrant (<a href="https://www.firebolt.io/">Firebolt</a>) getting some press. These solutions are expensive, but they make the analytics stack <strong>a lot </strong>simpler by obviating the need to manage servers and infrastructure. </p>
<p>I often get asked why teams choose Snowflake over BigQuery, and to analyze the respective merits of these different products. I’ve personally used all 3 of the big ones, and performance varied, but that was mostly based on architecture and data types. There is <strong>no one size fits all answer</strong> to this question: companies generally evaluate solutions based on cost, feature set, integrations, and portability (e.g. Snowflake is multi-cloud, sort of). </p>
<h5>2. Home rolled stuff</h5>
<p><img src="https://technically.dev/images/analytics/logos_5.svg"></p><p>If you want to build your own data warehouse – because of cost, security, or feature considerations – there’s a bunch of open source software out there to use. A popular stack is <a href="https://hive.apache.org/">Hive</a> on top of <a href="https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/hdfs_design.html">HDFS</a>, which are both part of the Hadoop ecosystem. I’ve also seen <a href="https://prestodb.io/">Presto</a> used here as a query engine, running on top of something like <a href="http://mesos.apache.org/">Mesos</a> for compute management. </p>
<h2>How the data moves around</h2>
<p>Once you’ve got a clean handle on where your data comes from and what warehouse it’s going to go to, you need to start thinking about how to move it from place to place. The goal of this part of the stack is to get data <strong>out of siloed systems</strong> and <strong>into your centralized warehouse</strong>, where you can query it as you place.</p>
<h5>1. Workflow orchestrators</h5>
<p><img src="https://technically.dev/images/analytics/logos_6.svg"></p><p>Getting data out of your source systems and into your warehouse isn’t usually a simple “pick it up and move it” kind of operation – there are usually <a href="https://technically.substack.com/p/whats-etl">a bunch of things you’ll want to do to that data while it’s on the way</a>, like transform it and clean it (see next section). For larger companies with complex datasets, you might see pipelines that rely on 20+ different source tables just to build one little piece of the warehouse. Pipelines like that usually get represented with diagrams like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://technically.dev/images/analytics/airflow_dag.png"></p>
<p>Workflow orchestrators help teams build these complex pipelines, make sure they run on time, and alert you when things go wrong. The most popular open source tool in the space is <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/">Airflow</a>, with <a href="https://github.com/spotify/luigi">Luigi</a> still hanging on and up and comers <a href="https://www.prefect.io/">Prefect</a> and <a href="https://dagster.io/">Dagster</a> making some waves.</p>

        <p>In 2006 [1] Stefan Nyström invented the [2] <strong>WaveReaper</strong> and released his plans online in 2008. This invention used parts of a bicycle to <em>reap</em> energy from the ocean waves. It surprised me that not much has happened since then (and the website is [4] no longer up), so I thought I’d write a little about it.</p>
<p>Electricity generation is one of humanities greatest indirect requirements. It’s used for literally everything:</p>
<ul>
<li>Farming</li>
<li>Hospitals</li>
<li>Refining Fuel</li>
<li>Lights</li>
</ul>
<p>In developing nations, electricity is not generally available, especially in rural areas. Cheap, easy to produce and sustainable energy is something most of the world still needs.</p>
<p>The WaveReaper is an invention that generates electricity from the motion of the waves on a coastline. It uses barrels which float on the water and produce electricity back on the shore. </p>

<li>The one-way bearings can be sourced on any bicycle.</li>
<li>The spindle-driven generator can easily be extracted from many existing electrical machines like a vacuum cleaner.</li>
<li>Can incrementally increase power, by adding more buoys. </li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few disadvantages which should also be considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having an exposed oscillating line heading out into the waves could be problematic.</li>
<li>There may be negative environmental effects on having this in the water.</li>
<li>Rust and corrosion is an ongoing problem</li>
<li>Steady power is not guaranteed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally, I think this is a great invention. It solves the problem effectively and components are easily sourced, making it an ideal way to generate power in developing countries. </p>
<p>What are your thoughts on the invention?</p>

<p>On <em>2021-02-16</em> by <em>ThatGeoGuy</em></p>

<p>The (current) extended public health crisis has given me a gratuitous amount of
free time. At least, comparatively to before the public health crisis. This
past weekend, bored out of my mind, I came across a <a href="https://k9mail.app/2021/02/14/K-9-Mail-is-looking-for-funding">post from the K-9
developers</a> on
Hacker News. This got me thinking a lot more about email and how my use has
changed over time.</p>

<p>I use K-9 on Android, and if you do too, you should definitely help fund the
app. It’s one of the few choices on Android for email that doesn’t suck.
However, this isn’t really about K-9 or their funding. This article kind of got
me thinking about email and how I use it, and with an idle mind that had no
other immediate priorities I started re-evaluating how I use &amp; interact with
email.</p>

<p>I’m writing this mostly because my blog is a blank canvas for my thoughts, and
because I can.</p>



<p>In recent years I’ve been taking this attitude more and more. Email certainly
is the universal platform (everyone has at least one email address), but I
don’t send an awful amount of email myself. Back when I was in grad school
email was literally the only way you could talk to some people. I met
professors, other students, and faculty from all branches of the university
that would put almost their entire lives into email. Nowadays, I suppose this
is more likely to happen over Slack, or even <a href="https://element.io/">Element</a>?</p>

<p>I send a lot less email than I used to. I also receive a lot fewer emails than
I used to, or at least, it feels like I do <sup id="reference-1"><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup>. All my work communication is handled through
Slack, and most of my personal communication will be over Signal or Element.
Despite this, email is still pretty good at a number of things, and its not
like I could see myself getting rid of it. Ignoring “you need an email address
to sign up for X service,” email is still king at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Availability &amp; compatibility. Everyone has an email, everyone can probably
receive an email, and everyone can communicate via email. Okay, that last one
is a bit of a stretch, but I’ll leave a caveat here that learning to
communicate effectively via email is significantly easier than e.g. Twitter.
So it’s got that going for it at least.</li>
  <li>Asynchronous communication. <em>Sure, instant messaging is asynchronous</em>, but is
it really? I feel completely comfortable not replying to an email anywhere
from an hour up to and including never. I can’t say the same about small
Slack notifications.</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s good reason to think email isn’t going away anytime soon, so I’m fairly
confident that lots of people do care about email, and will continue to do so.</p>

<h2 id="hey-product-cares-about-email">Hey (product) cares about email</h2>

<p>Thinking about email and how I still use it, I was reminded that
<a href="https://hey.com/">Hey</a> exists. Hey is a subscription email service (think,
paying for Gmail) that aims to do email radically differently than everyone
else. There is a limited amount you can change about email from the get-go, but
I went back and watched an entire <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCeYTysLyGI">37-minute
video</a> of their CEO explaining how
Hey is different than regular email.</p>

<p>The video is long, and touches on a lot of features. I don’t personally see
myself ponying up ~$99 USD a year for email, but I think there’s both some good
and bad ideas in there. Some of that probably depends on the volume of email
you receive, and like I said, I don’t receive lots. Nonetheless, Hey looks to
me more like they changed the frontend for a web-email client more than they
changed anything about email itself. This is completely fine, and is not really
to detract from their product (a lot of the choices are good!), but don’t go in
expecting the behaviour of the protocol to vastly change.</p>

<p>Hey gets a lot of things right. I really like the idea of “surfacing”
attachments and details from emails (i.e. displaying them as a separate
category and making them much more searchable). If I ever go neck deep into
using email to manage my life, this is something that would be a game changer.</p>

<p>The idea behind “the feed” is also really good. I’ve signed up for a few
substack lists as well as some great columns like Matt Levine’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/money-stuff">Money
Stuff</a>. The video
demo that Hey shows is a bit wrong, as I don’t expect that most people would
want to use the feed for marketing and advertisements, but maybe the way I use
email is weird. Nonetheless, the concept of having a folder / dedicated filter
for feed items seems both plausible and pragmatic to me. This also made me feel
a little dumb because I had always separated all feed items / mailing lists
into separate folders. For open-source mailing lists I still do this (don’t
cross your <a href="https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/chicken-users/">chickens</a>
with your <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guile-user/">guile users</a>, you
don’t want anyone getting salmonella!); however most of the “feed” columns I
subscribe to don’t post nearly often enough to make my feeds folder explode.
And to the point Hey makes, you shouldn’t have to stress out about this folder
or care.</p>

<p>Similar logic applies to their concept of a “paper trail,” but I’m also
convinced that’s something that has to be mostly curated manually since
automatic filters for sorting receipts &amp; invoices are… ripe for error on that
one.</p>

<p>Lastly, the idea of being able to permanently ignore threads is 💯 (the best).
There are so many instances of people not knowing the difference between
“Reply” and “Reply All” that I can veritably say that the lack of this feature
in every other email client has driven someone mad and / or driven someone to
death.  Hard to quantify, but the probability seems high enough at scale.
Anyone on the Thunderbird team willing to integrate this without having to make
thread-specific filters? Anyone on the Dovecot team willing to make this a
plugin?</p>



<p>Probably? Email obviously isn’t a secure communication medium, and the
protocols are pretty old school.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Meta_Application_Protocol">JMAP</a> seems like
it has it’s heart set in the right place, but I am skeptical of most of the
internet moving in that direction for… oh the next 25 years maybe? Years may
be a bad prediction metric, so maybe we say instead that Google will have
launched and killed at least 10 more chat applications by that time?</p>

<p>I think something more interesting surrounds the fact that most people suck at
email. I cringe whenever I see an unread count in the tens of thousands. Some
people believe that to be a badge of honour, but I’m fairly certain that just
describes you as someone who doesn’t care, and I generally take the position
that it’s not a virtue to be proud of how much I don’t care about things.</p>

<p>For a lot of people who are hopeless with email, an offering like Hey might be
good. On the other hand, I think if people grew up learning even the base level
of email skills (etiquette?) then a significant part of the world would be a
lot better off.</p>

<p>Knowing how to use email effectively is probably a superpower for some folks in
some organizations.</p>



<p>These are just some of my tips, but they certainly helped me get more
proficient at email over time.</p>

<h2 id="use-an-actual-email-client-not-a-web-client">Use an actual email client (not a web client)</h2>

<p>Upfront: Maybe this isn’t the most universal advice. I got a lot farther with
email when I started leaning heavily into using Thunderbird rather than trying
to keep up with every change to the Gmail interface. What makes a good client
is somewhat subjective, but I’d say that working with web clients has overall
been a poor experience for me.</p>

<p>For every feature a web client has, it also has a million ways to be
distracting or use 90% of your CPU in a single tab of your browser. “Hey” might
be different in some regards here, as their UI seems quite intuitive at a
glance, but you’ll pry my desktop native (read: not Electron) client from my
cold, dead hands.</p>

<h2 id="dont-send-html-emails">Don’t send HTML emails</h2>

<p>This is just good writing advice but: focus on content over form. The number of
random business emails I get with fancy HTML signatures, tons of markup, etc.
are ridiculous. Stop wasting yours and everyone else’s time, please, and just
write the email. If your email requires more formatting to be readable, then
you’ve already failed on the content front.</p>

<p>Being polite is a skill unto itself, but your email is (usually) not a
thinkpiece. Just write the text and focus on the message. The people writing
fancy substack newsletters and such obviously don’t need to follow this advice,
but most people seem to think that plain text emails are somehow… bad?</p>

<h2 id="use-message-filters-to-organize-things">Use message filters to organize things</h2>

<p>This goes back to the idea of “feeds” or a “paper trail.” Message filters and
folders are a great way to get unimportant stuff out of your inbox. It’s not
even something that should take you a full afternoon to learn.</p>

<p>The biggest downfall of this is that message filters can’t be easily translated
from one client to another. Likewise, server-side options with LMTP / Sieve or
whatever are still complex as all hell to set up, and then you <em>still</em> need to
understand how to write the scripts to do the email filtering. This is more a
complaint for someone who has their own mail server and uses multiple clients
(K-9 on Android, Thunderbird on Linux, Geary on Phosh-based distros).</p>

<p>Most people who want to set up filters in Gmail should absolutely just go do
that via the web interface, since that will happen before mail reaches your
local client. The filters you choose to set up or how you organize also doesn’t
matter. I think the feeds and paper trail ideas have some merit, but the main
point is <strong>stop pretending your inbox is the only folder that can ever exist</strong>.</p>

<p>And on that note: please for the love of god filter and silence automated
emails (think: a CI pipeline), or at least funnel them to a different folder.
Your inbox is not a notification bar, and on pretty much every mobile client
ever you can have alerts get sent to you either 1) not through email or 2) with
a filter that weeds out noise. So many people hate email for this reason alone!</p>

<h2 id="stop-using-your-email-as-a-todo-list">Stop using your email as a TODO list</h2>

<p>I mean, this speaks for itself. Use Org mode, use one of literally hundreds of
TODO apps, use a paper and pencil! But don’t use email <sup id="reference-2"><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="dont-be-afraid-of-archiving-or-marking-email-as-read">Don’t be afraid of archiving or marking email as read</h2>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>So I have requested a food delivery from DoorDash, and it happened that my food still hadn’t been picked up yet. I opened my DoorDash app at 12:30 pm today, and it’s still being prepared until now at 7:50 pm. During the approximately 8 hours waiting, I have tried to reach out to them three times, and each agent responded to me with a predefined message: “We are sorry for the delay … We will assign a new dasher for you … We will refund you the money amount XXX”, etc. Just out of curiosity, I did some google search about how these custom-faced companies deal with this type of situation, and here is what I found:</p><ol><li>Show your attitude that you are truly sorry.</li><li>Validate your customer’s <strong>feeling</strong>.</li><li>Explain what happened.</li></ol><p>I copied these bullet points from <a href="https://www.helpscout.com/helpu/how-to-apologize/">HelpScout</a>, which is a SaaS company that has powered a lot of tech companies such as GrubHub, PostMark, etc.</p><p>In the past, for example, for some smartphone companies (well, Apple had indeed done a great job) – it’s very hard to get an apology from them because their phone has somehow defected, or it generally took a long process to get your device replaced.</p><p>So why people change to be more “friendly”? I guess it’s simply because these companies now care more about their reputations than in the past. Imagine the era without Facebook and Twitter, people from the U.S. don’t care about what had happened in China, and they never heard about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang_internment_camps">Xinjiang internment camps</a>. However, when you first talk about Xinjiang in the U.S. today, you probably will encounter the conversation on Twitter about the camps. Isn’t it an issue back in 2000? Maybe, but people don’t have a chance to talk about it, so why would China defend itself on that?</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">BREAKING: BBC has been banned in China. The report said the BBC was responsible for a 'slew of falsified reporting' on issues including Xinjiang and China's handling of coronavirus. It went on to say that 'fake news' is not tolerated in China</p>— Yalda Hakim (@BBCYaldaHakim) <a href="https://twitter.com/BBCYaldaHakim/status/1359905060570996740?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2021</a></blockquote><blockquote><p>this is the first tweet I encountered after I searched “Xinjiang” on Twitter</p></blockquote><p>Company is like another type of “country” that needs to preserve its public face – for various reasons. If your public image is damaged, your stock will likely go down, your competitors might fight against you harshly, on and on… I am very happy to see what had changed here, but it also had drawbacks. Some big tech firms had a very good public image, and as a result, they become very wealthy. To become popular so that they can attract more customers, these companies decide to invest more money on maintaining their public images, then you know how the money circulated. Does it provide a lifeline for those smaller companies who used to be a specialist in certain areas? Or will it just promote another <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.">United States v. Microsoft</a> to live? It certainly didn’t block the whole aisle, but it definitely narrows the bridge ahead.</p><p>Now back to my food delivery from DoorDash. They had just issued me a full-price refund plus a small amount of credit for a future order, and I was told to hold and keep waiting. What can I do now? I guess I have to follow what they told me to do.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>I get the temptation to make standup asynchronous. “Stop forcing a daily meeting on everyone! Take back those <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/14/parkinsons-law-and-friends/">15 minutes</a>!” It sounds great, and I’m usually a fan of <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/15/good-teams-are-noisy/">writing as a way to collaborate</a>. </p>



<p>But <a href="https://critter.blog/2021/02/09/say-things-that-can-be-wrong/">asynchronous standups are not standups</a>. They’re a way for teams to <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/24/declare-bankruptcy-and-dont-be-ashamed-of-it/">kill standups</a> without feeling guilty about it. </p>



<p>Why? Two reasons:</p>



<p><strong>Reason 1: Standups are not status updates. </strong>I like Scrum’s definition of a standup, even for teams not doing Scrum:</p>



<blockquote><p>The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work.</p><cite><a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#daily-scrum">Scrum Guide</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>See that? In a good standup, you’re <strong>re-<a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/20/plan-the-sprint-not-the-project/">planning the sprint</a> every day</strong>. That can’t happen if you rattle off a quick “last 24 I did X, next 24 I’ll do Y, no blockers” and move on with your day.</p>



<p><strong>Reason 2: <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/01/never-underestimate-peoples-ability-to-not-hear-you/">Nobody’s reading</a> all those updates.</strong> At best, the manager reads them and one or two other people skim them. That’s not collaboration. That’s reporting up the chain, which is not what standups are for.</p>



<p>If your <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/06/10/spotting-broken-processes/">standups are so useless</a> that you don’t miss anything by taking it to Slack, <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/17/zombie-standups-try-walking-the-board/">try fixing them</a> instead of <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/24/intense-intervention-or-acceptance-pick-one/">giving up</a>. </p>

<em>2021-02-13</em><br>

<h2 id="baggins">Background</h2>

<p>
In the beginning, the CPU was created.
This has made a lot of people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move.

</p><p>
Though computers have only gained in popularity, in our interactions with them we have increasingly attempted to interact less with the CPU; and more and more with the abstractions that simply <i>happen</i> to be implemented atop CPUs.
One of the earliest such abstractions was the <b>instruction set architecture</b> (ISA).
The idea was this: instead of writing code for a specific CPU, you would design an abstract specification for one; a language, if you will, that could be spoken by multiple different CPUs.
You would then write code according to that instruction set, in that language, and it could be interpreted by any CPU implementing that instruction set.
This was desirable partly because it allowed code to be written once and run multiple placesâ€”the first inklings of portability, rising!â€”but mostly because it allowed you to think only of the specification while you wrote your code, and perhaps even forget for a moment that there was a CPU underlying it all.

</p><p>Ahhh, the power of abstraction in the morning...

</p><p>
Another such abstraction was the <b>mnemonic assembler</b>.
Before the assembler was created, CPUs and ISAs were instructed using numbers which had special meaning to the ISA in question.
For example, consider the following number<sup id="b0"><a href="#f0">0</a></sup> (in octal form, for no particular reason):

</p><pre>030514</pre>

<p>
In the context of the ISA implemented by the CRAY-1<sup id="b1"><a href="#f1">1</a></sup>, that number is understand to mean â€˜add the contents of registers A1 and A4, and store the result in register A5â€™.
The association between this numeric form and its meaning under the ISA is completely arbitrary, and serves only to remind our poor programmers that they are serving a CPU, whose native language is written with arbitrary numbers.
Wouldnâ€™t it be nice if, instead of meaningless <span>030514</span>, our CPU could understand a form like this one?

</p><pre>A5	A1+A4
</pre>

<p>
(This latter form, while no less arbitrary than the other, is arbitrary in a way which matches preexisting human arbitrarinesses.
 This makes humans feel warm and fuzzy inside, like theyâ€™ve conquered a part of the machine kingdom with their superior human intellect, and is called a â€˜mnemonicâ€™.)

</p><p>
Unfortunately, while CPUs are equally capable of parsing numbers like <span>030514</span> and strings of words like <span>A5	A1+A4</span>, they are much slower at the second.
Thus, a compromise was borne: a mnemonic assembler would be a program (like all programs, it would run on a CPU implementing an ISA), and it would translate mnemonic forms like <span>A5	A1+A4</span> into machine forms like <span>030514</span>.
This allows humans to <i>pretend</i> that the CPUs understand their own native language, while still allowing the CPUs themselves to run at tolerable speeds.

</p><p>
At this point, it is worth making a couple of things devastatingly clear.

</p><p>
First, an assembler that runs on a given ISA may produce machine code for that ISA, or machine code for a completely different ISA.<!--(An assembler that produces code for a different ISA than that on which is runs is sometimes called a â€˜cross assemblerâ€™, Ã  la â€˜cross compilerâ€™.)-->
</p><p>
Second, there is almost always a 1:1 correspondence between the mnemonics inhaled by a given assembler and the instructions it spits out.  (Where there is not, the situation is generally close enough to 1:1 as to make no ends.)
</p><p>
Third, mnemonics were not standardised the same way that ISAs were.  A given set of mnemonics only works on one ISA, but there might be any number of other mnemonic-sets that also work on that ISA.  (Despite this, a number of tropes tend emerge which are shared by all mnemonic-sets targeting a given ISA.)

</p><p>
At this point, we are ready to attack the problem at hand.
</p><p>
There is a popular group of ISAs variably known as:
</p><ul>
<li>x86
 <ul><li>x86-64?
  <ul><li>EM64T?
   <ul><li>x64??
    <ul><li>AMD64???</li>
    </ul></li>
   </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
 </ul></li>
<li>IA-32
 <ul><li>IA-32<b>e</b>???</li></ul></li>
</ul>
(The question marks have been added for comedic effect.
 In point of fact, they are about as funny as the overproliferation of names that this ISA seems to accumulate in much the same way that a pile of cow dung accumulates flies or that this sentence accumulates words.
 Unlike a pile of cow dung, however, no clarity emerges when you swat it; only more confusion.
 Which being said, you should still clean your CPU at least annually; use soap, warm water, and a soft rag to get the gunk out of the transistors.)

<p>
This ill-fated ISA, which has almost as many addressing forms as names and is so immensely complicated that a you need to read a 5000-page tome<sup id="b2"><a href="#f2">2</a></sup> plus an additional 400 or so pages of unofficial reference before you can even begin to be qualified to understand the consequences of a single of its instructions, will henceforth be referred to as â€˜â€œSIBâ€�â€™.
I give it that name not so much to deliberately sow confusion (though that is definitely a contributing factor) as because thatâ€™s the only name that everybody seems to agree is associated with it.
(This is also the reason its name is quoted: itâ€™s the only word, indeed the only idea in this missive I didnâ€™t make up from whole cloth, ripped cloth, cheese cloth, pins, pinheads, camembert<sup id="b3"><a href="#f3">3</a></sup>, angels, and heads of ã�®ã�£ã�ºã‚‰ã�¼ã�†.)

</p><p>
Because â€˜SIBâ€™ is, inexplicably, enduringly popular, a lot of assemblers have been made for it.
As I mentioned, though different assemblers are not always compatible with each other, tropes and commonalities tend to emerge.
In fact, there are two incompatible sets of tropes; they are generally called â€˜AT&amp;T syntaxâ€™ and â€˜Intel syntaxâ€™, and you can read about the differences <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language#Syntax">here</a>.

</p><p>
...but you knew all of this already.
If Iâ€™ve done my due diligence, you were incited by the title but are still looking for something to disagree (or agree) with strongly.
Patience!

</p><p>
I contend that the AT&amp;T syntax is harmful and bad, and should never be used, for any reason, under any circumstances, by anyone.
Hereâ€™s why:


</p><h2 id="the-real-biggy">AT&amp;T syntax is broken</h2>

<p>
This is the single greatest sin perpetrated by the AT&amp;T syntax.
If not for this, it would be sufficient to say that Intel syntax were superior.
If not for this, the use of AT&amp;T syntax would be at least be acceptable, at least be moral<sup id="b4"><a href="#f4">4</a></sup>, even if still in supremely poor taste.
If not for this, it would be <i>possible</i> to write correct programs using the AT&amp;T syntax.

</p><p>
Now, to be clear, I donâ€™t expect advanced safety features from an assembler.
I donâ€™t expect dependent types, or linear types, or even any types at all.
<i>But I would pretty damn well appreciate it if my assembler didnâ€™t <b>actively</b> try to sabotage me!</i>


</p><p>
Let me show you an example.
Hereâ€™s an annotated snippet of Intel-style â€˜SIBâ€™ assembly:

</p><pre>mov	eax, 28            ; (1) store the immediate value 28 in the EAX register
mov	eax, dword [28]    ; (2) load one â€˜dwordâ€™ (4 bytes) from memory location 28 and store it in the EAX register <!--;     (on some assemblers, â€˜dwordâ€™ should be replaced with â€˜dword ptrâ€™, or just elided entirely)-->
</pre>

<p>
Hereâ€™s another snippet, AT&amp;T syntax this time:

</p><pre>movl	$28, %eax          ; (1) store the immediate value 28 in the EAX register
movl	(28), %eax         ; (2) load one â€˜(l)ongâ€™ (4 bytes) from memory location 28 and store it in the EAX register <!--;     (on some assemblers, the â€˜lâ€™ can be elided)-->
</pre>

<p>
Good so far?
Reasonable?
Good.

</p><p>
I present to you two more candidates, again in AT&amp;T syntax:

</p><pre>movl	28, %eax           ; (3) ???
movl	($28), %eax        ; (4) ???
</pre>

<p>
Before you continue reading, I want you to imagine what it would make <i>sense</i> for those instructions to mean.
Should they even be correct?
If you happen to already know, try to forget (pray for oblivion from the horror...)

</p><p>
If you donâ€™t know, make your best guess.

</p><p>
Ready?
Here they are again, with annotations this time:

</p><pre>movl	28, %eax           ; (3) same as (2)
movl	($28), %eax        ; (4) load one long from the memory location indicated by global symbol â€˜$28â€™ and store it in the EAX register
</pre>

<p>
Wait, what?

</p><p>
Go back and read that again and tell me in what world that could possibly be okay.
Tell me in what world an assembler that silently accepts the above forms, that is almost certainly corrupting your meaning in a way you donâ€™t intend, could <i>possibly</i> produce correct code.
Tell me you would <i>never</i> forget to put a <span>$</span> in front of an immediate, and that you would never accidentally put one in a displacement.

</p><p>
This doesnâ€™t even have anything to do with Intel syntax.
This isnâ€™t a win for Intel over AT&amp;T.
This is just AT&amp;T syntax being straight-up batshit fucking bonkers for no very good reason.

</p><p>
All it would take to redeem AT&amp;T syntaxâ€”okay, maybe not redeem, but at least elevate from <i>Cocytus</i> to <i>Phlegyas</i>â€”would be to make syntaxes (3) and (4) illegal.
Thatâ€™s it.
Want to help?
Send a patch to your local AT&amp;T-style assembler to make it warn for both of those forms.
Give it a command-line flag to err instead of warning.


</p><h2>AT&amp;T is backwards</h2>

<p>
Having eaten the proverbial elephant, it is time to start addressing the smaller fry.<br>
Smaller fry: you have done an admirable job of being a thorn in my side.<br>
Reader: following are reasons why the AT&amp;T operand order is backwards.

</p><p>
Iâ€™m sure youâ€™re familiar with the issue, but hereâ€™s a quick refresher.
Intel first:

</p><pre>mov	eax, ebx           ; (1) load one dword from the EBX register and store it in the EAX register
add	eax, ebx           ; (2) load a dword each from the EAX and EBX registers, add them together, and store the result (truncated to a dword) in the EAX register
</pre>

<p>
AT&amp;T:

</p><pre>mov	%ebx, %eax         ; (1) load one dword from the EBX register and store it in the EAX register
add	%ebx, %eax         ; (2) load a dword each from the EAX and EBX registers, add them together, and store the result (truncated to a dword) in the EAX register
</pre>

<p>
In general, Intel instruction mnemonics take the form â€˜&lt;op&gt; &lt;destination&gt;, &lt;source&gt;â€™, where AT&amp;T uses â€˜&lt;op&gt; &lt;source&gt;, &lt;destination&gt;â€™.

</p><p>
Before continuing, I want to establish a couple of things.

</p><p>
First, the consistency argument is bunk.
The consistency argument in favour of Intel syntax is illustrated by the following example:

</p><blockquote>Putting the destination first is more consistent with other, higher-level languages like C.
<span>mov eax, ebx</span> is analogous to <span>eax = ebc</span>, and <span>add eax, ebx</span> to <span>eax += ebx</span>; in general, <span>op x, y</span> is analogous to <span>x op= y</span>.</blockquote>

				<p>Imagine you are handed this device and asked to get root on it as quickly as possible. No further information is given. Where would you begin? &nbsp;<em>(If you just want to see the router get rooted, jump down to "Mounting an Attack: Rooting a Home Router" ;-)</em></p>    <p><em>Our target: A <strong>VERY</strong> common/popular consumer Access Point.</em></p>  <p>Since you have the device in your hands, you might try directly attacking the hardware. However, if you've never done any kind of hardware hacking, getting started can be intimidating. In this post, we are going to talk about the fundamental information you need to know to use JTAG for hacking hardware. We'll also go over a quick example to illustrate the power of direct hardware access. ​</p>  <h2><u><span size="5" color="#3f3f3f"><strong>Why Do Manufacturers Use JTAG?</strong></span></u></h2>  <p><span></span><span><a href="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/boundary-scan-history_orig.png" rel="lightbox" onclick="if (!lightboxLoaded) return false"><img src="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/boundary-scan-history.png?241" alt="Picture"></a><span></span></span></p><p>​JTAG is a common hardware interface that provides your computer with a way to communicate directly with the chips on a board. It was originally developed by a consortium, the Joint (European) Test Access Group, in the mid-80s to address the increasing difficulty of testing printed circuit boards (PCBs). JTAG&nbsp;has been in widespread use ever since it was included in the Intel 80486 processor in 1990 and codified as IEEE 1491 that same year.&nbsp;Today JTAG is used for debugging, programming and testing on virtually ALL embedded devices.&nbsp;<br></p> <hr>    <p><span></span><span><a href="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/dfx-dft-ictdi-img01_orig.gif" rel="lightbox" onclick="if (!lightboxLoaded) return false"><img src="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/dfx-dft-ictdi-img01.gif?264" alt="Picture"></a><span></span></span></p><p><strong>Boundary Scanning</strong><br>With the invention of integrated circuits came the need to test physical interconnects. That is: test whether "Point A" on a circuit board correctly connects to "Point C". As industry drove toward higher density interconnects and finer pitch (i.e. smaller) components, a standardized way of testing integrated circuits (or "chips") was needed. By embedding the test logic within the IC itself and limiting the physical interface to just a few signals, JTAG/boundary-scan presented an elegant solution to testing, debugging, and diagnosing modern electronic systems.&nbsp;Simply stated, boundary Scanning allows you to read and write individual bits, on individual pins, of the individual chips on a board. This ability to read and write 1's and 0's directly onto the pins is extremely powerful, but widely misunderstood.&nbsp;</p> <hr>  <div><div><div> 	<table> 		<tbody> 			<tr> 				<td> 					 						  <p>​The JTAG interface gives manufacturers a way to test the physical connections between pins on a chip. When electrical engineers talk about using JTAG to "debug" a chip, they are talking about something very different than traditional software debugging.

These signals, and the small bit of silicon logic that connects and controls them, are collectively referred to as the Test Access Port, or TAP controller.</p></div> <hr>  <p><strong>The JTAG "Tower of Babel"</strong></p>  <div><p>One of the most confusing thing about learning to get hands-on with JTAG is how much partial and disinformation there is about it. Manufacturers' websites tell you the "theory" of how it works, but leave you longing for more information about "how to get started". To further confuse things there are other factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Buzzword</strong>:&nbsp;It is a infosec buzzword, everyone talks about it but few really share actionable info</li><li><strong>Loaded Word: </strong>JTAG has come to mean many things to many people. For example,&nbsp;in the gamer community "JTAG" means a hardware modification&nbsp;for a console that allows playing pirated games or loading homebrew content (i.e. "a <a href="http://hackaday.com/2009/10/20/freeboot-gives-the-xbox-360-jtag-hack-new-life/" target="_blank">jtagged&nbsp;XBox</a>"). This makes it difficult to search for useful information.</li><li><strong>Vernacular Overlap:</strong> As mentioned above, when an Electrical Engineer says "debug" he means: <em>"Are the pins in the right place?&nbsp;Is there enough power?&nbsp;Is the logic of the circuit correct?"</em> When a Software Engineer says "debug" he thinks of GDB or WinDBG. JTAG is designed for the former, not the latter.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Misunderstanding: </strong>As software developers the closest similarity&nbsp;to JTAG is maybe Kernel debugging via a debug cable (USB, Parallel, or Serial). But this is a dangerous comparison, because even on the "debugee" (in that scenario) there is software code executing on the remote system&nbsp;handling the translation of commands arriving on the debug cable. The JTAG state machine implemented&nbsp;entirely in hardware on the target.</li></ul></div>  <p><strong>What JTAG <u>ISN'T!</u></strong></p>  <div><p>In an effort to dispel disinformation (which is so rampant) here is what JTAG isn't.</p><ul><li><strong>The name of a specific device</strong> for debugging firmware or hardware</li><li><strong>The name of a piece of software</strong> used for debugging software code running on an embedded device.</li><li><strong>The name of a protocol:&nbsp;</strong>The JTAG specification doesnt even define the protocol for how data is passed between debugger and debugee (i.e. there is no .h file you can reference defining a "JTAG packet" to be passed over a serial, parallel, or USB cable to a target)</li><li><strong>The name of a kind of connector: </strong>Unlike a specification like USB or Ethernet, the&nbsp;JTAG specification doesn't even define what connectors should look like. This&nbsp;leads to a VERY confusing diversity of "JTAG" connectors. This is often a huge source of confusion&nbsp;to a software person.

In it's most fundamental. The JTAG specification 1149.1 requires these five signals:</p><ul><li><u><strong><span size="5">TCK</span></strong></u>: <strong>T</strong>est <strong>C</strong>loc<strong>k</strong><ul><li>The drummer, or metronome that dictates the speed of the TAP controller. Voltage on this pin simply pulses up and down in a rhythmic, steady beat. On every “beat” of the clock, the TAP controller takes a single action. The actual clock speed is not specified in the JTAG standard. The TAP controller accepts its speed from the outside device controlling JTAG.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><u><strong><span size="5">TMS</span></strong></u>: <strong>T</strong>est <strong>M</strong>ode <strong>S</strong>elect<ul><li>Voltages on the Mode Select pin control what action JTAG takes. By manipulating the voltage on this pin, you tell JTAG what you want it to do.</li></ul></li><li><u><strong><span size="5">TDI</span></strong></u>: <strong>T</strong>est <strong>D</strong>ata-<strong>I</strong>n<ul><li>The pin that feeds data into the chip. The JTAG standard does not define protocols for communication over this pin. That is left up to the manufacturer. As far as JTAG is concerned, this pin is simply an ingress method for 1s and 0s to get into the chip. What the chip does with them is irrelevant to JTAG.</li></ul></li><li><u><strong><span size="5">TDO</span></strong></u>: <strong>T</strong>est <strong>D</strong>ata-<strong>O</strong>ut<ul><li>The pin for data coming out of the chip. Like the Data-In pin, communication protocols are not defined by JTAG.</li></ul></li><li><u><strong><span size="5">TRST</span></strong></u>: &nbsp;<strong>T</strong>est <strong>R</strong>e<strong>s</strong>e<strong>t&nbsp;</strong><span>(Optional)</span><ul><li>This optional signal is used to reset JTAG to a known good state, we'll explain why this is optional in a few paragraphs.</li></ul></li></ul></div>  <p>Now that we know what pins/signals are really defined as "JTAG" let's take a second look at the sample of connectors from above:</p>  <div><div> <p><a href="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/screen-shot-2016-09-21-at-12-18-26-am_orig.png" rel="lightbox" onclick="if (!lightboxLoaded) return false"> <img src="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/screen-shot-2016-09-21-at-12-18-26-am_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p><p>Ah hah! We now see that each of these connectors have JTAG related signals!</p> </div></div>  <p><span>We now see that what <strong>makes these connectors "JTAG" is not their pin configurations,</strong> but rather the mere presence of these JTAG signals.

The State controller diagram is in the upper left of the video below. By manipulating the voltage on the TMS pin of the TAP controller and the TCK pin, you control the way the State Machine changes state. On each beat of the clock, the JTAG TAP controller in your targeted device checks if there is voltage on the TMS pin, and interprets that as either a 1 (voltage) or a 0 (no voltage). This series of 1’s and 0’s moves JTAG through a relatively simple State Machine. This state machine is so simple that you can <a href="http://hackaday.com/2013/08/31/learn-jtag-by-writing-a-bit-banging-programmer/" target="_blank">even write Arduino code to manipulate it</a>.

      <p><span>Eurus:</span> In our group discussion, you demonstrated that the concept of a bee is not fundamental; individual bees may be similar, but there is no inherent bee-essence. One may say, “bee-essence is the ability to reproduce bees.” However, you showed how gradual evolutionary change refutes this argument. “Consider an ancient bee that, if alive, could reproduce with a modern bee. Now consider an even more ancient bee that can reproduce with the ancient bee but not with the modern bee. Does the ancient bee have two essences, one to reproduce with the modern bee and another to reproduce with the more ancient bee?”</p>

<p>Your conceptual deconstructions remind me of śūnyatā, or emptiness, a tenet of the Madhyamaka Buddhist tradition. Śūnyatā says that nothing has svabhāva—essence, inherent existence, or true identity.</p>

<p><span>Dijon:</span> Thanks for sharing. I’d like to learn more about śūnyatā because it seems to me that there must be some fundamental things, perhaps particles, that inherently exist. If this weren’t the case, then how could anything exist? Said another way, although I think our minds project the <em>concept of a bee</em> onto an external reality, I still think there are aggregates of fundamentally existing things which we call bees.</p>

<p><span>Eurus:</span> Before I continue, I should point out that I’m not especially well-acquainted with Madhyamaka thought, so my comments may not be precisely correct.</p>

<p><span>Dijon:</span> I appreciate that you are willing to engage with me on these essential questions, even if you aren’t entirely sure of your own beliefs. Please continue!</p>

<p><span>Eurus:</span> Śūnyatā doesn’t say that nothing exists, but only that nothing has svabhāva—essence, inherent existence, or true identity. Śūnyatā is closely related to dependent origination, or pratītyasamutpāda. According to this doctrine, all phenomena arise in dependence upon other phenomena, which themselves arise in dependence upon other phenomena. Dependent origination leads to śūnyatā because phenomena can’t exist independently. Things do exist <em>conventionally</em>, similar to how Theseus’s ship exists conventionally. The error is to think that anything exists in-and-of-itself.</p>

<p>Nāgārjuna, who founded the Madhyamaka Buddhist school, summarizes this in a famous verse of his <em>Mūlamadhyamakakārikā</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whatever is dependently co-arisen</p>
<p>That is explained to be emptiness.</p>
<p>That, being a dependent designation</p>
<p>Is itself the middle way.</p>

<p>Something that is not dependently arisen,</p>
<p>Such a thing does not exist.</p>
<p>Therefore a thing with svabhāva</p>
<p>Does not exist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You say that particles exist in-and-of-themselves. While we can come up with a scientific theory with constructs like particles or wave functions at the bottom, I do not believe that science itself supposes these constructs have svabhāva. This would be true even if we found the correct theory of everything. For example, it seems tenuous to claim that wave functions fundamentally exist. To the physicist, a wave function is a mathematical tool that describes our observations. To say more is to go beyond what empirical science can support.</p>

<p><span>Dijon:</span> I think I’m using the term <em>fundamentally exist</em> differently than you’re using <em>svabhāva</em>. When I say something fundamentally exists, I mean it influences reality, and it can’t be broken into smaller pieces. Accordingly, if a wave function completely describes the behaviors we observe and can’t be replaced by a simpler construct, then I would say it fundamentally exists.</p>

<p><span>Eurus:</span> What does it mean to say something “influences reality” or that something “can’t be broken into smaller pieces”? Our discussion reminds me of a passage in <em>The Feynman Lectures</em> about the philosophical implications of quantum mechanics that may be helpful. I’ll read it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another thing that people have emphasized since quantum mechanics was developed is the idea that we should not speak about those things which we cannot measure. Unless a thing can be defined by measurement, it has no place in a theory. And since an accurate value of the momentum of a localized particle cannot be defined by measurement it therefore has no place in the theory.</p>
<p>The idea that this is what was the matter with classical theory is a false position. It is a careless analysis of the situation. Just because we cannot measure position and momentum precisely does not a priori mean that we cannot talk about them. It only means that we need not talk about them. The situation in the sciences is this: A concept or an idea which cannot be measured or cannot be referred directly to experiment may or may not be useful. It need not exist in a theory. In other words, suppose we compare the classical theory of the world with the quantum theory of the world, and suppose that it is true experimentally that we can measure position and momentum only imprecisely. The question is whether the ideas of the exact position of a particle and the exact momentum of a particle are valid or not. The classical theory admits the ideas; the quantum theory does not. This does not in itself mean that classical physics is wrong.</p>
<p>When the new quantum mechanics was discovered, the classical people—which included everybody except Heisenberg, Schrödinger, and Born—said: “Look, your theory is not any good because you cannot answer certain questions like: what is the exact position of a particle?, which hole does it go through?, and some others.” Heisenberg’s answer was: “I do not need to answer such questions because you cannot ask such a question experimentally.” It is that we do not have to. Consider two theories (a) and (b); (a) contains an idea that cannot be checked directly but which is used in the analysis, and the other, (b), does not contain the idea. If they disagree in their predictions, one could not claim that (b) is false because it cannot explain this idea that is in (a), because that idea is one of the things that cannot be checked directly.</p>
<p>It is always good to know which ideas cannot be checked directly, but it is not necessary to remove them all. It is not true that we can pursue science completely by using only those concepts which are directly subject to experiment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span>Dijon:</span> The ideas in this passage can indeed improve my definition: Let’s say something <em>fundamentally exists</em> if it is an irreducible construct in a theory that explains all our empirical observations.</p>

<p><span>Eurus:</span> Your second definition is better, but what does it mean to be “irreducible”? Quantum mechanics can be formulated in several different ways. Are constructs that are only present in some formulation irreducible? Could such a construct, especially if it can’t be directly measured, be said to exist in any normal sense of the word? They seem more like mathematical machinery to me.</p>

<p><span>Dijon:</span> Such constructs do <em>feel</em> like mathematical machinery. But how could it be otherwise? If the universe consists of small and simple particles and eyes are large and complex aggregates of particles, then eyes would necessarily not be able to see particles. If we also assume that the universe is ordered, then particles would follow mathematical laws and would be indirectly-known mathematical machinery.</p>

<p><span>Eurus:</span> Are you sure an eye <em>necessarily</em> couldn’t see a single particle? In our universe, human eyes can detect individual photons.</p>

<p><span>Dijon:</span> It can, in special circumstances. However, given that the eye and the brain require an immense number of particles to detect a single photon, they couldn’t operate at the scale of the particles. It would be too much information.</p>

<p><span>Eurus:</span> Couldn’t an eye see a focus down on a small number of particles? I’m not sure I see your point.</p>

<p><span>Dijon:</span> It’s not clear to me either, so I’ll give another example: Imagine a universe consisting of mind as well as particles. Sight is a fundamental property of mind, thus mind can see particles directly. It would be as if our vision was pixelated, and the laws of physics appeared to operate on pixels. Even in this universe, how would minds know they were seeing the things-in-themselves? How could they know they hit bottom?</p>

<p>Perhaps the mathematical machinery is the thing-in-itself. The existence of multiple formulations doesn’t seem to disprove this; information can always be represented in several ways—certainly, a grid of pixels can be.</p>

<p>The physicist studying the laws of nature is in the same situation as the programmer reverse-engineering a software libraries’ interface without access to the implementation. If the implementation acts in a consistent way, then with enough effort, we may be able to perfectly understand and describe the interface. We could predict how it would work in future situations. However, we would have no way of knowing anything about the software library besides its observable behavior. We could hypothesize about how it is implemented—what the particles are in-and-of-themselves—but we would have no way of validating the hypotheses.</p>

<p>Therefore, I agree empirical science can’t say anything about the thing-in-itself. However, if to have svabhāva means something different than to fundamentally exist, then by definition, it is a property of the thing-in-itself that is beyond the reach of science.</p>

<p>This doesn’t mean there <em>aren’t</em> things-in-themselves below the mathematical machinery or that svabhāva is a meaningless term. If we spoke about the sensation of blue to a citizen of a blueless universe, they wouldn’t know what we mean—but that doesn’t mean blue isn’t a valid concept. But it does mean we would require divine revelation to know whether anything has svabhāva. In our software analogy, divine revelation is like the library’s author telling us unobservable implementation details.</p>

<p><span>Eurus:</span> You make some interesting points. You’ve defined <em>fundamentally exist</em> to ensure that empirical science can verify it. I agree, according to this definition, that wave functions fundamentally exist. I don’t think it follows, however, that wave functions have svabhāva.</p>

<p>How is svabhāva different than your term <em>fundamentally exist</em>? The most important …</p></div></div>

<p>This post is a manifesto for a very simple idea: <strong>the phrase “open access” should be replaced with “free publishing”</strong>. I am asking you, the reader, to make this change. The rest of this post will try to explain why.</p>



<p>The fundamental reason is that <strong>the phrase “open access” has already been compromised</strong> through contact with corporate interests that are not in the interest of science. The fact that extra adjectives such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access#Diamond/platinum_OA">diamond </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access#Colour_naming_system">open access, platinum open access</a> and <a href="https://www.fairopenaccess.org/faq/#Fair">fair open access</a> are required shows that the words “open access” have lost their useful meaning. The pledge that I am a signatory of, <a href="https://nofreeviewnoreview.org/faq">No Free View? No Review!</a>, does not consider gold open access and other hybrid models to count as true open access.</p>



<p>Open access is named by analogy with open source software. (At least I assume it is – I haven’t found any actual evidence for that claim.) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source#Origins">Open source software was born</a> as a wing of the older <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_movement">free software movement</a>, which was strongly associated with a relatively extreme philosophy of people like Richard Stallman. Free software is codified as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Free_Software_Definition#The_Four_Essential_Freedoms_of_Free_Software">four essential freedoms</a>. The double meaning of the English word “free” is intentional, but free software is more fundamentally about free-as-in-libre than free-as-in-beer (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre">gratis vs libre</a>).</p>



<p>Open source software was both a re-branding of free software and a philosophically different approach to it, both with the goal of making it more palatable to businesses. This was a spectacularly successful move, and open source software is now a major part of the strategy of many businesses big and small.</p>



<p>My proposal is that we equally deliberately take the opposite step: from open access publishing to free publishing, and for the opposite reason: to make academic publishing as unappealing as possible to businesses.</p>



<p>Open access is, fundamentally, about making articles free to read, and in this it has been a complete success. There are two distinct reasons for wanting to make articles free to read: reducing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cost_of_Knowledge">spiralling cost to run an academic library</a>, and to make the research available to independent scholars and the general public. (This second reason is particularly important in medical science, but also applies to every subject to a lesser extent.)</p>



<p>If research is free to read, where does an academic publisher make their money? The answer is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_processing_charge">article processing charges</a> (APCs), or “pay to publish”. <a href="https://www.nature.com/ncomms/">Nature Communications</a>, for example, is an open access journal with a cost to publish of <a href="https://www.nature.com/ncomms/about/article-processing-charges">US$ 5560 plus VAT</a> per paper. This is unusually high, with US$ 3000 per paper being more typical.</p>



<p>Of course academics usually don’t pay the APC themselves – their institution covers the cost. This is just moving money around, since previously the institution was paying the cost to read. And similarly for independent scholars, they now have to pay to publish instead of pay to read. In either case, I imagine that APCs have been set by publishers in order to keep their income roughly similar (or increase it, if I’m being <s>cynical</s> realistic), so the actual cost to institutions and independent scholars would not significantly change.</p>



<p>Of course I am not naive, and I know that publishing costs money. Tim Gowers, who founded the free journal <a href="https://advances-in-combinatorics.scholasticahq.com/">Advances in Combinatorics</a>, wrote in <a href="https://gowers.wordpress.com/2018/06/04/a-new-journal-in-combinatorics/">this great blog post</a> (one that I come back to repeatedly) that “the total cost of running a new journal that isn’t too large is of the order of <strong>a few hundred dollars per year</strong>, as long as nobody is paid for what they do”. This money typically comes from grants and philanthropists.</p>



<p>A shining example of a free journal is <a href="http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/">Theory and Applications of Categories</a>, which has been both free to read and free to publish since 1995. <a href="https://compositionality-journal.org/">Compositionality</a>, a new free journal that I’m on the editorial board of, is funded by a philanthropist, with Gowers’ estimate being the right order of magnitude for its costs. It is clear that a free journal must be very lean indeed, but there are multiple examples showing that it is very much possible.</p>



<p>I have not yet said clearly what the definition of “free publishing” should even be. This is because I’d rather let the community decide. The baseline minimum is that to qualify as free publishing it must be both free to read and free to publish, both for the reader/author and for their institution. So free publishing may be defined to be the same thing as diamond open access.</p>



<p>Perhaps free publishing should be stricter still. One possibility is to require the use of a license such as <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/">CC BY-ND</a>, where the author grants certain permissions to others such as the right to host copies of the paper. Notably the <a href="https://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/license.html">arXiv default license</a> would not qualify for this. Another possibility would be an “independence” condition where the journal may not share an owner with a non-free journal. The <a href="https://www.fairopenaccess.org/faq/#Fair">fair open access</a> movement require community ownership of journals, strictly ruling out for-profit publishers.</p>



<p>Personally my view is that these more restrictive conditions would have more marginal benefits, and would risk dividing opinion and distracting attention from the most important issues. Thus while free software considers free-as-in-freedom to be more important than free-as-in-beer, free publishing would be the other way round. This is not unreasonable, since the nature of software and publications are very different. There is definitely a reasonable debate to be had here, though.</p>



<p>All of these are details. My central point remains: the phrase “open access” is no longer useful and should be avoided. The phrase “free publishing”, which is surely harder to corrupt into a different meaning, should be preferred and protected from a similar fate.</p>

<p>
Navigating codebases of any meaningful size is difficult. Most of a programmer’s time is spent jumping through the codebase, reading or skimming to build a mental model of the constructs and conventions within it. These constructs — among them: the DSLs, interfaces, and taxonomy of types that exist — are arguably the most important precursor to understanding where and how to make changes. But these constructs only exist in programmers’ heads. It’s difficult or impossible to navigate most codebases through the lens of those constructs; programmers lack “code browsers” that present the underlying code independently of files and the filesystem hierarchy. Yet code browsers that can do so — and we’ll look at some examples below — would be incredibly useful. This is because instances of these constructs can be thought of as records in a database, albeit an ad-hoc, poorly-specified database that can only be queried through carefully-crafted regexes<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote">1</a>.</p>
<p>
In simple cases, some constructs manifest as naming conventions: prefixes in a name may be a rudimentary way to namespace classes<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote">2</a>, while suffixes may be a rudimentary way to group classes or identify their type<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote">3</a>. But these are easy examples; many patterns are much more subtle.</p>
<h2>
“Where is this used?”</h2>
<p>
Imagine figuring out “where is this used?”, for various types of “this”:</p>
<p>
Most code editors (perhaps paired with a <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">language server</a>) can show you where local variables are used. This usually also works for finding where methods are invoked — although perhaps less reliably in dynamic-dispatch languages, or languages without types.</p>
<p>
What if you want to find where instances of a particular model get created? There may be multiple ways to create a model, so this isn’t super simple. In Rails, for example, there’s two built-in ways to create a model: you can either call <code>.new</code> to create a new instance in memory followed by <code>.save</code> to persist it to the database, or call <code>.create</code> to automatically do both. Your particular codebase might have additional wrappers for doing this that you’re supposed to use. Even worse, imagine that sometimes you create a <code>.new</code> instance, then set some properties on it over the next few lines, then finally call <code>.save</code>. Something like this:</p>
<pre><code>user = User.new
user.email = '<a href="https://feifan.blog/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="97fff2fbfbf8d7f2eff6fae7fbf2b9f4f8fa">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>' unless self.anonymous?
user.save</code></pre>
<p>
Conceptually, that’s still code that creates an instance of a particular model. But with the intervening syntax, this would be a difficult case to find with <code>grep</code>.</p>
<h2>
Static config</h2>
<p>
At <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, where I work, we have a lot of code for jobs that need to run at certain times each day. For example, we might need to move funds from one financial partner to another at noon UTC each day. Each of these jobs has configuration code describing when and how it should be run, implemented as a <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/concepts/domain-specific-languages/">DSL</a>. This config might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>run_config RunConfig.new(
  job_name: 'partner-daily-funding',
  env_vars: self.config_env,
  cron: RunConfig::Cron.new(
    schedule: { hour: 12, minute: 0 }
  ),
  owning_team: Company::Team::Liquidity
)</code></pre>
<p>
In our codebase, we have hundreds of these jobs, each with their own <code>run_config</code>. If you look at this codebase as a database, you can imagine these jobs being rows in a <code>jobs</code> table, where the fields on each row correspond to the parameters provided to the <code>RunConfig</code> class. </p>
<p>
Wouldn’t it be great to be able to browse all these jobs in a table? Maybe you could perform some basic operations on this data: searching for specific jobs by name or owning team; sorting by the time-of-day they’re scheduled to run; filtering for jobs owned by your team that have errored in the past week. Maybe you could edit the <code>run_config</code> from that interface (like you might edit a spreadsheet) and have it automatically make the corresponding change in the source code (or open a PR). Maybe you could even compute some aggregations on this data — for example, if you’re introducing a new job that requires some expensive computation, maybe you’d like to know which hours have the fewest other jobs scheduled. And of course, this job browser should be bidirectional with respect to the codebase — there should be a button beside each entry that shows the code for the job inline or opens the corresponding code in your editor.</p>
<h2>
Diffused concepts</h2>
<p>
Codebases typically contain logical concepts that are implemented across multiple pieces of code. This is often the case when you need to create multiple files to implement a particular feature.</p>
<p>
For example, in Rails, a “resource” is collectively implemented across a line in the router, a model file, a controller file, and a bunch of view files. Rails even ships with a code generator to <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/5f3ff60084ab5d5921ca3499814e4697f8350ee7/railties/lib/rails/generators/rails/resource/USAGE">create some of these files</a> for you. But despite resources being a core concept when working with Rails, there’s no good way to browse the resources in your codebase<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote">4</a>. There’s no good way to filter or query your codebase either — you can’t, for example, see which resources support JSON vs XML params. </p>
<p>
For another example, consider pubsub (aka emitter-consumer) pipelines. In web services, when you have processing that can happen “in the background”, one service will publish an event; another service subscribes to that event and will do the background processing on its own when it receives the event. Often, these will form event “pipelines” or trees where an event consumer will emit additional events that are consumed by yet other services. These pipelines are concepts that developers talk about (as in, the “account creation pipeline” or “funding reconciliation pipeline”), but in most codebases the pipeline itself isn’t declared or reified anywhere in the code.</p>
<p>
If you’re looking at code that emits an event, how do you find the consumers? If you’re lucky, the event has a unique, literal name and the consumer uses that name literally as well. But maybe some subscribers are using wildcard event names, or names generated by string concatenation, and that becomes a lot harder to grep for. Likewise, if you’re looking at a consumer of an event, how do you find the locations in the codebase that could emit that event<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote">5</a>?</p>
<p>
Wouldn’t it be great to be able to browse those pipelines in a table or perhaps a directed graph<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote">6</a>? Maybe that graph would support some basic operations on this data: searching for specific publishers or subscribers by class name or event name; filtering for pipelines that have run into errors; maybe even showing the flow of a particular event given an event ID<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote">7</a>. And of course, this pipeline browser should be bidirectional with respect to the codebase — there should be a button beside each graph node that shows the code for the publisher or subscriber inline or opens the corresponding code in your editor.</p>
<p>
For a final example, consider code that has functionality inherited from elsewhere. Some environments let you see a <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/viewing-structure-of-a-source-file.html">list of inherited properties</a> or methods, but this isn’t possible for more specialized cases. At Stripe, we have code that implements shell scripts that can take command-line arguments and flags. These arguments are defined via a DSL in the implementing code, but these commands can be subclassed, and there’s no way to see what the available arguments are while working in the subclass.</p>
<h2>
Philosophy</h2>
<p>
I think it’s important to consider these problems not as disparate cases in need of bespoke tooling, but as a <em>class</em> of problems characterized by a lack of access to the data structures embedded within codebases. Just like SQL databases and spreadsheets provide a singular querying abstraction and a set of visualization primitives that can be applied to any kind of data, programming environments need a singular querying abstraction and set of visualization primitives that can be applied to the concepts lurking in codebases. Getting there does <em>not</em> mean using proprietary drag-and-drop visual programming interfaces where the introspection capabilities are limited to whatever the programming environment happens to have implemented. Just the opposite — you should still be able to do whatever you want with your code (including treating it as plain-text files), <em>and also</em> have access to more advanced introspection tools that can query and slice your code — tools that let you easily understand and navigate complex codebases to reduce the <em>incidental complexity</em> of building software.</p>
<h2>
Solutions</h2>
<p>
I don’t have a solution to sell you here (at least, not yet!). But <a href="https://twitter.com/hirday_g/status/1356657607381946369">by popular demand</a> I think it’s worthwhile to at least discuss principles that solutions should embody and directionally-related prior art. </p>
<p>
To start with a simple example, see <a href="https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/">IHP</a>, a full-stack web framework similar to Rails. It comes with a web interface for manipulating your project’s codebase and database schema. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbDtS_mUMpI?t=102">One point in the introduction video</a> showed changes being made in the visual schema editor being automatically reflected in the SQL code that describes the database schema — and changes being made to the SQL code being bidirectionally reflected in the visual schema editor. </p>

For a more in-depth example, consider <a href="https://pharo.org/">Pharo</a>, a Smalltalk environment. “Environment” in this case means that it feels like you’re using a custom OS (including global menus, idioms, and keyboard and mouse conventions) designed specifically for browsing, writing, and debugging programs in the Smalltalk programming language<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote">8</a>. The holistic integration of these tools is important. Unlike the programming environments we cobble for ourselves today — where the editor is agnostic of the language and runtime and other tools like debuggers, inspectors, and code browsers are tacked on (if they exist at all) — it’s worth thinking about what an entire computing experience <em>for</em> writing and building custom tools might look like<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote">9</a>.</p>

Pharo is also interesting because of its Class Browser, which looks like this:</p>

<p>In late 2020, a coalition of predatory, money-losing, private-equity backed companies ran a $200m disinformation campaign that resulted in the passage of California's Prop 22, legalizing worker misclassification and mass-scale labor law violations.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/14/final_ver2/#prop-22">https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/14/final_ver2/#prop-22</a></p>
<p>Almost immediately, the passage of Prop 22 led to the loss of unionized jobs paying a living wage and offering basic worker protections, especially for people of color – only to have them replaced by "gig work" that lacked any of the above.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/05/manorialism-feudalism-cycle/#prop22">https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/05/manorialism-feudalism-cycle/#prop22</a></p>
<p>One of the primary funders – and beneficiaries – of Prop 22 was Uber, which pioneered worker misclassification. Uber is now pushing the EU to "harmonize" its regulations in a game of transatlantic pingpong where each volley makes things worse.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/15/uber-proposes-california-style-gig-work-reforms-in-europe.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/15/uber-proposes-california-style-gig-work-reforms-in-europe.html</a></p>
<p>The irony? Uber is a "bezzle" – JK Galbraith's name for "the magic interval when a confidence trickster knows he has the money he has appropriated but the victim does not yet understand that he has lost it." Uber is a scam and it will never be profitable.</p>
<p>Uber is a product of Softbank, the Saudi-backed Japanese investment fund that has $100b to spend on helping the Saudi royals find a revenue stream to replace oil. Softbank is a pioneer of accounting frauds that make stupid businesses look profitable.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/19/larval-pegasi/#long-con">https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/19/larval-pegasi/#long-con</a></p>
<p>From Wework to Uber to Doordash and beyond, Softbank makes two kinds of bets: first, that they can achieve a monopoly by doing illegal or quasi-illegal things so quickly that they become faits accompli before they get shut down.</p>
<p>And second, that the companies that fail to achieve a monopoly can be unloaded on suckers ("investors") who assume that a money-losing company that has been around for a decade or more must have a path to profitability ("a pile of shit this big <em>must</em> have a pony under it!").</p>
<p>Uber will never, ever be profitable. The company admitted as much on its S1 IPO filing, where it said that profitability depended on every public transit system in the world being replaced with Uber. The company lost <em>$4b</em> in the first half of 2020,</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/10/folksy-monopolists/#bezzled">https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/10/folksy-monopolists/#bezzled</a></p>
<p>If you think the first half of 2020 was bad, you should see the second half of 2020: <em>Uber lost $6.8b more!</em> As usual, transportation analyst Hubert Horan has the absolute best context on the company's haemorrhagic losses.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2021/02/hubert-horan-can-uber-ever-deliver-part-twenty-four-uber-loses-another-6-8-billion.html">https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2021/02/hubert-horan-can-uber-ever-deliver-part-twenty-four-uber-loses-another-6-8-billion.html</a></p>
<p>He points out that things are even worse than they seem for Uber. For many years, the pony-under-all-this-shit show required that Uber spend billions on the doomed pretense that they would someday replace drivers with autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>$2.5B later, Uber's "self-driving" cars could go a whopping <em>0.25 miles</em> before crashing. They had to <em>pay</em> someone $400m to take the division off their hands. Even so, ditching the business-unit produced a gain for Uber's H2-2020 balance-sheet.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/08/required-reading/#goober">https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/08/required-reading/#goober</a></p>
<p>Now, Uber <em>did</em> experience massive growth in H2-2020, in their food delivery division. However, that growth led to massive losses for them, because every delivery loses the company money, by design (more expensive pony-under-the-pile theatrics):</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/18/code-is-speech/#schadenpizza">https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/18/code-is-speech/#schadenpizza</a></p>
<p>But Uber's food delivery long con doesn't just victimize its investors: the primary harms accrue to the restaurants the company nonconsensually opts into its delivery services (with help from Google), draining them until they collapse.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/19/we-are-beautiful/#man-in-the-middle">https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/19/we-are-beautiful/#man-in-the-middle</a></p>
<p>Uber claims that it is just consuming every beloved restaurant in the world in order to attain liftoff for "ghost kitchens" – literally shipping containers stuffed with precarious chefs <em>paying</em> to cook in unsafe working conditions.</p>
<p>This is what we mean when we talk about "financialization." Uber is a finance shell-game, one that can only be sustained by the destruction of all public transit, all restaurants, basic worker protections and the minimum wage.</p>
<p>And once it has taken that brutal toll on workers and the real economy, once it has fleeced the last investor lured into paying to excavate a little more of the pile of shit, it will collapse.</p>
<p>You can't lost $10b/year forever. $10b here, $10b there, pretty soon you're talking real money.</p>

<p>Ring – Amazon's surveillance doorbell division – has 4,000 "partnerships" with US police ("public safety") orgs. The company has lied about how these work for years, but the basic deal is that they give cops free stuff to buzz-market their products.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/j5wyjy/amazon-told-police-it-has-partnered-with-200-law-enforcement-agencies">https://www.vice.com/en/article/j5wyjy/amazon-told-police-it-has-partnered-with-200-law-enforcement-agencies</a></p>
<p>Ring tells its customers that they get to choose whether to share the footage from their street-facing cameras with cops, but that's a lie, too. If you say no, the cops still get to look through your camera.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/43kga3/amazon-is-coaching-cops-on-how-to-obtain-surveillance-footage-without-a-warrant">https://www.vice.com/en/article/43kga3/amazon-is-coaching-cops-on-how-to-obtain-surveillance-footage-without-a-warrant</a></p>
<p>That's why cops debase themselves to serve as buzz-marketers for Ring – in exchange, they get an off-the-books, free-to-use, warrantless, city-scale, video surveillance grid.</p>
<p>It's an investment that pays off. Back in July, EFF documented how the San Francisco Police Department was able to commandeer 200 Avigilon cameras to produce surveillance data on BLM protesters:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/san-francisco-police-accessed-business-district-camera-network-spy-protestors">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/san-francisco-police-accessed-business-district-camera-network-spy-protestors</a></p>
<p>And in a new blockbuster report, EFF's Dave Maass and Matthew Guariglia document how the LAPD did the same thing, fraudulently using "unusual occurance" protocols to gain access to last summer's BLM protests.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/02/lapd-requested-ring-footage-black-lives-matter-protests">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/02/lapd-requested-ring-footage-black-lives-matter-protests</a></p>
<p>Ring has a terrible track record, kicking off its marketing by sending out deceptive news-bulletins to convince people that they lived in high-crime areas and needed its products:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/amazon-owned-ring-wants-report-crime-news/588394/">https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/amazon-owned-ring-wants-report-crime-news/588394/</a></p>
<p>They lied about their facial recognition program:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/amazon-ring-facial-recognition-ukraine">https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/amazon-ring-facial-recognition-ukraine</a></p>
<p>A program that included a plan to make "watch lists" of people who'd be tracked from camera to camera:</p>

<p>Far from keeping its customers safe, Ring exposed them to real harm, leaking their home addresses:</p>
<p><a href="https://gizmodo.com/ring-s-hidden-data-let-us-map-amazons-sprawling-home-su-1840312279">https://gizmodo.com/ring-s-hidden-data-let-us-map-amazons-sprawling-home-su-1840312279</a></p>
<p>Allowing third parties to hack their cameras, spy on them, and scream abuse at them:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3bbq4/podcast-livestreams-hacked-ring-cameras-nulledcast">https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3bbq4/podcast-livestreams-hacked-ring-cameras-nulledcast</a></p>
<p>Not just hackers, either! Multiple Ring employees got caught spying on Ring owners and their families, including their children:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3mdvk/ring-fired-employees-abusing-video-data">https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3mdvk/ring-fired-employees-abusing-video-data</a></p>
<p>As Maass and Guariglia point out, Ring made some improvements to user privacy over the past year, adding end-to-end encryption. But at the same time, Ring has cemented its relationship with American police forces, leading to far more police requests for Ring owners' footage.</p>
<p>These "requests" start to feel a lot more like coercion, and, as with other coercive law-enforcement requests, "like police 'asking' to search your phone during a traffic stop," they should be bound by strict limits.</p>
<p>EFF proposes four rules for coercive electronic searches:</p>
<p>I. Requests must be specific, targeting a particular time and place where there is reasonable suspicion that crime has happened (rather than general requests)</p>
<p>II. Police must collect and publish statistics about their consent searches of electronic devices, to deter and detect racial profiling</p>
<p>III. Police and reviewing courts must narrowly construe the scope of a person’s consent to search their device.</p>
<p>IV. Before an officer attempts to acquire footage from a person’s Ring camera, the officer must notify the person of their legal right to refuse.</p>
<p>The public-private surveillance partnership between Ring and the cops epitomizes the paradox of the American privacy debate.</p>
<p>When I talk to military, intelligence and government audiences about surveillance, they say, "Look, Uncle Sam already knows everything about me, but those scumbags in Silicon Valley would sell their mothers for a nickel."</p>
<p>And when I talk to tech audiences, they say, "Google just wants to show me better ads, big deal. But cops and spooks? They're the thickwitted sociopaths who were too stupid to get a job at a tech company. No <em>way</em> I want them spying on me."</p>
<p>But the reason companies like Ring are allowed to conduct such indiscriminate surveillance (a one mile walk in DC puts you under the gaze of 13 Ring cameras!) is that governments are wholly dependent on requisitioning their footage.</p>
<p>Rather than warning people about the dangers of Ring cameras – or agitating for ordinances banning them – cops served as street-teams marketing Ring's products. Private surveillance depends on government complicity, and spying governments depend on private surveillance.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>An interesting issue around using <code>is</code> with a literal in Python</h2>

	<p><small>February 12, 2021</small></p>
</div><div><p>For reasons outside of the scope of this entry, I recently installed
Ubuntu's package (for Ubuntu 20.04) of the Python <a href="https://github.com/drkjam/netaddr/">netaddr</a> on a system of ours. When I did,
I got an interesting Python warning that I hadn't seen before:</p>


<blockquote><pre>SyntaxWarning: "is not" with a literal. Did you mean "!="?
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>I was curious enough to look up the code in question, which boils
down to something that looked like this:</p>

<blockquote><pre>def int_to_bits(int_val, word_size, num_words, word_sep=''):
    [...]
    if word_sep is not '':
        [...]
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/netaddr/netaddr/blob/master/netaddr/strategy/__init__.py#L163">The current code</a>
replaces this with a '<code>!=</code>' comparison, which is what the other
similar code in that file uses. Ubuntu being Ubuntu, they will
probably never update or fix the 20.04 'python3-netaddr' package.)</p>

<p>The intention of this code is clear; it wants to check if you supplied
your own word_sep argument. On the one hand, using '<code>is not</code>'
here is not the correct thing to do. When you use '<code>is not</code>' this way
you need to have a sentinel object, not a sentinel value, and this
code uses the value <code>''</code>, the empty string. On the other hand, this
code actually works, for at least three reasons. One of them might be
slightly surprising.</p>

<p>The first reason the code works is mechanical, because I left out
the body of the <code>if</code> and the rest of the code that actually uses
word_sep. Here is the almost full code:</p>

<blockquote><pre>if word_sep is not '':
   if not _is_str(word_sep):
       raise ValueError(...)

return word_sep.join(bit_words)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>So the only thing the code does differently if it thinks that it has a
non-default word_sep is check that it really is a string.  Since the
empty string passes that check, everything is fine. Given this, the <code>if</code>
isn't all that necessary; you could just as well always check to see
that word_sep is a string. However this first reason is specific
to the code itself.</p>

<p>The second and third reasons are general, and would happen regardless
of what use the code made of word_sep and what it did in the <code>if</code>.
I'll start by presenting the second reason in illustrated form:</p>

<blockquote><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; def a(b=''):
...   return b is not ''
...
&lt;stdin&gt;:2: SyntaxWarning: "is not" with a literal. Did you mean "!="?
&gt;&gt;&gt; a()
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; a(b='')
False
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>In CPython, a number of specific strings and other (immutable)
values are what is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interning">interned</a>. Regardless of
how many times they're used in different places all over your Python
code, there's only ever one instance of these values. For instance,
there is only one instance of an empty tuple, '<code>()</code>', and only one
instance of many small integers. Integers are especially useful to
illustrate this vividly, because you can manipulate current ones
to create new values:</p>

<blockquote><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 10
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = 5
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = 4
&gt;&gt;&gt; (b+c+1) is a
True
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>If you change <code>a</code> to be 300 and <code>b</code> to be 295, this will be <code>False</code>
(as of Python 3.8.7).</p>

<p>The empty string, <code>''</code>, is one of those interned (string) values. All
copies of the empty string are the same objects, regardless of where
they come from. Because they're the same object, you can use '<code>is not</code>'
(and '<code>is</code>') to compare values to them and it will always work. This is
of course not guaranteed by the language specification or by CPython,
but it's such a fundamental optimization that it would be very unusual
if it ever stopped being the case. Still, you should use '<code>!=</code>' and not
be so tricky.</p>

<p>The third reason is best presented in illustrated form again:</p>

<blockquote><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; def a(b=3000):
...    return b is 3000
[...]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a()
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; a(b=3000)
False
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This is another CPython optimization, but it's an optimization
within a single function. When CPython is generating the bytecode
for a function it's smart enough to only keep one copy of every
constant value, and this merging of constants includes the default
arguments. So within the <code>a</code> function, the integer '3000' of the
<code>b</code> default value and the integer literal '3000' from the code are
the same object and '<code>is</code>' will tell you this. However, an integer
of '3000' that comes from the outside is a different object (since
3000 is a large enough integer that Python doesn't intern it).</p>

<p>This optimization is probably going to stay in CPython, but I would
strongly suggest that you not take advantage of it in your code. Just do
as the warning says and don't use '<code>is</code>' or '<code>is not</code>' on literals. The
very slight performance improvement you might get from exploiting this
isn't worth the confusion you're going to create.</p>

<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>There are many ways to celebrate Black History Month. Learning about amazing Black figures in American history. <a href="https://www.purpose.jobs/blog/lessons-virtual-panel-diversity-inclusion?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=community" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Discussing solutions to problems in diversity, equity and inclusion at the office</span></a>. Reading stories written by great Black authors. The list goes on.&nbsp;</p>
<!--more-->
<p>One thing we wanted to do at Purpose Jobs was highlight the contributions Black folks have made in the tech industry. We all know the story of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. You might know the story of Katherine Johnson if you saw the movie <em>Hidden Figures. </em>But do you know the story of Valerie Thomas? Or Mark Dean?&nbsp;</p>
<div><p>In honor of Black History Month, we’re highlighting some of the most influential Black leaders in tech from history—and a few from today. Did we miss someone? Let us know! We love learning more about tech and the people that have made the industry what it is today.&nbsp;</p></div>
<h2>15 Black Leaders in Tech You Should Know</h2>
<h3>1. Granville Woods (1856 - 1910)</h3>
<p>Born in Columbus, Ohio, Granville Woods was a great inventor, specifically known for his 15 different appliances for the electric railways. He was most known for inventing the <a href="https://www.biography.com/inventor/granville-t-woods" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>multiplex “induction telegraph,”</span></a> which allowed for voice communication through telegraph wires. The device ended up preventing many train accidents. He became known as “Black Edison” because Thomas Edison tried to sue Woods after he invented the multiplex telegraph. The lawsuit failed, so Edison tried to make Woods a partner, but he refused. Woods held nearly 60 patents at the time of his death.</p>

<h3>2. Katherine Johnson (1918 - 2020)</h3>
<div><p>The accomplishments of Katherine Johnson were highlighted in the film <em>Hidden Figures</em>, but for those who don’t know, she was a pioneering Black woman in tech. She entered college when she was just 15, and at the time of graduation, her only employment options were teaching or nursing. So she worked as a teacher before she applied for a job at the Langley Research Center (which would later become part of NASA). In 1953, Johnson began working as a <span>“</span><a href="http://blackwomenincomputing.org/who-we-are/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>human computer</span></a><span>”</span> and calculated the flight path for the first NASA mission to space. Her calculations were essential to the success of many early missions, like Project Mercury and Apollo 11. She also helped confirm the accuracy when machine computers were brought in. In 2015, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Obama.</p></div>

<h3><br>3. Otis Boykin (1920-1982)</h3>
<p><a href="https://lemelson.mit.edu/resources/otis-boykin" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Otis Boykin</span></a> was another prolific inventor, eventually holding 26 patents. After graduating from Fisk College in 1941, he began working with the Majestic Radio and TV Corporation and eventually P.J. Nilsen Research Laboratories. Among his inventions were a wire precision resistor used in televisions, radios, IBM computers, and even in military missiles. He also invented a control unit for the pacemaker. Boykin helped improve and make everyday electronics more efficient and affordable.</p>

<h3>4. Evelyn Boyd Granville (1924 - Present)</h3>
<p>In 1949, <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/five-fast-facts-about-evelyn-boyd-granville" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Evelyn Boyd Granville</span></a> became the second African-American woman ever to earn a Ph.D. in mathematics (hers was from Yale). After working in D.C. using math to help develop missile fuses, Granville took on a role at IBM in 1956. This launched her career at NASA, since IBM was a contractor to NASA at the time. She was an instrumental part of the Project Mercury missions, designing computer software that helped analyze satellite orbits. She also worked on the Apollo program in 1962 before returning to IBM as a senior mathematician. She has had a passion for education, teaching in higher ed, elementary schools, and advocating for STEM education.</p>

<h3>5. Melba Roy Mouton (1929 - 1990)</h3>
<p>Like Katherine Johnson, Melba Roy Mouton was another great Black leader in tech for her important work as a “<a href="http://blackwomenincomputing.org/who-we-are/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>human computer</span></a>” at NASA. She eventually made her way to being Head of Computer Programming at NASA, and then took on a role as Program Production Section Chief at Goddard Space Flight Center. Her work helped produce the orbital element timetables which allowed millions to see the satellite from Earth as it passed overhead. She received an Apollo Achievement Award and an Exceptional Performance Award while at NASA.</p>

<h3>6. Roy Clay Sr. (1929 - present)</h3>
<p>Roy Clay Sr. is often referred to as the <span>“</span><a href="https://ontechstreet.com/2015/02/roy-clay-sr-godfather-silicon-valley/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Godfather of Silicon Valley</span></a><span>.”</span> After graduating from Saint Louis University (where he was one of the first Black men to attend), he started working in computer programming. This was back in the ‘50s, when computers took up an entire room. He worked on writing software that demonstrated the spread of radiation after an atomic explosion. In the ‘70s, Clay worked as a computer consultant in Silicon Valley and became a key figure in the development of HP’s computer divisions. He would eventually lead the team that engineered HP’s entrance into the computer market. In 2003, he was inducted into the <a href="https://www.svec.org/hall-of-fame" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Silicon Valley Engineering Council’s Hall of Fame</span></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>7. Annie J Easley (1933 - 2011)</h3>
<p>Annie J Easley was another Black NASA scientist and important Black leader in tech. When she began her career, she was only one of four Black employees (out of 2,500) at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), which was the precursor to NASA. She started as a human computer, but when the real machine computers came out, she dove into learning assembly language and FORTRAN. She became a computer programmer, working on a variety of projects. But her most famous work was on the <a href="https://massivesci.com/articles/annie-easley-facts-stem-mathematician-nasa-scientist-discrimination/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Centaur rocket</span></a>, a first-of-its-kind rocket that used a unique fuel system. Its legacy still endures today. She had a long career with NASA, working on extremely advanced technology while overcoming Jim Crow laws and <a href="https://massivesci.com/articles/annie-easley-facts-stem-mathematician-nasa-scientist-discrimination/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>discrimination</span></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>8. Frank Greene (1938-2009)</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.scu.edu/engineering/stories/celebrating-black-history-month-spotlight-on-frank-s-greene-phd-70-1938-2009.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Frank Greene</a> is often hailed as one of the “first Black technologists.” He developed high-speed semiconductor computer-memory systems in the 1960s at Fairchild Semiconductor R&amp;D Labs. He would later go on to start two technology companies of his own. He also founded a VC firm called NewVista Capital, which focused on minority and female-led companies. His legacy as a technologist and an investor lives on today, and he’s also among 63 inductees in the Silicon Valley Engineering Council’s Hall of Fame<span>.</span></p>

<h3>9. Valerie Thomas (1943 - Present)</h3>
<div><p>Valerie Thomas had a strong interest in technology early on but didn’t receive support for it until she attended Morgan State University. She was one of only two women in her class to major in physics. She excelled at school and landed a job as a mathematical/data analyst for NASA. She worked at NASA from 1964 to 1995, conducting large-scale experiments, developing computer data systems, and most notably, spearheading the development of the first satellite to send images from space, “<a href="https://lemelson.mit.edu/resources/valerie-thomas" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Landsat</span></a>.” The technology she developed is still used by NASA today.</p></div>


<h3>10. Clarence “Skip” Ellis (1943 - 2014)</h3>
<p>A native of Chicago, <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/news/memory-clarence-skip-ellis-1943-2014" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Clarence “Skip” Ellis</span></a> was the first African-American to earn a Ph.D. in computer science (he earned this degree from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1969). While studying, Ellis worked on hardware, software, and the development of ILLIAC IV supercomputer. He had a long career at major tech companies like Bell Telephone Laboratories, IBM, Xerox, and more. At the Palo Alto Research Center where he worked from 1976 to 1984, Ellis spearheaded a group that invented Officetalk. It was the first office system to use icons and ethernet to allow people to collaborate from a distance. Ellis was a real pioneer in this field of operational transformation (examining the functionality in collaborative systems), which is found in computer applications today like Google Docs. Does that make him the grandfather (maybe great grandfather) of remote work? Perhaps. But either way, Ellis has had a hand in shaping the technology we use today.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>11. John W. Thompson (1949 - Present)</h3>
<p>John W. Thompson has had an impressive career in tech. He began as a salesperson at IBM and climbed up in the company to become the general manager of IBM Americas. He has also served as the CEO of Virtual Instruments, CEO of Symantec, and today he serves as the <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/exec/john-w-thompson/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Chairman of Microsoft</span></a> (since 2014). He’s also made significant contributions to <a href="https://lsvp.com/team/john-w-thompson/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>investing</span></a> in the next generation of tech.</p>

<h3>12. Marc Regis Hannah (1956 - present)</h3>
<p>For the graphics in <em>Jurassic Park</em>, <em>Aladdin</em>, <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>, and more, we have Chicago native <a href="https://www.thehistorymakers.org/biography/marc-hannah-41" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Marc Regis Hannah</span></a> to thank. He was an electrical engineer and computer graphics designer in the ‘80s and ‘90s. In 1982 he co-founded Silicon Graphics, Inc., eventually becoming the company’s principal scientist. His computer graphics technology has been used in major motion films as well as commercials, the intro for Monday Night Football, and by George Lucas’s visual effects studio, Industrial Light &amp; Magic.</p>

<h3>13. Dr. Mark Dean (1957 - Present)</h3>
<p>Mark Dean is an influential Black tech leader and prominent figure in computer science. Early on he had an interest—and a gift—in technology, building his own computer, radio and amplifier when he was in high school. He began working at IBM in 1980, where he was an essential leader in developing the personal computer. He holds <a href="https://www.black-inventor.com/dr-mark-dean" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>3 of IBM's original 9 patents</span></a> for the PC. Beyond that, he holds a total of 20 patents. Throughout his career he has made significant contributions to IBM’s research and development. More recently, he led the team that produced the 1-Gigahertz chip. He is the first African-American to become an IBM Fellow, which represents the highest level of technical excellence.</p>



<h3>14. John Henry Thompson (1959 - Present)</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.black-inventor.com/john-thompson" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>John Henry Thompson</span></a> has used his background in computer science and visual arts to help bridge the early gap between technology and art. He is the inventor of Lingo, a scripting language that renders visuals in computer programs. Many programs that use graphics, animation, sound, and video for interactive simulations still use Lingo to this day. It’s also been used to create the programs that are now used in video games, web design, animation and graphics.&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>My personal computer was a 4 year old MacBook Pro with a permanent battery service warning, a butterfly keyboard (AKA Apple’s greatest hardware design mistake), and a high chassis temperature issue when I use the <a href="https://twitter.com/_zouhir/status/1292878918677139464">left USB-C to charge it</a>, which throttled its Intel i7 CPU and spun the fan so much that it was quite noticeable — I guess what I am trying to say here is, my personal computer was due for a replacement.</p>
<p>After weeks of research, I ended up purchasing a Mac Mini with Apple’s M1 chip and 16 GB of memory. It arrived on Dec 9th and I have been using it for about 2 months now as my daily driver and primary web development machine. In this post I will be sharing my experience migrating away from my Intel-based Mac and how I set up a clean and productive web development environment on the new Apple silicon based Macs.</p>
<p>I will start out by highlighting some of the research I did around the M1 SoC and explain a little on how Apple has managed to achieve great results emulating stronger memory models on their ARM processor, before I walk you through my web development environment setup with Homebrew, Go, Node.js, and Docker.</p>
<h2 id="researching-apple-silicon"><a href="#researching-apple-silicon">Researching Apple Silicon </a></h2><p>Apple’s “One more thing…'' event in November brought us their M1 SoC and a handful of numbers: up to 3.5x faster CPU performance, up to 6x faster graphics, up to 2x battery life, and faster than 98 percent of PC laptops.</p>
<p>Although some people were <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3596814/new-macbook-air-is-not-faster-than-98-percent-of-pc-laptops.html">skeptical about Apple’s claims</a>, there was enough third-party data soon after the announcement that confirmed Apple’s M1 chip does provide a substantial <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/mac-benchmarks#single-core">performance increase</a>.</p>
<p>In hindsight, the performance and energy efficiency of the M1 chip should have not really been that surprising. Over two years ago, the reputable tech reviews magazine Anandtech ran the <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/13392/the-iphone-xs-xs-max-review-unveiling-the-silicon-secrets/4">SPEC2006 industry standard benchmark on Apple’s A12 chip</a>, and we learned that the A12 chips Apple used in their iPhone XS are capable of handling desktop workloads. They were capable of outperforming a moderately-clocked Skylake CPU in single-threaded tasks while having better energy efficiency than all Android SoCs.</p>
<p>As it became quickly evident that those who bought an M1 Mac would enjoy great responsiveness and blazing fast startup times, I shifted my attention to the main concern: <strong>the ARM architecture</strong>. I wanted to understand which Intel-based executables Rosetta 2 would <em>not</em> be able to translate? And how stable and performant were Rosetta 2 translated binaries?.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-rosetta-2-behavior-and-performance"><a href="#understanding-rosetta-2-behavior-and-performance">Understanding Rosetta 2 Behavior and Performance </a></h3><p>On the surface, nothing about Rosetta 2’s behaviour is out of the ordinary. It takes <code>x86_64</code> instructions and translates them to <code>arm64</code> instructions ahead-of-time. Once the translation process is finished, the translated <code>arm64</code> code blocks are cached so the subsequent executable launches do not need to repeat this process.</p>
<p>To get some insight on how Rosetta 2 translated executables perform compared to native <code>arm64</code> ones, Anandtech ran <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16252/mac-mini-apple-m1-tested/6">various SPEC benchmarks on the M1 chip in both formats</a>. The results showed that memory-intensive <code>x86_64</code> workloads translated by Rosetta 2 consistently achieved more than 90% of the native <code>arm64</code> speed and CPU-intensive workloads performed at 70-80% of its native counterparts. Overall, these results are simply outstanding. Combined with the raw power of the M1 chip, people should, in theory, barely notice any difference using translated macOS <code>x86_64</code> applications.</p>
<p>So, we now know that Rosetta 2 translated executables performance is great in general, and specifically for memory-intensive workloads, the question becomes: <em>how is this possible</em>?</p>
<h3 id="m1s-approach-to-emulating-strongly-ordered-memory-models-on-arm"><a href="#m1s-approach-to-emulating-strongly-ordered-memory-models-on-arm">M1’s Approach To Emulating Strongly Ordered Memory Models on ARM </a></h3><p>At a fundamental level, a multi-core processor requires reads and writes to memory to be communicated between its cores in a consistent manner. Each processor architecture defines the semantics of this communication as a part of its memory consistency model (often referred to as just memory model). The ARM architecture used by the M1 SoC provides <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100941/0100/">weaker memory ordering semantics</a> than the <a href="https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/download/intel-64-and-ia-32-architectures-sdm-volume-3a-system-programming-guide-part-1.html">x86 architecture</a> used by Intel processors. To understand the difference between the two, let’s look at the four basic types of memory reads &amp; writes orderings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write → Read: write must complete before subsequent read</li>
<li>Read → Read: read must complete before subsequent read</li>
<li>Read → Write: read must complete before subsequent write</li>
<li>Write → Write: write must complete before subsequent write</li>
</ul>
<p>Strongest memory model (known as Sequential consistency) maintains all orderings above, and ensures any change is communicated before the next instruction is run. This intuitive, sequential execution of instruction is bad for performance, and defeats the purpose of having multiple cores that can run things on parallel. Weaker consistency models allow some orderings to be violated, enabling the processors to overlap memory access with other operations. The table below captures which reoderings ARM’s “weaker” memory model and the “stronger” X86 one allow.</p>

<p>
source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_ordering#Runtime_memory_ordering" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>
</p>
</div>
<p>As you can see, ARM chose to adopt a memory model that allows any of the four basic memory operations to be reordered as a way to beat sequential consistency and make a wide range of hardware optimizations possible. x86 on the other hand chose to preserve orderings for the most parts, and adopt an on-core <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_buffer"><em>write buffers</em></a> as a way to beat sequential consistency and hide memory writes latency. x86’s behavior is often referred to as <em>Total Store Ordering</em> (or TSO) where write operations are placed on the local write buffer, and subsequent read instructions can be executed before that write changes are communicated.</p>
<p>When compiling binaries for ARM or x86 architectures, we are basically informing our software what are all the reorderings allowed by the target architecture that it needs to account for to ensure correctness.</p>
<p>Typically, this makes it extremely difficult to emulate x86 correctly on ARM without introducing a significant performance disadvantage caused by the ARM processor trying to explicitly guarantee the orderings x86 executables expect. While there aren’t any official details available publicly on how Apple has managed to overcome this hurdle, a plausible explanation is that it’s been solved at the hardware level, and the M1 chip is capable of switching between ARM’s memory model and the x86 TSO.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-rosettas-limitations"><a href="#what-are-rosettas-limitations">What are Rosetta’s limitations? </a></h3><p>In an <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_silicon/about_the_rosetta_translation_environment">official documentation page</a>, Apple stated that Rosetta 2 can translate most Intel-based apps, including the ones that contain just-in-time (JIT) compilers. The two exception are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kernel extensions</li>
<li>Virtual Machine apps that virtualize x86_64 computer platforms</li>
</ul>
<p>Catalina is the last version of macOS that supports third-party kernel extensions. Without these, developers are now limited to the collection of APIs and frameworks that macOS officially provides and supports. In turn, this means that Mac developers’ freedom and creativity are limited with BigSur – but that’s a topic for another day.</p>
<p>The lack of support for virtual machines was a big concern. It meant I wouldn’t be able to run <code>x86_64</code> Docker because it runs virtual machines under the hood. Luckily there was a path forward, as Docker was able to shift to Apple’s new hypervisor framework and provide <code>arm64</code> binaries. Today, <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/apple-m1/">Docker supports M1 chips natively</a>.</p>
<h3 id="decision-day"><a href="#decision-day">Decision Day </a></h3><p>Fascinated and feeling good about the M1’s performance and Rosetta 2 efficiency, I decided it was safe to buy a M1 Mac Mini and give it my own series of real-world tests. And I figured that if it did not meet my expectations or needs, I could take advantage of Apple’s return policy, or hang onto it as a secondary computer or as a media server. (Spoiler: It’s neither!)</p>
<h2 id="installing-rosetta-2"><a href="#installing-rosetta-2">Installing Rosetta 2 </a></h2><p>To make the process of setting up a new Mac less cumbersome and repetitive, I -like many others- have a shell script to configure new installations of macOS, copy my dotfiles and install some of the necessary tools via Homebrew.</p>

<p>A woman I’d met at a conference wrote to me: “I was addicted to meth for 5 years until I was diagnosed with ADHD.”</p>
<p>Katherine did not set out to abuse a street drug. Like many others with unrecognized or poorly managed ADHD and other psychiatric conditions, she faced a “Perfect Storm” of circumstances—and made a “really bad choice.”</p>
<p>She continues with her story, below. First, consider research: <a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/health-news/newsroom/mind-institute-researchers-study-adhd-and-methamphetamine-addiction/2012/09" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MIND Institute researchers study ADHD and methamphetamine addiction. </a>MIND Institute research Catherine Fassbender explains:</p>
<p>“Methamphetamine abusers with ADHD often say that abusing methamphetamine helps calm them down and helps them to maintain focus.</p>
<p>This may be a reinforcing factor in their continuing to abuse meth. Of course, there is a very big difference between taking prescription medication and substance abuse.”</p>
<p>Let’s continue with Katherine’s real-life experience.</p>

Lately I have been getting several emails and there have been postings around the web about the quality / coolness of this site. Mostly comments like, "His POS software is really good, just try to ignore the way his site looks.", "Once you get past the '90's look of his site...", "Just disregard the way the site looks, this is really functional software.", "If your site looks that bad your software must really suck."  And there have been several offers to take the maintenance of this site out of my pathetic hands by folks who like the software but think I have the site design skills of a mushroom.<p>
Piles of thanks for the feedback.</p><p>
So why does this site look like this?</p><hr>
<b>Answer #1</b><p>
Well, I like it.</p><hr>
<b>Answer #2</b><p>
It makes everyone else's site look so much better in comparison. Think of this site as a public service.</p><hr>
<b>Answer #3</b><p>
It isn't that bad, most of the words are spelled correctly. (How many sites can say that?)</p><hr>
<b>Answer #4</b><p>
This is an eye test to see if I can make you go blind.
</p><hr>
<b>Answer #5</b><p>
The real reason. Folks, I am doing the best I can.</p><p>
First realize that I am old. When I was in grade school / high school there were NO COMPUTERS IN THE SCHOOL because outside of main frame computers that cost millions of dollars, computers did not exist. Even pocket calculators did not exist. This made computer classes sort of problematical. (However I used to be a wizard with a slide rule.) So while you have had the advantages of computer classes in school and a bunch of friends to trade computer tips with, I have not. Half of my friends cannot even use a computer which makes them sort of useless when it comes to having a nice chat about HTML or Java. Needless to say I have no teachers, instructors, or professors to help guide my hand to learn this stuff.</p><p>
When I need a new talent (such as HTML) I have to research it on the net, get some books, and then shove myself into a cave until I get the concept, barely. Although if the idea of "learning through your mistakes" is correct then I should know everything because not only do I have the capability of screwing up every possible feature but I can also screw up each feature in every possible way.</p><hr>
So why do I not just stick with it until I actually learn it completely?<br>
 Well unlike some out there who get Christmas, spring, and summer vacations and weekends off, and can study this stuff during class, I have a 6 day a week job, 50 weeks a year. I have a family that I occasionally like to see. I am also writing the software, updating the manual, doing my incompetent best to update the site, and I sometimes sleep. At last count there was still only one of me. So since my computer time is limited I have two choices, either learn more about website design or add more features to the software. My guess is that adding more to the software would be a better use of my time for everyone.<hr>
So why not hire a professional service to maintain the website?<br>
Let me once again explain the concept of "FREE." Free means that you do not pay anything for my software. This means that there is no money coming in to pay for a professional service to maintain the website. I imagine that I could pay for a service out of my pocket for this but that is insane. Free is bad enough but I am not going to pay to provide folks with my software for nothing.<hr>
But if I have a slick site wouldn't that lead to more downloads of my software?<br>
Well, yes, but so what? Remember that FREE thing? An additional billion downloads would not put a dime in my pocket. As of 1-19-17 I have had 800,000 downloads of the POS program from just my site. How many more do I need? Just more people to complain about the website.<hr>
So how about having one of those volunteers do the site.<br>
Well there are two reasons. First I would lose control of the site. Sure, it would look great but I would not understand the code needed to create the site. If I needed to make a change in the site (which happens about weekly) I would have to dig up the volunteer to make the changes. For the volunteer this could quickly become a pain in the neck. Sure it would be fun to redesign this site and show off what you can do but then to have to update it every damn week would rapidly become a chore.<p>
So the volunteer quits, now what? I need to update the website for a new version of the program and I can't even change a period to a comma in this mess. Time to revert to my code that I at least can understand. I may as well just leave it as it is.</p><p>
Sorry.</p><p>

But if you have a better idea or just want to be the next person to bitch about this site <a href="mailto:daleharris@prodigy.net">daleharris@prodigy.net</a>

</p><hr>
Here is another comment from <a href="http://smallbusinessonlinecommunity.bankofamerica.com/message/71459"> http://smallbusinessonlinecommunity.bankofamerica.com/message/71459 </a><p>
If you want a totally free POS system that is very easy to use, accepts bar code scanners, various printers and does nearly everything and very easy to set up and use, then try Cash Register By Dale Harris. <span color="red">I looked at the website and thought it looked a piece of junk being a small program and the tacky look of the website, but the free software works excellently and so easy to use.</span> Its not Excel is the only problem I see for you. It actually runs in Msdos , but will run from your windows main screen. Take a look it, it costs nothing though he does offer a donation if the person likes it, but you don’t have to pay anything. I tried many free POS programs which had too many features for a small retail business, but this is so easy even the sales girl.
only took 30 minutes to understand it.

This email was received from Daniel K. on Sun, 23 Aug 2009...<p>

<span color="red">"Also, Did you know your website Sucks?"</span></p><p>

Ah yes, another appreciative fan.

I've been using the first one in that list for the last few years. DHPOS doesn't do customer tracking, but its a reasonable system. There's good support for it via forums and online chat, and it is regularly updated with bug fixes and new features. <span color="red">Don't get turned off by the ugly website or the DOS interface, it works well.</span>

<span color="red">dhpos dot com . It's free and actually rather good despite the terrible website.</span>

</p><hr>
Now they are even picking on the program itself. I have a "form" on my page that asks folks how they found my software and here is one I just received, "Google search pos system free download in Malaysia..do u have any

		<p><span>Amazon recently announced the release of <span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/01/amazon-aurora-supports-postgresql-12/">Aurora PostgreSQL 12</a></span>. This announcement may have encouraged several customers to upgrade from their existing Aurora PostgreSQL 10.x or 11.x to Aurora PostgreSQL 12.4. The Community PostgreSQL 12 has been one of the greatest releases ever with a big list of features and performance optimizations. So, it </span><b>may be</b><span> fair to assume that Aurora PostgreSQL 12.4 works on the same lines.</span></p>
<p><span>One of the customers as well upgraded their Aurora PostgreSQL 11.9 environments to Aurora PostgreSQL 12.4. Indeed, testing always plays a key role before performing any upgrades. Similarly, the functional testing was done and everything seemed to be perfect.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The actual issue started in less than a day after the upgrade. The performance of some queries started degrading. After taking a deeper look, it was noticed that the queries on just one of the tables started behaving badly. We then saw a very strange behaviour on Performance Insights similar to the following image. I have reproduced the same issue on Aurora PostgreSQL 12 and the following is an image from my test scenario.</span></p>

<p><span>What is wrong with the above image ? Yes, the vacuum process on one of the tables is running forever. To know more about autovacuum and why it is needed, I would recommend you to visit </span><span><a href="https://www.percona.com/blog/2018/08/06/basic-understanding-bloat-vacuum-postgresql-mvcc/"><span>this blog post</span></a></span><span> I have contributed to, while working for </span><span><a href="https://www.percona.com/blog/"><span>Percona</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The size of the table (fairly small) and a completely inactive database with perfectly tuned autovacuum settings should not make the vacuum process to run forever. To know the internals of autovacuum settings and how to tune it well, I would recommend read to see </span><span><a href="https://www.percona.com/blog/2018/08/10/tuning-autovacuum-in-postgresql-and-autovacuum-internals/"><span>this blog post</span></a></span><span> I wrote sometime ago.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Following is the test case I have quickly created to reproduce this issue. I have created a table and created a GiST Index on one of the columns and then performed some inserts and updates in random.</span></p>
<pre>migops=&gt; CREATE TABLE foo.bar (id int PRIMARY KEY, sometext varchar(10), loc point);
CREATE TABLE
migops=&gt; CREATE INDEX gist_bar_idx ON foo.bar USING GIST (loc);
CREATE INDEX
migops=&gt; \d+ foo.bar
Table "foo.bar"

loc | point | | | | plain | | 
Indexes:

"gist_bar_idx" gist (loc)
Access method: heap

migops=&gt; INSERT INTO foo.bar VALUES (generate_series(1,100000),'migops',point '(1,2)');
INSERT 0 100000
migops=&gt; UPDATE foo.bar SET sometext = 'junk' where id between 1000 and 100000;
UPDATE 99001</pre>
<p><span>Now, let me run a VACUUM on the table and check if it’s completing successfully. </span></p>
<pre>migops=&gt; VACUUM VERBOSE foo.bar ;
INFO: vacuuming "foo.bar"
INFO: index "bar_pkey" now contains 100000 row versions in 276 pages

VACUUM</pre>
<p><span>Yes, the above log says that the VACUUM successfully completed. However, let me insert some more data and see if VACUUM succeeds. </span></p>
<pre>migops=&gt; INSERT INTO foo.bar VALUES (generate_series(100001,1000000),'migops',point '(1,2)');
INSERT 0 900000

migops=&gt; VACUUM VERBOSE foo.bar;
INFO: vacuuming "foo.bar"

Time: 382984.688 ms (06:22.985)</pre>
<p><span>As you rightly noticed in the above logs, the VACUUM runs forever.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For a customer who runs mission critical databases, time is money. The first thought when this happened right after a Production database got upgraded was if the GiST Index got corrupted during the upgrade.&nbsp; So, the Index was rebuilt using REINDEX INDEX CONCURRENTLY. Similarly, I have rebuilt the Index in my test setup too. </span></p>
<pre>migops=&gt; REINDEX INDEX CONCURRENTLY foo.gist_bar_idx;
REINDEX
Time: 7900.757 ms (00:07.901)

migops=&gt; VACUUM VERBOSE foo.bar;

VACUUM
Time: 53.344 ms</pre>
<p><span>As noticed in the above logs, upon rebuild of the Index, the VACUUM succeeded. Some relief for the customer running their Production clusters on Aurora PostgreSQL 12.4 that the VACUUM succeeded now.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But, what about the next autovacuum ? Wait, is it stuck again ? This is what the following logs tell us. While reproducing the issue, I ran some inserts.</span></p>
<pre>migops=&gt; INSERT INTO foo.bar VALUES (generate_series(10000002,11000000), 'migops', point '(3,4)');
INSERT 0 999999

-- The following ran for more than 30 mins before me terminating it. 
migops=&gt; VACUUM VERBOSE foo.bar ;
INFO: vacuuming "foo.bar"
^CCancel request sent
ERROR: canceling statement due to user request</pre>
<p><span>So, it again requires a REINDEX of the GiST Index to let the vacuum succeed again.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Conclusion :</strong> We will now need to wait and see if AWS sends any notification or a public announcement to let everybody know about this issue or maybe remove the Aurora PostgreSQL 12.4 version from the list of options to implement a fix, just like </span><span><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/09/16/aws_aurora_postgresql_versions_disappeared/"><span>it happened earlier</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;Please subscribe to our blog posts to follow our latest updates on migrations to postgres.

<p>One of the Amazon reviewers of "Sun Performance and Tuning: Java and the
Internet" gave it 3/5 stars. While still a nice introduction, the book by
Adrian Cockcroft has become dated — claimed Roland in 2003, which believe it
or not was 18 years ago. The book Roland reviewed was published in 1998, and it
is a second edition. The first edition (1994) has a significantly different
title: "<a href="https://archive.org/details/sunperformancetu00cock_0">Sparc &amp; Solaris</a>",
is the focus instead of "Java and the Internet". Other than reflecting a major
shift in Sun’s focus happened between '94, and '98, the two editions also have
a different price tag. "Java and the Internet" costs 15.97 EUR, while one can
get "Sparc &amp; Solaris" used in allegedly <strong>Very Good</strong> conditions for 1.94.  If
I’m buying an outdated book I’m gonna get the most outdated version possible, I
figured, plus imagine the embarrassment if someone would find a book about Java
in my bookshelf. Shipping is 3 bucks, for a grand total of 4.94 EUR the book is
in my hands 15 days after placing the order.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51PSF9CDRYL.jpg" alt="51PSF9CDRYL">
</p>
</div>
<p>"The Porsche Book" is quick to explain the analogy between UNIX and the Porsche
911 featured on the cover: both were created in the '60s, in a form similar to
the current one. Both represent the latest and greatest of products still around
in 1994, and indeed 2021, despite their quirks.</p>
<p>A valid question at this point clearly is: why do you care about a book
published 30 years ago when there’s so much recent and surely more useful
material? One reason is that I find the history of Sun Microsystems
particularly interesting.  I’ve read and very much enjoyed
<a href="https://archive.org/details/highnoon00kare">High Noon</a> as well as
<a href="https://archive.org/details/sunburstascentof00hall">Sunburst</a> — dealing with
recent history there’s the privilege of having plenty of primary sources
readily available, which is great. When it comes to the Porsche book, I find it
fascinating to read about the most common usage scenarios of Sun servers in the
'90s, and I can’t help but feel sorry for the admin who didn’t know that for
SunOS 4, only filenames up to 14 characters long are cached in the Directory
Name Lookup Cache (DNLC). In this article, however, I want to focus on the
information contained in the book which is still valid today.  In a world that
moves as quickly as the world of computing, you could argue that all books are
outdated to begin with. If some of the information in "Sun Performance and
Tuning" was valid in 1994 and is still valid in 2021, there’s a good chance
that it will still be valid 30 years from now.</p>
<p>It seems to me that we can categorize tech knowledge as follows: theoretical
knowledge, generic practical information, and implementation details. Of the
three, theoretical knowledge is the most likely to stay relevant with time,
followed by generic practical information which might still apply some years
later, and finally implementation details which are very likely to become
irrelevant as time goes by. Those details are far from being useless however:
in fact they provide the distinction between novice and experienced
practitioner. To give an example: the chapter about Networks opens with a
description of the built-in <strong>le</strong> network interface, pointing out that it shared
its DMA connection with the SCSI interface. Crucially, the network interface had
higher priority: heavy network activity was likely to reduce disk throughput. In
1994 you would have needed to see multiple workstations with bad disk
performance before concluding that network traffic had anything to do with it — or read the book.</p>
<p>But what is the content that stood the test of time?</p>
<div>
<h2 id="_configuration_factors_and_levels">Configuration Factors and Levels</h2>
<div>
<p>When performing a set of tests, there are multiple settings and knobs one can
work with, each having various options to choose from. Which filesystem are we
using?  What’s the version of the application we’re testing? Kernel buffer
size?</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td><b>Factor</b></td><td><b>Level</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Filesystem type</td><td>ext4, xfs, btrfs,...</td></tr>
<tr><td>OS version</td><td>5.10.16, 5.11, ...</td></tr>
<tr><td>vm.dirty_ratio kernel setting</td><td>20, 40, 60, ...</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>To measure every combination of 6 different factors with 4 levels each would
take 4^6 = 4096 measurements, which clearly is madness. By reducing the levels
we consider to 2, still evaluating all 6 different factors in all possible
combination, we get down to 2^6 = 64 measurements instead.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_throughput_response_time_utilization">Throughput, Response Time, Utilization</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Throughput</strong> — the amount of work performed in a given amount of time — was a
thing in the '60s, it’s the same thing today, and it will still be <strong>work/time</strong>
in 2050. Your web server might have a maximum throughput of 10000 requests per
second (rps), that’s something you can use to compare it with another one.
<strong>Response time</strong> (latency) is defined as the amount of time the user has to
wait.  For example, how long did a given database transaction take.
<strong>Utilization</strong> is how much of the computer’s resources were used to do the work.
The values reported by <code>sar</code> and <code>iostat</code>, two tools very much still in use
today, are an example of Utilization measures.</p>
<p>The author suggests taking multiple <code>sar</code> Utilization measurements at various
load levels and combine them with <code>awk</code> to get an overview of how the system
behaves. We do have <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a>,
<a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a>, and friends nowadays, but the <code>sar | awk</code> idea
is a useful reminder that quick, simple measurements can go a long way too!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_vmstat_sar_and_iostat_rules">vmstat, sar and iostat Rules</h2>
<div>
<p><code>vmstat</code> and <code>sar</code> are described in detail, with a focus on runnable queue,
blocked queue, swap usage, and so forth. The Linux versions of <code>vmstat</code> and
<code>sar</code> from <a href="https://gitlab.com/procps-ng/procps">procps</a> and
<a href="http://sebastien.godard.pagesperso-orange.fr/">sysstat</a> are a bit different than
the Solaris ones, but the main ideas still apply.</p>
<p>The three commands are also used in the <strong>Rules and Tunables Quick Reference
Tables</strong> section. For each subsystem (Disk, Network, Memory, CPU), the author
specified a list of Rules involving the commands and the action to take if the
rule applies. Rules consist in the name of the command with any options, then a
"." followed by the name of the variable to take into account. For example, the
following indicates a disk bottleneck: <code>35%  &lt; iostat-D30.util &lt; 65%</code>. The
action to take is to try balance the I/O load on other disks too, or get more
disks.</p>
<p>A contemporary version of those rules for Linux would be great to have.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_interrupt_distribution_tuning">Interrupt Distribution Tuning</h2>
<div>
<p>Interrupts in Solaris 2.2 were load-balanced among all available CPUs. The
drawback was that, in case of heavy interrupt load from a given device, cache
hit rate would suffer: the OS allowed to statically assign IRQs to CPUs as an
improvement instead.</p>
<p>Nowadays a very similar problem occurs with the <code>irqbalance</code> daemon on Linux,
which on systems doing lots of network activity should not be used. SMP
affinity should instead be configured to ensure the interrupts of multiqueue
network cards are statically mapped among CPUs.</p>
<p>There’s more information in "Sun Performance and Tuning" that can still provide
valuable lessons today, as well as some true historical gems for those into
such things. Go <a href="https://archive.org/details/sunperformancetu00cock_0">check it
out</a> on the Internet Archive if you’re interested!</p>

    <p>Amongst all the news- both positive and grumbling- around the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26093778">Golang generics
proposal</a>, you may have missed
the announcement of <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/41191">native file
embedding</a> coming in Go 1.16
(February 2021).</p>

<p>Go programs have always been easy to distribute, with great cross-platform
compilation and default static binaries. But if you had files you wanted to
bundle with your app, well, things get a bit harder.</p>

<p>With the new <code>embed</code> directive, including files becomes easy. And it opens the
door for some really great UX improvements!</p>



<p>I have a long-running side-project called
<a href="https://github.com/lawrencejones/pgsink">pgsink</a> which aims to be a lightweight
alternative to tools like <a href="https://debezium.io/">debezium</a>. In short, you
connect pgsink to a Postgres database and tell it to sync various tables into
the configured sink (at release, this will be Google BigQuery).</p>

<p>Aiming for ease-of-use, I wanted to provide a lightweight UI to expose table
sync status and allow toggling each table. This meant applying my shockingly
out-of-date Javascript knowledge to a modern toolchain (😱), but more crucially,
it makes app distribution harder.</p>

<figure>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now we have web assets, we need to ship them with our app. We could put
everything in a Dockerfile, but not everyone runs docker- and any standalone
binaries won’t have a working website. pgsink is meant to be super easy-to-use,
so adding an install step that configures web assets was also… yuck.</p>

<p>Screw this, I want to keep my single binary. Let’s see how <code>embed</code> makes this
possible.</p>



<p>First, project structure: pgsink has a Golang app at root, with
<code>cmd/pgsink/main.go</code> as the binary entrypoint (what you’ll pass to <code>go build
cmd/pgsink/main.go</code>). The Javascript app (created using create-react-app) live
in <code>web</code>, and will generate build assets into <code>web/build</code>.</p>

<p>Shown as a tree, it looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>pgsink
├── cmd
│   └── pgsink
│       └── cmd        &lt;&lt; Golang binary entrypoint
└── web
    ├── build          &lt;&lt; production Javascript assets
    │   └── static
    │       ├── css
    │       └── js
    ├── public
    └── src
        └── components
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>First, we need to embed the assets. Remember this will work only work with Go &gt;= 1.16,
which isn’t released yet. I’m using the release candidate for now: run <code>go get
golang.org/dl/go1.16beta1</code> if you want to follow along.</p>

<p>We’ll create a Golang file for the sole purpose of loading our build assets in
<code>web/build.go</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// web/build.go</span>
<span>package</span> <span>web</span>

<span>import</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>"embed"</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>//go:embed build/*</span>
<span>var</span> <span>Assets</span> <span>embed</span><span>.</span><span>FS</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s all we need to embed the assets into the binary.</p>

<p>Simple, right? To explain: <code>embed</code> is a new package coming in Go 1.16 which
helps you work with embedded content. You can find the full documentation at
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/embed/">pkg/embed</a>, but as a brief explanation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <code>go:embed</code> directive asks to load all files within the build directory
(relative to the Go source file) into <code>Assets</code></li>
  <li>An <code>embed.FS</code> is a read-only collection of files, providing methods that
emulate a real filesystem</li>
  <li>It implements the <code>fs.FS</code> interface, which allows you to use <code>embed.FS</code>
alongside other stdlib constructs that are adapted for the upcoming filesystem
consolidation (see <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/draft-iofs.md">File System Interfaces for
Go</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>Now we have the website stored in <code>web.Assets</code>, we need to write a
<code>http.Handler</code> that can serve them.</p>

<p>The handler needs to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Accept requests at <code>/web/file/name</code> and return the contents of
<code>web/build/file/name</code></li>
  <li>As the Javascript app handles routing, requests to non-website assets should
be served the root <code>index.html</code> (allowing the JS to take over)</li>
</ul>

<p>In code, this looks like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// web/build.go</span>
<span>// Continuing from previous example...</span>

<span>// fsFunc is short-hand for constructing a http.FileSystem</span>
<span>// implementation</span>
<span>type</span> <span>fsFunc</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>name</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>fs</span><span>.</span><span>File</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span>

<span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>f</span> <span>fsFunc</span><span>)</span> <span>Open</span><span>(</span><span>name</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>fs</span><span>.</span><span>File</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// AssetHandler returns an http.Handler that will serve files from</span>
<span>// the Assets embed.FS.  When locating a file, it will strip the given</span>
<span>// prefix from the request and prepend the root to the filesystem</span>
<span>// lookup: typical prefix might be /web/, and root would be build.</span>
<span>func</span> <span>AssetHandler</span><span>(</span><span>prefix</span><span>,</span> <span>root</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>Handler</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>handler</span> <span>:=</span> <span>fsFunc</span><span>(</span><span>func</span><span>(</span><span>name</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>fs</span><span>.</span><span>File</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>assetPath</span> <span>:=</span> <span>path</span><span>.</span><span>Join</span><span>(</span><span>root</span><span>,</span> <span>name</span><span>)</span>

                <span>// If we can't find the asset, return the default index.html</span>
                <span>// content</span>
                <span>f</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Assets</span><span>.</span><span>Open</span><span>(</span><span>assetPath</span><span>)</span>
                <span>if</span> <span>os</span><span>.</span><span>IsNotExist</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
                        <span>return</span> <span>Assets</span><span>.</span><span>Open</span><span>(</span><span>"build/index.html"</span><span>)</span>
                <span>}</span>

                <span>// Otherwise assume this is a legitimate request routed</span>
                <span>// correctly</span>
                <span>return</span> <span>f</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span>
        <span>})</span>

        <span>return</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>StripPrefix</span><span>(</span><span>prefix</span><span>,</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>FileServer</span><span>(</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>FS</span><span>(</span><span>handler</span><span>)))</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Picking this apart:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We wrap the embedded filesystem so that requests to open file <code>name</code> are
prefixed with our root, which is the <code>build</code> directory</li>
  <li>Not-found errors suggest we’re seeing a request for a Javascript internal
route, so serve the <code>index.html</code></li>
  <li>Wrap the <code>http.Handler</code> to strip the <code>/web/</code> prefix from our file reads</li>
</ul>

<p>To serve requests from this handler, we can add it to whatever <code>mux</code> is routing
our server:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Strip /web/ and prepend build, so that a file `a/b.js` would be</span>
<span>// found in web/build/a/b.js, but served from localhost:8080/web/a/b.js.</span>
<span>handler</span> <span>:=</span> <span>web</span><span>.</span><span>AssetHandler</span><span>(</span><span>"/web/"</span><span>,</span> <span>"build"</span><span>)</span>

<span>mux</span><span>.</span><span>Handle</span><span>(</span><span>"GET"</span><span>,</span> <span>"/web/"</span><span>,</span> <span>handler</span><span>.</span><span>ServeHTTP</span><span>)</span>
<span>mux</span><span>.</span><span>Handle</span><span>(</span><span>"GET"</span><span>,</span> <span>"/web/*filepath"</span><span>,</span> <span>handler</span><span>.</span><span>ServeHTTP</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The compiled binary can now serve the site without touching the filesystem:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ pgsink serve
...
component=http event=listen address=localhost:8080
component=http request_id=D6ZD7V1f event=http_request http_method=GET
    http_path=/web/ http_status=200 http_bytes=2992 http_duration=0.005253945
component=http request_id=h3Imq0Dl event=http_request http_method=GET
    http_path=/web/static/css/2.8938a2ac.chunk.css http_status=200 http_bytes=154146 http_duration=0.000736358
component=http request_id=WczI7yhi event=http_request http_method=GET
    http_path=/web/static/css/main.44817166.chunk.css http_status=200 http_bytes=141 http_duration=2.8524e-05
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>For fast CI builds, you want to separate the building of Javascript assets from
your Golang toolchain. Producing a release binary will need to combine the two,
so we need to adjust our CI pipeline to account for this.</p>

<p>This project uses CircleCI, and separates the build into many different stages.
Relevant to us is <code>web-build</code>, which builds the web assets, and the <code>release</code>
step which compiles the final binary and creates a Github release.</p>

<p>Assuming familiarity with the CircleCI config file, we adjust <code>web-build</code> to
pass assets into the <code>release</code> step, and make <code>web-build</code> an input to release:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># .circleci/config.yml</span>

          <span>command</span><span>:</span> <span>goreleaser</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This configuration allows <code>release</code> to use what <code>web-build</code> produces, without
bundling the Javascript toolchain alongside the Golang docker image.</p>

<p>This is just one way the <code>embed</code> directive can really improve the experience
around distributing Golang apps. It won’t always be a good idea- bundling a
500MB Javascript app would have different trade-offs!- but it’s awesome that Go
gives you the choice.</p>

<p>See the PR that introduced this functionality at
<a href="https://github.com/lawrencejones/pgsink/pull/185">pgsink/pull/185</a>. The PR has
a few details I excluded from the post snippets for clarity, such as checking
the build assets are around before producing a release.</p>

<p>I’m excited to see how people use <code>embed</code> to improve their apps. If you have any
cool ideas, I’d love to hear them! <a href="https://twitter.com/lawrjones">@lawrjones</a></p>

      <article>
        
        <div><p>The Unix command line is full of surprises. For instance: did you know that the OS X version of the <code>ls</code> tool, most frequently used to get a list of the files in the current working directory, recognizes no fewer than <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/ls.1.html">38 different flags</a>?</p>

<p>I didn’t, so I <a href="https://twitter.com/maxkreminski/status/585843964260941824">tweeted</a> about it. I got a couple of replies, <a href="https://twitter.com/rtraschke/status/585933203183165441">one of which</a> got me wondering: was Unix itself really to blame?</p>

<blockquote lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/msimoni">@msimoni</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/maxkreminski">@maxkreminski</a> Unfortunately, the lineage is _not_ Unix -&gt; Linux. It is Unix -&gt; Plan 9. Linux doesn't follow Unix philosophy :-(</p>— Robby Raschke (@rtraschke) <a href="https://twitter.com/rtraschke/status/585933203183165441">April 8, 2015</a></blockquote>


<p>As far as I know, neither Linux nor OS X was designed with close adherence to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">Unix philosophy</a> in mind. It’d be disingenuous of me to base a criticism of “Unix” exclusively on those derivatives of Unix that are still with us today.</p>

<p>What follows, then, is my attempt to show that many of the problems with the command-line interfaces provided by modern descendants of Unix go all the way to the roots of Unix itself. In particular, I’m going to try to explain my skepticism at the idea that the Unix command-line environment could <em>ever</em> have supported an ecosystem of programs that each did one thing well.</p>

<p>But I’m getting a little ahead of myself. Before I start into any of that, let’s take a closer look at <code>ls</code> and see if we can figure out what exactly it’s doing wrong.</p>

<h3 id="many-things-poorly">Many things poorly</h3>

<p>Different versions of <code>ls</code> understand different sets of flags, but these flags can in general be classified into a few broad categories. <code>ls</code> users make use of flags to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Specify the output format</strong>. <code>-C</code> arranges entries in a neat grid; <code>-m</code> prints a comma-separated “stream” of entries; <code>-1</code> prints each entry on its own line; <code>-q</code> replaces nonprintable characters in file names with question marks.</li>
  <li><strong>Display extra information about each file</strong>. <code>-F</code> adds trailing sigil characters to the names of directories (<code>/</code>), executables (<code>*</code>), symlinks (<code>@</code>), and files of other “special” types; <code>-s</code> prints the size of each file alongside its name.</li>
  <li><strong>Reorder the list of files</strong>. <code>-r</code> reverses the default order; <code>-t</code> orders files by how recently they’ve been modified.</li>
  <li><strong>Include and exclude certain files</strong>. <code>-a</code> includes files that are hidden by default; <code>-R</code> recursively lists files in subdirectories of the working directory.</li>
</ul>

<p>Disregarding the first category for now, there’s something interesting going on with the other three. Functional programmers in particular might find something about them strangely familiar.</p>

<p>That’s right – each of these three categories corresponds roughly to a single generic higher-order function that operates on sequences!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flags that <em>display extra information about each file</em> can be expressed in terms of <code>map</code>, which applies a given transformation to each item in a sequence independently of the others.</li>
  <li>Flags that <em>reorder the list of files</em> can be expressed in terms of <code>sort</code>, which uses a given comparator to compare items pairwise and reorder them accordingly.</li>
  <li>Flags that <em>include and exclude certain files</em> can be expressed in terms of <code>filter</code>, which tests each item against a given predicate and rejects those that are found unworthy.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>ls</code> seems bloated because it <em>is</em> bloated. A handful of higher-order functions could subsume the vast majority of the functionality that’s currently baked into <code>ls</code> itself in the form of flags.</p>

<h3 id="what-went-wrong">What went wrong?</h3>

<p>By no means is it novel to assert that each program should constitute a self-contained unit of functionality. For decades, Unix proponents have been extolling the virtues of pipelines: “programs” created on the fly by gluing small, composable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_(software)#Unix">filters</a> together end-to-end. How, then, is it possible to explain the evolution of such a conceptually simple tool as <code>ls</code> towards ever-greater complexity?</p>

<p>The extreme terseness of the Unix command line hints at one possible explanation. When Unix was invented, 80 characters was about as wide as you could expect a screen to go, and using a computer was synonymous with sitting at a terminal and typing out commands. In such an environment, it made sense to trade legibility and composability for the ability to fit more information into as few characters as possible.</p>

<p>During this era, the developers of heavily used utilities were strongly incentivized to build in shortcuts wherever they could. <code>ls</code> is called <code>ls</code> for the very same reason that its flags are cryptic single-character runes rather than meaningful words or, god forbid, entire phrases: it was developed by and for a small group of highly specialized experts in an environment where every keystroke, every character displayed on the screen, came at a real and meaningful cost.</p>

<p>Likewise, the flags themselves are shortcuts for common real-world use cases. Why waste time adding a filtering step to the pipeline to drop the hidden files when 90% of the time no one wants to see the hidden files anyway? Why display all the available information about each file when 90% of the time the user only cares about filenames?</p>

<p>This mindset – that keypresses are expensive, and that there should be a shortcut for everything – is responsible for many of the problems with <code>ls</code>, and with the Unix command-line environment as a whole.</p>

<h3 id="the-universal-interface">The “universal interface”</h3>

<p>But <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22why%20not%20just%22">why not just</a> write a simpler alternative to <code>ls</code> – a function that takes an optional directory, or the working directory by default, and returns a list of the files inside, disregarding flags entirely? Unix is, after all, nothing if not hackable: if you don’t like <code>ls</code>, you’re free to replace it.</p>

<p>I’ll answer that question with a hypothetical. Imagine, if you will, a programming language in which every function takes exactly one argument (a string) and returns exactly one result (another string).</p>

<p>Oh, look at that – it exists, and it’s called the shell.</p>

<p>Unix permits programs to communicate with one another, and with the user, exclusively through character streams. You can’t  write a function that returns a list of files because the shell doesn’t know what a “list” is, doesn’t know what “files” are, and couldn’t tell you the difference between a “function” and a “program” if its life depended on it. Programs don’t “take arguments” and “return values”, they read characters from <code>stdin</code> and print characters to <code>stdout</code>!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.</p>

  
</blockquote>

<p>The original designers of Unix viewed the “simplicity” of text streams as an advantage. Consequently, they declined to impose any structure on the data that was to pass between programs. This decision, intended to banish inessential complexity, instead managed only to push essential complexity further downstream.</p>

<p>Remember that first category of <code>ls</code> flags, the flags we couldn’t explain away as shortcuts for generic sequence transformations? Turns out they’re just shortcuts for informally encoding notional <em>lists of files</em> as strings that certain other programs (or, in some cases, human beings) know how to parse.</p>

<p>The system fails to provide the abstractions its users need. Users respond by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun%27s_tenth_rule">reinventing them</a>, poorly and inconsistently and in all the wrong places. It’s a distressingly common pattern.</p>

<h3 id="not-an-acceptable-unix">Not an acceptable Unix</h3>

<p>Awareness of the history of computing, and of the constraints under which our current mental models were developed, bestows a kind of superpower: the ability to notice when changing circumstances have rendered once-necessary tradeoffs nonsensical or obsolete.</p>

<p>Many of the usability issues raised by Don Norman in his 1981 <a href="http://www.ceri.memphis.edu/people/smalley/ESCI7205F2009/misc_files/The_truth_about_Unix_cleaned.pdf">criticism of Unix</a> have gone largely unaddressed for three and a half decades. Granted, we’ve developed graphical user interfaces that keep “ordinary users” away from the command line, but we still expect “serious developers” to drop down into a demonstrably inhumane environment to get anything meaningful done.</p>

<p>Rather than re-evaluating the Unix command line with an eye towards improving its usability under the greatly relaxed technological constraints of modern hardware, we’ve written <a href="http://www.secretgeometry.com/apps/cathode/">terminal emulators</a> that faithfully reproduce the constraints of the mid-1970s. We demand <a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/145522/what-does-it-mean-to-be-sh-compatible"><code>sh</code> compatibility</a> from new alternative shells and take it for granted that the <a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/hotos09/tech/full_papers/seltzer/seltzer.pdf">hierarchical filesystem</a> is the optimal way to organize information.</p>

<p>What are the odds that we somehow stumbled upon the best possible interface for interacting with the computer 40 years ago? What are the odds, in other words, that what we’re doing still makes sense today?</p>

<p>Even the earliest version of Unix was ultimately only a particular, flawed implementation of the Unix philosophy. If we want to encourage more widespread acceptance of the <em>philosophy</em>, we should not try to defend the <em>implementation</em> by downplaying its flaws. Instead, we should confront these flaws head-on and work to build systems that address them while also adhering to the spirit – if not the letter – of the principles on which Unix was built.</p>

<p><span>01</span> Intro</p>



<p>One of the favorite activities of tech analysts, VCs and similar Twitter armchair experts is to predict what the next big technology platform might be.</p>



<p>The usual suspects that come up in these conversations are VR/AR, crypto, smart speakers and similar IoT devices. A new contestant that I’ve <a href="https://twitter.com/BrianNorgard/status/1108755070642880512">seen</a> <a href="https://www.aboveavalon.com/notes/2019/11/19/airpods-are-becoming-a-platform">come up</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/chrismessina/status/1177619897884368904">more</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/HarryStebbings/status/1215425809944543240">frequently</a> in these debates recently are Apple’s AirPods.</p>



<p>Calling AirPods “the next big platform” is interesting because at the moment, they are not even a small platform. They are no platform at all. They are just a piece of hardware. </p>



<p>But that doesn’t mean they can’t become platform.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/platform.png"></p><p><span>02</span> What is a platform?</p>



<p>Let’s first take a look at what a platform actually is.</p>



<p>At its core, a platform is something that others can build on top of. A classic example would be an operating system like iOS: By providing a set of APIs, Apple created a playground for developers to build and run applications on. In fact, new input capabilities such as the touch interface, gyroscope sensor and camera allowed developers to create unique applications that weren’t possible before. </p>



<p>Platforms are subject to network effects: More applications attract more users to the platform, while more users in turn attract more developers who build more apps. </p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/flywheel.png"></p><p>It’s a classic flywheel effect that creates powerful winner-takes-all dynamics. This explains why there are only two (meaningful) mobile operating systems – iOS and Android. </p>



<p>It also explains why everyone is so interested in upcoming platforms – and why Apple might be interested in making AirPods a platform.</p>



<p><span>03</span> Why AirPods aren’t a platform</p>



<p>In their current form, AirPods are not a platform. They don’t provide any unique input or output functionalities that developers could leverage. Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode are neat but not new or Airpods-exclusive features – other headphones offer exactly the same. In either case, developers don’t have any control over them and thus can’t build applications that use these functionalities.</p>



<p>Some say that AirPods will give rise to more audio apps because they are “always in” which in turn will lead to more (and perhaps new forms of) audio content. That might be true – content providers are always looking for <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/01/26/newsletters-and-alternative-trade-routes/">alternative routes</a> to get consumers’ attention – but, again, it does not make AirPods a platform. You can use any other pair of headphones to use these audio apps as well.</p>



<p>If Apple wants to make AirPods a platform, it needs to open up some part of the AirPods experience to developers so that they can build new things on top of it.</p>



<p><span>04</span> On Siri &amp; Voice Platforms</p>



<p>The most obvious choice here is Siri, which is already integrated into every pair of AirPods.</p>



<p>In contrast to other voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant, Apple has never really opened up Siri for 3rd-party developers. If they did, it would create a new platform that could have its own ecosystem of apps and developers.</p>



<p>But I’m not convinced that this is Apple’s best option.<br>Let me explain why.</p>



<p>Opening up Siri wouldn’t make AirPods a platform, it would make Siri a platform. This might sound like a technicality, but I think it’s an important difference. As <a href="https://twitter.com/einkoenig">Jan König</a> <a href="https://context-first.com/alexa-please-send-this-to-my-screen-6f4839eb415a">brilliantly summarized in this article</a>, voice isn’t an interface for <em>one</em> device – it’s an interface <em>across</em> devices. It’s more of a meta-layer that should tie different products together to enable multi-device experiences.</p>



<p>This means Apple has little interest in making Siri an AirPods-exclusive. Voice-based computing works best when it’s everywhere. It’s about reach, not exclusivity. This is part of the reason why Google and Amazon excel at it.</p>



<p>At the moment, Siri’s capabilities are considerably behind those of Google Assistant and Alexa. Again, this isn’t overly surprising: Google’s and Amazon’s main job is finding the right answers to users’ questions. The required ML capabilities for a smart assistant are among the core competencies of these two companies.</p>



<p>But even Amazon and Google haven’t really figured out the platform part yet, as indicated by the lack of breakout 3rd-party voice applications. It seems like the two platforms are still looking for their product-market-fit beyond being just cheap speakers that you can also control with your voice.</p>



<p>This is partly because the above-mentioned use case of voice as a cross-device layer isn’t something developers can build with the current set of APIs. </p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/voiceonlyinterfaces-3.png"></p><p>The other big reason I see is that people are mistaking voice as a replacement for other interfaces. Movies like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne6p6MfLBxc">Her</a> paint a future where human-computer-interaction primarily occurs via voice-powered smart assistants, but in reality, voice isn’t great as a primary or stand-alone interface. It works best as an *additional* input/output channel that augments whatever else you are doing.</p>



<p>Let me give you an example: Saying “Hey Google, turn up the volume” takes 10x longer than simply pressing the volume-up button on your phone. It only makes sense when your hands are busy doing other things (kitchen work, for example).</p>



<p>The most convincing voice app I have seen to date was at a hackathon where a team <a href="https://upsidelab.io/blog/design-voice-user-interface-starcraft/">used the StarCraft API to build voice-enabled game commands</a>. Not to replace your mouse and keyboard but to give you an additional input mechanism. Actual multitasking.</p>



<p><span>05</span> What Apple Should Build</p>



<p>I’m not against Apple opening Siri for developers. On the contrary, given that AirPods are meant to be worn all the time, a voice interface for situations that require multitasking is actually a very good idea. But voice input should remain the exceptional case. And it shouldn’t be what makes AirPods a platform.</p>



<p>Instead of voice, I’d love to see other input mechanisms that allow developers to build new ways for users to interact with the audio content they consume.</p>



<p>Most headsets currently on the market offer the following actions with one (or multiple) clicks of a physical button:</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/earpodsremote-1.png"></p><p>These inputs were invented a long time ago and there has been almost zero innovation since. <strong>Why has no one thought about additional buttons or click mechanisms that allow users to interact with the actual content?</strong></p>



<p>For example, when listening to podcasts I often find myself wanting to bookmark things that are being talked about. It would be amazing if I could simply tap a button on my headphones which would add a timestamp to a bookmarks section of my podcast app. <span>(Or better even, a transcript of the ~15 seconds of content before I pressed the button, which are then also automatically added to my notes app via an Apple Shortcut.)</span></p>



<p>Yes, you could build the same with voice as the input mechanism, but as we discussed earlier, saying <em>“Hey Siri, please bookmark this!”</em> just doesn’t seem very convenient.</p>



<p>While podcast apps might use the additional button as a bookmarking feature, Spotify could make it a Like button to quickly add songs to your Favorites playlist. Other developers could build completely new applications: Think about interactive audiobooks or similar two-way audio experiences, for example. </p>



<p>This is the beauty of platforms: You just provide developers with a set of tools and they will come up with use cases you hadn’t even thought about. Crowdsourced value creation.</p>



<p><span>06</span> Closing Thoughts</p>



<p>(1) The input mechanism I describe doesn’t have to be a physical button. In fact, gesture-based inputs might be even more convenient. If AirPods had built-in accelerometers, users could interact with audio content by nodding or shaking their heads. Radar-based sensors like Google’s Motion Sense could also create an interesting new interaction language for audio content.</p>



<p>(2) You could also think about the Apple Watch as the main input device. In contrast to the AirPods, Apple opened the Watch for developers from the start, but it hasn’t really seen much success as a platform. Perhaps a combination of Watch and AirPods has a better chance of creating an ecosystem with its own unique applications?</p>



<p>(3) One thing to keep in mind is that Apple doesn’t really have an interest in making AirPods a standalone platform. The iPhone (or rather iOS) will always be the core platform that Apple cares about. Instead of separate iPhone, Watch and AirPods ecosystems, think about Apple’s strategy as more of a multi-platform bundle. Even as a platform, AirPods will remain more of an accessory that adds stickiness to the existing iPhone ecosystem.</p>

<p>Do you have thoughts or feedback on this post?<br>If so, <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1251919017721421827">I’d love to hear it</a>!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>President Biden approved a Disaster Declaration in Texas on Monday. The entire state is under a winter storm warning that is bringing the coldest temperatures experienced in the state in decades. With freezing temperatures, the ERCOT electricity market is currently experiencing extremely high pricing – and outages – due to increased heating demand and ERCOT&nbsp;energy production failures. New data is showing a good part of this week is likely to be even worse. Here’s what you need to know: </p><h2>What’s currently going on </h2><p>There are rolling blackouts throughout Texas due to the polar vortex and surging electricity demand. ERCOT, the Texas grid operator, issued an Energy Emergency Alert (EEA) 3, which means rotating outages across the state in order to preserve long-term reliability on the grid. </p><p>If you experience a power outage as a Griddy member, please contact your electric utility immediately. <strong>Unfortunately, Griddy cannot provide assistance with outages. Find your utility’s info here: </strong><a href="https://www.griddy.com/outages" target="_blank"><strong>https://www.griddy.com/outages</strong></a><strong>. &nbsp;</strong> </p><h2><strong>How did we get here</strong> </h2><p>We’ve been tracking the prices and the storm since late last week. But on Thursday, we knew things were shaping up to be much worse. &nbsp;ERCOT under-forecasted system load on Thursday by nearly 20%, caused largely by a weather forecast failure in Houston. ERCOT had forecasted temperatures in Houston to remain in the high 50s through most of the day on Thursday. In reality, temperatures hovered around 40 through most of the day. This forecast failure meant that ERCOT had an insufficient generation plan for Thursday, which caused them to rely on fast-responding, expensive replacement generation to meet the higher actual system load caused by the cold temperatures. Real-time prices started spiking around 9am and the elevated pricing persisted through the day. Freezing temperatures also locked up wind turbine towers and spiked energy demand across Texas, according to the state grid operator. </p><p>As soon as we could see that this storm, coupled with ERCOT’s forecast errors, were going to wreak havoc and result in record-breaking price surges, we knew that many of our members wouldn’t be able to reduce their energy consumption sufficiently … particularly when Texas homes are not built for below-freezing temperatures. &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>We’re here for you</strong> </h2><p>We pushed out an email as quickly as we could, suggesting that our members switch to another provider with a fixed rate. While we value our members, we want what is best for their wallet and family even more, even if that means helping them switch away to our competitors. Their well being is more important than our bottom line. </p><p>Unfortunately, it looks like other providers are no longer excepting switches until later in the week. For those that did not switch over, we will still be here for you in any way we can help and continue to send you daily market updates. We also have recommendations of helpful ways to reduce your energy usage: <a href="https://www.griddy.com/post/how-to-save-during-a-price-a-spike-winter-edition" target="_blank">https://www.griddy.com/post/how-to-save-during-a-price-a-spike-winter-edition</a> &nbsp;</p><p>While prices continue to remain very high throughout the week, we will not be shutting off power for anyone. If you lose power, it is from a rolling blackout in your area. &nbsp;Elevated pricing is likely to persist into this coming weekend, likely not at the extreme levels of the last 2 and next 2 days, but still pretty unpleasant. </p><p>Please remember that Griddy doesn’t control the wholesale price of electricity. We simply pass through the cost of wholesale electricity to our customers and only make money from our $9.99/month membership rate, no matter the price of electricity that we pass through from ERCOT. Wholesale prices are always changing based on market conditions like the weather, available supply of energy, and how much energy is demanded at any given time. Rare occasions like the one we are in right now can affect the ERCOT energy market and create unusually high prices.  </p><p>It is “all-hands on deck” right now and we are here to help in any way. &nbsp;</p><h2>A quick shout out </h2><p>We have 1000s of die hard Griddy members who love our vision and product and have been with us since the beginning. We had a rough 4 days in August of 2019, and many of them knew how to master energy efficiency to minimize energy costs during the price surges. As this polar vortex as ascended upon us, we have received a flood of support and inspiring messages from these same members. They’re bundling up, optimizing their homes, and riding this storm out together with us. To all of you, thank you – we love you guys! </p><p>Be safe, be warm! </p><p>The Griddy Team </p><p>‍</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>You’ve probably heard that phrase in TV and movies, in fact, it’s become quite cliché in my opinion. I recently watched an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc9TDjhaYg8" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc9TDjhaYg8" target="_blank">interview with Paul Bettany and Elizabeth Olsen</a> from 2018 where Paul discusses how he got the role of Vision in Avengers: Age of Ultron. In the interview, he says he had a meeting with a producer that told him he was done in Hollywood, and immediately following that meeting he [Bettany] received a phone call from Joss Whedon offering him the part of Vision. This story reminded me of the time that I was told I would “never work in this town again”.</p>



<p>Years ago, while living and working in Greenville, South Carolina, I was unhappy with my job and I was trying to break out of it. I was looking for another position in local marketing agencies as a web developer. At the time, I had zero connections to the <a href="https://stevenwadejr.com/2016/03/03/starting-a-user-group/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://stevenwadejr.com/2016/03/03/starting-a-user-group/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">local community</a> and did all of my job searching with Google: “php developer greenville sc”. Despite the no networking abilities, no connections, and poor job search skills, I found a local shop that was more web development than marketing, and they were hiring. Their website’s job description included a link to an online application with the usual resume upload and personal info, but it also included a questionnaire wanting more specifics on experience, programming style, and various bits and bobs. So, I started filling out the application. That’s when I received a phone call.</p>



<p>A local recruiter, who shall not be named, from a local recruiting agency, that too will remain nameless, phoned me up. They had seen my profile on LinkedIn and had an opportunity for me. They told me all about the company and the position and it all sounded great. I was excited about the possibility of interviewing there, so the recruiter agreed to send them my information. At the end of the call, he revealed the name of the company he was hiring for. It was the same company I had tracked down myself and was in the middle of applying for.</p>



<p>After the phone call, I went back to my browser and looked at my half completed application. The direct application was asking many more questions than the recruiter asked me, so in my inexperienced and young mind, I thought “hey, I’ll just finish filling this out and when they get my resume from the recruiter, they’ll have a little extra info on me for the interview”. I didn’t see anything wrong with my thinking. I thought it would help my chances. I was wrong.</p>



<p>The next day I got a call from the recruiter. Excited and thinking it was to schedule an interview, I answered the phone. I was immediately berated with accusations of “double submittal” and trying to “screw” the recruiter. I was in shock. I casually explained that I had already been in the middle of an application and decided to finish it as the company was asking more specific questions than the recruiter did. I also explained that since the recruiter was sending my info over, I didn’t see how it was a “double submittal”. The recruiter wasn’t having any of it, and then he hit me with “I’ll make sure you never work in this town again”.</p>



<p>I couldn’t believe what I had just heard. I was nervous and scared. Could this person really prevent me from getting another job in my city? Logically I knew he couldn’t, but emotions are quicker to the brain than logic. Years later I would become friends with the owners of the company that I had attempted to interview with and they remembered the incident. They told me the same recruiter threatened to blackball their company if they hired me.</p>



<p>Needless to say, I did not get the interview. A few months after the incident, I received a cold call from a local business owner about a different opportunity in town that was a bigger step up than the one I had attempted to get earlier. I took the job which eventually led to other possibilities and eventually to where I am now, a full-time remote Software Engineer working for an international company. So I guess that recruiter was right, I never did work in that town again.</p>

    </span></p>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Shorthand_properties" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CSS shorthand syntax</a> lets you set the values of multiple other CSS properties simultaneously.</p>
<p>You can write</p>
<div data-language="css"><pre><code><span>background</span><span>:</span> #000 <span><span>url</span><span>(</span>image.png<span>)</span></span> no-repeat left top<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>instead of</p>
<div data-language="css"><pre><code><span>background-image</span><span>:</span> <span><span>url</span><span>(</span>images/bg.gif<span>)</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>background-position-x</span><span>:</span> left<span>;</span>

<span>background-repeat-y</span><span>:</span> no-repeat<span>;</span>
<span>background-color</span><span>:</span> #000<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>and happily switch to another line of code waiting for you, but... here comes the issues.</p>
<h2 id="shorthand-issues"><a href="#shorthand-issues" aria-label="shorthand issues permalink"></a>Shorthand issues</h2>
<h3 id="hard-to-remember"><a href="#hard-to-remember" aria-label="hard to remember permalink"></a>Hard to remember</h3>
<p>For around a decade as a frontend engineer, I'm writing and reviewing styles on a daily basis, and still, I can't remember all the shorthands. I was often struggling to understand what my teammate or past me wrote and use MDN as a cheat sheet repeatedly.</p>
<p>The same applies to many others, especially to juniors who are overwhelmed with the amount of information memorized.</p>
<p>It's better to invest in the learning of properties and their values than their specific order.</p>
<h3 id="error-prone"><a href="#error-prone" aria-label="error prone permalink"></a>Error-prone</h3>
<p>Shorthands are very error-prone, lemme give you mistake that happens all the time. Developer A wrote component styles:</p>
<div data-language="css"><pre><code><span>.component</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>margint-top</span><span>:</span> 1em<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then developer B extended this component with centered styles:</p>
<div data-language="css"><pre><code><span>.component</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>margin-top</span><span>:</span> 1em<span>;</span>
  <span>margin</span><span>:</span> 0 auto<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Can you spot the issue? Right, the top margin was overwritten, and unwanted sticking to the previous sibling node was introduced.</p>
<p>Surely you can catch it by your eye, and even lint it with <a href="https://stylelint.io/user-guide/rules/declaration-block-no-shorthand-property-overrides" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">no-shorthand-property-overrides</a> as we did for <a href="https://github.com/zattoo/stylelint-config/pull/122" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">@zattoo/stylelint-config</a>. But in real-world you unlikely will see these overrides together, and lint won't help you:</p>
<div data-language="css"><pre><code><span>.component</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>margin-top</span><span>:</span> 1em<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>.component__centred</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>margin</span><span>:</span> 0 auto<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The same happens with background, border, transform, and many other shorthands.</p>
<h3 id="conflicts"><a href="#conflicts" aria-label="conflicts permalink"></a>Conflicts</h3>
<p>Single-lined shorthand has much more chance to conflict when multiple developers modifying its properties.</p>
<div data-language="css"><pre><code><span>.component</span> <span>{</span>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
  <span>padding</span><span>:</span> 1em 0.5em 3em<span>;</span>
=======
  <span>padding</span><span>:</span> 2em 0.5em 1em<span>;</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; my-branch
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="without-shorthands"><a href="#without-shorthands" aria-label="without shorthands permalink"></a>Without shorthands</h2>
<p>There can be no good without evil</p>
<h3 id="size"><a href="#size" aria-label="size permalink"></a>Size</h3>
<p>Does size really matter? Yes, but you don't have to manually care for it. Leave it to minification tools like <a href="https://webpack.js.org/plugins/mini-css-extract-plugin" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">MiniCSSExtractPlugin</a>, and gzip.</p>
<h3 id="speed"><a href="#speed" aria-label="speed permalink"></a>Speed</h3>
<p>Shorthand is much faster to write. But as was said, not to read.</p>
<p>If you want to be more productive, look at <a href="https://docs.emmet.io/css-abbreviations" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Emmet</a>, most IDEs support it out from the box or have a plugin that can help you speed up typing a lot.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="conclusion permalink"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Sometimes we are using shorthand without even knowing about it. It's beneficial to check how shorthand unwraps in a debugger get a clue.</p>
<p>Some CSS properties even don't have longhand props like transform functions (until recent times).</p>
<p>We can't get rid of them fully or even forbid its usage, but I encourage you to use them as little as possible.</p>

February 16, 2021 | https://materialize.com/temporal-filters/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://materialize.com/temporal-filters/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://materialize.com/">Materialize</a> provides a SQL interface to work with continually changing data. You write SQL queries as if against static data, and then as your data change we keep the results of your queries automatically up to date, in milliseconds.</p>
<p>Materialize leans hard into the ideal that SQL is what you know best, and what you want to use to look at streaming data. At the same time, there are several tantalizing concepts that native stream processors provide that aren’t obviously possible with standard SQL.</p>
<p>Today we’ll look at how to perform time-windowed computation over temporal data.</p>
<h2>Temporal Data</h2>
<p>Temporal databases are a pretty neat thing, and we aren’t going to go deep on that today. Instead, let’s just start with a relation that has a pretty simple schema, and which includes some times.</p>
<pre><code>-- Making a new data source.
CREATE TABLE events (
    content text,
    insert_ts numeric,
    delete_ts numeric
);
</code></pre>
<p>We have some content, clearly you could fluff that up to something more interesting, and two additional columns. The <code>insert_ts</code> and <code>delete_ts</code> columns will play the role of timestamps, indicating when an event should first appear and when it should be removed.</p>
<p>Of course, this is all just data right now. These are fields, and you could put whatever you want in them. They don’t have any specific meaning yet. You could make <code>delete_ts</code> be smaller than <code>insert_ts</code>, if you are that sort of person.</p>
<h2>Time-Windowed Queries</h2>
<p>The question is now what do you do with these data?</p>
<p>In Materialize, you can ask questions that grab the “logical time” for your query (roughly: the wall clock when you run the query) and then use that in your query’s logic. For example, this query counts up <code>content</code> based on events that start by and end after the current logical timestamp.</p>
<pre><code>-- Reduce down to counts within a time interval.
SELECT content, count(*)
FROM events
WHERE mz_logical_timestamp() &gt;= insert_ts
  AND mz_logical_timestamp()  &lt; delete_ts
GROUP BY content;
</code></pre>
<p>This query will change its results over time. Not just because you might add to and remove from <code>events</code>, but because <code>mz_logical_timestamp()</code> advances as you stare at your screen. Each time you issue the query you may get a different result.</p>
<p>This looks like a great query! What’s not to like?</p>
<p>The main issue really is that it is <em>just a query</em>. You can ask this question over and over, but you can also ask the same thing with an arbitrary timestamp in place of <code>mz_logical_timestamp()</code>. To support that, Materialize has to keep the entire collection of data around. Your <code>events</code> table will grow and grow and grow, and the time to answer the query will grow as well.</p>
<h2>Time-Windowed Computation</h2>
<p>Materialize specializes at <em>maintaining</em> computations like the above, both because that can make it faster to get your answers out, but also because by specifying what you actually need Materialize can run much more lean. We’ll see that now with the query above!</p>
<p>Until recently, if you tried to create a materialized view of the query above, Materialize would tell you to take a hike. The subject of this post is that you can now do it. Moreover, comparing parts of your data to <code>mz_logical_timestamp()</code> in views (rather than just in queries) introduces powerful new idioms, ones that we’ll explore in this post.</p>
<pre><code>-- Maintained collection of only valid results.
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW valid_events AS
SELECT content, count(*)
FROM events
WHERE mz_logical_timestamp() &gt;= insert_ts
  AND mz_logical_timestamp()  &lt; delete_ts
GROUP BY content;
</code></pre>
<p>What’s all this then?</p>
<p>Presumably <code>valid_events</code> has the property that if you <code>SELECT</code> from it you should see the same results as for the time-windowed <code>SELECT</code> in the previous section. That is 100% true.</p>
<p>What is also true is that <code>valid_events</code> has enough information from you, in the form of the query itself, to maintain only enough historical detail to answer these <code>SELECT</code> queries from now onward. Once Materialize’s <code>mz_logical_timestamp()</code> passes a record’s <code>delete_ts</code> it cannot be seen (at least not through this view), and Materialize can dispose of the event. The in-memory footprint of <code>valid_events</code> stays bounded by the number of records in the system that could still satisfy this constraint (those records that are currently valid, or who may yet become valid in the future).</p>
<p>While you add to <code>events</code>, Materialize collects up the events that are no longer visible, automatically. Of course, you can also <em>change</em> the records in <code>events</code>, in case you want to remove some events early, or draw out the <code>delete_ts</code> of any record, or replace one event with its next stage (and new <code>insert_ts</code> and <code>delete_ts</code>). If you happen to adjust any fields that interact with <code>mz_logical_timestamp()</code> Materialize will update the views appropriately.</p>
<h2>A Brief Example</h2>
<p>Let’s do some testing with our table and maintained view. Tables have the nice property that we can interactively update them from within Materialize, rather than spinning up a Kafka cluster.</p>
<p>Let’s start with something simple: we’ll just look at the records currently present in our <code>valid_events</code> view. Let’s define a different view to do that, though, without the aggregation so you can see the raw data:</p>
<pre><code>-- Maintained collection of only valid results.
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW valid AS
SELECT content, insert_ts, delete_ts
FROM events
WHERE mz_logical_timestamp() &gt;= insert_ts
  AND mz_logical_timestamp()  &lt; delete_ts
</code></pre>
<p>We’ll print out the things in our view, along with the current logical timestamp. It is initially empty, because we haven’t put any data in. But, these are the columns we’ll be looking at.</p>
<pre><code>materialize=&gt; SELECT *, mz_logical_timestamp() FROM valid;
 content | insert_ts | delete_ts | mz_logical_timestamp
---------+-----------+-----------+----------------------
(0 rows)

materialize=&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Now let’s put some data in there. I’m going to just take advantage of the fact that <code>INSERT</code> statements can also use <code>mz_logical_timestamp()</code> to populate the data with some records that we will make last five seconds.</p>
<pre><code>materialize=&gt; insert into events VALUES (
    'hello',
    mz_logical_timestamp(),
    mz_logical_timestamp() + 5000
);
materialize=&gt; insert into events VALUES (
    'hello',
    mz_logical_timestamp(),
    mz_logical_timestamp() + 5000
);
materialize=&gt; insert into events VALUES (
    'hello',
    mz_logical_timestamp(),
    mz_logical_timestamp() + 5000
);
</code></pre>
<p>Each of these were executed by me, a human, and so almost certainly got different <code>insert_ts</code> and <code>delete_ts</code> timestamps. We’ll see them in just a moment!</p>
<p>Next, I typed <em>incredibly fast</em> to see the output for the query; what was previously empty just up above:</p>
<pre><code>materialize=&gt; SELECT *, mz_logical_timestamp() FROM valid;
 content |   insert_ts   |   delete_ts   | mz_logical_timestamp
---------+---------------+---------------+----------------------
 hello   | 1613084609890 | 1613084614890 |        1613084613168
 hello   | 1613084611459 | 1613084616459 |        1613084613168
 hello   | 1613084610799 | 1613084615799 |        1613084613168
(3 rows)
</code></pre>
<p>We can see that the <code>insert_ts</code> and <code>delete_ts</code> values are indeed <code>5000</code> apart, and for each of the outputs the <code>mz_logical_timestamp</code> lies between the two. What happens if we type the query again, very quickly?</p>
<pre><code>materialize=&gt; SELECT *, mz_logical_timestamp() FROM valid;
 content |   insert_ts   |   delete_ts   | mz_logical_timestamp
---------+---------------+---------------+----------------------
 hello   | 1613084609890 | 1613084614890 |        1613084613988
 hello   | 1613084611459 | 1613084616459 |        1613084613988
 hello   | 1613084610799 | 1613084615799 |        1613084613988
(3 rows)
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>mz_logical_timestamp</code> values have increased. We still see all of the record, as the timestamp hasn’t increased enough to fall outside the five second bound yet. We type again ..</p>
<pre><code>materialize=&gt; SELECT *, mz_logical_timestamp() FROM valid;
 content |   insert_ts   |   delete_ts   | mz_logical_timestamp
---------+---------------+---------------+----------------------
 hello   | 1613084609890 | 1613084614890 |        1613084614843
 hello   | 1613084611459 | 1613084616459 |        1613084614843
 hello   | 1613084610799 | 1613084615799 |        1613084614843
(3 rows)
</code></pre>
<p>.. and the timestamp increases again ..</p>
<pre><code>materialize=&gt; SELECT *, mz_logical_timestamp() FROM valid;
 content |   insert_ts   |   delete_ts   | mz_logical_timestamp
---------+---------------+---------------+----------------------
 hello   | 1613084611459 | 1613084616459 |        1613084615628
 hello   | 1613084610799 | 1613084615799 |        1613084615628
(2 rows)
</code></pre>
<p>.. and we lost one! Now that <code>mz_logical_timestamp()</code> has reached <code>1613084614890</code> that record no longer satisfies the predicate, and is no longer present in the view.</p>
<pre><code>materialize=&gt; SELECT *, mz_logical_timestamp() FROM valid;
 content |   insert_ts   |   delete_ts   | mz_logical_timestamp
---------+---------------+---------------+----------------------
 hello   | 1613084611459 | 1613084616459 |        1613084616392
(1 row)
</code></pre>
<p>One more has dropped out.</p>
<pre><code>materialize=&gt; SELECT *, mz_logical_timestamp() FROM valid;
 content | insert_ts | delete_ts | mz_logical_timestamp
---------+-----------+-----------+----------------------
(0 rows)
</code></pre>
<p>Ah, they are all gone. My fingers can rest now.</p>
<p>Although this looks rather similar to re-typing the <code>SELECT</code> query that explicitly filters against <code>mz_logical_timestamp()</code>, the difference here is that everything is dataflow with updates flowing through it. If we were to <code>TAIL</code> the view, we would see exactly the moments at which the collection changes, without polling the system repeatedly.</p>
<p>And of course, we can handle a substantially higher volume of updates than if we were continually re-scanning the entire collection.</p>
<h2>Windows: Sliding and Tumbling</h2>
<p>The pattern we saw above was actually very powerful: records could state both their insertion and deletion times. If a record wants to be around for 10s it can do that, if it wants to stay for a year or forever, it could do that too (note: please read further before choosing to do that).</p>
<p>But, let’s check out some other idioms.</p>

<p>My <a href="https://leanpub.com/generative-art-in-golang">recent foray</a> into writing and self-publishing a technical book showed me that teaching people what I've learned is what drives me forward. That's especially true for offering the audience a different perspective (like <a href="https://leanpub.com/generative-art-in-golang">teaching Go developers how to make art with code</a>).</p><p>Naturally, I started looking for a way to introduce the beauty of the <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir language</a> to another programming community. I want to do that by addressing well-known pain points and how they can get solved by Elixir and OTP. And while the language divide between Go and Elixir might be a little too wide for me to present a strong case, Python can be a great candidate because it was Python that prompted me to start searching for alternatives.</p><p>See, I still love the language and its ecosystem, but over the past few years, it has become an unmanageable blob of options and alternatives for doing the same things. And new <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/">PEPs</a> (Python Enhancement Proposals) are coming all the time. For instance, you can't just use good old classes and objects; there are dicts (which pretty much everyone ends up using), named tuples, data classes, and lately, typed dicts. That is, excluding the myriad of third-party libraries that try to solve the problem of introspecting data in one way or another. The same applies to concurrency - one can choose between OS processes, OS threads (which are synchronized when it comes to CPU-bound ops), green threads, and as of a few years, async functions (which only work with IO that supports async). And yeah, structural <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0622/">pattern matching</a> is probably coming too. It's all quite confusing.</p><p>And yet, Python lives on and moves forward. Its ecosystem is massive, offering libraries for solving pretty much any problem one can imagine. The language has deep ties to both the industry and academia. It also has the native interface, which, similar to the NIFs, has allowed Python developers to execute code at native speed since the beginning. Which, of course, was the reason that Python became the de-facto king of ML.</p><p>My motivation to write this book is two-fold. On the one side, it's the aspect of teaching Elixir/OTP by analogy. On the other, it's about revisiting stuff from Python, which I might have missed, and, in a way, rediscovering it again.</p><p>Do you think that the book will be worth reading? Drop me a line and let me know what you think. Your feedback is more than welcome.</p>

  <p>If the history of Life on Earth has taught us one thing, it's that sometimes it takes a very particular set of conditions for something to happen. Purchasing Power Dis-Parity was forgotten by the Internet at first, but the JS teaching community has recently sparked it by combining the following characteristics:</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Digital product.</strong> And to make another copy of an existing course is virtually free. So making an extra sell, even at a discount, will make more money than not selling at full price.</li>
<li>
<strong>Global community.</strong> JS devs are all around the world. Courses are in English. But only a quarter of the world's English speakers live in "rich" Western countries.</li>
<li>
<strong>Technical skills.</strong> It requires technical skill to set up purchasing power parity. Especially if you add security and analytics features like with exportator. JS dev teachers have the skill to build it.</li>
</ul><p>Here are 10 Javascript courses offering purchasing-power-adapted prices in YOUR country, now.</p><p>If you want to find out about more apps, courses, games, and ebooks on #PPP, subscribe to our newsletter.</p><h2>1. Epic React</h2><p><a href="https://epicreact.dev/?ref=exportator">Website</a> - Level: Intermediate/Advanced - Tech: React - Twitter - PPP: Active</p><p>Throughout 19h of video courses, Kent Dodds will take you from the fundamentals of React to a walkthrough of advanced React apps. Kent is an experienced dev and teacher who's making you work hard to become truly good. And that's what we want.</p><p>Kent's English is easy to understand, even for non-native English speakers, and the videos are top-notch quality. The course offers pricing based on the #PPP index, all over the world, without exception.</p><h2>2. Opinionated React</h2><p><a href="https://opinionatedreact.com/?ref=exportator">Website</a> - Level: Intermediate - Tech: React - <a href="https://twitter.com/NikkitaFTW">Twitter</a> - PPP: Active</p><p>Remember when you hadn't done your homework and tried to borrow someone's cheat sheet? Sara's eBook is like that perfect 200 pages cheat sheet that will give you all the keys, structure, vocab, and concepts to navigate the React world.</p><p>Sara made it clear that this is her take on React. But as a friend said about Ruby on Rails' DHH, when someone much more intelligent than you thought about a topic for much longer than you, it's probably best to listen to their opinions. Duh!</p><h2>3. ES6 by Wes Bos</h2><p><a href="https://es6.io/?ref=exportator">Website</a> - Level: All - Tech: All - <a href="https://twitter.com/wesbos">Twitter</a> - PPP: Active</p><p>ES6 totally changed the JS ecosystem for sure, but the whole web too. Whether you're on Ruby on Rails, PHP, or Python, you'll have to write JS at some point. Wes Bos' ES6 course will take you through the </p><p>Wes Bos is one of the best JS teachers on the Web right now and a huge advocate of purchasing power parity. One of the great strengths of Wes is his ability to explain hard concepts without jargon, and making them crystal clear to any listener. He offers a bunch of other courses with purchasing power prices around JavaScript.</p><h2>4. Learn Node &amp; React for Beginners by Wes Bos</h2><p><a href="https://learnnode.com/?ref=exportator">Node</a> - <a href="https://reactforbeginners.com/?ref=exportator">React</a> - Level: All - Tech: React + Node - <a href="https://twitter.com/wesbos">Twitter</a> - PPP: Active</p><p>Beginners, here are two top-notch courses to get started with your JS framework of choice. Wes covers all the concepts that you need to start building web applications. From setting up your computer for the framework, creating user accounts, routing, database, sending emails, handling errors, creating your API, to deploying your app. Wes' got you covered.</p><p>If you're looking for more <a href="https://advancedreact.com/?ref=exportator">advanced</a> content, other courses on these frameworks are available. All are working with #PPP pricing too.</p><h2>5. Node CLI</h2><p><a href="https://nodecli.com/">Website</a> - Level: Intermediate - Tech: Node CLI - <a href="https://twitter.com/MrAhmadAwais/">Twitter</a> - PPP: Active</p><p>How do you build your own npm package and publish it on the Internet? Awais answers this question in extreme detail over the course of 10 hours of short, easy-to-watch videos.</p><p>Awais a lot of fun. It's not given to everyone to make CLIs a rivetting topic, but he nails it. Content quality is all you can expect from a modern online course. Awais has a slight accent but you get used to it surprisingly fast and after the courses' 10h you'll miss it :)</p><h2>6. Vue School</h2><p><a href="https://vueschool.io/?ref=exportator">Website</a> - Level: Intermediate - Tech: Node CLI - <a href="https://twitter.com/vueschool_io">Twitter</a> - PPP: Active</p><p>Vue School offers Vue JS courses for all levels, on all Vue-related topics. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced developer, you'll find something to learn. </p><p>Vue School is well aware of the potential of providing adapted prices but they go one step further by offering subtitles on some of their video courses. For the moment available in Spanish, we hope to see more languages supported.</p><h2>7. Vanilla JS Academy</h2><p><a href="https://vanillajsacademy.com/?ref=exportator">Website</a> - Level: Intermediate - Tech: Node CLI - <a href="https://twitter.com/vueschool_io">Twitter</a> - PPP: Active</p><p>Sure, sure, Vanilla JS is not the latest sexy JS framework. We wouldn't recommend it for starting a project in 2021, but developers working freelance might need a crash course in Vanilla JS, and the Vanilla JS Academy will give you the full tour.</p><p>We love that Chris has strong opinions about Vanilla JS, and makes a point of showing how simple and resilient it is. </p><hr><h2>Want to find more purchasing power prices' courses?</h2><p>Subscribe to our PPP apps newsletter!</p><h2>How can you provide #PPP too?</h2><p>Exportator purpose is to help you provide purchasing power promo codes for your app or course in seconds.

<p>Last year <a href="https://gradientflow.com/one-simple-chart-online-learning-platforms/">I examined usage of a few online learning platforms</a> and found that a month into the pandemic, many of them were growing rapidly. Now that we have data to compare pre and post pandemic usage, let’s revisit the same group of online learning providers:</p>

<p>At least in the West, the impact of the pandemic as far as restrictions and shelter-at-home orders didn’t kick in until March/2020 (late February in a few places). So the chart above is the first comparison of usage <strong>before</strong> and <strong>after</strong> the effects of the pandemic. Data indicates that major online learning platforms enjoyed a banner year. Many of them grew by double digits year-over-year: Udemy, Coursera, edX, Skillshare, and Pluralsight all grew by more 10%. Traffic to Coursera jumped 75%!</p>
<p>A major reason behind this growth is the increasing popularity of <em>micro-credentials</em> ⎼ series of courses that let students demonstrate competence in specific areas. With micro-credentials, students typically get badges or certificates upon completion, and depending on the program, they are able to <em>combine and stack</em> different micro-credentials towards a more comprehensive qualification. I have spoken to several people who have started micro-credential programs over the last year and I get the sense that they are representative of what’s happening in online learning. With many people sheltering in place, micro-credential programs are booming.</p>
<p>All of the major online learning platforms offer micro-credentials in many different disciplines and subjects, here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>edX offers more than sixty <a href="https://www.edx.org/micromasters">MicroMasters®</a> degrees.</li>
<li>Coursera offers <a href="https://www.coursera.org/browse">Specializations, Certificates, and Degree Programs</a>.</li>
<li>Linkedin Learning offers 150 different <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/topics/business?entityType=LEARNING_PATH">Learning Paths</a>.</li>
<li>Traditional Universities are beginning to acknowledge demand for micro-credentials and some well-known public institutions in the U.S. are rolling out offerings: <a href="https://gradpathways.ucdavis.edu/micro-credentials">UC Davis</a>, <a href="https://system.suny.edu/academic-affairs/microcredentials/">SUNY</a>, <a href="https://www.unh.edu/continuingeducation/micro-credentials/about">UNH</a> – just to name a few.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few trends make me think that&nbsp;online learning platforms will be able to maintain at least some of the growth we’re seeing once the world returns to normal. First of all digital transformation is fueling demand for skilled workers across all industries and traditional educational institutions alone cannot meet demand. Secondly employees realize that they increasingly need to keep their skills up to date, and online learning platforms are just so much more cost-effective and convenient.</p>
<p>Finally, the pandemic has caused many to question the cost of higher education. This is particularly true in the U.S. where there’s already a looming <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/12/how-student-debt-became-a-1point6-trillion-crisis.html">crisis in student loans</a>. While I think the <strong><em>top</em></strong> private and public Colleges and Universities have enough brand power to hold off more affordable alternatives, many academic institutions will have difficulty countering lower cost and more convenient alternatives. It’s hard to fault people who want to continue to study from the comfort of their home, while focusing only on the topics they are most passionate about!</p>

<p>If you’ve ever lost your wallet, only to have it returned to you through the kindness of strangers, you’ve probably come to understand what true gratitude is. After all, our wallets not only carry our cash—something that is increasingly rare these days—but also important items such as our drivers license, credit/debit cards, voter registration documents, and more. Having to replace all of that stuff can be costly, time consuming, and frustrating.</p>
<p>Now imagine if you lost your wallet in Antarctica. Chances are you’d probably figure that it was one for good, never to be seen again. Most of the time you’d probably be right, as the frozen continent is one of the most remote and demanding environments on the planet. But a California man was <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-02-06/wallet-lost-1960-antarctica-returned-california-man-paul-grisham/13128946" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently reunited with his missing wallet</a>, which he misplaced in the Antarctic more than 53 years ago, creating one of the more unique and interesting stories that I’ve seen in some time.</p>

<h2>13-Month Tour of Duty in the Antarctic</h2>
<p>Paul Grisham was a career Navy man, enlisting in 1947 and serving as a weather technician and forecaster for 30 years. In 1967 he drew the unenviable duty of being sent to the Antarctic as part of a team that supported a civilian research project there. He would end up spending 13 months at the bottom of the world, assisting with data collection for a study on the Antarctic environment there. </p>
<p>While there, Grisham managed to lose his wallet, which contained a number of documents that you would expect, along with some unique items as well. For instance, in addition to his military ID and drivers license, the wallet contained a tax withholding statement, receipts for money orders sent to his wife and two young kids back home, and a punch card that tracked his rations of beer. As a sign of the times, the wallet also had a reference card for what do in case of a nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons attack. </p>
<p>Although Grisham was frustrated with his carelessness, he says that he soon forgot about the wallet, rarely ever thinking about it again. Imagine his surprise then when he was recently reunited with said wallet after more than five decades had passed. </p>

<h2>A Curious Find</h2>
<p>The wallet was discovered in 2014 at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/geo/opp/support/mcmurdo.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McMurdo Station</a>, located on Ross Island in the Antarctic. But even though it contained the identification of the man who had lost it, tracking down Grisham—who is now 91—proved more challenging than expected. After all, at the time it had been more than 45 years since he’d even been there. </p>
<p>it took a group of dedicated amateur internet investigators to find Grisham, using emails, Facebook, handwritten letters, and a variety of other tools to locate the wallets rightful owner. The group, which is formed by a man named Stephen Decato, had undertaken similar projects in the past to reunite individuals with missing property.</p>
<p>A friend of Decato who had heard about the wallet—along with another that had also been found in the Antarctic—asked for assistance. The group of sleuths then sprang into action, searching for clues as to whether or not Grisham was still alive and where he might reside today. </p>
<p>Eventually the Decato and his group were able to find the long-lost Navy weatherman and send his wallet back to him. When he received it, Grisham said that he was “blown away.”</p>

</p></figure>
<h2>A Different Era in the Antarctic</h2>
<p>In sharing his thoughts on the discovery of the missing wallet, Grisham has also offered insights into what it was like in the Antarctic back in the last 1960s. He was there as part of a program known as Operation Deep Freeze, which kept him away from home for more than a year. And while McMurdo was about as remote as it could get, the Naval meteorologist did enjoy a daily post-work martini while staying at the base.</p>
<p>Grisham also says that one of the few luxuries he had was being able to call his wife Wilma via shortwave radio once a week. The two—along with their childrenexchanged messages while waiting for his return. Wilma passed away in 2000 and Paul has since remarried. </p>
<p>That’s a far cry from what life is like at McMurdo these days, which is now equipped with state of the art satellite communications systems and relatively quick internet. While the base does remain remote and isolated, it is no longer cut off from the rest of the world in terms of daily interactions. </p>
<p>That said, it still isn’t a place where you’d want to lose your wallet. Chances are, you probably wouldn’t be as lucky as Paul and have it returned to you, although it would make for an equally great story. </p>

    </span></p><p>At some point, rather recently, I began to rethink part of my approach to software developent. <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky's</a> <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/04/21/dont-let-architecture-astronauts-scare-you/"><em>Architecture Astronauts</em> post</a>, of decades ago, has been weighing on me.</p><p>I began to grow tired of unnecessary complexity, over-abstractions, library bloat, feature bloat, and the subsequent documentation bloat. Not to mention, dependency bloat. I know, I should probably write a blog post about software bloat in general.</p><p>Specifically, and with that in mind, I think that state management with React should not be hard; it should not be bloated or over-abstracted. After all, we are really just talking about writing and/or fetching values stored in some variables that an application has access to.</p><p>The barrier to entry, especially with React state management, should not be hard assuming that you know how to React.</p><p>(The irony of my aforementioned statements along with <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html">React Hooks</a>, and what I am about to share, is not lost on me in all of this.)</p><p>So, that is why I, with help and ideas from <a href="https://www.dev.to/droopytersen">Andrew Petersen</a>, created <a href="https://www.launchio.dev/">Launch.IO</a>; an ultra hip, simple, smart, and fast, React state management library. I think that great libraries should be fun and rewarding to developers, and so I added <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel_debugging">time travel debugging</a>.</p><p>I am not going to get into <code>code</code> in this blog post, so feel free to pause for one minute, and grok the <a href="https://www.launchio.dev/">Launch.IO website</a> or go straight to the <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/launchio-demo-yqo2n">CodeSandbox Demo</a>. The website is one simple page and it covers install, setup, and basic use cases. If you are enjoying what you are reading, you can take an extra 5 minutes and read <em>all</em> of the <a href="https://github.com/launch-io/launch.io/blob/master/docs/api/index.md">Launch.IO API documentation</a>.</p><p>Launch.IO provides the means to easily and consistently define your application state into as many different domain services as you see fit. Services require a name (for access), initial state, and a set of actions that should be pure functions that return the new service state. The actions within these services, since they are pure, will predictably update their service state and this subsquently allows for the time travel debugging.</p><p>Launch.IO provides a React Hook to allow components to pass selector functions which return the state and/or actions, from the defined services, that your components need to leverage or launch (invoke). No special setup or component integration is required and you can rewind or fast-forward time as needed.</p><p>The core of Launch.IO is actually entirely independent of React. The glue that binds the two is the React Hook, <code>useLaunch</code>, that comes with the library. If I were feeling extra motivated, Launch.IO could be ported to Angular, Vue, or <!-- -->[insert your UI library]<!-- -->, but I am not feeling motiviated... yet.</p><p>I have spent a lot of time working with various React state management libraries. Many of them I still love, and I even used patterns (obviously) from some of them in Launch.IO. Compared to those libraries, however, Launch.IO aims to scale back the abstractions, boilerplate, features, and other bloat that is probably not required to be successful when managing React state.</p><p>You probably don't need the overhead and extended features of other React state management libraries. You just need Launch.IO and some good vanilla ice cream.</p></section></div></div>]]>

                <div>
                    <div data-clipboard="Copy link to clipboard."><p>One of the best ways to make software more accessible is to reduce the hardware resources needed to run it. Blockchain software is no exception. The XRP Ledger is already <a href="https://xrpl.org/carbon-calculator.html">one of the greenest blockchains</a> due to its pioneering consensus protocol, but its ecosystem can still benefit from more efficient resource usage. Reduced inefficiencies benefit businesses, developers, and enthusiasts alike.</p><p>So how much can we really improve?</p><p>The C++ team at Ripple spent a significant amount of time in 2020 focusing on how to make better use of available system resources. We're proud to report that, compared to previous versions, the improvements we've contributed to version 1.7.0 of <code>rippled</code>, our reference implementation of the XRP Ledger server, cut its memory usage to <em>less than half</em>.</p><p>That's not a typo and these aren't theoretical numbers. These are <em>real-world</em> improvements of more than 50% in servers running <code>rippled</code> on the XRP Ledger mainnet. The operator of <a href="https://alloy.ee/">alloy.ee</a> calls it "sheer voodoo":</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1.7b9 is sheer voodoo - The higher one is 1.6.0 <a href="https://t.co/NOlqAmpvBU">pic.twitter.com/NOlqAmpvBU</a></p>— Alloy Networks (@alloynetworks) <a href="https://twitter.com/alloynetworks/status/1341495806893973506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 22, 2020</a></blockquote>

<figcaption>"Sheer voodoo"</figcaption></figure><p>Keep reading to learn the technical details that made this engineering work possible.</p><p>Alongside our other experiments, we set out to measure and understand how <code>rippled</code> uses resources and how to improve it.</p><p>As a result of these measurements, we contributed support for link compression in <a href="https://xrpl.org/blog/2020/rippled-1.6.0.html">version 1.6.0</a>, which reduces the amount of bandwidth used by servers, benefiting operators of single servers and large clusters alike.</p><p>We're also working on optimizing how messages are propagated or routed throughout the XRP Ledger network so that every server receives everything it needs to know without getting redundant copies of info.</p><p>However, the primary pain-point for many operators of the software is RAM usage. Memory is a critical and scarce resource. Reducing the amount required by the server could have an outsized impact on the performance of individual servers, and potentially, the network as a whole.</p><p>To get the best return on our effort, we focused on identifying what parts of the server used the most RAM and experimented with what we could do about them.</p><h2 id="understanding-shamap"><strong>Understanding SHAMap</strong></h2><p>In <code>rippled</code>, one of the largest targets was the SHAMap and its constituent parts—specifically, the nodes within the SHAMap's tree-like structure.</p><p>This data structure holds the state of <a href="https://xrpl.org/ledgers.html">the ledger itself</a>—all the accounts, balances, settings, exchange orders, and everything else the XRP Ledger tracks. On the mainnet, the SHAMap consists of millions of nodes, which means that even small savings in the size of individual nodes can result in large savings overall.</p><p>More precisely, the SHAMap is a combination of a <a href="https://medium.com/@theblockchaincafe/what-is-merkle-tree-complete-guide-for-beginners-9bcf4631bb19">Merkle tree</a> and a <a href="https://medium.com/basecs/compressing-radix-trees-without-too-many-tears-a2e658adb9a0">Radix tree</a> with a branching factor of 16. This branching factor is especially relevant in this instance. It means that the <em>inner nodes</em> in the tree (the nodes other than the "leaves") can have <em>up to</em> 16 children. For example, consider this simple tree:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/2021/02/Tree-01.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Tree-01.png 600w, https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Tree-01.png 1000w, https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/Tree-01.png 1600w, https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/size/w2400/2021/02/Tree-01.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>Each node has 16 children, whether they point to something or not. And that was the key insight: just because nodes can have <em>up to</em> 16 children doesn't mean that they actually do in practice.</p><p>The question then became, how many children does a "typical" inner node have? We gathered data from Ripple-operated servers, which resulted in the following distribution:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/2021/02/Histogram.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Histogram.png 600w, https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Histogram.png 1000w, https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/Histogram.png 1600w, https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/size/w2400/2021/02/Histogram.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>The data we collected shows that most inner nodes only have a handful of children. With that in mind, we examined if the nodes of the tree could be adjusted, at runtime, to accommodate only as many children as they needed.</p><p>In other words, what if we changed the tree to look more like this?</p><figure><img src="https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/2021/02/Tree-02.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Tree-02.png 600w, https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Tree-02.png 1000w, https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/Tree-02.png 1600w, https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/size/w2400/2021/02/Tree-02.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><h3 id="the-naive-shamap-design"><strong>The Naive SHAMap Design</strong></h3><p>The SHAMap is a tree-like data structure where keys are 256-bit hashes, and a node in the tree (other than the leaves), can have up to 16 children. Children are always stored as a 256-bit hash value that can be used to retrieve the child node from a database. Children are also sometimes cached directly in a node for quick traversal.</p><p>The original implementation of the non-leaf nodes had a C++ class that looked a bit like this:</p><pre><code>struct SHAMapInnerNode {
    std::bitset&lt;16&gt; isBranch_;
    SHAMapHash hashes_[16];
    std::shared_ptr&lt;SHAMapTreeNode&gt; cachedChildren_[16];
}</code></pre><p>To traverse the tree, the code looks at the 256-bit key four bits at a time. These 4-bit numbers represent which of the sixteen children to transition to next. This means the children are ordered, and it's possible that some branches (such as 2, 5, and 7) are occupied while the rest are empty.</p><p>The <code>isBranch_</code><em> </em>variable tracks which branches have children and which are empty, but the <code>hashes_[16]</code> array always leaves space for sixteen 256-bit identifiers anyway.</p><h3 id="sparse-shamap"><strong>Sparse SHAMap</strong></h3><p>Instead of always storing sixteen children, we want to use a space-saving sparse representation when there are only a few children and only switch to the dense representation when there are more children.</p><p>Such a representation could look like this:</p><pre><code>struct SHAMapInnerNode {
    std::bitset&lt;16&gt; isBranch_;
    SHAMapHash* hashes_;
    std::shared_ptr&lt;SHAMapTreeNode&gt;* cachedChildren_;
    std::uint8_t arraySize_;
}
</code></pre><p>A sparse representation would store <code>hashes_</code> and <code>cachedChildren_</code> without gaps. For example, if branches 2, 5, and 7 are occupied while the rest are empty, then <code>hashes_</code> would store these values at indexes 0, 1, and 2. To look up a child in a sparse array, count how many non-empty branches come before it.</p><p>For example, if branches 2, 5, and 7 are occupied, and you want to find the child in branch 5, there's 1 branch with an index less than 5, so you'd look at array index 1 of the <code>hashes_</code> array.</p><p>How much memory does this save? Each hash is 256 bits—that's 32 bytes—and each shared pointer is 16 bytes. That means that every time the sparse representation doesn't leave empty space for a nonexistent child that the naive, dense implementation would have, you save 48 bytes.</p><p>With the data we had collected on how many children the nodes in the SHAMap really had when used in production, we could calculate how much memory could be saved by using a sparse representation.</p><p>The following Python code demonstrates how to perform such a calculation:</p><pre><code>def savings(child_hist, arg_indexes):
"""
Given a histogram of the number of children, and the array size boundaries,
calculate the ratio of memory used for a sparse representation/memory used
for a dense representation
"""
if not arg_indexes:
	return 1.0
# add one (and copy so we don't modify original list)
indexes = [a+1 for a in arg_indexes]
	if indexes[0] != 0:
indexes.insert(0, 0)
	if indexes[-1] != 17:
indexes.append(17)
per_child_bytes = 48.0 # 32 for the hash 16 for the shared_ptr
dense_bytes = 16.0 * per_child_bytes * sum(child_hist)
sparse_bytes = 0.0
	for i in range(1, len(indexes)):
		sparse_bytes += ((indexes[i]-1) *
				per_child_bytes *
				sum(child_hist[indexes[i-1]:indexes[i]])
				)

But doing that brings in other costs. For example, when you have a size-10 array and you need to add an 11th child, you need to allocate space for a size-11 array and copy all 10 existing entries into the new array.</p><p>Another approach is to have just two sizes of arrays. For example, you might use a sparse array with room for up to 5 children, and a dense array when you need to hold 6 to 16.</p><p>This approach still wastes some space (i.e. when the sparse array has just 1 of its 5 spots occupied, or when the dense array uses only 6 or 7 of its 16 spots, it's simpler and faster than constantly changing the size of the array). Alternatively, we could have different 3 sizes or more (i.e. 3, 6, 16).</p><p>To decide between all the possibilities, we had to consider the trade-offs of different numbers of sparse array sizes. This kind of analysis is common in engineering and even in other disciplines; it's kind of like deciding how many different sizes of jeans you want to manufacture to make the most profit.</p><p>In our case, we considered all of the following in deciding how to approach the problem:</p><ol><li>Costs of moving data when the sparse array changes representations. If you need to add a child and the current sparse array is full, you need to allocate a new array and move the data into it.</li><li>Costs of inserting and removing data in the sparse array. Since the sparse arrays are sorted, you have to move elements around whenever you add or remove children from them. Keeping the sparse arrays small reduces the amount of data movement necessary.</li><li>Space savings. The more sparse array sizes, the greater the savings. However, we expected diminishing returns from each additional size option.</li><li>Implementation considerations. A tagged pointer (described below) can be used to store a small number of bits without using additional space. Keeping the number of array sizes below this number results in additional savings.</li></ol><p>Fortunately, we didn't have to make these decisions based on pure intuition and generalizations. Using our histogram data, we could calculate the actual space savings of various numbers and sizes of sparse arrays, which helped us figure out where the diminishing returns actually kicked in.</p><p>The following code helps compute this.</p><pre><code>def savings_dim(dim=1):

<p>This post has been delayed by several months, as some other things (like <a href="https://destevez.net/tag/ce5/">Chang’e 5</a>) kept getting in the way. As part of the <a href="https://www.gnuradio.org/">GNU Radio</a> activities in <a href="https://www.seti.org/ata">Allen Telescope Array</a>, on 14 November 2020 we tried to detect the X-band signal of <a href="https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/">Voyager-1</a>, which at that time was at a distance of 151.72 au (22697 millions of km) from Earth. After analysing the recorded IQ data to carefully correct for Doppler and stack up all the signal power, I <a href="https://twitter.com/ea4gpz/status/1330617930229436416">published in Twitter</a> the news that the signal could clearly be seen in some of the recordings.</p>



<p>Since then, I have been intending to write a post explaining in detail the signal processing and publishing the recorded data. I must add that detecting Voyager-1 with ATA was a significant feat. Since November, we have attempted to detect Voyager-1 again on another occasion, using the same signal processing pipeline, without any luck. Since in the optimal conditions the signal is already very weak, it has to be ensured that all the equipment is working properly. Problems are difficult to debug, because any issue will typically impede successful detection, without giving an indication of what went wrong.</p>



<p>I have published the IQ recordings of this observation in the following datasets in <a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a>:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4521217">Voyager-1 recording with Allen Telescope Array on 2020-11-14: scan 1/4</a></li><li><a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4522166">Voyager-1 recording with Allen Telescope Array on 2020-11-14: scan 2/4</a></li><li><a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4524683">Voyager-1 recording with Allen Telescope Array on 2020-11-14: scan 3/4</a></li><li><a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4527040">Voyager-1 recording with Allen Telescope Array on 2020-11-14: scan 4/4</a></li></ul>



<h4>Observation set up</h4>



<p>The observation was done between 18:30 and 21:30 UTC on 2020-11-14, when Voyager-1 was between 40 and 60 degrees elevation. Antennas 1a and 4g were used. These are two antennas having the older feeds described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0904.0762">this paper</a>, which have lower performance at X-band than the newer feeds donated by Franklin Antonio, which are described <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02252">here</a>. The reason for choosing antennas with older feeds was to have two antennas having the same feed type, as that might simplify calibration for beamforming (which would become necessary if the signal was too weak to be detected with a single dish). At that time we only had access to antenna 4g with one of the USRPs used by the GNU Radio team, so we chose a matching older feed antenna to use with the other USRP.</p>



<p>The dual polarization signals from the antennas were taken to LO d in the RF converter board, which converted 8419.7 MHz down to an IF of 512 MHz. The IF was received and digitised with a <a href="https://www.ettus.com/all-products/usrp-n321/">USRP N321</a> and a <a href="https://www.ettus.com/all-products/usrp-n320/">USRP N320</a>. The two X and Y polarizations of antenna 1a were routed to the two channels of the USRP N321, and the two polarizations of antenna 4g were received with the USRP N320. The LO of the first channel of the USRP N321 was <a href="https://kb.ettus.com/USRP_N320/N321_LO_Distribution#N321_.2B_N320_Cabling_Diagram">exported and shared to all the other channels</a>. GNU Radio was used to record synchronized baseband IQ data from the two USRPs at a sample rate of 960 ksps using <code>int16</code> format.</p>



<p>In order to make beamforming possible later on with the recordings, interferometric observations of the compact calibrator 1733-130 were done. This source appears in the list of <a href="https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/vla/observing/callist">VLA calibrators</a>, and it was near the position of Voyager-1 on the sky. These observations would allow us to calibrate the phase offsets between the two antennas if needed for beamforming.</p>



<p>The observation was organized as four 30 minute scans of Voyager-1 interleaved with 5 minute scans of the calibrator. Longer scans of the calibrator were done before and after the four scans of Voyager-1.</p>



<h4>Signal processing</h4>



<p>The signal processing of the IQ recordings is done in this <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/ata_notebooks/blob/main/Voyager-1/Voyager-1%202020-11-14.ipynb">Jupyter notebook</a>, which can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/ata_notebooks">ata_notebooks</a> Github repository.</p>



<p>The first step is to fetch the ephemeris data from <a href="https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi">JPL HORIZONS</a> using <a href="https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Astroquery</a>. I learned this library from <a href="https://twitter.com/bistromath/">Nick Foster</a>, who has a similar <a href="https://github.com/bistromath/voyager/blob/master/voyager.ipynb">Jupyter notebook</a> to process Voyager-1 recordings done with ATA on 2010. We need the range-rate from the ephemerides in order to compute and correct for the downlink Doppler, which is shown below.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/voyager1_downlink_doppler.png"><img width="644" height="336" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/voyager1_downlink_doppler-644x336.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/voyager1_downlink_doppler-644x336.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/voyager1_downlink_doppler-300x156.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/voyager1_downlink_doppler.png 662w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>The a priori estimate for the spacecraft’s transmit frequency was 8420.432097 MHz. In order to take the downlink Doppler into account, the recording was centred at 8419.7 MHz, as mentioned above. The residual Doppler that should appear in the baseband data is as follows.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/voyager1_residual_doppler.png"><img width="644" height="345" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/voyager1_residual_doppler.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/voyager1_residual_doppler.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/voyager1_residual_doppler-300x161.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>The signal will be detected in a sub-Hz FFT resolution bandwidth, so we want our Doppler correction calculations to have precision of mHz. Therefore, the range-rate data is fetched from Horizons in steps of approximately 8.6 seconds and linearly interpolated to a grid with 10 ms spacing. The carrier phase corresponding to the integrated Doppler is computed over this 10 ms grid.</p>



<p><a href="https://dask.org/">Dask</a> is used for parallel computation and on demand loading of the IQ data by chunks. Each of the 30 minute scans is processed separately. The first step in the signal processing chain amounts to removing the DC spike. This is done by grouping the samples in segments of approximately 0.5 seconds and subtracting from each segment its average.</p>



<p>Next, the average power per channel over all the 30 minute scan is computed. Each channel is divided by its average power in order to normalize the power, since each channel has different amplitude gains. Then, LHCP and RHCP polarizations are synthesised from the linear X and Y polarizations. To do so, the phase offset between the X and Y channels of each antenna is needed. These phase offsets were measured by receiving the RHCP X-band signal from Tianwen-1 at 8431 MHz earlier that day. The phase offsets are assumed to be the same at the receive frequency for Voyager-1.</p>



<p>The phase for Doppler correction is linearly interpolated from its 10 ms grid to each sample and applied in order to correct for Doppler. Finally, an FFT with a bin size of 458 mHz, rectangular window and no overlaps is applied to the data and average power spectral densities are computed per antenna, polarization and scan.</p>



<h4>Results</h4>



<p>A preliminary step to assess the quality of the IQ recordings is to plot the power of each channel versus time. Since the signal is tiny in the 960 kHz bandwidth, this gives basically the power of the noise floor, which can change due to changes in gain, noise figure, interference, etc. Plotting the power can help us spot any obvious problems such as the sudden increases in the noise floor that we are <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/12/change-5-observations-from-ata-on-december-19-and-20/">seeing with some of the Chang’e 5 recordings</a>.</p>



<p>Since each of the channels has a different gain, we normalize the power in each channel by dividing by the average power of that channel computed over all the four scans. This makes the power be centred about one, and gives the figure below. We see that the power variation is only of a few percent, so everything seems alright.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/power_per_channel.png"><img width="644" height="302" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/power_per_channel-644x302.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/power_per_channel-644x302.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/power_per_channel-300x141.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/power_per_channel-768x360.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/power_per_channel.png 851w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>The first step in processing the Doppler corrected spectra is to perform a bandpass calibration to flatten out the bandpass frequency response. This is done by fitting a degree four polynomial to the average spectra of each antenna and polarization (ignoring the steep skirts at the edges). The figure below shows the uncorrected spectra and the estimated bandpass shape. The peak of the Voyager-1 signal can already be seen clearly in the LHCP signal from antenna 4g, and also in antenna 1a, albeit a bit weaker.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bandpass_calibration.png"><img width="644" height="376" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bandpass_calibration-644x376.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bandpass_calibration-644x376.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bandpass_calibration-300x175.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bandpass_calibration.png 722w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>The bandpass calibrated spectra are show below.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bandpass_calibration_done.png"><img width="644" height="381" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bandpass_calibration_done-644x381.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bandpass_calibration_done-644x381.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bandpass_calibration_done-300x178.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bandpass_calibration_done.png 713w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>The average power spectral density for the LHCP polarizations between both antennas is computed and transformed to significance level (units of sigmas) by subtracting one, which is the average noise power, and dividing by the standard deviation. We get the figure below, which shows a detection at a level of 13.2 sigmas at a transmit frequency of 8420430170.7 Hz. This frequency is close to the a priori expected transmit frequency, so we are confident that this detection is in fact the Voyager-1 carrier. Moreover, if the Doppler correction is disabled, the detection peak disappears completely.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/voyager1_detection.png"><img src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/voyager1_detection-644x306.png" alt=""></a></figure>



<p>The next figure shows the power spectra in each of the antennas and polarizations per scan. We see that there is a clear peak in the first two scans, the peak is weaker in the third one, and disappears in the last scan. The reason why the SNR decreases throughout the observation is not known.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/voyager1_detection_per_scan.png"><img width="644" height="375" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/voyager1_detection_per_scan-644x375.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/voyager1_detection_per_scan-644x375.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/voyager1_detection_per_scan-300x175.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/voyager1_detection_per_scan-768x447.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/voyager1_detection_per_scan.png 936w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>The estimates of C/N0 for the first two scans are given in the table below. These should be taken carefully. They are coarse estimates, since the signal is weak. The C/N0’s for the last two scans are not given, since the signal is already too weak.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong>Antenna 1a</strong></td><td><strong>Antenna 4g</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>First scan</strong></td><td>-8.5 dB·Hz</td><td>-6.4 dB·Hz</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Second Scan</strong></td><td>-8.8 dB·Hz</td><td>-6.7 dB·Hz</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>C/N0 estimates for the first two scans</figcaption></figure>



<p>There seems to be a difference in performance of 2.1 dB between antennas 1a and 4g that needs to be investigated further.</p>



<h4>Conclusions</h4>



<p>Doing a link budget for Voyager-1 is not so easy, since we don’t have an accurate estimate of its transmit power. Perhaps, it’s better to work with the estimated received power shown in <a href="https://eyes.nasa.gov/dsn/dsn.html">NASA DSN Now</a>, which is around -156 dBm for a 70 m antenna (under bad weather conditions, the signal may drop to -161 dBm, as shown by <a href="https://twitter.com/nascom1">Richard Stephenson</a> in <a href="https://twitter.com/nascom1/status/1358617187641028609">this tweet</a>). Assuming the same efficiency, one of the ATA 6.1 m antennas should receive a power of -177.2 dBm. At a system noise temperature of 60 K (which is taken from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0904.0762">this paper</a> but perhaps too optimistic), the noise floor is at -181 dBm/Hz, so we should find the carrier at a CN0 of 3.8 dB.</p>



<p>It seems that the CN0 we measured is 10 dB below this estimate, so either there is something wrong with the estimate or there is room for improvement with the receive chain at ATA. This is something that we’ll need to look into in the future, by measuring the performance of the system in terms of noise figure, gain, etc.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, we have shown that it’s possible to detect with the current equipment the Voyager-1 carrier at a CN0 of around -7 dB·Hz. If the power spectrum is normalized so that the noise has unity power spectral density, and we use an FFT bin size of 500 mHz, the carrier will have a power of …</p></div></article></div>

<p>If you ever had a look at <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/bitcoin_quotes_globex.html">CME’s Bitcoin futures</a>, you might have noticed that there are multiple contracts – one for each month, and that they have different prices. Systematically, the futures contracts for months that are further away, are more expensive than those with closer expiration, and also cheaper than spot. When this happens for a commodity like oil, we’re talking about contango.</p>



<p>This is usually due to the fact that there’s a risk premium on the uncertainty of the future, and it costs a little bit to be sure of the price that you’ll pay for something three months from now. But for futures on financial products, it’s very rare. Currently, the premium for Bitcoin is a whopping 2% per month, and it’s a red warning sign.</p>



<h3>Term structure of Bitcoin futures</h3>



<p>The reason contango for commodities like oil is normal, is that you can’t arbitrage it. The way to arbitrage contango is to buy spot, short the future, wait till expiry, and collect the premium. But you can’t simply “wait” when you buy thousands of barrels of oil – you have to store those barrels somewhere, and it will cost you an arm and a leg. The storage costs will eat up your contango premium, plus some.</p>



<p>There were occurrences in the past where traders were able to arbitrage this premium, but the contango needed to be absolutely off-the-charts (“super-contango”). For instance, after the 2008 financial panic, the spread between spot and futures in the oil market was so big, <a href="https://doc.rero.ch/record/323428/files/TDIBM_Loris_Beltramello.pdf">traders would literally rent tankers and use them as storage facilities</a> for oil, waiting for their futures leg to mature.</p>



<p>The reason contango for financial products isn’t normal, is that you can arbitrage it very easily, as you don’t have storage costs. You buy Bitcoin spot, sell an April future for 4% more than spot, and simply wait two months.</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-16-at-13.42.35.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-16-at-13.42.35.png 952w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-16-at-13.42.35-300x79.png 300w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-16-at-13.42.35-768x203.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 952px) 100vw, 952px"></figure>



<p>At expiry, you’ll sell your Bitcoin at a certain price, while the future will settle at the exact same price, and you’ll collect the premium. Your only cost is the carry, i.e. the interest you have forfeited on the cash you used to buy Bitcoin, but this is virtually zero today.</p>



<p>Why the premium, then? Why don’t hedge funds with hundreds of billions of dollars to spare don’t arbitrage the Bitcoin contango down to zero?</p>



<h3>Credit risk?</h3>



<p>One quick answer would be that you aren’t guaranteed to close your trade because of counterparty risk. This is what happened when Lehman went bust – all the hedge funds that had OTC derivatives positions with Lehman as one leg of a trade, suddenly saw the “Lehman leg” disappear, while the other leg was still there. Lehman going bust single handedly destroyed the convertible bonds market, as hedge funds who had bought convertible bonds and hedged their risks (credit, volatility, equity risks – you name it) with Lehman, suddenly were out of hedges, and had to sell their cash position (their convertible bonds) at literally any price.</p>



<p>But there is no counterparty risk here. You can’t lose your Bitcoins – you just keep them on chain, and no exchange going bust will affect your position. CME can’t go bust – it has margin calls, initial margin deposits, has a guarantee fund, and is almost explicitly guaranteed by the Fed because of its critical importance to financial markets.</p>



<p>So, again, why is nobody picking those hundred dollar bills lying on the street?</p>



<h3>Systemic risk</h3>



<p>There is one risk that you can’t edge – that of the world collapsing overnight, when there’s nobody left to pay you even if you win your bet. Imagine shorting USDT on Binance. What happens if you’re right and USDT goes to zero? Do you really think Binance will still be around to pay you?</p>



<p>You can always say, “bah, I’ll see it coming, the moment shit starts to hit the fan, I’ll close my positions”. But what if you don’t have the time to do so? What if a black swan event happens overnight?</p>



<p>This is the risk with Bitcoin. A whim from regulators, like passing the STABLE act, and all USDT exchanges go bust. What will happen to Bitcoin futures then? CME uses the “<a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/cryptocurrency-indices.html">Bitcoin Reference Rate</a>” (BRR) to calculate the spot for its Bitcoin futures, which is a weighted average of the spots taken from multiple crypto exchanges, the list of which changes over time. What happens if the Bitcoin ecosystem collapses, the prices of Bitcoin on half of those exchanges go to 100,000 on paper because those exchanges become insolvent and people rush for the exits by buying Bitcoin to try and send it to their own wallets (as happened with MtGox)? Futures skyrocket because of a technicality, CME is slow to react, and you get wiped out on your “short futures” leg – while you can’t really sell the “long Bitcoin” leg either, because every exchange is on fire and nobody processes redemption requests.</p>



<h3>Implied probability of default</h3>



<p>This risk is rewarded handsomely – a big fat 2% per month. With interest rates at zero, we can borrow a formula from the Credit Default Swaps market to calculate the <a href="https://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/15986/how-to-compute-the-implied-probability-of-default-from-a-cds-spread#:~:text=Risk%2Dneutral%20default%20probability%20implied,R%20is%20the%20recovery%20rate.&amp;text=Hulls%20equation%20is%20a%20gross,works%20for%20all%20tenor%20points.">implied probability of default</a>, which we’ll <a href="http://nzz-files-prod.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/files/4/1/2/cds+deutsche+bank+161214_1.18446412.pdf">simplify to the extreme</a>:</p>



<p><strong>p = S/(1-R)</strong></p>



<p>Where p is the probability of default, S the annual “swap rate” that compensates for that probability, and R the recovery rate, i.e. how much you can expect to recoup from your investment if a default occurs.</p>



<p>In our case, S = 24% (12 months in a year, at 2% for each month), and R ≈ 50% based on what happened after MtGox collapsed. This means that we assume you’ll be able to cash out in the event of an apocalypse with an average 50% loss. Remember, this is assuming that you are hedged!</p>



<p>This gives us an implied probability of default p ≈ 50% over the next year. Again, that’s the probability of the whole Bitcoin ecosystem collapsing overnight, not giving you the time to close your positions, cutting you off from exchanges, and where CME futures no longer trade.</p>



<p>This is the risk as it’s being priced by the market, on relatively liquid financial instruments. So the next time someone tries to explain to you that “Bitcoin is a store of value”, when the chances of it getting utterly destroyed overnight before the year is over are around 50/50, try not to shoot coffee through your nose laughing.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Having started my career as a software developer in 2013 with an undergraduate degree in Mathematics, I never got the
chance to take some of the higher-level courses on subjects like compilers, programming languages, or databases. In 2020
I set out to correct some of the gaps in my knowledge, and one of the ways I did so was by writing my own database, in
Haskell, from scratch. This series of posts chronicles the decisions I made along the way.</p>

<p>If you’d like to skip ahead and read the code, it’s <a href="https://github.com/dfithian/dfdb">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-was-interested-in">What I was interested in</h2>

<p>In starting this project, I was most interested in (a) how the data was stored, (b) transactionality, and (c) how
indexes work.</p>

<p>I found out pretty quickly that data is stored in a B-tree (see below) in most circumstances. Since there are many
how-tos out there already I decided I was more interested in index creation and management. Nevertheless, in order to
index my data I’d still need a tree representation, and I hadn’t written one in a while, so I made a halfhearted
attempt.</p>

<h2 id="efficient-searches-use-trees">Efficient searches use trees</h2>

<p>In any most implementations you’d probably want to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree">B Tree</a> as the
underlying data structure. The TL;DR is that B-trees are good at managing access to files while keeping only small
chunks of those files in memory at any time.</p>

<p>I ended up settling on using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree">Red Black Tree</a>. It has many of
the same properties as the B Tree (self balancing, efficient), and is simpler since it doesn’t need access to a file
system. Since this was mostly a project for my own learning, I figured I could just write the tree to disk whenever I
wished.</p>

<h3 id="tree-definition">Tree definition</h3>

<p>I won’t go into the implementation specifics, since the algorithm is copied from the Wikipedia article, but I’ll quickly
go over the data declaration so that later discussion makes sense.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Color</span> <span>=</span> <span>Red</span> <span>|</span> <span>Black</span>
  <span>deriving</span> <span>(</span><span>Eq</span><span>,</span> <span>Ord</span><span>,</span> <span>Generic</span><span>)</span>

<span>data</span> <span>TreeMap</span> <span>a</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>Node</span> <span>!</span><span>a</span> <span>!</span><span>b</span> <span>Color</span> <span>!</span><span>(</span><span>TreeMap</span> <span>a</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>!</span><span>(</span><span>TreeMap</span> <span>a</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>|</span> <span>Nil</span>

<span>type</span> <span>Tree</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>TreeMap</span> <span>a</span> <span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A <code>TreeMap a b</code> node either contains a key <code>a</code>, a value <code>b</code>, a color, and left/right branches, or is a leaf node (<code>Nil</code>).</p>

<p>For testing purposes, define the <code>Tree</code> type to be unitary values, since we really care about finding and inserting keys
efficiently, and we don’t really care about the data (other than that it’s there).</p>

<h3 id="property-testing">Property testing</h3>

<h4 id="definitions">Definitions</h4>

<p>Any recursive code always needs a good set of property tests. Luckily for us, Red Black Trees already have a list of
laws (source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree#Properties">Wikipedia</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In addition to the requirements imposed on a binary search tree the following must be satisfied by a red–black tree:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Each node is either red or black.</li>
    <li>The root is black. This rule is sometimes omitted. Since the root can always be changed from red to black, but not
necessarily vice versa, this rule has little effect on analysis.</li>
    <li>All leaves (NIL) are black.</li>
    <li>If a node is red, then both its children are black.</li>
    <li>Every path from a given node to any of its descendant NIL nodes goes through the same number of black nodes.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="laws">Laws</h4>

<p>Right out the gate, the first three properties listed above are either correct by construction or trivial to test. We
defined a <code>Color</code> type, with only two constructors, so nodes of the tree can only inhabit one of those two colors.
Testing whether the root node is black isn’t very interesting, since it’s easy to set it to black after any operation.
Finally, by omitting a color in the definition of a leaf node we can ensure that its color is black.</p>

<h5 id="binary-search-law">Binary Search Law</h5>

<p>Our first property test is to ensure that any tree we generate adheres to the binary search property.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>checkBinary</span> <span>::</span> <span>(</span><span>HasCallStack</span><span>,</span> <span>Ord</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Tree</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>
<span>checkBinary</span> <span>=</span> <span>\</span> <span>case</span>
  <span>Tree</span><span>.</span><span>Nil</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>True</span>
  <span>Tree</span><span>.</span><span>Node</span> <span>x</span> <span>_</span> <span>_</span> <span>tl</span> <span>tr</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>all</span> <span>(</span><span>\</span> <span>l</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>l</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>Tree</span><span>.</span><span>setToList</span> <span>tl</span><span>)</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>all</span> <span>(</span><span>\</span> <span>r</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>r</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>Tree</span><span>.</span><span>setToList</span> <span>tr</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, we check that every element on the left side of the root is less than the root, and vice-versa for the right side.
Since we will be running this test for hundreds of test cases, we don’t care that we’re only checking the root node, as
we’ll be generating many different depths.</p>

<h5 id="children-of-red-nodes">Children of Red Nodes</h5>

<p>Our second property test is to ensure that children of a red node are black.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>checkColor</span> <span>::</span> <span>HasCallStack</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Tree</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>

<p>Pass a counter through a traversal of the tree. For each subtree, verify that its subtrees satisfy the predicate, and
increment the counter if the root node of that subtree is black. Warning, you may have to squint.</p>

<p>We want to ensure that any mutation we apply to a tree results in a tree that satisfies the laws we set out above. For
simplicity, I have outlined only tree creation and element insertion here, but we would want to property test each

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The paper suggests new daily indicators of consumers' inflation expectations built using machine learning techniques and textual analysis drawn from the microblogging and social networking service, Twitter. Trends in these indicators are compared both with monthly inflation expectations based on the Istat surveys and with those obtained daily from the market prices of derivative contracts on inflation (inflation swaps), which measure the expectations only indirectly, because they include unobservable risk premia.</p>
<p>Adopting the most recent specific algorithms for dealing with big and voluminous data (Big Data Analytics), the paper shows that the Twitter-based indicators are significantly correlated with the other existing measures of inflation expectations. Furthermore, these indicators have a superior forecasting power for survey-based monthly inflation expectations than all the other available sources. Therefore, they represent an additional source of information available in real time.</p></div></div>]]>

couple of threats on the end user's side that you as a developer can help mitigate. They include: </p><ul><li>Attacks through malicious websites/links in the user's browser.</li><li>Attacks on the user's local network.</li><li>Attacks where someone accesses a shared web browser before or after the user (for example if sensitive information is left in the browser cache then subsequent computer users will be able to retrieve it even if the previous user has logged out).</li></ul><h3 id="-use-https-and-only-https-to-protect-your-users-from-network-attacks"><a href="#-use-https-and-only-https-to-protect-your-users-from-network-attacks"><i></i> Use HTTPS and only HTTPS to protect your users from network attacks</a></h3><p><img width="706" height="246" alt="https" src="https://www.appsecmonkey.com/img/web-application-security-checklist/https.webp"></p><p>This one you probably already knew. Encrypt <strong>all</strong> connections between your user's web browser and your web server. Doesn't hurt to also disable some of the older cipher suites and protocols.</p><p>It is <strong>not</strong> enough to encrypt the "sensitive" portions of a website. A single unencrypted HTTP request anywhere under the <em>domain</em> can be intercepted by an attacker on the network, who can then forge a response from the server with malicious content in it.</p><p>Luckily HTTPS is easy these days, you can get both the certificate (LetsEncrypt) and tools for automatic certificate creation/management (CertBot) free of charge.</p><blockquote><p><i></i> Further reading</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.ssl.com/guide/ssl-best-practices/" target="_blank">SSL/TLS Best Practices for 2021</a></li><li><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" target="_blank">LetsEncrypt</a></li><li><a href="https://certbot.eff.org/" target="_blank">CertBot</a></li></ul></blockquote><h3 id="-use-hsts-and-preloading-to-protect-your-users-from-ssl-stripping-attacks"><a href="#-use-hsts-and-preloading-to-protect-your-users-from-ssl-stripping-attacks"><i></i> Use HSTS and preloading to protect your users from SSL stripping attacks</a></h3><p>HSTS or <code>Strict-Transport-Security</code> is a header that can be used to tell web browsers that <em>from here on always use an encrypted connection (HTTPS) when connecting to this domain</em>.</p><p>This will prevent so-called <em>SSL stripping</em> attacks where an attacker on the network intercepts the very first HTTP request made by a browser (which is often unencrypted), and forges a reply to that unencrypted HTTP request right away, pretending to be the server and downgrading the connection to intercepted plaintext HTTP from then on.</p><p>One caveat is that HSTS will only protect an application if the user has already successfully visited it before. To overcome this limitation you should submit your site to <a href="https://hstspreload.org/" target="_blank">https://hstspreload.org</a> so browser vendors can hard code your domain to the HSTS list.</p><h4 id="example">Example</h4><pre><code><span>Strict-Transport-Security</span><span>:</span> max<span>-</span>age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload</code></pre><blockquote><h4 id="-warning"><i></i> Warning</h4><p>Be mindful when implementing HSTS.

      </p>
<p>
Throughout <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dream-Machine-M-Mitchell-Waldrop/dp/1732265119"><em>The Dream Machine</em></a>, a history of the early days of computing, tinkering and having fun was a recurring theme throughout the decades. I wasn’t around to experience the early days of computers myself, but they seemed to be genuinely exciting and rewarding. In the words of MIT sociologist Sherry Turkle: computers empowered their users, making them feel smart[er], “in control”, and “more fully participant in the future”. </p>
<p>
Those feel like odd descriptions for the modern computing experience. Using computers today doesn’t feel like￼ an empowering experience￼. Sometimes it’s mindless and distracting. Sometimes, when a redesign rolls out, or laptop doesn’t wake from sleep mode,￼ it’s downright hostile. The experience of using a computer in 2020 is a concoction of data silos, dinging notifications and reinvented wheels, presented in gratuitously bubble-wrapped UIs hyper-optimized by persnickety product managers and soulless A/B tests. </p>
<p>
For most people, the computing experience is <a href="https://feifan.blog/2020/06/22/no-one-cares-about-software-quality/">clicking around a lot</a>, typing into disparate apps in which your data is trapped except through narrowly-defined, bespoke integrations, and struggling to find <em>that thing you were just reading a few days ago</em> among all the silos. This doesn’t make anyone feel smarter or more in control. It’s simply frustrating.</p>
<p>
Software <em>development</em> is stuck in the doldrums too. A massive amount of cumulative engineering effort is spent rebuilding the same primitives<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote">1</a> because the software engineering industry hasn’t convincingly developed platforms at higher levels of abstraction<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote">2</a>. A significant portion of development effort goes to placating not-invented-here-ness, where companies feel the need to build their own version of every feature, each slightly different (user familiarity be damned). A lot of software is little more than looking up API documentation and plugging one into another. There’s a dearth of creativity, of joy and discovery, of inventing something interesting and new. </p>
<p>
To be fair, computers — both the desktop kind and various mobile kinds — enable<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote">3</a> seemingly-impossible<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote">4</a> things<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote">5</a>. But it feels frustrating to see the pioneering spirit that originally led to the development of modern computers giving way to uninspired flat interfaces<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote">6</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a> SaaS apps. The things you can do are limited to bespokely-implemented features, dribbled out only as fast as a small team of designers and developers can think of and build them. Of course you have an extensive list of things you <em>wish</em> your phone/computer/most-used apps could do; everyone does. You know the majority of it will remain a wishlist; there’s almost no hope of the feature you really want being implemented<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote">7</a>. This isn’t empowering. What’s more, new features tend to be one-off improvements and ungainly new ways for you to do more work<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote">8</a> rather than adding or improving functionality in a generalized way so you can remix functionality and do things faster.</p>
<p>
For the people who’ve figured out the right incantations to type and buttons-buried-in-submenus to click, computers can automate administrivia, surface information, and make them feel “more fully participant in the future”. But getting there is an arduous journey, and many people get in a place where computers just make things harder. The experience of using computers is, in various ways, awkward and frustrating (and maybe even dangerous<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote">9</a>) for everyone. Computers were supposed to be bicycles for the mind. So far we only have penny-farthings.</p>

<p>
Navigating codebases of any meaningful size is difficult. Most of a programmer’s time is spent jumping through the codebase, reading or skimming to build a mental model of the constructs and conventions within it. These constructs — among them: the DSLs, interfaces, and taxonomy of types that exist — are arguably the most important precursor to understanding where and how to make changes. But these constructs only exist in programmers’ heads. It’s difficult or impossible to navigate most codebases through the lens of those constructs; programmers lack “code browsers” that present the underlying code independently of files and the filesystem hierarchy. Yet code browsers that can do so — and we’ll look at some examples below — would be incredibly useful. This is because instances of these constructs can be thought of as records in a database, albeit an ad-hoc, poorly-specified database that can only be queried through carefully-crafted regexes<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote">1</a>.</p>
<p>
In simple cases, some constructs manifest as naming conventions: prefixes in a name may be a rudimentary way to namespace classes<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote">2</a>, while suffixes may be a rudimentary way to group classes or identify their type<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote">3</a>. But these are easy examples; many patterns are much more subtle.</p>
<h2>
“Where is this used?”</h2>
<p>
Imagine figuring out “where is this used?”, for various types of “this”:</p>
<p>
Most code editors (perhaps paired with a <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">language server</a>) can show you where local variables are used. This usually also works for finding where methods are invoked — although perhaps less reliably in dynamic-dispatch languages, or languages without types.</p>
<p>
What if you want to find where instances of a particular model get created? There may be multiple ways to create a model, so this isn’t super simple. In Rails, for example, there’s two built-in ways to create a model: you can either call <code>.new</code> to create a new instance in memory followed by <code>.save</code> to persist it to the database, or call <code>.create</code> to automatically do both. Your particular codebase might have additional wrappers for doing this that you’re supposed to use. Even worse, imagine that sometimes you create a <code>.new</code> instance, then set some properties on it over the next few lines, then finally call <code>.save</code>. Something like this:</p>
<pre><code>user = User.new
user.email = '<a href="https://feifan.blog/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="97fff2fbfbf8d7f2eff6fae7fbf2b9f4f8fa">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>' unless self.anonymous?
user.save</code></pre>
<p>
Conceptually, that’s still code that creates an instance of a particular model. But with the intervening syntax, this would be a difficult case to find with <code>grep</code>.</p>
<h2>
Static config</h2>
<p>
At <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, where I work, we have a lot of code for jobs that need to run at certain times each day. For example, we might need to move funds from one financial partner to another at noon UTC each day. Each of these jobs has configuration code describing when and how it should be run, implemented as a <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/concepts/domain-specific-languages/">DSL</a>. This config might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>run_config RunConfig.new(
  job_name: 'partner-daily-funding',
  env_vars: self.config_env,
  cron: RunConfig::Cron.new(
    schedule: { hour: 12, minute: 0 }
  ),
  owning_team: Company::Team::Liquidity
)</code></pre>
<p>
In our codebase, we have hundreds of these jobs, each with their own <code>run_config</code>. If you look at this codebase as a database, you can imagine these jobs being rows in a <code>jobs</code> table, where the fields on each row correspond to the parameters provided to the <code>RunConfig</code> class. </p>
<p>
Wouldn’t it be great to be able to browse all these jobs in a table? Maybe you could perform some basic operations on this data: searching for specific jobs by name or owning team; sorting by the time-of-day they’re scheduled to run; filtering for jobs owned by your team that have errored in the past week. Maybe you could edit the <code>run_config</code> from that interface (like you might edit a spreadsheet) and have it automatically make the corresponding change in the source code (or open a PR). Maybe you could even compute some aggregations on this data — for example, if you’re introducing a new job that requires some expensive computation, maybe you’d like to know which hours have the fewest other jobs scheduled. And of course, this job browser should be bidirectional with respect to the codebase — there should be a button beside each entry that shows the code for the job inline or opens the corresponding code in your editor.</p>
<h2>
Diffused concepts</h2>
<p>
Codebases typically contain logical concepts that are implemented across multiple pieces of code. This is often the case when you need to create multiple files to implement a particular feature.</p>
<p>
For example, in Rails, a “resource” is collectively implemented across a line in the router, a model file, a controller file, and a bunch of view files. Rails even ships with a code generator to <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/5f3ff60084ab5d5921ca3499814e4697f8350ee7/railties/lib/rails/generators/rails/resource/USAGE">create some of these files</a> for you. But despite resources being a core concept when working with Rails, there’s no good way to browse the resources in your codebase<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote">4</a>. There’s no good way to filter or query your codebase either — you can’t, for example, see which resources support JSON vs XML params. </p>
<p>
For another example, consider pubsub (aka emitter-consumer) pipelines. In web services, when you have processing that can happen “in the background”, one service will publish an event; another service subscribes to that event and will do the background processing on its own when it receives the event. Often, these will form event “pipelines” or trees where an event consumer will emit additional events that are consumed by yet other services. These pipelines are concepts that developers talk about (as in, the “account creation pipeline” or “funding reconciliation pipeline”), but in most codebases the pipeline itself isn’t declared or reified anywhere in the code.</p>
<p>
If you’re looking at code that emits an event, how do you find the consumers? If you’re lucky, the event has a unique, literal name and the consumer uses that name literally as well. But maybe some subscribers are using wildcard event names, or names generated by string concatenation, and that becomes a lot harder to grep for. Likewise, if you’re looking at a consumer of an event, how do you find the locations in the codebase that could emit that event<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote">5</a>?</p>
<p>
Wouldn’t it be great to be able to browse those pipelines in a table or perhaps a directed graph<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote">6</a>? Maybe that graph would support some basic operations on this data: searching for specific publishers or subscribers by class name or event name; filtering for pipelines that have run into errors; maybe even showing the flow of a particular event given an event ID<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote">7</a>. And of course, this pipeline browser should be bidirectional with respect to the codebase — there should be a button beside each graph node that shows the code for the publisher or subscriber inline or opens the corresponding code in your editor.</p>
<p>
For a final example, consider code that has functionality inherited from elsewhere. Some environments let you see a <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/viewing-structure-of-a-source-file.html">list of inherited properties</a> or methods, but this isn’t possible for more specialized cases. At Stripe, we have code that implements shell scripts that can take command-line arguments and flags. These arguments are defined via a DSL in the implementing code, but these commands can be subclassed, and there’s no way to see what the available arguments are while working in the subclass.</p>
<h2>
Philosophy</h2>
<p>
I think it’s important to consider these problems not as disparate cases in need of bespoke tooling, but as a <em>class</em> of problems characterized by a lack of access to the data structures embedded within codebases. Just like SQL databases and spreadsheets provide a singular querying abstraction and a set of visualization primitives that can be applied to any kind of data, programming environments need a singular querying abstraction and set of visualization primitives that can be applied to the concepts lurking in codebases. Getting there does <em>not</em> mean using proprietary drag-and-drop visual programming interfaces where the introspection capabilities are limited to whatever the programming environment happens to have implemented. Just the opposite — you should still be able to do whatever you want with your code (including treating it as plain-text files), <em>and also</em> have access to more advanced introspection tools that can query and slice your code — tools that let you easily understand and navigate complex codebases to reduce the <em>incidental complexity</em> of building software.</p>
<h2>
Solutions</h2>
<p>
I don’t have a solution to sell you here (at least, not yet!). But <a href="https://twitter.com/hirday_g/status/1356657607381946369">by popular demand</a> I think it’s worthwhile to at least discuss principles that solutions should embody and directionally-related prior art. </p>
<p>
To start with a simple example, see <a href="https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/">IHP</a>, a full-stack web framework similar to Rails. It comes with a web interface for manipulating your project’s codebase and database schema. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbDtS_mUMpI?t=102">One point in the introduction video</a> showed changes being made in the visual schema editor being automatically reflected in the SQL code that describes the database schema — and changes being made to the SQL code being bidirectionally reflected in the visual schema editor. </p>
<p>
For a more in-depth example, consider <a href="https://pharo.org/">Pharo</a>, a Smalltalk environment. “Environment” in this case means that it feels like you’re using a custom OS (including global menus, idioms, and keyboard and mouse conventions) designed specifically for browsing, writing, and debugging programs in the Smalltalk programming language<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote">8</a>. The holistic integration of these tools is important. Unlike the programming environments we cobble for ourselves today — where the editor is agnostic of the language and runtime and other tools like debuggers, inspectors, and code browsers are tacked on (if they exist at all) — it’s worth thinking about what an entire computing experience <em>for</em> writing and building custom tools might look like<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote">9</a>.</p>
<p>
Pharo is also interesting because of its Class Browser, which looks like this:</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://files.tanagram.app/file/tanagram-data/prod-feifans-blog/database-codebase-pharo-browser.png" alt="Pharo class browser">
</p>
<p>
This browser breaks free from the source code <em>file</em> as the atomic unit of browsing; instead, it allows the user to browse one method at a time. Making the “unit of browsing” …</p></article></div></div></div>

        Why is esbuild fast?
      </h2>
      <p>Several reasons:</p>
      <ul><li><p> It's written in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> and compiles to native code. </p> <p> Most other bundlers are written in JavaScript, but a command-line application is a worst-case performance situation for a JIT-compiled language. Every time you run your bundler, the JavaScript VM is seeing your bundler's code for the first time without any optimization hints. While esbuild is busy parsing your JavaScript, node is busy parsing your bundler's JavaScript. By the time node has finished parsing your bundler's code, esbuild might have already exited and your bundler hasn't even started bundling yet. </p> <p> In addition, Go is designed from the core for parallelism while JavaScript is not. Go has shared memory between threads while JavaScript has to serialize data between threads. Both Go and JavaScript have parallel garbage collectors, but Go's heap is shared between all threads while JavaScript has a separate heap per JavaScript thread. This seems to cut the amount of parallelism that's possible with JavaScript worker threads in half <a href="https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/111#issuecomment-719910381">according to my testing</a>, presumably since half of your CPU cores are busy collecting garbage for the other half. </p></li><li><p> Parallelism is used heavily. </p> <p> The algorithms inside esbuild are carefully designed to fully saturate all available CPU cores when possible. There are roughly three phases: parsing, linking, and code generation. Parsing and code generation are most of the work and are fully parallelizable (linking is an inherently serial task for the most part). Since all threads share memory, work can easily be shared when bundling different entry points that import the same JavaScript libraries. Most modern computers have many cores so parallelism is a big win. </p></li><li><p> Everything in esbuild is written from scratch. </p> <p> There are a lot of performance benefits with writing everything yourself instead of using 3rd-party libraries. You can have performance in mind from the beginning, you can make sure everything uses consistent data structures to avoid expensive conversions, and you can make wide architectural changes whenever necessary. The drawback is of course that it's a lot of work. </p> <p> For example, many bundlers use the official TypeScript compiler as a parser. But it was built to serve the goals of the TypeScript compiler team and they do not have performance as a top priority. Their code makes pretty heavy use of <a href="https://mrale.ph/blog/2015/01/11/whats-up-with-monomorphism.html">megamorphic object shapes</a> and unnecessary <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/39247">dynamic property accesses</a> (both well-known JavaScript speed bumps). And the TypeScript parser appears to still run the type checker even when type checking is disabled. None of these are an issue with esbuild's custom TypeScript parser. </p></li><li><p> Memory is used efficiently. </p> <p> Compilers are ideally mostly O(n) complexity in the length of the input. So if you are processing a lot of data, memory access speed is likely going to heavily affect performance. The fewer passes you have to make over your data (and also the fewer different representations you need to transform your data into), the faster your compiler will go. </p> <p> For example, esbuild only touches the whole JavaScript AST three times: </p> <ol> <li>A pass for lexing, parsing, scope setup, and declaring symbols</li> <li>A pass for binding symbols, minifying syntax, JSX/TS to JS, and ESNext-to-ES2015</li> <li>A pass for minifying identifiers, minifying whitespace, generating code, and generating source maps</li> </ol> <p> This maximizes reuse of AST data while it's still hot in the CPU cache. Other bundlers do these steps in separate passes instead of interleaving them. They may also convert between data representations to glue multiple libraries together (e.g. string→TS→JS→string, then string→JS→older JS→string, then string→JS→minified JS→string) which uses more memory and slows things down. </p> <p> Another benefit of Go is that it can store things as compactly in memory, which enables it to use less memory and fit more in the CPU cache. All object fields have types and fields are packed tightly together so e.g. several boolean flags only take one byte each. Go also has value semantics and can embed one object directly in another so it comes "for free" without another allocation. JavaScript doesn't have these features and also has other drawbacks such as JIT overhead (e.g. hidden class slots) and inefficient representations (e.g. non-integer numbers are heap-allocated with pointers). </p></li></ul>
      <p>Each one of these factors is only a somewhat significant speedup, but together they can result in a bundler that is multiple orders of magnitude faster than other bundlers commonly in use today.</p>

        Upcoming roadmap
      </h2>
      <p>These features are already in progress and are first priority:</p>
      <ul><li>Code splitting (<a href="https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/16">#16</a>, <a href="https://esbuild.github.io/api/#splitting">docs</a>)</li><li>CSS content type (<a href="https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/20">#20</a>, <a href="https://esbuild.github.io/content-types/#css">docs</a>)</li><li>Plugin API (<a href="https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/111">#111</a>)</li></ul>
      <p>These are potential future features but may not happen or may happen to a more limited extent:</p>
      <ul><li>HTML content type (<a href="https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/31">#31</a>)</li><li>Lowering to ES5 (<a href="https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/297">#297</a>)</li><li>Bundling top-level await (<a href="https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/253">#253</a>)</li></ul>
      <p>After that point, I will consider esbuild to be relatively complete. I'm planning for esbuild to reach a mostly stable state and then stop accumulating more features. This will involve saying "no" to requests for adding major features to esbuild itself. I don't think esbuild should become an all-in-one solution for all frontend needs. In particular, I want to avoid the pain and problems of the "webpack config" model where the underlying tool is too flexible and usability suffers.</p>
      <p>For example, I am <em>not</em> planning to include these features in esbuild's core itself:</p>
      <ul><li>Support for other frontend languages (e.g. <a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>, <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>, <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a>, <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>)</li><li>TypeScript type checking (just run <code>tsc</code> separately)</li><li>An API for custom AST manipulation</li><li>Hot-module reloading</li><li>Module federation</li></ul>
      <p>I hope that the extensibility points I'm adding to esbuild (<a href="https://esbuild.github.io/plugins/">plugins</a> and the <a href="https://esbuild.github.io/api/">API</a>) will make esbuild useful to include as part of more customized build workflows, but I'm not intending or expecting these extensibility points to cover all use cases.

<p>Jazzer is a coverage-guided fuzzer for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It works on the bytecode level and can thus not only be applied directly to compiled Java applications, but also to targets in other JVM-based languages such as Kotlin or Scala.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Jazzer consists of two main components:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Jazzer driver</strong> is a native binary that links in <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html" rel="nofollow">libFuzzer</a> and runs a Java fuzz target through the Java Native Interface (JNI).</li>
<li>The <strong>Jazzer agent</strong> is a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html" rel="nofollow">Java agent</a> that runs in the same JVM as the fuzz target and applies instrumentation at runtime. The information obtained through this instrumentation is fed back to libFuzzer <span>just as it would be for a compile-time instrumented native binary.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Taken together, the driver and the agent make it seem to libFuzzer as if it were fuzzing an ordinary native binary. Our goal is to make all of libFuzzer's features work with Jazzer <span>out of the box</span>. In the following, we want to highlight some of the most interesting aspects of the engineering effort required to achieve this goal.</p>
<h2>Instrumenting JVM bytecode for fuzzing</h2>
<p>The JVM bytecode of a compiled Java class is much more higher-level than the machine code of an equivalent C/C++ binary. This makes it possible to instrument a JVM application at runtime rather than at build-time, which means that neither the code nor the build script requires any changes. The Jazzer agent, which is written in Kotlin, instruments the classes right as <span>they are being loaded</span> by the JVM.</p>
<p>To obtain coverage information from the JVM fuzz target, the Jazzer agent inserts bytecode instructions together with a unique ID at the beginning of every basic block. When we enter a block, the previous basic block’s shifted ID is XORed with the current ID to obtain an identifier for the control flow edge between the two blocks.&nbsp;This idea to obtain edge-level coverage information from basic block instrumentation originated in <a href="https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/technical_details.txt" rel="nofollow">AFL</a> and has already featured in the early AFL-based Java fuzzer <a href="https://github.com/isstac/kelinci">Kelinci</a>. By relying on memory shared directly between the JVM and the Jazzer driver through a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/ByteBuffer.html" rel="nofollow">direct <code>ByteBuffer</code></a> as well as implementing a branch-free saturating counter increment, we found this approach to coverage instrumentation to be very efficient in practice (take a look at <a href="https://github.com/CodeIntelligenceTesting/jazzer/blob/v0.9/agent/src/main/java/com/code_intelligence/jazzer/instrumentor/AFLCoverageMapInstrumentor.kt">AFLCoverageMapInstrumentor.kt</a> if you want to know how this is done).</p>
<p>Since coverage is not the only type of information that is used by libFuzzer to guide its exploration of the fuzz target, Jazzer also instruments other JVM constructs (see <a href="https://github.com/CodeIntelligenceTesting/jazzer/blob/v0.9/agent/src/main/java/com/code_intelligence/jazzer/instrumentor/TraceDataFlowInstrumentor.kt">TraceDataFlowInstrumentor.kt</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>bytecode-level compares, such as the <span><code>lcmp</code></span>, <span><code>if_*</code></span>, and <span><code>if*</code></span> opcodes</li>
<li>higher-level method-based compares, such as <span><code>String#equal</code></span> or <span><code>Arrays#compare</code></span></li>
<li><code><span>switch</span></code> statements (corresponding to the <span><code>lookupswitch</code></span> and <span><code>tableswitch</code></span> opcodes)</li>
<li>integer divisions (corresponding to the <span><code>idiv</code></span> and <span><code>ldiv</code></span> opcodes and the <span><code>divideUnsigned</code></span> methods)</li>
<li>constant array indices (corresponding to the <span><code>*aload</code></span> opcodes and <span><code>get*</code></span> methods on array-like objects)</li>
</ul>
<p>In all these cases, interesting observed values are forwarded to libFuzzer callbacks such as <span><code>__sanitizer_cov_trace_cmp4</code></span> (for comparisons of 32-bit integral types) and <span><code>__sanitizer_weak_hook_strcmp</code></span> (for string comparisons). The values populate libFuzzer's table of recent compares and will be incorporated into the fuzzer input bytes via random mutations.</p>
<h2>Value profile support</h2>
<p>The table of recent compares is usually quite effective at letting the fuzzer progress through simple compares in which the required input can be obtained directly by inserting bytes reported via the compare hooks. But real-world fuzz targets are rarely that simple. For example, a function might encode the input into Base64 or apply a simple, non-cryptographic checksum function, followed by a comparison. In these cases, the relation between the input required to explore the fuzz target further and the bytes reported via callbacks is highly non-trivial.</p>
<p>libFuzzer's <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html#id33" rel="nofollow">value profile</a>, which can be enabled with the runtime flag <span><code>-use_value_profile=1</code></span>, can be very helpful in this situation. In this mode, for every comparison between two values<span></span>, an extra set of coverage counters will be incremented for every matching bit position in <span><code>A</code></span> and <code><span>B</span></code>. This allows the fuzzer to track its partial progress in getting <span><code>A</code></span> and <span><code>B</code></span> to match, thereby simplifying the problem from brute force (exponential time) to a linear search (linear time).</p>
<p>Since Jazzer builds on libFuzzer and reports string comparisons using <span><code>__sanitizer_weak_hook_strcmp</code></span>, basic value profile support is automatic.&nbsp;Allowing the value profile to track comparisons between integral types is a more difficult task as the relevant fuzzer hooks such as <span><code>__sanitizer_cov_trace_cmp4</code></span> do not take the address of the compare instruction as an argument. Instead, these hooks retrieve the return address from the stack via the <span><code>__builtin_return_address</code></span> compiler intrinsic.</p>
<p>While this is a very natural approach for instrumented native binaries, our calls to the callbacks all go through the JNI and will thus have the same native return address somewhere in the JNI dispatcher. This would mean that the fuzzer would not be able to distinguish between different compare instructions, which would render the value profile <span>largely useless for non-string types</span>. We initially considered submitting a patch to LLVM that would add variants of the compare callbacks that take a call site address as an additional argument, but then found a way to provide full value profile support even without upstream changes.</p>
<p>A small piece of inline assembly in the Jazzer driver implements a "trampoline" that can invoke any of the libFuzzer callbacks with an arbitray fake return address <span><code>addr</code></span>, e.g., a unique ID assigned to a bytecode instruction (see <a href="https://github.com/CodeIntelligenceTesting/jazzer/blob/v0.9/driver/sanitizer_hooks_with_pc.cpp">sanitizer_hooks_with_pc.cpp</a> for the implementation). The trampoline first pushes an address pointing to the <span><code>addr &amp; 0xFFF</code></span>-th entry in a "sled" of <span><code>0xFFF + 1=4096</code></span>&nbsp;ASM <span><code>ret</code> </span>instructions to the (native) stack and then performs a direct jump (also called a "tail call") to the sanitizer callback.&nbsp;The callback will see the address of the <code>ret</code> corresponding to the lower 12 bits of the synthetic address <span><code>addr</code> </span>as the return address via <span><code>__builtin_return_address</code> </span>and associate the bit-wise progress made in the comparison with it in the value profile map.&nbsp;Since libFuzzer only uses the lower 12 bits of an address for the purpose of the value profile, this allows for fast and complete value profile support also for integral types.</p>
<h2>FuzzedDataProvider</h2>
<p>Both libFuzzer and Google’s Python fuzzer <a href="https://github.com/google/atheris" rel="noopener">Atheris</a> provide convenience functions that transform the raw byte input received from the fuzzer into useful primitive types, such as strings, integers, and arrays. While working on Jazzer's analogue of such a <span><code>FuzzedDataProvider</code></span>, we found the two prior implementations to differ in <span>quite a few relevant ways</span>. Adding our own experience with building fuzzers to the mix, we arrived at the following design decisions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jazzer's <span><code>FuzzedDataProvider</code> </span>turns raw fuzzer input bytes into valid JVM strings by carefully applying the least number of bit changes required to turn the input bytes into valid UTF-8. This differs from the approach taken by Atheris, which randomly chooses between ASCII, UTF-16 and UTF-32. We found the fuzzing to be more stable if a consistent, ASCII-compatible encoding is used throughout the <span><code>FuzzedDataProvider</code> </span>and the libFuzzer callbacks. This however comes at the cost of added complexity in the implementation of the string generation functions: The JNI internally uses an encoding that historically predates UTF-8 and is best described as "UTF-16 code points encoded using UTF-8, with special handling of zero bytes". <span>We found this additional complexity</span> to be worth it based on the increased fuzzing efficiency.</li>
<li>The provider distinguishes between "data byte" and "choice bytes". More complex data which is likely to be parsed by the fuzz target, such as strings or arrays of primitive types, is consumed from the beginning of the fuzzer input. Small primitive types such as single integers, floats, and booleans, which are more likely to guide control-flow, are consumed from the end of the fuzzer input. This idea goes back to libFuzzer's <span><code>FuzzedDataProvider</code> </span>and has two key benefits: It makes the consumed fuzzed data more stable under the typical mutations applied by libFuzzer<span>and also ensures</span> that corpus entries preserve the structure of valid input files (e.g., JSON, PDF, or JPEG files) as much as possible.</li>
<li>Reproducing crashes in fuzz targets using a <span><code>FuzzedDataProvider</code></span> would be challenging if it always required running the crashing input through the driver. For this reason Jazzer, in addition to the crashing input dumped by libFuzzer, creates a Java-only reproducer for every crash. This reproducer contains all values consumed from the <span><code>FuzzedDataProvider</code> </span>in serialized form and can be run like any other Java program without any native dependencies.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Custom method hooks</h2>
<p><a href="https://alexgaynor.net/2020/may/27/science-on-memory-unsafety-and-security/" rel="nofollow">Experience shows</a> that roughly 65% of all serious security bugs found in projects using languages without memory-safety guarantees stem from incorrect memory handling. For the most part this high percentage is likely explained by how difficult memory handling can get if memory-safety is not built into the language from the ground up. However, there is another part to this story: With the likes of AddressSanitizer, MemorySanitizer, and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, there is excellent tooling available to detect such bugs with fuzzing.</p>
<p>While there is no need to detect violations of memory-safety for Java applications (at least those without native libraries), <span>other vulnerabilities </span>such as SQL injections, path traversals, or infinite loops occur in JVM-based languages just as often as they do in C/C++. One of the core ideas behind Jazzer is that the higher-level structure of JVM bytecode compared to native binaries coupled with suitable "sanitizers" should make these bugs detectable via fuzzing. For this purpose, Jazzer includes a flexible <a href="https://codeintelligencetesting.github.io/jazzer-api/com/code_intelligence/jazzer/api/MethodHook.html" rel="nofollow">annotation-based mechanism to hook methods</a>, regardless of …</p></article></span></p></div></div></div></div></div>

    <p>Creating a traditional computer program involves a fixed sequence of steps. First, we need to understand the problem and translate it into formal logic. Then, we implement that in code. Often surprisingly, the implementation of a program’s logic is comparatively easy. The challenging part is understanding and translating the problem.</p>
<p>The more complex systems become, the more brainpower we spend to understand them. It becomes necessary to distill the problem and its logic into components, which are easier to work with. Given an input to a component, we know which output to expect. Even before writing a single line of code, we formalize these expectations in <em>contracts</em>. These contracts describe how various components interact with each other. And ultimately, how the overall system interacts with the real world. Once the software is written, we can ensure that the contracts hold. This process makes the concept of failure transparent and clearly defined.</p>
<p>This way, we have managed to build <em>extremely</em> safe software systems that can operate in real-world environments. For example, software autopilots for airplanes, which have been in use for half a century<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, don’t fail even once in a billion flight hours. To put this in perspective, think about flying a Boeing 747 around Earth 22 million times<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. We don’t expect it to fail once in that time! Flying is the safest mode of transport<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> for a good reason. It is designed with failure in mind.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-era-of-machine-learning">The New Era of Machine Learning</h2>
<p>But things have changed over the past decade. More recently, the idea of letting a computer learn program behavior with data has heralded a new era of <em>machine learning</em>. It is now one of the most powerful tools of our age.</p>
<p>Machine learning can leverage statistical dependencies in data to learn complex input-output mappings. The program behavior is deduced from data. Therefore, we no longer need to distill the logic and implement it in code. Instead, the computer does so from data. We no longer have to translate the problem into formal logic. Instead, the computer does so from data. To some extent, we don’t even have to understand the problem anymore – or at least we are fooled into believing that we don’t.</p>
<p>Through machine learning, a computer can learn behaviors that are much more complex than anything humans can describe with hand-written rules. On well-designed datasets, or sometimes even in well-controlled environments, we can now do things that we couldn’t even imagine with traditional software.</p>

    <img src="https://david-haber.github.io/images/aisafetyreqs.png" alt="AI systems have all of the developmental and operational problems of traditional code, plus a vast additional set of AI-specific issues.

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Traditionally, we left the difficult parts – like understanding and translating the problem – to humans. We explicitly defined the behavior of traditional programs. Now machine learning solves this for us. It automatically distills the problem and its assumptions into a model. As a result, we can learn much more complicated program behaviors. But, at the same time, the understanding and behavioral guarantees of traditional software are lost. The contracts, which we previously relied on, no longer exist. This makes it much more difficult to analyze AI behavior, let alone to demonstrate its safety.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-mindset-for-ai-development">A New Mindset for AI Development</h2>
<p>AI systems have the same developmental and operational problems as traditional software, plus a vast set of AI-specific issues. As a result, <a href="https://david-haber.github.io/posts/ai-discipline/" target="_blank">companies can create impressive demos but fail to translate them into real products</a>. Or even worse, they operate AI software with a lot more uncertainty. This has already led to catastrophic consequences.</p>
<p>Regulatory organizations, industry-specific working groups, and researchers are investigating how existing safety standards can be extended to cover the additional challenges of AI software. With decades of experience certifying traditional software, they know that safety <em>follows</em> from adopting a system-level view. Moreover, it requires a mindset that holds all stages of the development process accountable, from requirements collection to end-user interaction.</p>
<p>AI development teams must adopt a similar top-down approach. Crucially, this means a development workflow that looks beyond the model. We need to systematically combine the best practices from traditional software with the tools specific to AI. Only then can we reestablish the contracts that traditional software relies on, reduce the uncertainty around AI applications, and achieve the failure rates that mission-critical applications require.</p>
<p>With quickly evolving regulatory standards and improving machine learning tools, we now have a chance to get this right. Both sides of the table, regulators and industry, need to work together to create frameworks that support innovation, not stifle it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p>At Leet Resumes, where we write <a href="https://leetresumes.com/">great technical resumes for free</a>, (tips gratefully accepted), we've learned a lot about <a href="https://leetresumes.com/blog/leet-resumes-technical-resume-documentation">writing technical resumes</a>. We've taken an open source model to sharing those learnings, figuring that you can do it yourself, or have us do it for you. Either way, the cost is the same!</p><p>A great technical resume helps <a href="https://leetresumes.com/blog/what-a-great-technical-resume-can-do-for-you">get you ahead in your career</a>. Company hiring practices can seem mysterious and cryptic, but it’s not too complicated in reality. Companies have processes for how they hire, and just like any system, if you know the rules it’s easy to reverse engineer what you need to do.</p><p>To help a hiring manager make technology hires, a company typically has HR staff, and sometimes a recruiter, review resumes of applicants and professionals they've invited to interview. The software they use to track interviews or job applicants is called an Applicant Tracking System (ATS).  Technical resumes should be written so they work well with an ATS, and that they are persuasive and effective at getting you interviews with engineering managers and HR people.</p><p>Here's a simple guide to doing that well.</p><h3>Professional headline </h3><p>The professional headline summarizes your role and level. For easy comprehension, it sums up your professional standing in a few words - a short phrase that serves as shorthand for your career. Great professional headlines include: </p><ul><li>“Passionate Open Source Engineer”,</li><li>“Top-performing BI Analyst”,</li><li>“Innovative Machine Learning Expert”,</li><li>“Successful Front-end Engineer”, or </li><li>“Dedicated DevOps Professional”</li></ul><p>In the case of Stephanie's fictional resume below, "Accomplished Lead Engineer" is what she's gone with. A clear professional headline helps you get seen by managers looking to hire professionals like you.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_PkawPzsWgabHObNz/assets/exevIYbERKmdnlRg.png" alt="Software Engineering Resume example"></p><h3>Four job titles you’d accept</h3><p>Often missed on resumes, it helps to declare explicitly which job titles you are willing to accept. After your professional headline, include these three to four job titles as a means for the recruiter or hiring manager to know what roles they ought to consider you for. These are not necessarily past roles or job titles you’ve already had. Instead, these are  job titles your readers should consider you for in your next job. This may seem really obvious to you, but it’s not obvious to the HR staff or your future boss – help them out by documenting very clearly your intended path forward.</p><h3>Professional summary</h3><p>The next three lines of your professional summary describe your most important, most relevant attributes. (If you have less than 10 years of experience, you ought to reduce this professional summary section to two lines.)</p><p>The second line of the professional summary is capabilities, skills, talents. These are your top 4 most differentiated skills in the market.  Highlight skills that indicate <strong>you’re ready for the 4 job titles</strong> listed above. </p><p>The third line covers performance. What types of achievements in your work history prove that you have the skills and capabilities listed above? What specific factual details can you summarize here? (You’ll explain them in detail in the <a href="https://leetresumes.com/blog/how-to-write-bullet-points-for-a-technical-resume">bullet points</a> below.)</p><p>The fourth line covers career highlights - awards, promotions, truly distinguishing achievements or industry recognitions. It's always helpful to include your promotion track record on this line: "Promoted early" or "6x Promoted"</p><p>Again, please note, if you have less than 8 years of experience, we’ll typically advise collapsing the professional summary from 4 lines into just 2.</p><h3>Work experience </h3><p>The most common mistake engineers make in their work experience section is copying and pasting their job description. The readers of your resume already know the duties and responsibilities of a ‘software engineer’ or a ‘full-stack engineer’. So a copy-pasta job here doesn’t help you. </p><p>Instead, please focus on providing the <strong>details</strong> about what you actually did achieve on the job.  Answer for your reader the questions she or he has in their head about you. Did you contribute in concrete numbers and real results to your past employers? Why was your previous employer better because you were there? Did you reduce latency? Increase throughput? Shave seconds off loading time? Build a system that could handle more capacity, concurrency, or continents? </p><p>For technologists, this is an area where resumes actually favor your strong suit: numbers, not words. It’s always better to show your expertise by <a href="https://leetresumes.com/blog/software-engineering-resumes-need-numbers-here-s-how-to-do-i">sharing the numbers</a>. Numbers are objective, they are facts, and they help readers understand precisely what you did. For each role on your resume, share the numbers that detail your success.</p><p>Examples of good numbers to share:</p><ul><li>Load time reduced by xx ms</li><li>Site engagement increased by xx%</li><li>Bug fix time reduced by xx days</li><li>Data usage reduced by xx %</li><li>Revenue increased by xx %</li><li>etc.</li></ul><p>Anything where you can quantify the specific improvements that happened because you were the engineer on the job.</p><h3>Technologies</h3><p>Finally, list the technologies you’ve used at the end. For more experienced engineers, your particular technology stack may matter less than your overall track record. While for more junior engineers, the placement on the first (and only) page means this important data is at the fingertips of hiring managers and recruiters.</p><p>We typically expect to see 8 - 10 technologies for engineers with two to four years of experience.  That grows to 15 - 20 by the time you're at ten years' experience. Commonly, being proficient in 25 or so technologies by fifteen years is the sign that you've transcended the bounds of programming languages in specificity, and that you're able to learn enough about any particular language to contribute productively at a higher level.</p><p>I hope this overview has been helpful.

<p>SpatiaLite is an <b>open source</b> library intended to extend the <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> core to support fully fledged Spatial SQL capabilities.<br>
SQLite is intrinsically simple and lightweight:</p><ul>
<li>a single lightweight library implementing the full SQL engine</li>
<li>standard SQL implementation: almost complete SQL-92</li>
<li>no complex client/server architecture</li>
<li>a whole database simply corresponds to a single monolithic file (no size limits)</li>
<li>any DB-file can be safely exchanged across different platforms, because the internal architecture is universally portable</li>
<li>no installation, no configuration</li></ul>

<p>SpatiaLite is smoothly integrated into SQLite to provide a complete and powerful Spatial DBMS (mostly OGC-SFS compliant).<br>
Using SQLite + SpatiaLite you can effectively deploy an alternative <i>open source</i> Spatial DBMS roughly equivalent to <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> + <a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/">PostGIS</a>.

<p>Wrangling dates and times in JavaScript can be a headache. JavaScript date libraries provide user-friendly APIs and useful utilities that alleviate some of that pain. But with so many options how do you pick the best one? In this post we delve into the world of JavaScript date libraries to help you choose. Our top pick, <strong>date-fns</strong>, delivers the best feature set combined with an elegant modular architecture.</p>
<h2 id="our-picks">Our picks</h2>
<h3 id="best-overall-date-fns">Best overall: <a href="https://www.skypack.dev/view/date-fns">date-fns</a></h3>
<p><strong>date-fns</strong> offers great documentation, functional architecture, and utilities that handle almost any task you can think of. If dates are a critical concern for your JavaScript application, use <strong>date-fns.</strong>&nbsp;Each feature has clear documentation written in ESM (ES Modules) for the browser. Logical and consistent function names encourage readable code. A modular architecture allows build tools to trim away unused code for a slimmer final build.</p>
<h3 id="best-for-time-zones-luxon">Best for time zones: <a href="https://www.skypack.dev/view/luxon">Luxon</a></h3>
<p>If time zones or localization are your primary concern, we recommend <strong>Luxon</strong>. <strong>Luxon</strong> leverages JavaScript’s <code>Intl</code> for speed and slimness while providing what <code>Intl</code> doesn’t: an immutable user-friendly API. Concise, well-written documentation eases the learning curve for getting started.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="best-minimalist-option-dayjs">Best minimalist option: <a href="https://www.skypack.dev/view/dayjs">Day.js</a></h3>
<p>For basic handling of dates, <strong>Day.js</strong> is a minimalist library that offers an excellent API without much overhead. While <strong>Day.js</strong> has fewer features than <strong>Luxon</strong> or <strong>date-fns</strong>, it’s much smaller in size.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="when-to-use-a-datetime-package">When to use a JavaScript date library</h2>
<p>Why not just use JavaScript’s built-in <strong>Date</strong> object? A good JavaScript date library provides a clear advantage over JavaScript’s <strong>Date</strong> in several ways: immutability, parsing, and time zones. In addition, JavaScript date libraries offer useful utilities for date manipulation and formatting, which can save developers time and energy.</p>

<p>JavaScript’s <strong>Date</strong> is mutable, which can lead to unintentional bugs. Let’s say you create a <strong>Date</strong> object named <code>currentTime</code>. You display it on top of the website. Another developer comes in and wants to create a widget that displays next weeks events. They use <code>currentTime.setDate(currentTime.getDate() + 7)</code> at the top to the widget to display next week’s date. However it also changes the date in the header! Oops. With an immutable date library, adding a week would create a new instance so the original would not change.</p>
<p>While <strong>Date</strong> has a <code>parse</code> method, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/Date">MDN documentation for <strong>Date</strong>‘s <code>dateString</code> notes</a> that usage is “strongly discouraged.” An excellent answer in the Stack Exchange question <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/20463521">Why does Date.parse give incorrect results?</a> describes in detail differences in formatting standards and browsers lead to inconsistent and unreliable results. If you need to parse, a date library is a must.</p>

<p>Time zones are another major frustration. <strong>Date</strong> in the browser always represents the local system date stored as milliseconds since January 1st, 1970 in UTC. A <strong>Date</strong> can rendered as a <code>string</code> in a different time zone using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl"><strong>Intl</strong></a>, but the <strong>Date</strong> itself is always the local system time.</p>
<p><strong>Date</strong> also lacks utilities for common tasks like creating human-readable relative dates. Using library utilities for such tasks can save a lot of time.</p>

<p>In the meantime, be aware of the limitations of <strong>Date</strong> and use a library when you need one.</p>
<h2 id="our-previous-pick-momentjs">Our previous pick: Moment.js</h2>
<p>For a long time <strong>Moment.js</strong> was king of the JavaScript date libraries, but in 2020 <strong>Moment.js</strong>‘s maintainers published a <a href="https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status">Project Status</a> announcing they consider Moment.js a legacy project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The maintainers argued that there was no way to refactor <strong>Moment.js</strong> to meet the demands of modern JavaScript development such as immutability and tree shaking. Lighthouse (Chrome’s built-in auditing tool) warns against using Moment because of its large size (329 kb).</p>
<p>For these reasons, we do not include it as one of our recommended picks. If you are looking for a replacement to <strong>Moment.js</strong> that closely matches its API, try <strong>Day.js</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-picked">How we picked</h2>
<p>We looked at data from <a href="https://www.skypack.dev/">Skypack</a> and <a href="https://www.npmtrends.com/">NPM trends</a> to identity the most popular and trending libraries and evaluated them against these core criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Browser-friendly</strong>: We evaluated JavaScript date libraries for use directly by the browser rather than the Node.js backend.</li>
<li><strong>Great documentation</strong>: Users look to this to implement the library correctly. We looked at the parts the facilitate this process: organization, search, examples, and the individual pages relating to the methods we tested.</li>
<li><strong>Modularity + Tree shaking</strong>: Modular architecture allows you to shrink your library size by “tree-shaking” out any library code you’re not using. Common build tools capable of tree-shaking include <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a>, <a href="https://snowpack.dev/">Snowpack</a> and <a href="https://rollupjs.org/">Rollup</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Features</strong>: Feature-richness was just one factor. We also considered whether a library was especially good at certain tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>: Measuring performance gives us a clue at how fast each library performs common operations. This usually isn’t noticeable but in large, complex apps can cause lag.</li>
<li><strong>Size</strong>: One of the biggest problems people had with <strong>Moment.js</strong> was size. A large library can substantially increase page load times.</li>
<li><strong>Anti-bug features</strong>: Immutability, readability, and informative error messages can help prevent bugs. When code is readable, you can learn a lot about what it does by reading it. Format, syntax, and naming conventions can make all the difference in readability.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h3>
<p>When evaluating each library we made a CodePen using Skypack. We attempted to pick out common use cases that illustrate differences between libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rendering the current date &amp; time</li>
<li>Rendering the current date using a custom format</li>
<li>Modifying a date to add/remove time</li>
<li>Working with timezones</li>
<li>Parsing arbitrary date strings</li>
</ul>
<p>First we implemented these cases using JavaScript’s <strong>Date:</strong></p>
<p data-height="300" data-theme-id="15606" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="melissamcewen" data-slug-hash="NWRMoLm" data-preview="true" data-pen-title="datetime example">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/melissamcewen/pen/NWRMoLm"> datetime example</a> by melissa (<a href="https://codepen.io/melissamcewen">@melissamcewen</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</p>

<p>We wrote up examples for performance testing on <a href="https://perf.link/">perf.link</a> and all of the tests and code are available in the <a href="https://github.com/melissamcewen/date-time-perf-examples/">Date/time performance examples GitHub repository</a>. If you have a specific use-case, you can modify one of the provided examples. JavaScript date libraries contain hundreds of methods and features that we couldn’t test them all. Instead, we opted to test the same methods demonstrated in our Codepens.</p>

<p>The sizes listed on each review are based on loading via the Skypack CDN.

<p>A caveat to our testing is we did not consider back-end <code>Node.js</code> use. Many JavaScript date libraries rely on browser APIs so may not work correctly on the back-end.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does it let us know if we have an invalid date when we pass in invalid items? For example moment(undefined) behaves like moment() and doesn’t output an error, which could lead to bugs.</li>
<li>How well does it handle different languages and locales?</li>
<li>Can it render relative dates (like “4 days ago”)? Can it do this in different languages?</li>

<h3 id="date-fns"><a href="https://www.skypack.dev/view/date-fns">Date-fns</a></h3>
<p>Size: 58.9 kb (tree-shakable)</p>

<p data-height="300" data-theme-id="15606" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="melissamcewen" data-slug-hash="bGwjaGV" data-preview="true" data-pen-title="datetime example: date-fns">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/melissamcewen/pen/bGwjaGV"> datetime example: date-fns</a> by melissa (<a href="https://codepen.io/melissamcewen">@melissamcewen</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</p>

<p><strong>date-fns</strong> is a pleasure to use, offering all the benefits of a modular architecture and covering almost any date use case. Our example shows the power of good naming and syntax in conveying information. Code like <code>add(now, {days: 7})</code> is straightforward to understand even if you’re unfamiliar with <strong>date-fns</strong>.</p>
<p>To get the most out of <strong>date-fns’</strong>s modular architecture, use a tree-shaking build tool (see our criteria section) and import only the features you need:</p>
<pre><code>import { format, add, getHours, parse } from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/date-fns@2.16.1";
</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, a tree-shaking build tool would remove all code from <strong>date-fns</strong> that’s not used in <code>format</code>, <code>add</code>, <code>getHours</code>, or <code>parse</code>. The final build would be much slimmer. Still at 58.9kb for the whole package, it’s not giant in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>date-fns</strong> doesn’t package a browser build for NPM (<a href="https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/issues/1780">see the related GitHub issue</a>) and therefore only works on CDNs that transform for the browser like <a href="https://www.skypack.dev/">Skypack</a> and <a href="https://www.jsdelivr.com/esm">ESM.run</a>. However, documentation has examples labeled for the browser as both ESM(ES Modules) and ES2015. This ensures developers don’t get confused trying to run <code>Node.js</code> backend code in the browser.</p>
<h4 id="limitations">Limitations</h4>
<p>Although we liked almost everything about <strong>date-fns</strong>, it is not for everyone. For starters, <strong>date-fns</strong> seems geared towards experienced developers working with a professional tool chain. Working without a build tool, the tree-shaking advantage disappears.</p>
<p>Note that our CodePen example starts with a <code>const now = new Date()</code>, which is the default JavaScript <strong>Date</strong> object. As noted in our <strong>Date</strong> section a <strong>Date</strong> is always the current system’s time zone. <strong>date-fns</strong> has a separate library for working with time zones using helper functions. We found the documentation and examples for these helper functions less consistent than the main <strong>date-fns</strong>. Our resulting code is less readable than the rest of the examples. Our time-zone example for <strong>date-fns</strong> is 4 lines of code, compared to 1 for <strong>Luxon</strong>.</p>
<p>Another quirk we encountered was if you Google “date-fns parse” the top results take you to the <a href="https://date-fns.org/v2.0.0-alpha.9/docs/parse">v2.0.0-alpha docs for parse</a>, which no longer work (the current version is 2.16). We found ourselves using Google because the documentation’s built-in search seems to search only title and descriptions of sub-pages. The information architecture of the menu could also use improvement, as we would it overwhelmingly …</p></div></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Interviewing managers is difficult.</p>

<p>For starters, the role has high volatility. Managers can elevate a team well past what was thought possible. On the flip side, they can blow up a high-functioning team, destroying it’s magic in unrecoverable ways.</p>

<p>Second, it’s hard to fire mediocre managers. When a mediocre individual contributor leaves the company, usually they have a mediocre volume of things to transition. When a mediocre manager leaves the company, they’ll often have a bunch of plates spinning in various states of wobble. Someone has to keep those plates spinning, it’s likely going to be you, and you hired this person  because you didn’t have the time to do that well.</p>

<p>So, you want to hire a great manager. To do that you need to evaluate them on a large number of competencies - people management, process management, subject matter expertise, communication, and more. That’s a lot of ground to cover. However, my favorite question can get you a reasonable read in under 15 minutes.</p>



<p>The three most important decisions in management are hiring, firing, and promoting. Asking prospective managers how many times they’ve done each, and asking follow-up questions about their responses, gets to the heart of a manager’s competency faster than any other question I’ve tried.</p>

<h2 id="how-many-people-have-you-hired">How many people have you hired?</h2>

<p>Great managers are great recruiters. Asking someone how many people they’ve hired gets you critical information, fast. If they’ve only hired a couple people, you can’t count on this person to come in and revamp your hiring process on day 1. If they’ve hired a bunch, ask some quick followups to understand how they did it:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What’s your offer acceptance rate? Where do you want it to be?</li>
  <li>What’s your top source for top-of-funnel pipeline?</li>
  <li>How do you make sure you’re counteracting bias in the hiring process?</li>
</ul>

<p>The biggest red flag for this question is if someone acts like hiring is easy. That’s a sure-fire way to know that they have no idea how to hire top talent.</p>

<h2 id="how-many-people-have-you-fired">How many people have you fired?</h2>

<p>Firing is a gut-wrenching, stressful, angst-inducing, and essential function of a manager.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, most effective managers have fired around 1 out of every 7-10 people they’ve ever managed. Proportions much lower than that start to raise concerns that this candidate has had issues effectively performance managing. Ask follow-ups to understand anomalous report:firing ratios.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if a candidate has only managed a few people and never had to fire someone, then you’ve gotten the signal that it’s something you’ll need to help them with if and when the time comes. You can also avoid accidentally giving a manager with no firing experience a report with material performance issues.</p>

<p>The biggest red flag for this question is anyone is if someone acts like firing is anything besides a life-changing event that requires the utmost seriousness and attention.</p>



<p>Growing your team is an essential manager function. Promotions are also a rough proxy for the effectiveness of your team. Great managers should have promoted a significant proportion of their team and have clear examples of how they helped their team advance their career. For someone in a role for more than a couple years, a good quick response to this question is “most of the team”.</p>

<p>The biggest red flag for this question is multi-year management stints with very low promotion counts. Dive into that signal to uncover if it was happenstance, a faulty reward mechanism, or a failure in team execution.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>You should be able to get through this three-part question in under 15 minutes. By the end of it you’ll have a quick but useful read on the candidate’s ability to hire, fire, and promote effectively. A nice benefit of this rapid-fire discovery is that it explores the candidate’s ability to communicate effectively when concise information is needed.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>There are a whole bunch of popular interview questions that can be solved in one of two ways:
Either using common data structures and algorithms in a sensible manner, or by using some properties of XOR in a seemingly hard to understand way.</p>

<p>While it seems unreasonable to expect the XOR solutions in interviews, it is quite fun to figure out how they work.
As it turns out, they are all based on the same fundamental trick, which we will derive in a bottom-up way in this post.
Afterwards we will look at a bunch of applications of <em>that XOR trick</em> ™, such as solving this popular interview question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are given an array of n - 1 integers which are in the range between 1 and n. All numbers appear exactly once, except one number, which is missing. Find this missing number.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, there are a number of straightforward ways to solve this problem, but there is also a perhaps surprising one using XOR.</p>

<h3 id="xor">XOR</h3>

<p>XOR is a logical operator that works on bits.
Let’s denote it by <code>^</code>.
If the two bits it takes as input are the same, the result is <code>0</code>, otherwise it is <code>1</code>.
This implements an <em>exclusive or</em> operation, i.e. exactly one argument has to be <code>1</code> for the final result to be <code>1</code>.
We can show this using a truth table:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><code>x</code></th>
      <th><code>y</code></th>
      <th><code>x ^ y</code></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Most programming languages implement <code>^</code> as a bitwise operator, meaning XOR is individually applied to each bit in a string of bits (e.g. a byte).</p>

<p>For example:</p>



<p>since</p>
<div><div><pre><code>0 ^ 0 = 0
0 ^ 1 = 1
1 ^ 0 = 1
1 ^ 1 = 0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Because of this, we can apply XOR to anything, not just booleans.</p>

<h3 id="deducing-some-useful-properties">Deducing Some Useful Properties</h3>

<p>We can derive a bunch of properties from the previous definition.
Let’s go through them one by one, and then compose them to solve the interview questions previously mentioned.</p>

<h4 id="xor-and-0-x--0--x">XOR and 0: <code>x ^ 0 = x</code></h4>

<p>If one of the two arguments to XOR is <code>0</code>, then the remaining argument is the result.
This directly follows from the truth table by checking the rows where <code>y = 0</code>, namely the first and third row.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><code>x</code></th>
      <th><code>y</code></th>
      <th><code>x ^ y</code></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>1</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
      <td><strong>1</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4 id="xor-on-the-same-argument-x--x--0">XOR on the same argument: <code>x ^ x = 0</code></h4>

<p>If the two arguments are the same, the result is always <code>0</code>.
Again, we can convince ourselves that this is true by inspecting the truth table.
This time we have to check the rows where <code>x = y</code>, i.e. the first and last row.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><code>x</code></th>
      <th><code>y</code></th>
      <th><code>x ^ y</code></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>1</strong></td>
      <td><strong>1</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Intuitively, this means that if we apply XOR to the same arguments, they cancel each other out.</p>

<h4 id="commutativity-x--y--y--x">Commutativity: <code>x ^ y = y ^ x</code></h4>

<p>XOR is commutative, meaning we can change the order in which we apply XOR.
To prove this, we can check the truth table for both <code>x ^ y</code> and <code>y ^ x</code>:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><code>x</code></th>
      <th><code>y</code></th>
      <th><code>x ^ y</code></th>
      <th><code>y ^ x</code></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>As we can see, <code>x ^ y</code> and <code>y ^ x</code> always end up with the same value.</p>

<h4 id="sequences-of-xor-operations">Sequences of XOR operations</h4>

<p>By combining all of this, we can deduce the central insight behind everything that is about to follow:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The XOR trick</strong>: If we have a sequence of XOR operations <code>a ^ b ^ c ^ ...</code>, then we can remove all pairs of duplicated values without affecting the result.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Commutativity allows us to re-order the applications of XOR so that the duplicated elements are next to each other.
Since <code>x ^ x = 0</code> and <code>a ^ 0 = a</code>, each pair of duplicated values has no effect on the outcome.</p>

<p>Let’s go through an example of this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>  a ^ b ^ c ^ a ^ b     # Commutativity
= a ^ a ^ b ^ b ^ c     # Using x ^ x = 0
= 0 ^ 0 ^ c             # Using x ^ 0 = x (and commutativity)
= c
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Because <code>^</code> is a bitwise operator, this will work regardless of what kind of values <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> are.
This idea is really at the heart of how XOR can be used seemingly magically in many situations.</p>

<h3 id="application-1-in-place-swapping">Application 1: In-Place Swapping</h3>

<p>Before we solve the problem of finding the missing number, let’s start with this simpler <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/swap-two-numbers-without-using-temporary-variable/">problem</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Swap two values x and y in-place, i.e. without using any helper variables.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It turns out that one can easily solve this problem using the following three XOR instructions:</p>



<p>That seems a bit mysterious.
Why do we end up swapping <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> if we do this?</p>

<p>To see how it works, let’s go through this step by step.
The comment after each instruction shows the current values of <code>(x, y)</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>x ^= y # =&gt;                      (x ^ y, y)
y ^= x # =&gt; (x ^ y, y ^ x ^ y) = (x ^ y, x)
x ^= y # =&gt; (x ^ y ^ x, x)     = (y, x)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see that this is really just using the properties derived earlier.</p>

<p>The fundamental insight here is that having <code>x ^ y</code> in one register and <code>x</code> in the other, allows us to perfectly reconstruct <code>y</code>.
Once <code>x ^ y</code> is stored (instruction 1), we can just put <code>x</code> into the other register (instruction 2), and then use it to change <code>x ^ y</code> to just <code>y</code> (instruction 3).</p>

<h3 id="application-2-finding-the-missing-number">Application 2: Finding the Missing Number</h3>

<p>Let’s finally solve the problem posed in the beginning of this post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are given an array <code>A</code> of n - 1 integers which are in the range between 1 and n. All numbers appear exactly once, except one number, which is missing. Find this missing number.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, there are many straightforward ways of solving this, but we did set out to do it using XOR.</p>

<p>From the XOR trick we know that having a sequence of XOR statements means we can remove all duplicated arguments.
If we just XOR all values in the given list, however, we cannot apply this trick because there are no duplicates:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>A[0] ^ A[1] ^ ... ^ A[n - 2]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that <code>A[n - 2]</code> is the last index of a list of <code>n - 1</code> elements.</p>

<p>What we can do additionally is to also XOR all values between 1 and n:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>1 ^ 2 ^ ... ^ n ^ A[0] ^ A[1] ^ ... ^ A[n - 2]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will give us a sequence of XOR statements where elements appear as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All values in the given list now appear twice:
    <ul>
      <li>once from taking all the values between 1 and n</li>
      <li>once because they were in the original list</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The missing value appears exactly once:
    <ul>
      <li>once from taking all the values between 1 and n</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If we XOR all of this, we essentially remove all values that appear twice, thanks to the XOR trick.
This means that we are left with the missing value, which happens to be exactly what we were looking for in the first place.</p>

<p>Coded up, it looks something like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>find_missing</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span><span>):</span>
  <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>

  <span># XOR of all the values from 1 to n
</span>  <span>for</span> <span>value</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>):</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>^=</span> <span>value</span>

  <span># XOR of all values in the given array
</span>  <span>for</span> <span>value</span> <span>in</span> <span>A</span><span>:</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>^=</span> <span>value</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>result</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Just looking at the code, this seems to be a difficult to understand algorithm.
When knowing how the XOR trick works, however, it becomes fairly trivial.
I think that also shows why it is unreasonable to expect this solution in an interview: It requires knowledge of a very specific trick but not much algorithmic thinking beyond that.</p>

<p>Before we move on to the next application, let me follow up with two remarks.</p>

<h4 id="generalizing-this-beyond-integers">Generalizing this beyond integers</h4>

<p>While we worked on integers from 1 to n so far, this is not required.
In fact, the previous algorithm works in any situation where there is (1) some set of potential elements and (2) a set of elements actually appearing.
The sets may only differ in the one missing element.
This worked out nicely for integers because the set of potential elements just corresponds to the elements from 1 to n.</p>

<p>One could imagine applications where the elements are not integers from 1 to n:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The set of potential elements are <code>Person</code> objects and we ought to find the <code>Person</code> missing from a list of values</li>
  <li>The set of potential elements are all nodes in a graph and we are looking for a missing node</li>
  <li>The set of potential elements are integers in general (not necessarily from 1 to n) and we want to find a missing integer</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="arithmetic-operators-instead-of-xor">Arithmetic operators instead of XOR</h4>

<p>If the algorithm still seems a bit magical – which I hope it does not – it might help to think about how one could achieve the same result using arithmetic operators.
This is actually fairly straightforward:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>find_missing</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span><span>):</span>
  <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>

  <span># Add all the values from 1 to n
</span>  <span>for</span> <span>value</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>):</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>+=</span> <span>value</span>

  <span># Subtract all values in the given array
</span>  <span>for</span> <span>value</span> <span>in</span> <span>A</span><span>:</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>-=</span> <span>value</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>result</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We add all potential integers and then subtract the ones actually appearing.
The solution is not as nice because one would need to handle overflows and because it requires the type of the elements to support <code>+</code>, <code>-</code> with certain properties.
It, however, has the same logic of elements canceling each other out because they appear a certain number of times (once positive, once negative).</p>

<h3 id="application-3-finding-the-duplicate-number">Application 3: Finding the Duplicate Number</h3>

<p>Here’s where it gets fun: We can apply the <em>exact</em> same solution to a similar interview question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are given an array <code>A</code> of <strong>n + 1</strong> integers which are in the range between 1 and n. All numbers appear exactly once, except one number, which is <strong>duplicated</strong>. Find this duplicated number.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s think about what happens if we just apply the exact same algorithm as in the previous solution.
We would get a sequence of XOR statements where elements appear as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The duplicated value appears three times:
    <ul>
      <li>once from taking all the values between 1 and n</li>
      <li>twice because it was duplicated in the original list</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>All other values in the given list appear twice:
    <ul>
      <li>once from taking all the values between 1 and n</li>
      <li>once because they were unique in the original list</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As previously, all the duplicated elements cancel each other out.
This means we are left with exactly what we are looking for: the element that was duplicated in the original array.
This element appearing three times, combined with XOR, reduces to that very element:</p>


<p>All other elements cancel each other out because they appear exactly twice.</p>

<h3 id="application-4-finding-two-missingduplicate-numbers">Application 4: Finding Two Missing/Duplicate Numbers</h3>

<p>It turns out we can take this even further.
Consider the following, slightly more difficult, problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are given an array <code>A</code> of <strong>n - 2</strong> integers which are in the range between 1 and n. All numbers appear exactly once, except <strong>two</strong> numbers, which are missing. Find these two missing numbers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As before, the problem is completely equivalent when looking for two <em>duplicated</em> numbers, instead of two <em>missing</em> numbers.</p>

<p>And I am sure you guessed it, but we will stick with what worked before and start exactly the …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <div> <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div id="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <figure> <img src="https://blog.tinybird.co/images/clickhouse.png" alt="Tinybird uses Clickhouse"> <figcaption>Tinybird uses Clickhouse</figcaption> </figure> <p>There are two extremes in the open source world: companies creating open-source and the ones that just use it. And in between, some companies contribute from time to time.</p> <p>Let’s use Linux kernel development as an example: if you look at the contributor list you’ll see Redhat, IBM, Facebook, and many more. But those companies don’t control the project in this case, there is a foundation behind it. This is the ideal situation, when there is no company behind the project. Of course, each company pushes in their direction, but no one can change the project license.</p> <p>On the other hand you have Mongo or Elastic, they created the project and control it. Their business model depends on the project, so to protect it they’ll do whatever is needed. There are plenty of examples of companies changing license terms to limit what other companies -basically large cloud services providers- can offer. Mongo, Elastic, Redis, Mapbox are recent examples.</p> <p>We truly believe in open source. Ideally following the foundation way, but any piece of code that enables others to do things is welcome in our book. Open source is one of the things that make the world a better place: COVID vaccine scientists used spark for its development, Wikipedia uses Kafka (and runs entirely on open source software), OpenStreetMap uses Postgres and PostGIS.</p> <p>In our previous companies, we based most of our products on open source technology but we often felt we weren’t contributing enough. Not just because you should feel the pressure to contribute if you are making money out of it; also because if you are contributing to it, it probably means you really understand how it works and therefore your product will be better.</p> <p>Our service relies heavily on Clickhouse, the database Yandex published as open source a few years ago. It’s one of the best pieces of technology I’ve seen, the kind of software you get when you put the best minds to solve one hard problem.</p> <p>We have been contributing to the database with some pull requests, but not as many as we would like. And even though we understand Clickhouse inside and out now, we feel that’s not enough. That’s why we have decided to hire developers to work on the open-source project full-time.</p> <p>For a company of our size this means a long-term effort but we are pretty sure it will pay off in the short and medium-term. And not just for us but for everybody facing the same problems we are trying to solve.</p> <p>If you are a C++ developer and like working on high-performance projects you’ll feel at home at Tinybird. Please take a look at the <a href="https://www.tinybird.co/jobs/clickhouse-developer">Clickhouse Developer job offer</a> and consider applying.</p> </div>  </article>  </div> </div></div>]]>

                    <p><code>I2C</code> is a communication protocol which was originally designed and used for inter-board communications between peripherals, like the processor talking to an EEPROM in a system. These days it is also used for short distance communication with sensors - not what it was designed for, but it works anyway. Wikipedia has this to say about <code>I2C</code>:</p>

<p><i>I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit), pronounced I-squared-C, is a synchronous, multi-master, multi-slave, packet switched, single-ended, serial communication bus invented in 1982 by Philips Semiconductor (now NXP Semiconductors). It is widely used for attaching lower-speed peripheral ICs to processors and microcontrollers in short-distance, intra-board communication. Alternatively, I2C is spelled I2C (pronounced I-two-C) or IIC (pronounced I-I-C).</i> (thanks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C">Wikipedia</a>!)</p>


<p>I've been playing around with some <code>I2C</code> based sensors from SparkFun. They have <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic">QWIIC</a> connectors making it easy to speak to them from SparkFuns <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16832">OpenLog Artemis</a>. The OpenLog Artemis can log sensor data to SD card and also presents itself as a serial device where it streams data from the sensors in a CSV-like format. It works great and I can highly recommend the whole <code>QWIIC</code> ecosystem.</p>

<p>Occationally I need to use one of the <code>QWIIC</code> sensors from some FreeBSD based system, without the <code>OpenLog Artemis</code>. In this case I am using a <code>Raspberry PI Zero</code> with FreeBSD a 13-CURRENT from December. This is easy because the <code>QWIIC</code> system is just plain <code>I2C</code> underneath, so it is easy to hook a sensor up directly to the <code>GPIO</code> pins of the RPI with <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14988">one of these</a>.</p>

<p>In FreeBSD land we have <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=i2c&amp;sektion=8">i2c(8)</a> which is a userspace utility for reading and writing to <code>I2C</code> devices. I will start by going over basic usage before diving deeper into the actual sensors I am playing with in this learning session.</p>

<p>My test rig for this blogpost looks like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://people.bornhack.org/tyk/i2c/IMG_20210206_201331.jpg"><img src="https://people.bornhack.org/tyk/i2c/IMG_20210206_201331.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<h3>Basic I2C on FreeBSD</h3>
<p>First things first, I need some hardware with an <code>I2C</code> bus which is exposed to FreeBSD. I am using a <code>Raspberry PI Zero</code> and the <code>I2C</code> bus looks like this in <code>dmesg</code>:</p>

<pre>[root@pizero1 ~]# grep I2C /var/run/dmesg.boot 
iicbus0: &lt;OFW I2C bus&gt; on iichb0
iic0: &lt;I2C generic I/O&gt; on iicbus0
[root@pizero1 ~]# 
</pre>

<p>The first sensor I've hooked up is a SparkFun <code>TMP117</code> temperature sensor. According to the <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/qwiic-tmp117-high-precision-digital-temperature-sensor-hookup-guide">hookup guide</a> the default <code>I2C</code> address of this sensor is <code>0x48</code> which matches what I am seeing after hooking up the hardware and running <code>i2c(8)</code> with the <code>-s</code> flag to make it scan the <code>I2C</code> bus for devices:</p>

<pre>[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -s
Hardware may not support START/STOP scanning; trying less-reliable read method.
Scanning I2C devices on /dev/iic0: 48 
[root@pizero1 ~]# 
</pre>

<p>After connecting an additional sensor which has a default <code>I2C</code> address of <code>0x60</code> the bus scan can see that device too:</p>

<pre>[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -sv
dev: /dev/iic0, addr: 0x0, r/w: r, offset: 0x00, width: 8, count: 1
Hardware may not support START/STOP scanning; trying less-reliable read method.

[root@pizero1 ~]# 
</pre>

<h3>Reading From I2C Devices</h3>
<p>Reading from the sensor is straightforward. I specify that I want to read with <code>-d r</code> (meaning <code>read</code>), the length of data to get with <code>-c 2</code> (meaning 2 bytes) and the address of the device to read from with <code>-a 48</code>:</p>

<pre>[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -a 48 -d r -c 2 -m tr
0d 67 
[root@pizero1 ~]# while true; do date; i2c -a 48 -d r -c 2 -m tr; sleep 1; done
Sun Dec 20 00:51:45 UTC 2020
0d 67 
Sun Dec 20 00:51:46 UTC 2020
0d 67 
Sun Dec 20 00:51:48 UTC 2020
0d 66 
Sun Dec 20 00:51:49 UTC 2020
0d 66 
^C
[root@pizero1 ~]# 
</pre>

<p>After some trial and error I also add <code>-m tr</code> to set the <code>addressing mode</code> to <code>complete-transfer</code> which is needed on this I2C bus to make everything work.</p>

<p>The reading shown is a hex value, exactly two bytes as requested with <code>-c 2</code>.</p>

<p>When reading temperature from this sensor I don't need to add <code>-o</code> to the <code>i2c(8)</code> command to specify an offset, since the temperature is stored in the first register in the device. If I wanted to read from the next register (which for the <code>TMP117</code> is where the configuration is stored) I would use <code>-o 1</code>:

</p><pre>[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -a 48 -d r -c 2 -m tr -o 1
22 20 
[root@pizero1 ~]# 
</pre>

<p>All the registers in the <code>TMP117</code> are 16 bits (or two bytes), but the <code>I2C</code> command can read or write any number of bytes, just specify the width with <code>-c</code>.</p>

<p>Trying to read more data than the register size just results in FF bytes being returned:</p>

<pre>[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -a 48 -d r -c 2 -m tr
0c bc 
[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -a 48 -d r -c 4 -m tr
0c bc ff ff 
[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -a 48 -d r -c 40 -m tr
0c bd ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 
ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 
ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 
[root@pizero1 ~]# 
</pre>


<h3>Writing To I2C Devices</h3>
<p>The <code>i2c(8)</code> utility also makes it easy to write values back to the device. The <code>TMP117</code> sensor has a programmable low and high thresholds in registers 2 and 3. The first one defaults to <code>0x6000</code> and changing it is much like reading, except we want the bytes to be written on <code>stdin</code>:</p>

<pre>[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -a 48 -d r -c 2 -m tr -o 2
60 00 
[root@pizero1 ~]# echo -en "\x60\x01" | i2c -a 48 -d w -c 2 -m tr -o 2
[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -a 48 -d r -c 2 -m tr -o 2
60 01 
[root@pizero1 ~]# echo -en "\x60\x00" | i2c -a 48 -d w -c 2 -m tr -o 2
[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -a 48 -d r -c 2 -m tr -o 2
60 00 
[root@pizero1 ~]# 
</pre>


<h3>Understanding Readings From the TMP117 Sensor</h3>
<p>Reading the <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/9/e/5/1/8/tmp117.pdf">datasheet</a> for the <code>TMP117</code> sensor I learned that the temperature readings are stored in the first register, as a 16-bit value, which means I use <code>-c 2</code> for <code>i2c(8)</code> so it reads two bytes (16 bits) from the sensor.</p>

<p>The datasheet for the <code>TMP117</code> has this to say about the register where the temperature is stored: <code>The data in the result register is in two's complement format, has a data width of 16 bits and a resolution of 7.8125m °C.</code>.</p>


<h3>Two's Complement Format</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement">Two's complement</a> is a widely used and convenient way to work with signed (negative) numbers in binary. Basically the most significant bit is used to indicate if what follows is a positive or a negative binary number.</p>

<p>The following table is from the <code>TMP117</code> datasheet, it shows some sample temperatures in celcius and what those readings translate to in decimal, two's complement binary, and hex:</p>

<p>I haven't worked much with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement">two's complement format</a>, so I started out by familiarising myself with it in Python. I borrowed the following function from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1604464/twos-complement-in-python/37075643#37075643">SO</a> and started out by reproducing the values in the above table:</p>

<pre>[root@pizero1 ~]# cat twos.py 
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys

def twos(binary_str, bytecount):
    integer = int(binary_str, bytecount)
    bytes = integer.to_bytes(bytecount, byteorder="big", signed=False)
    return int.from_bytes(bytes, byteorder="big", signed=True)

print(twos(sys.argv[1], int(sys.argv[2])))

<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-c57517e3-7fff-7dc7-5bfe-84839fb3df5f"><span><span>I’m super proud of my mom, Amanda Milne! She was among the first to earn a degree in Computer Science from the University of Michigan, has worked in the field of software development her entire career, and worked her way up to become president of her own custom software development company here in Michigan, and later on, a Senior Vice President of a Fortune 500 company.<br></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><img height="400" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/I_JBY1MgrnV3vaSDYSKCmbpPcdBqZgHi3_BHf75JmS1hqsBnafdWNLk0FXO_znQO7STWS7LDumylUgns2hWV2RzUXClodbjRT04DPAvs8RRt0l_G7b8z9c7-nQRB5d2N5szEdbnT" width="400"></span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>This is an interview with Amanda about her early years in software development, back in the 1970s and 1980s, and about one project in particular that I remembered her doing from my days as a grade school kid.</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span><span>You were among the first Computer Science graduates at the University of Michigan, right?</span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>I was! I graduated from Michigan with a Computer Science Degree in 1974. The Computer Science degree program was fairly new back then. We had no textbooks, just mimeographed handouts (which I wish I’d kept!).&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Nearly all of our work was done on an IBM System/360 Mainframe Computer, primarily by submitting our code on punched cards via a remote card reader. I took one class on a DEC PDP-8 Mini Computer, and I learned to build logic boards by soldering chips in an elective Electrical Engineering course. The programming languages were primarily Fortran and Assembler.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Only 43 of us graduated with a Computer Science degree from U of M in ‘74. Fun Fact: I graduated without ever actually seeing the IBM System/360 Computer!</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span><span>What did you do after graduation?</span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>I worked as a Programmer for various companies (and customer accounts).&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>My first assignment was to single-handedly write the real time process control code to run a custom carburetor test stand for Oldsmobile.&nbsp; The computer was a16-bit Modcomp mini computer with 16K of memory, and no disk! When I started that project, I knew nothing about Modcomp computers, their operating system, their language -- or what a carburetor was!&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>I wrote the code in an Assembler level language, and loaded my compiled code into the machine via paper tape.&nbsp; When I found a bug in my code, I wrote the fix, de-compiled it by hand, converted it to hexadecimal, and keyed the fix into memory using 16 binary switches.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Writing process control code was fun because I could actually see my code working as it opened and closed mechanical valves, and turned stepping motors. I was only 21, but I did successfully complete the project.</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span><span>That’s pretty amazing! As a developer these days, there are so many layers of indirection between code we write, and what’s actually happening at the hardware level.&nbsp; You actually got to add instructions to memory directly, with no steps in between! (And without Google or StackOverflow to help you know what to do!)</span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span><span>After that, you worked at a startup called Custom Software Services, right? What was your role there?</span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>In 1981, Custom Software Services, a programming consultancy startup in the Detroit area, hired me to work part-time on a two-month project. I only had 3 years of programming experience at the time, because I took a 4-year break when you and Jeremy were born. My assignment was to single-handedly develop a daily Profit and Loss system for a local restaurant chain on an IBM Series/1 Computer (a 16-bit mini computer with the EDX Operating System), using a low level language called EDL. At the time, CSS had only one employee. After the project was completed, I stayed on to work on other projects. After 4 years, I went full time as a programmer.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span><span>Highland Superstores was a big appliance sales company back in the 1980s, right? What was the project that you did for them?</span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Highland Superstores was a national chain of 100 appliance stores selling TVs, electronics, washers, dryers and refrigerators. In 1987, the Internet did not yet exist. Highland Superstores wanted a networked Point of Sale (POS) system in all of their stores, and headquarters. The system would track their inventory, daily sales, gross margins, commissions, and so forth.</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Highland Superstores wanted a system to enable the salespeople on the floor to negotiate pricing, view how a lowered price negatively affected their own commission, check accurate up-to-date store inventories, sell the items, and schedule delivery.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Before this system, a salesperson had to leave the customer (or make a phone call) to check inventory in the back of the store. Salespeople had no idea if the next closest store had the item in stock that his customer desired. It was important to Highland to have up-to-date inventories of ALL of their stores available in each store. With this feature, a salesperson would be able to sell the item, and send the customer to the next closest store to pick it up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>The POS system in each store had to communicate and update the headquarters computer every 15 minutes. It also had to download inventory updates from the other stores every 15 minutes.</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span><span>How did IBM get involved in this project?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Highland Superstores had spent 2 years working with another local software company to develop the POS system using PC LANs, but it wasn’t working and Highland was getting frustrated.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Rick Teague, Highland’s IBM Salesperson, told them that putting an IBM System/36 in each store, all communicating with an IBM System/38 at their headquarters, would work.&nbsp; The hardware was up to the job.</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span><span>With no Internet, how did this kind of communication work? Dial-up modems?</span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Yes, dial-up modems. The POS system had to dial the headquarters IBM System/38 every 15 minutes, establish a connection, upload the local store inventory, and download updated inventories from the other 99 stores.</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span><span>You mentioned Highland was getting frustrated? What was the issue with the other company’s in-progress implementation?</span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Well, they couldn’t get their PC LAN system to work. If I remember correctly, their software could perform&nbsp; the in-store functionality, but it had a great deal of trouble getting the communications with headquarters to work properly and quickly.</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span><span>So how did you, and CSS, get involved in this project?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>The IBM System/36 hardware solution was a good idea, but there was no POS software to run on that platform. Since Highland Superstores had been paying another software company, they weren’t willing to fund another software development project on a different platform.</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Rick said, “If I can get your POS system up and running in one of your stores on an IBM System/36, will you buy 100 System/36s?” Highland Superstores said maybe, provided they didn’t have to spend any money for the trial, and that the system would be up and running in the pilot store in 90 days!&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Highland Superstores also made it clear they were keeping their focus and money on the PC LAN-based solution. The new IBM System/36-based solution would have to out-perform a solution that had a two-year head start!&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>IBM approached several software companies in the Detroit area, and asked if they would be willing to develop the POS system for free, demonstrate that it worked, and then hope to get paid afterwards. They all said “No”... except my boss, Don George, who owned Custom Software Services.</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Our company had about 15 employees at the time, business was slow, and we were in danger of going under.&nbsp; Don was an ex-IBM Systems Engineer, so he knew the guys in the local IBM office. He sat down and had some serious discussions with them about the project, and then he decided to take on the risk and tackle the project. I got involved when my boss asked me to manage the project.</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span><span>That does sound like quite a risk! What was it like working on a project, and leading a team, that would have a zero payout for everyone involved if it wasn’t successful?&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>It was extremely challenging. We couldn’t afford to pay a team of developers to write the software, so Don came up with a creative idea to share the risk. He offered several local developers a double-or-nothing deal. If they signed on with our project, we’d track all of their hours, and then pay them double their going hourly rate at the end -- if it was successful and Highland Superstores purchased it. If not, they’d get zero.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Surprisingly, he found 7 developers who were willing to take his offer, but they all had to keep their day jobs. So, they worked on our POS project nights and weekends.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span><span>And you were in charge of managing this? How did you approach that?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>I was 34 years old, and this was my very first project management assignment. The first thing I did was to read 3 books on project management. I knew that the project would be very difficult, and that I’d have to use every bit of education, new knowledge, guts, and perseverance I had!&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>As it turned out, it was even more stressful, and challenging that I’d first thought. The project lasted 5 months, not 3. At the 90 day mark, we had accomplished enough that we earned another month or two as a grace period.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>The developers and I were all working 2 shifts, 7 days a week. Over that summer, none of us had any family time, or vacation time. There were many days when I came home late at night, dropped my clothes on the floor and fell into bed. Then, the next morning, I showered, grabbed clean clothes and was gone again. We worked 2 shifts, 7 days a week. The good news is that as the project progressed, everyone had more skin in the game. The developers saw their potential earnings mount, and became more and more unwilling to walk away.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>When we had the code (in the RPG language) running on a remote IBM System/36, IBM installed a System/36 in one of the Highland Superstores (for a free trial), and we spent about a month troubleshooting and debugging the software in a live store environment.</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span><span>That must have been exhausting! How about the flip side? Was there a best part about the project?</span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Yes! No scope creep! This was the only software development project I’ve ever worked on with zero scope creep.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>We didn’t realize at first, how important this would be, but it was one of the biggest contributors to the project’s success. There was no scope creep because Highland Superstores had already invested 2 years in hammering out the functionality of the system. All we had to …</span></span></span></p></div></div>

<div>
<article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

<div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>I spend a fair amount of time wandering around in the terminal. The chances
are that you are too since you dared to open this story. My daily activities
led me to contribute to various kinds of projects (professional, personal and
open-source). For my sanity, I tend to follow strict rules to organize my
workspace, which helps me keep things tidied up and easily reachable. Or so I
thought.</p>
<p>I decided to arrange my projects by following the <a href="https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces">Go
philosophy</a>: make the
arborescence mirrors the urls where they are reachable. e.g.,
<code>~/Workspace/src/github.com/aymericbeaumet/dotfiles</code> would contain the
project <a href="https://github.com/aymericbeaumet/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> owned by
<a href="https://github.com/aymericbeaumet">@aymericbeaumet</a> and accessible at
<a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. That’s great, but I am now facing a complex
directory structure tedious to navigate quickly. Making it, in the end,
harder to access the resources I need.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>pwd</span>
/Users/aymericbeaumet/Workspace/src/github.com/brigad/back-end
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><em>Nobody wants to manually deal with this.</em></p>
<p>Remembering and typing the location of each project (even while leveraging
autocomplete) is time-consuming. Creating shell aliases is not scalable.
Instead, I would like to rely on the pseudo-unicity of each project name to
find it among all the directories on my computer.</p>
<h2 id="z">z?</h2>
<p>Several tools exist to tackle this problem. My favorite is
<a href="https://github.com/rupa/z"><em>z</em></a>. It follows the Unix philosophy by being
small, focused and interoperable. <em>z</em> allows jumping around swiftly,
automatically learning from your habits. The entries are ranked based on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frecency">frecency</a> at which you access the
directories.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through the basics of this tool. Below is how I advise to install
it for Zsh on macOS (the install process should be similar for other shells
and operating systems):</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>brew <span>install </span>z
<span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>"source '</span><span>$(</span>brew <span>--prefix</span> z<span>)</span><span>/etc/profile.d/z.sh'"</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> ~/.zshenv
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><em>Install z for Zsh on macOS.</em></p>
<p>Note how installing <em>z</em> is not enough to start using it. You have to source
<code>z.sh</code> at the beginning of each shell session to activate it. The <code>~/.zshenv</code>
configuration file is appropriate as Zsh <a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Intro/intro_3.html">loads it in most
circumstances</a>, making the
tool accessible in a wide-variety of contexts (terminals, editors, IDEs,
scripts, etc.).</p>
<h2 id="lets-play">Let’s play</h2>
<p>Once the install and setup are complete: start a new shell session, <code>cd</code>
through some folders and execute <code>z</code> to confirm it has been accurately
tracking your activity:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>z | <span>sort</span> <span>-rn</span> | <span>head</span> <span>-3</span>
5331.72    /Users/aymericbeaumet/Workspace/src/github.com/brigad/back-end
637.255    /Users/aymericbeaumet/Workspace/src/github.com/brigad/ops
386.198 /Users/aymericbeaumet/.config/dotfiles
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><em>Top 3 directories based on frecency.</em></p>
<p>As shown above, I spend quite some time navigating through
<a href="https://github.com/brigad">Brigad</a> projects, but it seems I also often
access my <a href="https://github.com/aymericbeaumet/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> to tweak
some configuration. The ranking score is volatile, and one could observe
significant changes in a brief amount of time.</p>
<p>Now that <em>z</em> has accumulated some knowledge try it by navigating to one of
the tracked folders. Navigating is as simple as executing the <code>z</code> command
followed by the directory name:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>z dotfiles
<span>$ </span><span>pwd</span>
/Users/aymericbeaumet/.config/dotfiles
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><em>Navigating by matching with a whole directory name.</em></p>
<p>As a matter of facts, I do prefer to leverage partial matching (imagine <code>**</code>
surrounding your search pattern) to type fewer characters. Hence, <code>z dot</code> is
valid and should produce a similar behavior as <code>z dotfiles</code> (modulo possible
name collisions, but you get the idea). This works because <em>z</em> relies on
regular expressions. For example, the snippet below will navigate to the
directory ending with the letters “tmp” (with the highest score):</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>z tmp<span>$</span>
<span>$ </span><span>pwd</span>
/private/tmp
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><em>Navigating by matching with a regular expression.</em></p>
<p>Neat right? I guess you start seeing the possibilities of this tool. And we
have only scratched the surface of its capabilities. I suggest you dive in
its <a href="https://github.com/rupa/z/blob/master/README">documentation</a> to get an
idea of its full potential. Features such as autocomplete, subdirectories
matching, consecutive matching, etc. are a game changer.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p><em>z</em> is tremendous. This tool saves me a non-trivial amount of time every
single day. When one starts relying on it, there is no going back. And I hope
it’s going to fit your workflow as well as mine.</p>
<p>I would be grateful to hear any of your time-saving tricks. Feel free to
share your experiences!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>It's hard to be in IT, cause your friends have no idea what you do. Engineer, product manager, QA — how does it all differ from fixing a printer in the office? (tip: you don't get $150k/year for fixing printers).</p> <p>You also can't really talk to normal people about IT, because they use this industry, but they don't get it. But there's a topic you can raise with any mortal, that will get their attention: data privacy.</p> <p> <a href="https://dkzlv.com/static/img/posts/en_privacy1/intro.png" target="_blank"> <img alt="Typical privacy talk" src="https://dkzlv.com/static/img/posts/en_privacy1/intro.png" height="335" width="600"> </a> </p> <blockquote> <p>Disclaimer:</p> <ul> <li>this one is a biggie. I tried to add some pics and jokes so I don't mess with my readers' clip culture;</li> <li>if you're from IT — well, it would be like learning the alphabet once again. Probably you won't find anything new; if you do, that is a bad sign for your employer.</li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>How do they gather data about us? Will VPN and incognito mode save us? Maybe we should all just pack our stuff and go into the woods and make friends with wolves and bears?</p> <a href="https://dkzlv.com/en/how-they-harvest-data#part-1-classification" id="part-1-classification">  </a><p>Right to privacy in some sense consolidates all other rights as well: to vote, freedom of expression, equal opportunities, and so on. Once you lose your right to privacy you're screwed. Most of the people can easily be caught in a mind trap <em>"I have nothing to hide, why would I care?"</em>. Common mistake. You shouldn't worry about stuff you wanna hide, you should worry about what is in plain sight.</p> <p>This topic is so broad I was forced to come up with a categorization of a sort. I thought of it for no less than 3 minutes and this is the result: the most important thing is how obvious it is for an end user who stores the data, what the data really is and how it is manipulated. So, 3 variables: actor, data, and manipulation. A simple 3-dimensional matrix — you remember I wrote even a dumbass will understand the article? you don't remember? Me neither. Apparently, I didn't write it.</p> <p>Actor:</p> <ol> <li><strong>immediate receiver</strong>. When you give your phone number to get a new discount card the store gets your phone number. Yes, it's the first incredible insight from the article, thanks, Dan — you're welcome, my fellow reader.</li> <li><strong>shadow receiver</strong>. Is it obvious though that in that case your phone number will be sold to anyone else? Would you like it if Google and Facebook found out you are a regular customer of a brothel called "Tight flower bud"? Have no doubt, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/26/technology/facebook-expands-targeted-advertising-through-outside-data-sources.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they will buy that shit</a>. You're only starting to type "Epstein didn…" and the FBI already checks what toilet paper you use to threaten your ass using Braille writing system — all thanks to your Walmart discount card, ffs.</li> </ol> <p>Data:</p> <ol> <li><strong>stuff you give away consciously</strong>. You open another app that turns you into a cutie doggie. It asks for access to your photo gallery and camera, and you obviously allow it. What can go wrong?</li> <li><strong>stuff you didn't mean to give away</strong>. Mmm, 3896 photos you took over the last 3 years. These photos also contain <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/EXIF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">meta-tags</a> with geo-coordinates of the place the photo was taken. So it means it is a very <a href="https://github.com/KrauseFx/detect.location" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accurate history of your moving</a>. Who would have thought the app gets programmatic access to all the photos and not just the one you choose.</li> </ol> <p>Manipulation:</p> <ol> <li><strong>storing</strong>. Let's get back to the photos. If you choose a photo to add a doggie face, this photo can be stored on the servers of this service for god knows how long. Nothing strange.</li> <li><strong>calculation</strong>. But, as I said, the app also gets access to the whole gallery. Is it that obvious that the app can get a pretty accurate guess on what is your home and work addresses are based on the time and geo-location of each photo? Or that it can run every image against <a href="https://yahooeng.tumblr.com/post/151148689421/open-sourcing-a-deep-learning-solution-for" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an ML algorithm that finds NSFW images</a> and securely upload it to the servers? I hope your fucking doggie face was worth it.</li> <li><strong>selling</strong>. <em>If you don't pay for the product, you are the product</em>. What a cliché. Instagram is free because every single person on Earth can buy ads for a very specific audience. Those who travel to beaches, who loves certain food or have a high income. Instagram calculates all of this from the enormous data set they have, and the advertiser can combine these segments however they want. Of course, once you click an ad the advertiser knows exactly what segment you are in. <a href="https://dkzlv.com/static/img/posts/en_privacy1/targeting.png" target="_blank"> <img alt="Targeting accuracy" src="https://dkzlv.com/static/img/posts/en_privacy1/targeting.png" height="543" width="600"> </a> </li> <li><strong>hacks or leaks</strong>. Oh, guys and gals, when we get to this I'll turn your camera on to capture how surprised you'd be. For now, just believe me: <em>all the companies</em> lose the data from time to time, from a small garage startup to Google, from a small accounting firm to Revenue Service of an entire country. I get chills from some of the most notorious cases, really.</li> </ol> <p>Some of the bullets require some explanation (and we'll get to that!) because laymen for some reason think Big Corporations are not that bad and want good for humanity. Well, if you also think that your frustration will be very painful.</p> <a href="https://dkzlv.com/en/how-they-harvest-data#part-2-actors" id="part-2-actors">  </a><p>Let's go top to bottom. Cumplucters are connected with a huge Great Internet-Network and they talk to each other using Magic Requests.</p> <p><em>(all of it are eligible terms, I'm a pro, believe me)</em></p> <p>When you visit someone's blog your computer makes a request to another computer and gets some response. But the response does not go directly to the server, it has a few stops on the way. Each stop has its own dangers. </p> <p> <a href="https://dkzlv.com/static/img/posts/en_privacy1/request_flow.png" target="_blank"> <img alt="Request flow on the internet" src="https://dkzlv.com/static/img/posts/en_privacy1/request_flow.png" height="293" width="600"> </a> </p> <blockquote> <p>The outline is super simple, its accuracy is around 60%, but according to British scientists <a href="https://www.getscience.com/biology-explained/how-genetically-related-are-we-bananas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you are a 60% banana</a>, so if you're very interested go check out <a href="https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the whole story of the request</a>.</p> </blockquote> <a href="https://dkzlv.com/en/how-they-harvest-data#device-dns" id="device-dns"> <h2>Device → DNS</h2> </a><p>Machines identify each other using ip-addresses — those look like 4 numbers split out with dots, like <code>127.0.0.1</code>. People are not that good with numbers, we're used to strings, like <a href="https://dkzlv.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dkzlv.com</a>. We call it "domain".</p> <p><em>God save you if you'll come telling me about ipv6.</em></p> <p>But the computers still work — all thanks to a thing called DNS (Domain Name Server, clear, isn't it?). Think of it as a huge table in Excel that translates a domain into an ip-address.</p> <p>DNS will be the first leak. The problem is that the founding fathers of the internet didn't foresee this informational revolution and they made the information exchange with the DNS completely unencrypted. Later we'll talk about transport layer security, but the idea is simple: your internet provider will always know what sites you visit. Sometimes it can even modify the answer from the original DNS if the site owner does not implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DNSSEC</a>.</p> <p>Answering your question: yes, your provider knows you visit <em>the site</em>, which makes you sweat like a dog.</p> <p><strong>Solution</strong>: we have a few. You can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_TLS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DNS-over-TLS (DoT)</a>. There's some difference that smart people get (I really don't), but you shouldn't dive into these details.</p> <p>You remember those tech guys who came to your house that set up the internet? They should have given you a piece of paper and said "don't lose this". You immediately threw it in the garbage after that, AND YOU DID RIGHT. It had your provider's DNS there, and that tech guy set up your router to use it. "It helps you with speed" — they said. "Insecure shit" — we understand. They do not support DoT and unlikely they will ever support it, because why would they.</p> <p>Try to use independent DNS-servers. I recommend using Cloudflare DNS with a cool ip-address: <strong>1.1.1.1</strong>. It's free, fast and they promise a zero-logs policy, so they don't save anything about your dirty little secrets. They have <a href="https://1.1.1.1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apps for smartphones</a>, that setup everything magically, so use them, otherwise it's kind of difficult to setup.</p> <p>It gets trickier for desktops. First, you need to setup a DNS <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/setting-up-1.1.1.1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the OS level</a>, and then turn on <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/dns-over-https-will-eventually-roll-out-in-all-major-browsers-despite-isp-opposition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an experimental DoH support in the browser</a>.</p> <a href="https://dkzlv.com/en/how-they-harvest-data#device-provider-datacenter-server" id="device-provider-datacenter-server"> <h2>Device → Provider → Datacenter → server</h2> </a><p>There are two types of connections: secure and not secure. You'll get a notification about an insecure connection from the browser if it's not an old piece of mammoth shit. If it's not an old piece of black rhino's shit, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_rhinoceros" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which got extinct in 2013</a>, it will even ask you to think carefully if you should use this site at all.</p> <p>If you see a notification about an insecure connection, you'd be safer to just close this site and do nothing there. Believe me, this site may be as bad as having unprotected sex with a partner that has radial red stripes spreading from their genitalia.</p> <p> <a href="https://dkzlv.com/static/img/posts/en_privacy1/secure_channel.png" target="_blank"> <img alt="Most secure connection of all" src="https://dkzlv.com/static/img/posts/en_privacy1/secure_channel.png" height="720" width="600"> </a> </p> <p>Insecure connections have no real vulnerabilities, except a small one: every single intermediary has complete control over stuff you send and receive — so it means a complete lack of any security at all. Some mobile operators, for example, <a href="https://tjournal.ru/tech/62611-pochemu-megafon-bessovestno-pokazyvaet-reklamu-na-chuzhih-saytah" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">embed their fullscreen ads</a> on insecure sites without asking any permission from site owner.</p> <p>So let's talk about secure connections. I'll give you a small lecture about cryptography (no, it has near to no connection to cryptocurrencies) and how the network works so you can impress your grandma.</p> <p>If you're not a Ph.D. in cryptography and haven't launched an ICO from school's canteen, it good enough to know there are two types of encryption: symmetric and asymmetric. Symmetric is the one that has a single key for both encryption and decryption. Asymmetric one is where you use one key to encrypt stuff (it's called <strong>public key</strong>) and another key to decrypt it (it's called <strong>private key</strong>).</p> <p>Nobody really knows how the math works (like nobody really knows how so heavy-looking planes manage to fly the sky), but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol</a> that powers all this voodoo-shenanigan is safe enough for you to send sacred cat photos to your family.</p> <p>So, we use both types of encryption. It's rather boring to read, so I wrote a play that illustrates the whole process.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Characters</strong>:</p> <p><strong>Jimmie</strong>: young Alamaba fella having troubles with girls for some strange reasons.</p> <p><strong>Hannah</strong>: just a girl I added here to make a full picture.</p> <p><strong>Jimmie's phone</strong>: the device that sends messages.</p> <p><strong>Pinder</strong>: an app. <em>(any similarities to reality are entirely coincidental)</em></p> <p><strong>Pinder's server</strong>: the server that receives messages.</p> <p><strong>Act 1</strong></p> <p><em>Jimmie types a message to Hannah in Pinder</em></p> <p><strong>Jimmie's phone</strong> (talks to Pinder's server_): Hi there, good fellow. My guy wants to write yet another message (<em>signs</em>). Let's do this quickly and securely. I know HTTPS.</p> <p><strong>Pinder's server</strong>: Hi there, pal. Yeah, I get it. I know HTTPS as well. Here's the plan: first, I'll send you my public key, …</p></blockquote></div></div>

		<p><em>Update: an updated version of the ideas in this blog post appears in <a href="https://manning.com/books/api-security-in-action">chapter 9 of my book</a>. </em></p>
<p>URLs are a cornerstone of the web, and are the basic means by which content and resources are shared and disseminated. People copy and paste URLs into Slack or WhatsApp to share interesting links. Google crawls the web, discovering and indexing such links. But what happens when the page you want to link is not public and requires credentials in order to view or interact with it? Suddenly a URL is no longer sufficient, unless the recipient happens to already have credentials. Sometimes they do, and everything is fine, but often they do not. If we really do want to give them access, the problem becomes how to securely pass along some credentials with the URL so that they can access the page we have linked.</p>
<p>A commonly desired approach to this problem is to encode the credentials into the URL itself. While convenient, this solution is fraught with dangers and frequently results in credentials being exposed in insecure contexts. In this article, we’ll look at various ways to accomplish this, the ways that things can go wrong, and conclude with a set of guidelines for cases where this can be made secure, and actually improve security overall.</p>

<h2>What kind of credentials?</h2>
<p>The most usual kind of credential to grant access to a protected resource would be a username and password. Way back in the prehistory of the web there was a standard way to encode a username and password into a URL using the following syntax:</p>
<pre>http://bob:sekret@example.invalid/some/path</pre>
<p>Here “bob” is the username and “sekret” is the password. The way this was supposed to work is that when you clicked on that link, the web browser would automatically submit the username and password using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication">HTTP Basic</a> authentication (or possibly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication">Digest authentication</a>, but we should never talk of that). This turned out to be a terrible idea for many reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Firstly, putting your username and password in plaintext into a URL that can then be copied far and wide is a really quick way to account compromise. Giving your username and password to somebody else just so they can look at one of your cat photos is not the best idea in the world.</li>
<li>Basic authentication just Base64-encodes the credentials, so unless you were using SSL then the password would be recoverable to anybody observing the network traffic. While sites sometimes put SSL on the login page, they often didn’t bother for other parts of the site (relying on time-limited session cookies instead), so sending a username and password to a random URL was quite risky. This is much better now with the widespread adoption of HTTPS.</li>
<li>Due to the way Basic authentication works, after you have logged into one page with it, your browser will helpfully and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617#section-2.2">proactively send the username and password to every other page on the site</a> under the same path. This can leak credentials to unrelated pages.</li>
<li>It was soon realised that using a URL like <code><a href="http://www.google.com:search@example.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com:search@example.com</a></code> was a really easy way to create convincing-looking phishing links.</li>
<li>If the target of the URL is a login endpoint, then the attacker can attempt to get you to click on the link to perform a <a href="https://support.detectify.com/customer/portal/articles/1969819-login-csrf">Login CSRF</a> attack. In this case the honest user ends up with a session cookie for an account under the control of the attacker.</li>
</ol>
<p>For all these reasons, this specific form of URL was deprecated back in 2005, and now support within browsers is patchy: Safari for instance will just silently ignore any username:password component when following such a link. Other browsers will tolerate them in some cases, but this varies considerably by browser and often by version to version. Some versions of Chrome refuse to follow such links and instead display a large red phishing warning page.</p>
<p>So if not a username and password, then what kind of credentials could we put in a URL? Ideally you’d want a limited-scope credential that provides only permission to access that one specific URL in just the ways that the sharer of the link intends (e.g., read-only access). This is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege">principle of least authority</a> (POLA). Typically this is done by creating an unguessable <em>bearer token</em> that grants limited access to anybody that holds the token (the token bearer). There are two basic approaches to this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The token on its own is sufficient to grant access. This is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security">capability-based security</a>. This is similar to how keys work in the physical world, with the token here acting as the key. Just as with a real key, you can have different keys (capabilities) for different doors (URLs) so that one key does not grant access to everything.</li>
<li>The token grants some subset of the permissions of the person/agent who authorised it. Access is granted based on the permissions granted by the token as well as the identity of the user that approved it (the <em>resource owner</em>). This is the model used by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/confluence/display/uma/Home">UMA</a>, and a real-world analogy would be a signed note from a teacher granting a child permission to go and fetch something from a store cupboard at school. The teacher’s signature and identity grant the authority here, and the note describes the scope of the permission being granted.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will refer to both methods as <em>capability URLs</em> in this article, although strictly speaking that term only applies to the first option.</p>
<h2>Why put tokens in URLs at all?</h2>
<p>The OAuth approach is pretty popular these days as a way of granting limited access to third parties without giving away your username and password. The capability approach is less common, but has some <a href="http://wiki.erights.org/wiki/Walnut/Secure_Distributed_Computing#Capabilities">attractive security properties</a>. In both cases, if we want to follow POLA then we will end up with many fine-grained tokens that grant access to specific resources. We then have to make sure that we use the right token with the right URL, otherwise we might be denied access and also leak security tokens to unauthorized parties.</p>
<p>If we instead use broad-scope tokens and reuse them for many URLs then we run the risk of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confused_deputy_problem">confused deputy</a> attacks, where an attacker tricks us into adding our token to a request of their choosing. This is the basis of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery">CSRF attacks</a> against session tokens, and the same thing can happen with OAuth tokens if the code that adds access tokens to requests is not carefully written. Often UI code is written to add an access token to every request transparently, as a convenience for the developer. If an attacker can influence any of the requests you make, such as by manipulating URL parameters or the URL fragment, then they may still be able to trick your UI code into adding its token to a request of the attacker’s choosing.</p>
<p>Capability-based systems avoid confused deputy attacks because they fundamentally combine <em>permission to act on something </em>with the <em>ability to name that thing</em>. You can’t name an object you don’t have access to, and you can’t just add a permission token to any request to any resource. In an <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model">object-capability</a> programming language, capabilities are references to objects; if you hold a reference to an object you can call the methods on it, and you can’t just create a reference out of nowhere. On the web, we can achieve some of the same advantages by combining unforgeable tokens with URLs. CSRF attacks become impossible as the attacker cannot construct a valid URL in the first place (think of this as a bit like anti-CSRF tokens directly in the URL itself). Phishing becomes pointless as there are no credentials to phish independent of the links they are part of. In certain cases, even XSS attacks become less effective, as we shall see later.</p>
<h2>How to do it safely</h2>
<p>Many security professionals reading this will baulk at the very idea of putting security tokens into URLs, and with good reason. A <em>lot</em> can go wrong. Let’s look at some ways to add credentials to URLs and how they can go wrong. Firstly, there are some issues that are common to all methods of putting credentials in URLs:</p>
<ul>
<li>URLs may be saved in the history of a browser, making them potentially accessible to the next user of a public terminal. Most browsers support private browsing modes that can be used on public browsers to prevent this, but use of a public terminal is always a risk. If somebody gains access to your computer or phone, then this may also be a threat even on your own device. Using time-limited tokens in URLs can help mitigate against these threats.</li>
<li>URLs within page content may be cached by the browser and by web proxies. Use of TLS and proper <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control">Cache-Control</a> headers can reduce this risk.</li>
<li>URLs in the content of a HTML page may be sniffed by other scripts running in the page. Sandboxing untrusted 3rd-party scripts in iframes can help, but a more general technique is to avoid links directly in HTML, as we shall see later.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tokens in the path or in query parameters</h3>
<pre>https://example.com/users/<span>Kay2xVuid_tiWxJ5NI0NWmGxQ7Y</span> https://example.com/users/bob?key=<span>Kay2xVuid_tiWxJ5NI0NWmGxQ7Y</span></pre>
<p>An obvious place to put a token in a URL is either into the path (perhaps using random names for resources) or into the query parameters. This is nice and simple, but suffers from some drawbacks.</p>
<p>Firstly, such URLs might inadvertently leak in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer">Referer header</a> when loading resources from other sites. This can also happen via the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/referrer">document.referrer</a> field available in Javascript when a third-party resource is loaded in an iframe (ironically, often done to isolate the 3rd-party code). These days the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referrer-Policy">Referrer-Policy</a> header can be used to prevent these kinds of leaks, but browser support is not yet 100%.</p>
<p>A second drawback is that URL path elements and query parameters are often logged in access logs of any servers that the request passes through, making tokens vulnerable to anybody who has access to those logs. The more widespread deployment of HTTPS has reduced this risk, but it still common to terminate TLS at a load balancer or reverse proxy (or even <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/204144518-SSL-FAQ">in the cloud</a> before it ever reaches your own servers). The request may then pass through several other gateways and services before being processed (even more …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Intro</strong></p><p>I’m a believer that anyone can build anything, given that they stay resourceful. Development, design, product all require similar veins of thinking. You need to think from the user’s perspective, continuously iterate, and collaborate cross functionally. Generalists who are able to do a bit of everything, or at least understand the tools of other trades have a great advantage in the industry.</p><p>Back in 2016, I was building my first few iOS apps, but didn’t know anything about design. That design bit held me back from working on more ambitious projects. I was afraid to start a new project until I had carefully produced mockups, and a clear understanding of what to build. This mindset held me back from doing the most important thing —&nbsp;building.</p><p>Taking the leap is really important. It means recognizing that you might not immediately have all the skills necessary to do something, but that you’ll give it a try anyway. When it comes to a developer learning how to design, taking that first leap is critical. After all, design skills don’t come through books or videos, but through application and reflection.</p><p>It’s definitely intimidating to dive into a field you’ve never explored before, but there are ways to make that transition easier. In this next section, I’ll talk a bit about some small things that have helped me be more resourceful and soak in knowledge from unexpected places.</p><h2>Being resourceful</h2><p><strong>1. Question your friends a lot</strong></p><ul><li>It’s easy to fall in the trap of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_consensus_effect" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><u>false consensus effect</u></a>, where we believe everyone sees things the same way we do. But the fact is, those around us, even those closest to us, probably perceive things very differently. That’s something people should exploit; it’s a free resource that’s incredibly accessible to us.</li><li>When unsure about how you’d approach a problem or novel idea, ask a friend. They don’t need to be an expert in that field —&nbsp;in fact, I think it’s better if they weren’t an expert. Get their opinion on how they would design a search box, then make adjustments as you see fit. Others’ unbiased approaches to a problem, or their years of expertise can teach you a whole lot.</li></ul><p><strong>2. Question seemingly inconsequential things in your daily life.</strong></p><p>This is a big one! Every time you use a mobile app or visit a landing page, don’t just mindlessly scroll through. It’s pretty crazy, but most of the times everything is meticulously crafted, with elements placed in certain locations for very specific reasons. Put yourself in the shoes of the person who designed that product, and think about a few things:</p><ul><li>Why choose this color for their buttons?</li><li>Why use certain fonts?</li><li>Why use this style of wording?</li><li>Why this graphic style?</li></ul><p><strong>3. Get good at searching for answers</strong></p><p>Here, I pretty much mean get really good at digging through Google, Reddit, and relevant forums. There are countless blog posts, videos, and threads that go really deep into even the most obscure things. If you look hard enough, you’ll find an answer, or at least another direction to look in. Searching for help instead of thinking through already solved problems and reinventing the wheel is a much better use of time.</p><p><strong>4. Get connected</strong></p><p>Follow blogs, newsletters, YouTube channels, Twitter accounts, whatever pertains to what you’re trying to learn. Become a daily follower of a few channels. r/design and UX Collective on Medium are always great sources for learning from other designers. I also tend to scroll through ProductHunt every morning, paying special attention to what makes successful products so usable/beautiful, and what problems plague less successful products.</p><p>For developers looking to learn design, here are a few resources I found super helpful.</p><ul><li><a href="https://mobbin.design/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Mobbin.design</a>: mobile design inspiration</li><li><a href="https://pttrns.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Pttrns.com</a>: mobile design inspiration</li><li><a href="https://dribbble.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dribbble</a>: general design inspiration</li><li><a href="https://muz.li/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Muzli</a>: general design inspiration</li><li><a href="https://lapa.ninja/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Lapa.ninja</a>: landing page inspiration</li></ul><h2>A few rules of thumb</h2><p>If you're a developer and are looking to improve your design skills, here are a few rules I followed that quickly improved my usability and aesthetics.</p><p><strong>1. Establish a design system early on</strong></p><p>Investing some initial time to develop a design system saves a boatload of time down the road. Here’s an example of a basic design system. It consists of setting up font sizes/styles/colors, spacing rules, and a color palette. As you add to this system, you can build out reusable components like modals, buttons, and call to action blocks.</p><figure><img src="https://cosmonaut-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/690495724046078_5fb7b92b5574cd223a09ade8_Screenshot%202020-11-20%20at%208.png"></figure><p>Or, if you don’t want to build a design system from scratch, use a framework like <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><u>Tailwind CSS</u></a> or <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><u>Bootstrap</u></a> which gives you a set of components out of the box.</p><p>Want more options? Run with a prebuilt design system like <a href="https://github.com/palantir/blueprint" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><u>Blueprint</u></a> by Palantir or <a href="https://evergreen.segment.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><u>Evergreen</u></a> by Segment.</p><p>Make sure to reference this system constantly as you start developing! It keeps your design clean and consistent.</p><p><strong>2. Hierarchy</strong></p><p>This one’s super important! Not all elements on the page should be treated as equal. Bump up the font size and weight for the elements that users should care more about. Typically, section titles, important statistics, or names take precedence over body text, descriptions, and metadata.</p><p>Another tip from Steve Schoger from Refactoring UI (highly recommended read): you can establish hierarchy not just from increasing the font sizes, but primarily through font weight as well. Sometimes, keeping elements scaled down with larger weights helps a lot with balancing the aesthetics of a page.</p><figure><img src="https://cosmonaut-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/737743796539109_5fb7b92b879c176278a4bd9b_Screenshot%202020-11-20%20at%208.png"></figure><p><a href="https://twitter.com/steveschoger/status/910162010754748416" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Source</a></p><p><strong>3. Use white space</strong></p><p>White space is a powerful tool. It can be used to draw attention where you want, increase legibility, and add a sense of additional organization and hierarchy to the page.</p><p>White space in Google’s homepage here removes distractions and draws your attention to what matters — search.</p><figure><img src="https://cosmonaut-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/761519906735794_5fb7b9293fa55b1b89e756ed_Screenshot%202020-11-20%20at%208.png"></figure><p>Adding some white space in the form of increasing the line height for this block of body text also makes a huge difference in readability. Notice how spacing out the title and the body text helps establish that information hierarchy too.</p><figure><img src="https://cosmonaut-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/184238091170962_5fb7b92baa1448248ebee17b_Screenshot%202020-11-20%20at%208.png"></figure><p>White space is a powerful tool, just remember to be consistent! Follow that design system and play with different spacing, but based on those spacing levels defined earlier. That way, the entire app or website feels coherent.</p><p><strong>4. Utility over design</strong></p><ol><li>We learned a few tips to freshen up your UI design, but the most important thing to keep in your mind is to always prioritize utility over design. Something beautiful that people don’t understand just isn’t useful to anybody.</li><li>Choose a traditional font for your body text. I love Inter, Helvetica, PT Serif if you want a sans serif font. They’re clear and legible.</li><li>Make sure there’s enough foreground and background contrast. Make sure text is clearly visible, and think about accessibility when it comes to people who might have some form of colorblindness. Here’s a pretty great tool to see if your colors have enough contrast: <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/</a></li></ol></div></div>]]>

  <p><i>Posted on <code>16 Feb 2021</code> by
  <code>Boris Kolpackov</code> with comments on <a href="https://redd.it/ll1l6z"><code>r/cpp/</code></a></i></p>

  <p><b>TL;DR</b>: <code>build2</code> now provides conforming and scalable
  support for all the major C++20 Modules features when used with GCC. This
  includes named modules, module partitions (both interface and
  implementation), header unit importation, and include translation. All of
  these features are also supported in libraries, including consumption of
  installed libraries with information about modules and importable headers
  conveyed in <code>pkg-config</code> files. As part of this effort we have
  also created a collection of <a href="https://github.com/build2/cxx20-modules-examples/">examples</a> that
  demonstrate C++20 Modules features that impact the build process.</p>

  <p>Before going into detail on each of these features, let's clarify what we
  mean by <i>conforming</i> and <i>scalable</i>. With GCC (and soon with
  Clang), <code>build2</code> uses the module mapper mechanism to discover
  module and header unit dependencies and communicate their mapping to the
  compiler. As a result, <code>build2</code> does not place any restrictions
  on the structure of translation units or module features used. In other
  words, it is able to handle any conforming C++ module or header unit.</p>

  <p>Similarly, <code>build2</code> does not place on the user any modules
  support burden that would not scale to general, real-world projects and
  use-cases. Specifically, it does not expect the user to manually specify and
  maintain module name to file name mapping, their dependency information, or
  arrange pre-building of any modules or header units, including of system
  headers. In particular, <code>build2</code> will automatically build header
  units if and when imported or include-translated.</p>

  <div>
  <p>While <code>build2</code> support for modules is complete and reasonably
  reliable, at the time of writing the same cannot be said about GCC. As a
  result, until the situation improves, the implementation is meant more for
  early experimentation rather than production use. See <a href="#try">How to
  Try</a> for details.</p>

  <p>One <code>build2</code> feature that is not yet handled by the module
  mapper is support for auto-generated headers. However, this support has
  already been successfully prototyped during the early modules development in
  GCC and we hope to revive and complete it in the near future (see <a href="https://wg21.link/P1842">P1842</a> for details).</p>

  <p>See <a href="https://github.com/build2/cxx20-modules-examples/tree/master/hello-module"><code>cxx20-modules-examples/hello-module</code></a>
  for the complete example.</p>

  

  <p>Building named modules with <code>build2</code> is fairly
  straightforward. Here is a minimal example consisting of three files,
  <code>hello.mxx</code>, <code>main.cxx</code>, and
  <code>buildfile</code>:</p>

  <pre>// hello.mxx

export module hello;

import &lt;string_view&gt;;
import &lt;iostream&gt;;

export namespace hello
{
  void
  say_hello (const std::string_view&amp; name)
  {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, " &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; '!' &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  }
}</pre>

  <pre>// main.cxx

import hello;

int
main ()
{
  hello::say_hello ("World");
}</pre>

  <pre># buildfile

cxx.std = experimental
cxx.features.modules = true

using cxx

assert $cxx.features.modules "no modules support for $cxx.signature"

mxx{*}: extension = mxx
cxx{*}: extension = cxx

exe{hello}: {cxx mxx}{*}</pre>

  <p>If you place all three files into some directory, you should be able to
  build it like this (see <a href="#try">How to Try</a> for details):</p>

  <pre>$ b config.cxx=g++-11
c++ .../include/c++/11.0.0/h{string_view}
c++ .../include/c++/11.0.0/h{iostream}
c++ mxx{hello}
c++ cxx{main}
ld exe{hello}

$ ./hello
Hello, World!</pre>

  <p>As you might have noticed, we used a different extension
  (<code>.mxx</code>) for our module interface (<code>hello.mxx</code>)
  compared to other source files (for example, <code>main.cxx</code>). We
  recommend that you follow this practice (using the <code>.mpp</code>
  extension if your source files use <code>.cpp</code>). If, however, you
  would like to use the same extension for all translation units, you can, you
  will just have to sort them out in your <code>buildfiles</code>, for example
  (after renaming <code>hello.mxx</code> to <code>hello.cxx</code>):</p>

  <pre>mxx{*}: extension = cxx
cxx{*}: extension = cxx

exe{hello}: mxx{hello} cxx{main}</pre>

  <p>If you compare the above three files to the <a href="https://github.com/build2/cxx20-modules-examples/tree/master/hello-module"><code>hello-module</code></a>
  example, you will notice that the latter has quite a few more files and some
  internal structure. The reason is that <code>hello-module</code> is a
  package with a structure more suitable for real-world projects. In contrast,
  the above three files are a simple build system-only project more suitable
  for quick tests and prototypes.</p>

  <div>
  <p>Because modules support in GCC is currently experimental and incomplete,
  we have to explicitly force this feature either with the following in our
  <code>buildfile</code>:</p>

  <pre>cxx.std = experimental
cxx.features.modules = true</pre>

  <p>Or by overriding on the command line:</p>

  <pre>$ b config.cxx.std=experimental config.cxx.features.modules=true ...</pre>
  </div>

  

  <p>See <a href="https://github.com/build2/cxx20-modules-examples/tree/master/hello-partition"><code>cxx20-modules-examples/hello-partition</code></a>
  for the complete example.</p>

  <p>There is not much difference in dealing with module partitions compared
  to primary module interfaces: both interface and implementation partitions
  should use the same extension as module interfaces (or otherwise be
  explicitly listed as <code>mxx{}</code> targets, as shown above). See the <a href="https://github.com/build2/cxx20-modules-examples/tree/master/hello-partition"><code>hello-partition</code></a>
  example which shows the use of both interface and implementation
  partitions.</p>

  

  <p>See <a href="https://github.com/build2/cxx20-modules-examples/tree/master/hello-header-import"><code>cxx20-modules-examples/hello-header-import</code></a>
  for the complete example.</p>

  <p>Importing header units is straightforward: simply replace
  <code>#include</code> directives with <code>import</code> declarations and
  hope the compiler can handle it. In fact, we've already used header units in
  our named module example above. Here is another example:</p>

  <pre>// main.cxx

import &lt;iostream&gt;;

int
main ()
{
  std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, World!" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}</pre>

  <pre># buildfile

cxx.std = experimental
cxx.features.modules = true

using cxx

assert $cxx.features.modules "no modules support for $cxx.signature"

cxx{*}: extension = cxx

exe{hello}: cxx{*}</pre>

  <pre>$ b config.cxx=g++-11
c++ .../include/c++/11.0.0/h{iostream}
c++ cxx{main}
ld exe{hello}</pre>

  <p>Naturally, importation is not limited to standard library headers and we
  can also import our project's own headers as demonstrated in the <a href="https://github.com/build2/cxx20-modules-examples/tree/master/hello-header-import"><code>hello-header-import</code></a>
  example.</p>

  

  <p>See <a href="https://github.com/build2/cxx20-modules-examples/tree/master/hello-header-translate"><code>cxx20-modules-examples/hello-header-translate</code></a>
  for the complete example.</p>

  <p>Instead of manually replacing <code>#include</code> directives with
  <code>import</code> declarations in our source code we can translate them on
  the fly. To control which headers are translated we use the
  <code>config.cxx.translate_include</code> configuration variable. For
  example, we can try to translate all the importable headers:</p>

  <pre>$ b config.cxx=g++-11 config.cxx.translate_include=all-importable</pre>

  <p>Since include translation is non-intrusive, you can try it on any project
  that uses <code>build2</code> by forcing modules support and enabling
  include translation, for example:</p>

  <pre>$ b config.cxx=g++-11 \
  config.cxx.std=experimental \
  config.cxx.features.modules=true \
  config.cxx.translate_include=all-importable</pre>

  <p>Which headers are importable? The C++20 standard specifies that all the
  C++ standard library headers (but not the C library wrappers) are
  importable. For example, this is how we can translate only importable
  standard library headers:</p>

  <pre>config.cxx.translate_include=std-importable</pre>

  <p>We can also mark our own headers as importable with the
  <code>cxx.importable</code> variable, for example:</p>

  <pre># buildfile

...

# Assume headers are importable unless stated otherwise.
#
hxx{*}: cxx.importable = true</pre>

  <p>There could also be third-party headers that are not explicitly marked as
  importable. To handle this, we can request the translation of specific
  headers or header wildcard patterns, for example:</p>

  <pre>config.cxx.translate_include='&lt;iostream&gt; "&lt;boost/container/*.hpp&gt;"'</pre>

  <p>We can also disable the translation of specific headers or header groups,
  for example:</p>

  <pre>config.cxx.translate_include='all-importable std-importable@false'
config.cxx.translate_include='std-importable &lt;iostream&gt;@false'</pre>

  <p>You can also attempt to translate all headers by specifying the
  <code>all</code> header group. This is primarily useful for experimentation,
  for example, to discover which headers would break the build if
  translated.</p>

  <p>Finally, if we need to adjust or disable include translation for our
  project or for specific translation units in our project, we use the
  <code>cxx.translate_include</code> variable, for example:</p>

  <pre># buildfile

cxx.translate_include += &lt;iostream&gt;@false

obj{main}: cxx.translate_include = # Don't translate anything.</pre>

  

  <p>See <a href="https://github.com/build2/cxx20-modules-examples/tree/master/hello-library-module"><code>cxx20-modules-examples/hello-library-module</code></a>
  and <a href="https://github.com/build2/cxx20-modules-examples/tree/master/hello-library-header"><code>cxx20-modules-examples/hello-library-header</code></a>
  for the complete examples.</p>

  <p>Building modules as part of a library does not pose any additional
  complications. Here is how we can convert our example from the <a href="#named-modules">Named Modules</a> section to build a library:</p>

  <pre># buildfile

...

exe{hello}: cxx{main} lib{hello}
lib{hello}: {cxx mxx}{* -main}</pre>

  <p>However, installing libraries with modules and then consuming the result
  in other projects (and potentially with other build systems) requires
  additional mechanisms. Specifically, the installation needs to convey which
  modules are provided by the library and the location of their module
  interface source files (the consuming build system also needs to arrange for
  the compilation of these interfaces on the side).</p>

  <p>Instead of inventing yet another file format, we choose to reuse the
  <code>pkg-config</code> files that <code>build2</code> automatically
  produces for every library it installs. Specifically, the
  <code>pkg-config</code> format supports free variables which is what we use
  to convey the modules information. For example, this is the relevant
  fragment from the <code>libhello.pc</code> file in the <a href="https://github.com/build2/cxx20-modules-examples/tree/master/hello-library-module"><code>hello-library-module</code></a>
  example (<code>..</code> in <code>hello..check</code> encodes the
  <code>:</code> module partition separator):</p>

  <pre>cxx_modules = \
  hello..check=/usr/include/libhello/check.mxx \
  hello=/usr/include/libhello/hello.mxx</pre>

  <p>Naturally, the same mechanism is used to convey which library headers are
  importable (from the <a href="https://github.com/build2/cxx20-modules-examples/tree/master/hello-library-header"><code>hello-library-header</code></a>
  example):</p>

  <pre>cxx_importable_headers = \
  /usr/include/libhello/check.hxx \
  /usr/include/libhello/hello.hxx</pre>

<p>Our next lecture will cover one of the basic tools we’ll use throughout the rest of the course: <em>exterior algebra</em>. The basic idea is to add a couple new operations to our usual list of vector operations (dot product, cross product, etc.) that make it easy to talk about <em>volumes</em> rather than just vectors. If you felt ok working with things like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product">cross product</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant">determinant</a> in your linear algebra/vector calculus courses, this shouldn’t be too big of a leap. (If not, could be a good moment for a <a href="http://brickisland.net/DDGFall2017/2017/09/03/linear-algebra-and-vector-calculus-review/">review</a>!)</p>

<p>In tomorrow’s lecture we will catch a first glimpse of the idea of <em>manifolds</em>, which are pretty central to differential geometry.  Rather than giving a formal definition in the smooth case, we’ll introduce a notion of <em>discrete manifolds</em> that capture the most important ideas.  These discrete manifolds build on the idea of a <em>simplicial complex</em>, introduced in the previous lecture.</p>

<p>Your next reading will take a dive into purely combinatorial descriptions of surfaces,&nbsp;<em>i.e.,</em> those that capture connectivity, but not geometry. &nbsp;These descriptions and data structures will provide the foundation for all the geometry and algorithms we’ll build up in this class. &nbsp;(The reading also provides the essential background for your first written and coding assignments!)</p>
<p>The reading is Chapter 2, pages 7–20 of our <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/DDG/paper.pdf">course notes</a>, which can always be accessed from the link above.</p>
<p>Your short 2-3 sentence summary is due by <strong>10am Eastern on February 19, 2020.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Handin instructions can be found on the <a href="http://brickisland.net/DDGSpring2021/assignments/">assignment page</a>.</p>

<p>For the coding portion of your first assignment, you will implement some operations on simplicial complexes which were discussed in class and in Chapter 2 of the <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/DDG/paper.pdf">course notes</a>. Once implemented, you will be able to select simplices and apply these operations to them by clicking the appropriate buttons in the viewer (shown above).</p>
<p><b><u>Getting Started</u></b></p>
<ul>
<li>Decide whether you want to use the web skeleton (in JavaScript) or the desktop skeleton (in C++). The web skeleton should “just work” for anyone with a web browser. Setting up the C++ skeleton is also fairly automatic (just a few <tt>git</tt> commands), but requires a little more familiarity with coding environments. (The benefit of the C++ version is that it’s built on a richer, real-world mesh processing/visualization library than the web version.)</li>
<li>To use the JavaScript version, download or clone the files in the <a href="https://github.com/cmu-geometry/ddg-exercises-js">ddg-exercises-js repository</a>.</li>
<li>To use the C++ version, follow the instructions in the <a href="http://github.com/geometrycollective/ddg-exercises">ddg-exercises repository</a>. <b>It is important that you follow the “Getting Started” instructions and do not simply <tt>git clone</tt> the repo.</b> Otherwise, dependencies will not be installed correctly, and the code will not build. If you struggle to get the C++ version working on your platform, we recommend you switch to the JavaScript version.</li>
<li>Either way, you should need to download just one code skeleton for the whole semester (though we may push periodic updates to fix bugs, etc.).</li>
<li>For this assignment, you will need to implement the following routines in <tt>projects/simplicial-complex-operators/simplicial-complex-operators.[js|cpp]</tt>:
<ul>
<li><tt>assignElementIndices</tt></li>
<li><tt>buildVertexEdgeAdjacencyMatrix</tt></li>
<li><tt>buildEdgeFaceAdjacencyMatrix</tt></li>
<li><tt>buildVertexVector</tt></li>
<li><tt>buildEdgeVector</tt></li>
<li><tt>buildFaceVector</tt></li>
<li><tt>star</tt></li>
<li><tt>closure</tt></li>
<li><tt>link</tt></li>
<li><tt>isComplex</tt></li>
<li><tt>isPureComplex</tt></li>
<li><tt>boundary</tt></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b><u>Notes</u></b></p>
<ul>
<li>The JavaScript assignment comes with a viewer <tt>projects/simplicial-complex-operators/index.html</tt> which lets you apply your operators to simplices of meshes and visualize the results. Likewise, the C++ version comes with a viewer with similar functionality. (Viewers will be available for all assignments throughout the semester.)</li>
<li><b>Pay close attention to the course notes!</b> Some routines really must be implemented with sparse matrices, <em>not</em> directly with the halfedge mesh data structure.</li>
<li>Selecting simplices will not work until you fill in the <tt>assignElementIndices</tt> function.</li>
<li>The assignment also comes with a test script <tt>tests/simplicial-complex-operators/text.html</tt> which you can use to verify the correctness of your operators.</li>
<li>The web framework is implemented in Javascript, which means no compilation or installation is necessary on any platform. You can simply get started by opening the <tt>index.html</tt> file in <tt>projects/discrete-exterior-calculus/</tt> in a web browser. We recommend using Chrome or Firefox. Safari has poor <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API">WebGL</a> performance.</li>
<li>If you do not have prior experience with Javascript, do not worry! You should be able to get a handle on Javascript syntax by reading through some of the code in the framework (a good place to start might be <tt>core/geometry.js</tt>). The framework also contains extensive documentation (see <tt>docs/index.html</tt>).</li>
<li>All browsers come with tools for debugging (for instance the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/">JavaScript Console</a> in Chrome).</li>
</ul>
<p><b><u>Submission Instructions</u></b></p>
<p>The assignment is due on <strong>February 26, 2020 at 5:59:59pm Eastern</strong> (<em>not</em> at midnight!). Remember to turn in the whole coding assignment via a single ZIP file containing the modified source files. Further hand-in instructions can be found on <a href="http://brickisland.net/DDGSpring2021/assignments/">this page</a>.</p>

<p>For the written part of your first homework you will do some exercises that will help familiarize you with basic descriptions and representations of combinatorial surfaces (simplicial surfaces, adjacency matrices, halfedge meshes), which will help prepare you to work with such surfaces as we continue through the course.  (If any of this stuff seems abstract right now, don’t worry: we’ll use it over and over again to implement “real” algorithms starting in just a couple weeks!)</p>
<p>You must complete all 15 exercises from the <em>Written Exercises</em> section of Chapter 2 of the <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/DDG/paper.pdf">course notes</a>.  If these exercises seem scary and unfamiliar, and you don’t know where to start, that’s ok!  This is not typical computer science stuff, and you shouldn’t necessarily know how to do it right off the bat.  If you find yourself stumbling, <em>please</em> reach out to the instructor/TAs and your classmates on Piazza, Discord, or during the office hours/Q&amp;A sessions.  We’ll have you up and running in no time. 🙂</p>

<p>In this lecture we’ll really start from the beginning, and define some of the basic objects we’ll use throughout the class.  In particular, we’ll look at the idea of a “mesh,” and study one very specific kind of mesh called an <em>oriented simplicial complex</em>.</p>

		<p><strong>Due date: 10am Eastern on Thursday, February 11, 2021</strong></p>
<p>Your first reading assignment will be to read an overview article on Discrete Differential Geometry. Since we know we have a diverse mix of participants in the class, you have several options (pick one):</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>(pages 1–3)</strong>&nbsp;Crane &amp; Wardetzky, <a href="http://www.ams.org/publications/journals/notices/201710/rnoti-p1153.pdf">“A Glimpse into Discrete Differential Geometry”</a>.<br>
This article discusses the “no free lunch” story about curvature we looked at in class, plus a broader overview of the field.</li>
<li><strong>(pages 1–5)</strong>&nbsp;Pottman et al, <a href="http://brickisland.net/DDGFall2017/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/DDGArchitecturalGeometry.pdf">“Architectural Geometry”</a>.<br>
This article discusses the beautiful tale of how discrete differential geometry is linked to modern approaches to computational design for architecture, as well as fabrication and “rationalization” of free-form designs.</li>
<li><strong>(pages 5–9)</strong>&nbsp;Bobenko &amp; Suris, <a href="http://brickisland.net/DDGFall2017/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/DDGConsistencyAsIntegrability.pdf">“Discrete Differential Geometry: Consistency As Integrability”</a>.<br>
This article provides another overview of discrete differential geometry, with an emphasis on&nbsp;<em>nets</em> and their connection to the notion of <em>integrability</em> in geometry and physics.</li>
</ol>
<p>Though written for a broad audience, be warned that all of these articles are somewhat advanced—the goal here is not to understand every little detail, but rather just get a high-level sense of what DDG is all about.</p>
<p><strong>Assignment: </strong>Pick one of the readings above, and&nbsp;write 2–3 sentences summarizing what you read, plus at least one question about something you didn’t understand, or some thought/idea that occurred to you while reading the article. &nbsp;For this first assignment, we are also&nbsp;<strong>very</strong> interested to know a little bit about <b>YOU!</b> E.g., why are you taking this course? &nbsp;What’s your background? &nbsp;What do you hope to get out of this course? &nbsp;What are your biggest fears about the course? &nbsp;Etc.</p>
<p>Handin instructions can be found in the <span>“Readings”</span> section of the <a href="http://brickisland.net/DDGSpring2021/assignments/">Assignments</a> page.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>Our first lecture provides motivation for the topics we’ll cover in the course, and takes a deep dive into one specific example (curvature of curves in the plane) to highlight some of the basic principles of discrete differential geometry.  This example moves pretty fast and uses some ideas that we’ll study at a slower, more careful pace later on.  For now, don’t worry too much about the details—the goal here is to just get a sense of what the course is all about!</p>

<p> <a href="https://www.de24.news/"></a>&nbsp;The&nbsp; editors of Titanic can currently no longer deliver the digital edition of their satirical magazine via the app in the Google Play Store. <a href="https://www.de24.news/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.de24.news/a1/de24.png?resize=400%2C20&amp;ssl=1" alt="© www.de24.news" width="400" height="20" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>&nbsp;The&nbsp; background is a dispute with the tech company, which, according to the Titanic editor-in-chief, took offense at several magazine covers.</p>



<p>In particular, the December 2020 issue was rejected by Google because of the depiction of a sacred motif (profanity), which was rated as “obscene”: <a href="https://www.de24.news/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.de24.news/a1/de24.png?resize=400%2C20&amp;ssl=1" alt="© www.de24.news" width="400" height="20" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>&nbsp;The&nbsp; cover of the magazine shows the Pope with a bare backside with a crucifix, and an angry one (because he is jealous of God ) Seeing Jesus with his genitals bared. <a href="https://www.de24.news/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.de24.news/a1/de24.png?resize=400%2C20&amp;ssl=1" alt="© www.de24.news" width="400" height="20" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>&nbsp;The&nbsp; cover alludes to a cover picture of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, on which the Turkish prime minister could be seen in a similar scene.</p>

<h3>Titanic 12.2020</h3><figcaption> (Image: Titanic Magazine)</figcaption>
<h3 id="nav_antrag_auf__0">Application for re-listing rejected for the time being</h3>
<p>Two weeks ago, shortly before the appearance of the second edition in 2021, Google blocked the app of the satirical magazine with an automatically generated notice without warning, said the Titanic editorial team. This was followed by the demand to delete some older magazine covers with depictions of nudity and sexuality. It is curious that the Titanic app has been listed in the store since 2014 and actually had an age rating of 12 years due to the assignment as satire, explained Titanic editor-in-chief Moritz Hürtgen <em>heise online</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.de24.news/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.de24.news/a1/de24.png?resize=400%2C20&amp;ssl=1" alt="© www.de24.news" width="400" height="20" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>&nbsp;The&nbsp; East German magazine Eulenspiegel, for example, continues to be listed in the store with similarly drastic cover pictures, which is even available without age restriction. According to Hürtgen, as a compromise solution, his magazine had submitted an application for re-approval as an adult app with the age rating “18 and over”. However, Google rejected the application on Monday.</p>

<h3 id="nav__quot_verkniffen__1">“Connected Humor of Monopolwichsern”</h3>

<p>Moritz Hürtgen also affirmed that the satirical magazine will not bow to pressure from Silicon Valley: “TITANIC will not censor itself in order to do justice to the pinched humor of monopoly wankers in San Fernando Valley, err: Silicon Valley.” One would rather accept the loss of digital subscriptions and leave the store permanently if Google does not fully reactivate the Titanic app and its motifs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.de24.news/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.de24.news/a1/de24.png?resize=400%2C20&amp;ssl=1" alt="© www.de24.news" width="400" height="20" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>&nbsp;The&nbsp;re had already been a misunderstanding with the Apple App Store in the past, but this could be resolved quickly (the lock was lifted, the Titanic app is still available in the App Store). <a href="https://www.de24.news/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.de24.news/a1/de24.png?resize=400%2C20&amp;ssl=1" alt="© www.de24.news" width="400" height="20" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>&nbsp;The&nbsp; long-suffering Titanic was also temporarily blocked once on Twitter.</p>
<h3 id="nav_alternative__2">Alternative delivery routes for subscribers</h3>
<p>Titanic claims that it has appealed against Google’s censorship request and is now also considering withdrawing its own app permanently from the Play Store. In the meantime, subscribers will be “supplied by other means”, says the Titanic website.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.de24.news/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.de24.news/a1/de24.png?resize=400%2C20&amp;ssl=1" alt="© www.de24.news" width="400" height="20" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>&nbsp;The&nbsp; Titanic editorial team currently offers subscribers direct delivery of print and PDF editions. Since, according to the editor-in-chief, the magazine “has no access to the contact details of the” Play Store “subscribers,” those affected by the app lock should report by email.

<p>The "Pico" board with the RP2040 chip developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation is the latest tiny fast and versatile board in Arduino Nano format. As you may already know, the board can be programmed using MicroPython and C/C++. In this tutorial, I extended the official MicroPython version to support cryptographic primitives, and this unlocks the possibility to connect the board (using the SX1276 chip) to the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/">"The Things Networks"</a> (TTN) - which means LoRaWAN support.</p><table><thead><tr><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img data-src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/14e/4d0/d3e/602af6bae274a130446131__800.jpg" legend="Raspberry Pi Pico connected to the LoRa V2.0 board" width="400px" data-srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/14e/4d0/d3e/602af6bae274a130446131__800.jpg 800w, https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/14e/4d0/d3e/602af6bae274a130446131__400.jpg 400w, https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/14e/4d0/d3e/602af6bae274a130446131__768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/14e/4d0/d3e/602af6bae274a130446131__800.jpg" srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/14e/4d0/d3e/602af6bae274a130446131__800.jpg 800w, https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/14e/4d0/d3e/602af6bae274a130446131__400.jpg 400w, https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/14e/4d0/d3e/602af6bae274a130446131__768.jpg 768w"></td></tr><tr><td><span>Fig. 1: Raspberry Pi Pico connected to the LoRa V2.0 board.</span></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The RP2040 with a QFN-56 package has the following specifications:</p><ul><li>Dual-Core ARM Cortex-M0+ @133MHz</li><li>264KB of on-chip RAM</li><li>Support for up to 16MB of off-chip Flash Memory via a dedicated QSPI bus</li><li>DMA Controller</li><li>Interpolator and integer divider peripherals</li><li>30 GPIO pins, 4 of which can be used as analog inputs</li><li>2 x UARTs, 2 x SPI controllers, and 2 x I2C Controllers</li><li>16 x PWM Channels</li><li>1 x USB 1.1 Controller and PHY, with host and device support</li><li>8 x Raspberry Pi Programmable I/O (PIO) state machines</li><li>USB mass-storage boot mode with UF2 support for drag-and-drop-programming</li></ul><p>which makes it ideal for projects that need the LoRaWAN technology.</p><div uk-grid=""><p><img data-src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/576/93b/4e0/6029ab89c7a0c706498019__768.jpg" legend="Raspberry Pi Pico with RP2040" data-srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/576/93b/4e0/6029ab89c7a0c706498019__768.jpg 768w, https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/576/93b/4e0/6029ab89c7a0c706498019__400.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/576/93b/4e0/6029ab89c7a0c706498019__768.jpg" srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/576/93b/4e0/6029ab89c7a0c706498019__768.jpg 768w, https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/576/93b/4e0/6029ab89c7a0c706498019__400.jpg 400w"><br><span>Fig. 2: Raspberry Pi Pico with RP2040.</span></p></div><h2><span id="software-and-hardware-454294">Software and Hardware</span></h2><p>This section includes the software and hardware needed for this tutorial.</p><h2><span id="programming-the-raspberry-pi-pico-using-the-visual-studio-code-vscode-ide-454294">Programming the Raspberry Pi Pico using the Visual Studio Code (VSCode) IDE</span></h2><p>The Raspberry Pi Foundation recommends the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://thonny.org/">Thonny Python IDE</a> to program the Raspberry Pi Pico, but I still prefer <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a> with the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pycom.Pymakr">PyMakr plugin</a>. The only difference between programming an ESP32 and the Raspberry Pi Pico running MicroPython is that you need to set the <code>address</code> parameter in the <code>pymakr.conf</code> file to <code>"/dev/ttyACM0"</code> instead of <code>"/dev/ttyUSB0"</code> and the file results as:</p>
<pre><code>{
    "address": "/dev/ttyACM0",
    "username": "micro",
    "password": "python",
    "open_on_start": true,
    "safe_boot_on_upload": false,
    "sync_file_types":"py",
    "py_ignore": [
        "pymakr.conf",
        ".vscode",
        ".gitignore",

        ".python-version",
        ".micropy/",
        "micropy.json",
    ],
    "fast_upload": false
}</code></pre>
<p>Then, you can upload, download and run files and projects as you usually do with an ESP32. For more information, take a look at <a href="https://lemariva.com/blog/2018/12/micropython-visual-studio-code-as-ide">this tutorial</a>.</p><div><p>The Pymakr plugin with version 1.1.8 is having compatibility issues with VSCode 1.53.1/2. Therefore, you need to downgrade <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_52">VSCode to 1.52.1</a>. I hope this <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/pycom/pymakr-vsc/issues/119">issue</a> will be solved soon. If you don't want to downgrade VSCode, you can try the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ChrisWood.pico-go">pico-go</a> extension that is a derivative extension of Pymakr, which is working. </p><p> Take a look at <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium">VSCodium</a> if you want a to have free release binaries.</p></div><h2><span id="diy-add-encryption-support-454294">DIY: Add Encryption Support</span></h2><p>To connect to LoRaWAN, you need AES encryption. The MicroPython version that supports the Raspberry Pi Pico is still very limited. So, I extended it to include the <code>ucryptolib</code> package.</p><p>I included the compiled custom firmware in the <a href="https://github.com/lemariva/micropython-pico-mbedtls">lemariva/micropython-pico-mbedtls</a> repository. But if you want to build the firmware from scratch, follow these steps:</p><ol><li>First, clone the Micropython official repository, and pull the pico-sdk submodule following these steps:
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/micropython/micropython.git
cd micropython
#
# usually this shouldn't be necessary, but the master branch is not compatible with the actual pico-sdk
git checkout tags/v1.14
#
git submodule update --init -- lib/pico-sdk
cd lib/pico-sdk
git submodule update --init</code></pre></li><li>To build the RP2040 MicroPython port, you’ll need to install some extra tools (toolchain, etc.):
<pre><code>sudo apt update
sudo apt install cmake gcc-arm-none-eabi libnewlib-arm-none-eabi build-essential</code></pre></li><li>and build the <code>mpy-cross</code> tool:
<pre><code>cd ../..
make -C mpy-cross</code></pre></li><li>After that, add these <code>define</code>s lines to the <code>mpconfigport.h</code> file inside the <code>ports/rp2</code> folder:
<pre><code>#define MICROPY_PY_UCRYPTOLIB                   (1)
#define MICROPY_SSL_MBEDTLS                     (1)</code></pre></li><li>This means you need to add to the pico-sdk and compile the library <code>MBEDTLS</code>, which is nowadays not included. Therefore, I included that to the CMake project using this file:
<pre><code>include(ExternalProject)
ExternalProject_Add(
mbedtls
PREFIX ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/mbedtls-2.25.0

    ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/mbedtls-2.25.0/library/libmbedx509.a   
    )
include_directories(${MBEDTLS_HEADERS})</code></pre>
<p>As you may already have seen, you need a <code>pico_config.h</code> file, which is included in the repository. I duplicated some of the configurations of the ESP32. Copy that file inside the <code>ports/rp2</code> folder.</p></li><li>Finally, add/modify two lines to the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file inside the <code>ports/rp2</code> folder:
<pre><code># add this under include(micropy_rules.cmake)
include(mbedtls.cmake)
# add ${mbedtls_libraries} to the target_link_libraries as:
target_link_libraries(${MICROPYTHON_TARGET}

hardware_rtc
hardware_spi
hardware_sync
pico_multicore
pico_stdlib_headers
pico_stdlib
pico_unique_id
tinyusb_device
${mbedtls_libraries}
)</code></pre></li><li>Finally, build the MicroPython port for RP2040, that is, the version of MicroPython that has specific support for the Raspberry Pi Pico chip:
<pre><code>cd ports/rp2
make</code></pre></li></ol><p>If everything goes well, there will be a new directory called build (<code>ports/rp2/build</code>), which contains the new firmware binaries. The most important ones are:</p><ul><li><code>firmware.uf2</code> A UF2 binary file that can be dragged onto the RPI-RP2 drive that pops up once your Raspberry Pi
Pico is in BOOTSEL mode.</li><li><code>firmware.elf</code> A different type of binary file, which can be loaded by a debugger (such as gdb with openocd) over
RP2040’s SWD debug port.</li></ul><p>You can drag and drop the custom MicroPython version following the instructions described <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/pico/getting-started/" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><h2><span id="diy-raspberry-pi-pico-meets-lorawan-454294">DIY: Raspberry Pi Pico meets LoRaWAN</span></h2><p>Last year, I wrote a driver to connect the ESP32 to the LoRaWAN network.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			

<p>In late August 2020 I read <a href="https://press.stripe.com/#the-dream-machine">The Dream
Machine</a> and it is my favorite
book of 2020. It is an incredible overview of a sliver of computer pioneers in
the 1960s-1980s and how one man was instrumental in tying all their narratives
together. One of the strands the book follows is the group at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)">PARC</a> (and other places) that
firmly believed in the notion of interactive computing. Over the last year,
I’ve repeatedly been introduced to this strand of thinking. There is Douglas
Engelbart’s <a href="https://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/papers/scanned/Doug_Engelbart-AugmentingHumanIntellect.pdf">Augmenting Human
Intellect</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup>
and his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos">mother of all
demos</a>. The notion that
computers should allow humans to <em>think better</em>, and one way to do that is to
allow humans to express and try out ideas better. <em>Writing</em> is a useful skill
to form coherent, but generally linear streams of thought. <em>Computing</em> is the
closest we can yet get to a non-linear exploration of a problem domain, and
freed from the limitations of time and space, we can recreate our thoughts in a
malleable, explorable way. By applying <a href="https://doriantaylor.com/softwares-ailing-mythology">a known process to known information,
but turning a few billion cranks at a
time</a> we can get to better
solutions, faster. The notion is, if we could have a <em>computer</em> (the physical
device including the software) that would allow people to iteratively express
their problems, get immediate sensory (primarily visual, but nothing prevents
using the other senses) feedback and <em>extend the computer as necessary</em>, we can
really liberate the human mind from some of its limitations. It is a very
different vision from the consensus reality of vendors that deliver
pre-packaged applications that all come with restrictions.</p>

<p>Smalltalk<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">2</a></sup> is one of the outputs of this strand of thinking and has had a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk#History">big impact on general purpose programming
languages</a><sup id="fnref:bak"><a href="#fn:bak">3</a></sup>. However the
focus on object orientation and test-driven development have robbed the world
of what I think are its most important aspects:</p>

<ol>
<li>programming as a dialogue with the computer, with meaningful feedback and <em>assistance</em>.</li>
<li>the environment being just as important to programming as the language, and empowering users to <em>modify the environment to help solve their problem</em>.</li>
<li>semantic simplicity as a necessity for easier comprehension in the face of the above points.</li>
</ol>

<p>Aditya Siram has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch/baxtyeFVn3w">this excellent
talk</a> giving a taste of Smalltalk.
If you had to take only one thing away from this post, it is to go and watch
that. I knew I had to try this thing out! While I worked through the <a href="https://nikhilism.com/post/2021/experiencing-smalltalk/TODO">Pharo
MOOC</a> for a few days, I quickly lost interest in their examples. <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020">Advent
of Code 2020</a> (AoC)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">4</a></sup> seemed like a much
better avenue to really try out Smalltalk. All my experiences are based on the
<a href="https://pharo.org/">Pharo</a> variant, which seems to be the leading
implementation right now.</p>

<p>While I was working my way through AoC, Mike Levins wrote <a href="https://mikelevins.github.io/posts/2020-12-18-repl-driven/">On repl-driven
programming</a>. I
think he wasn’t fully able to convey the ideas of Smalltalk, because the term
“REPL” is too strongly associated with Python/JavaScript/Ruby REPLs at this
point. I hope I did my <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25642699">bit</a> of
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25642717">evangelizing</a> to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25642741">correct
that</a>. Alright, lets jump into
my experience.</p>



<h2 id="a-truly-integrated-development-environment-ide">A truly integrated development environment (IDE)</h2>

<p>What do I mean? Well Smalltalk really facilitates creating a program in an
exploratory style, including test-driven development. As an example, for Day 5,
I wrote the following:</p>



<p>Now, as soon as I “accept” this code (by pressing Ctrl+S), Smalltalk will ask
me if I would like to define this <code>AOCBoardingPassParser</code> class. It will pop up
a little window to let me do that. It will also detect I wrote a test case
(because when I created a class for the test case, I inherited from <code>TestCase</code>)
and the system browser and other elements of the interface will have these
little gray/green/red dots next to every test case, letting me run the test and
observe the results right away. Now, this is offered in modern IDEs like
IntelliJ and PyCharm, but this was available 40 years ago in Smalltalk! But
that is just the beginning.</p>

<p>I can now run this test (remember I’ve only defined the <code>AOCBoardingPassParser</code>
class at this point) and it will encounter the missing method <code>toSeat:</code> on the
class (think of this like a “static method” in Java/Python<sup id="fnref:static"><a href="#fn:static">5</a></sup>). In a
statically typed language, you would get a compilation error or have your IDE
highlight it for you. If you were in a dynamic language, then you’d just have
an exception thrown when running the program – <code>AttributeError</code> in Python.
Unless you explicitly ran the test in a debugger, that is all you would get and
now you’ve to go back to the editor, fix this, then re-run the test.</p>

<p>Not so in Smalltalk. First this isn’t just an IDE in the sense of a
language-aware editor. The IDE is also very aware of the runtime environment.
It will break at the stack frame with the missing method, and pop up a window.
You can <em>create</em> a method right there. This window has a full fledged editor
with code completion and all the other fanciness right there. I’m not aware of
any other environment<sup id="fnref:lisp"><a href="#fn:lisp">6</a></sup> that does this. Ok so we quickly recover by
creating the method. But I don’t know exactly what to put in there yet. Don’t
worry, this is Smalltalk. We don’t need to go through this cycle of rerunning
the entire test. The state of the running program is <em>preserved</em> until the
point where you hit the error, and you just tell the IDE “ok, I’ve fixed the
immediate error, let’s try again” and it will resume execution from there! You
can do this as many times as you wish, developing the code as a function of
encountering errors and test failures. This very fast iteration cycle feels
amazing! Imagine writing a much more complex program that was running for
minutes to hours but then hit an error. In most languages you would have to fix
it and start from the beginning, but in Smalltalk you would just fix it right
there and proceed.</p>

<p>I think browser developer tools are the closest we can come to having this kind
of interactivity in widespread computing environments. They don’t do that yet,
but they could. But we need to acknowledge how much work had to be put in to
those tools vs Smalltalk. In addition, the that implementation would likely
need to be in C++ instead of JavaScript, which means users wouldn’t be able to
extend and improve it as necessary. Which brings me to my next point.</p>

<h2 id="ide-extension-and-visualization">IDE extension and visualization</h2>

<p>Where most IDEs and language implementations are written in C/C++/Java,
Smalltalk prides itself on bootstrapping from a very minimal native code core.
After that nearly everything about the runtime and the IDE is written in
Smalltalk. The program and the environment are not 2 separate things, they are
one. When you execute your program, it is just another “thread” in the same
environment that you are creating the program in. You can do bizarre things
like remapping <code>true</code> to <code>false</code> or redefining what addition means and the
entire system will reflect the change right away (to disastrous results!). The
fact that the IDE and the program share a language means that any Smalltalk
programmer can understand and extend the IDE itself. Would you like a menu with
your most commonly used commands? Sure, just use the inspector/debugger to find
out where the menus are defined and add an entry there. Boom!</p>

<p>This also offers the really powerful ability to customize the debugger for the
task at hand. <a href="http://kursjan.github.io/petitparser2/">PetitParser2</a> is
probably the best example of this. It is a parser-combinator library. As Aditya
demonstrates in his talk, when you build up a parser, the parser provides
several hooks into the Smalltalk debugger. It can show you the matches it has
built up so far(including negative matches!) and you can run various inputs
against the parser to understand behavior. So you can start with a very simple
parser and iteratively make it complicated, observing the parse tree and
getting the behavior you want.</p>

<p>Whereas a lot of AoC implementations on reddit used various regex and string
operations for parsing inputs, I’d lean to PetitParser for anything beyond
simple white-space delimited numbers. It was just so easy and straightforward.
Instead of having to find subtle bugs in string parsing, I could actually see a
domain specific debugging view as my parser encountered tokens.</p>

<p>You could similarly imagine having domain specific drawings for your project.
If I was writing a build system in Smalltalk, I would write a build graph
viewer, and instead of a <a href="https://graphviz.org/">static graphviz image</a>, it
could be very interactive. While the build was running, it could update the
graph with file modification times, or indicate whether it thinks a file needs
to be rebuilt, and then I could easily debug why a particular file wasn’t being
built.</p>

<p>The folks at <a href="https://feenk.com/">Feenk</a> are really leveraging this in their
<a href="https://gtoolkit.com/">Glamorous Toolkit</a> to fantastic effect! I highly
recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClLZHVq_-2D2-iI4rA2O8Ug">their
videos</a>.</p>

<h2 id="minor">Minor</h2>

<p>I appreciated the built-in Array2D class for the various game-of-life
implementations as well as <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/20">Jurassic
Jigsaw</a> where it was easy to reason in
terms of rows and columns, and quickly slice those out.  Similarly, the Point
class and special “syntax”<sup id="fnref:point"><a href="#fn:point">7</a></sup> made Day 12 <a href="https://github.com/nikhilm/AdventOfCode2020/blob/bbc331e2af2d948e683cade9ff4f93b4e4a3f667/AdventOfCode/AOCFerry.class.st">really
easy</a>.</p>



<p>Of course everything wasn’t magical. The Smalltalk/Pharo community is very
small, so this shouldn’t be considered a rant, just my disappointments.</p>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

<p>This was my biggest frustration. If we accept that <a href="https://documentation.divio.com/">documentation has 4
distinct types</a>, Smalltalk does a great job
of Reference docs, because everything can easily be inspected and browsed, so
reading method documentation, while seeing its implementation is really easy.
You can also easily inspect what an object is at the point of use, and then see
what methods are available on it. However there is still plenty of scope for
improvement here, as not all non-trivial methods have docstrings. In addition,
for such a powerful IDE, the lack of documentation tooltips on hover is very
odd.</p>

<p>It really lags behind in the other categories. There is a wealth of great
content in <a href="http://books.pharo.org/">various free books</a> and the
<a href="http://mooc.pharo.org/">MOOC</a> that explains the language and getting around
the IDE. However all the books on various useful libraries are really out of
date. It isn’t fair to expect someone to …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Web performance isn’t going to save you in this crisis.</p>
<p>But if you’re building a software product, chances are you’re relatively unaffected. And in this case, having a quick app is more important than ever. Internet <a href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/how-covid-19-is-affecting-internet-performance">is slowing down</a> due to increased demand, and people <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/mobile-phone-shipments-will-drop-to-10-year-low-this-year-as-coronavirus-hurts-demand/">are holding on to their phones</a> for longer – so if your app is slow, your users <em>will</em> be affected by it.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://wpostats.com/"><em>slow app</em> means <em>worse business</em></a>.</p>
<p>Today, let’s take a look at <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> – an advanced note-taking web app. Notion is a great product, but one thing customers complain about is its startup time:</p>
<blockquote data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Notion app and my laptop OS take the same time to boot.</p><p>Beautiful application but it's tooooo slow😔</p></div>— Aniket Mandle (@aniketmandle11) <a href="https://twitter.com/aniketmandle11/status/1256659106464698368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 2, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>Notion <a href="https://twitter.com/NotionHQ/status/1228074819784073216">shipped tremendous speed enhancements recently</a>, but there’s still a lot of space to improve. Let’s reverse-engineer it and see what else can be optimized!</p>


<p>Notion is a React web app embedded into a native shell. This means its “startup time” is largely the “loading time of the web part”.</p>
<blockquote><div><p><strong>To be concrete.</strong> On the desktop, the Notion app is a web app wrapped with Electron. On mobile, from my understanding, the Notion app runs both React Native parts (likely responsible for some mobile experiences) and web parts (likely responsible for the overall editing UI).</p><p>Due to (apparently) HTTPS certificate pinning in the Android Notion app, I wasn’t able to verify whether the mobile app runs the same bundles the desktop app does. But even if the bundles are different, issues they are having are, likely, similar.</p></div></blockquote>
<p>To understand how the web part is loading, let’s create <a href="https://www.notion.so/iamakulov/Job-Board-f96cfe500e7d47108f44e0b6102e7c01">a public Notion page</a>:</p>

<p>It takes a couple more seconds to finish loading all the hero image.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>6.2 seconds for a desktop computer is quite a lot. However, with a medium-tier phone like Nexus 5, this time <a href="https://webpagetest.org/video/compare.php?tests=200420_7E_24739856690fea9cbdadeea3e0b934a2-r%3A1-c%3A0&amp;thumbSize=200&amp;ival=100&amp;end=visual">increases to 12.6 seconds</a>. Here’s how that feels:</p>

<p>Let’s see how we can improve it.</p>

<p>When one talks about “loading speed”, one typically means <em>networking performance</em>. From the networking standpoint, Notion is doing well: they’re using HTTP/2, they’re gzipping files, and they’re using Cloudflare as a proxying CDN.</p>
<p>However, another part of “loading speed” that people talk less about is <em>processing performance</em>. All downloaded resources have a processing cost: gzip archives need to be decompressed; images need to be decoded; JS needs to be executed.</p>
<p>Unlike networking performance, processing performance doesn’t improve with better networks – it’s only as fast as the user’s CPU is. And user’s CPUs in phones – especially Android phones – <a href="https://medium.com/@addyosmani/the-cost-of-javascript-in-2018-7d8950fbb5d4">are <em>bad</em></a>:</p>

    </picture>
  </figure>
<p>For Notion, processing performance is even more significant. It’s easy to avoid networking costs by caching network resources in the app. But processing costs are paid <em>every single time</em> the app starts – which means a phone user may see a 10-second splash screen multiple times a day.</p>
<p>On our test Nexus 5, executing <code>vendor</code> and <code>app</code> bundles takes 4.9 seconds. This whole time, the page – and the app – stay non-interactive and empty:</p>
<figure>

    </figure>
<p>What’s happening there? WebPageTest doesn’t record JS traces, but if we go to DevTools and run a local audit, we’ll see this:</p>

<p>First, the <code>vendor</code> bundle is being compiled (for 0.4s). Second, the <code>app</code> bundle is being compiled (for 1.2s). Third, both bundles start executing – and spend 3.3s doing so.</p>
<p>So how can we reduce that time?</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at the bundle execution phase. What are all these functions?</p>

<p>Turns out that’s bundle initialization:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Functions with four-character names</em>, like <code>bkwR</code> or <code>Cycz</code>, are application modules.</p>
<!-- prettier-ignore -->

<p>  |
| When webpack builds a bundle, it wraps each module with a function – and assigns it an ID. That ID becomes the function name. In the bundle, this looks as follows:
|
| <em>Before:</em>
|
| <code>js
  | import formatDate from './formatDate.js';
  | 
  | // ...
  |</code>
|
| <em>After:</em>
|
| <code>js
  | fOpr: function(module, __webpack_exports__, __webpack_require__) {
  |   "use strict";
  |
  |   __webpack_require__.r(__webpack_exports__);
  |
  |   var _formatDate__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__ =
  |     __webpack_require__("xN6P");
  |
  |   // ...
  | },
  |</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>And the <code>s</code> function</em> is actually <code>__webpack_require__</code>.</p>
<p><code>__webpack_require__</code> is the webpack’s internal function that it uses for requiring modules. Whenever you write an <code>import</code>, webpack transforms it to <code>__webpack_require__()</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Bundle initialization takes so much time because it executes all the modules. Each module may take just a few milliseconds to execute, but with Notion’s 1100+ modules, this adds up.</p>
<p>The only way to fix it is to execute fewer modules upfront.</p>
<h2 id="use-code-splitting"><a href="#use-code-splitting" aria-label="use code splitting permalink"></a>Use code splitting</h2>
<p>The best way to improve the startup time is to code-split away some features that’re not needed immediately. In webpack, this is done <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/">using <code>import()</code></a>:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code>

<p><mark>Code splitting is the best first optimization you can do.</mark> It brings huge performance benefits: after doing code splitting, Tinder reported <a href="https://medium.com/@addyosmani/a-tinder-progressive-web-app-performance-case-study-78919d98ece0">a 60% decrease in the complete load time</a>; and our client, Framer, managed to <a href="https://3perf.com/#clients">cut 40-45% off the CPU Idle time</a>.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://medium.com/js-dojo/3-code-splitting-patterns-for-vuejs-and-webpack-b8fff1ea0ba4">several common approaches to code splitting</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>splitting the bundle by pages,</li>
<li>splitting away below-the-fold code,</li>
<li>and splitting away conditional content (any dynamic UIs that are not visible immediately)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Notion app doesn’t have pages, and code-splitting below-the-fold content is hard because pages are very dynamic. This means the only useful approach is code-splitting conditional content. The following parts may be good candidates for that:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Settings</em>, <em>Import</em>, <em>Trash</em> – all UIs that are rarely used</li>
<li><em>Sidebar</em>, <em>Share</em>, <em>Page options</em> – all UIs that are frequently used but are not needed immediately when the app starts. Those could be preloaded and initialized right after the app starts</li>
<li><em>Heavy page blocks.</em> Some page blocks are quite heavy – e.g. the <em>Code</em> block supports highlighting 68 languages, which bundles 120+ minified KBs of language definitions from Prism.js. Notion seems to be code-splitting some blocks already (e.g., <em>Math equation</em>), but it might make sense to extend it to others as well.</li>

<p>In webpack, the <a href="https://webpack.js.org/plugins/module-concatenation-plugin/">module concatenation</a> feature is responsible for merging multiple small ES modules into one large. This reduces the module processing overhead and makes removing unused code more effective.</p>
<p>To confirm that module concatenation is working:</p>
<ul>
<li>check that you’re not transpiling ES modules to CommonJS with Babel. <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env"><code>@babel/preset-env</code></a> doesn’t transpile ES modules into CommonJS</li>
<li>check that <a href="https://webpack.js.org/configuration/optimization/#optimizationconcatenatemodules"><code>optimization.concatenateModules</code></a> is not disabled explicitly</li>
<li>run the production webpack build with <a href="https://webpack.js.org/plugins/module-concatenation-plugin/#debugging-optimization-bailouts"><code>--display-optimization-bailout</code></a> to see if there are any cases where module concatenation bails out</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><div><p><strong>Fun fact.</strong> Remember that all imports are transformed into the <code>__webpack_require__</code> function?</p><p>Well, what happens when the same function is called 1100 times throughout initialization? Right, it becomes a hot path taking 26.8% of the total time:</p><figure>

<blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> this suggestion relies on disabling module concatenation. Because of that, it’s incompatible with the previous one.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy"><code>@babel/plugin-transform-modules-commonjs</code></a> is an official Babel plugin that transforms ES imports into CommonJS <code>require()</code>s:</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>
<span>import</span> formatDate <span>from</span> <span>'./formatDate.js'</span><span>;</span>
<span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>getToday</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>formatDate</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Date</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>


<span>const</span> formatDate <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'./formatDate.js'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
exports<span>.</span><span>getToday</span> <span>=</span> <span>function</span> <span>getToday</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>formatDate</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Date</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And with its <code>lazy</code> option enabled, it also inlines all <code>require</code>s right into where they’re used:</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>
exports<span>.</span><span>getToday</span> <span>=</span> <span>function</span> <span>getToday</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'./formatDate.js'</span><span>)</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Date</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Thanks to this transformation, if the <code>getToday()</code> function is never called, <code>./formatDate.js</code> is never imported! And we don’t pay the import cost.</p>
<p>There are a few drawbacks, however:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switching the existing codebase to <code>lazy</code> might be tricky. Some modules may rely on side effects from other modules, which we’re delaying here. Also, <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy">the plugin docs</a> warn that the <code>lazy</code> option breaks cyclic dependencies</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>Switching to CommonJS modules disables <a href="https://webpack.js.org/plugins/module-concatenation-plugin/">module concatenation</a>. This means the module processing overhead will be higher</li>
</ul>
<p>These drawbacks make this option riskier compared to others – but if it plays right, its benefits might far outweigh its costs.</p>

      <p><strong>An exploration of threads, processes, and coroutines in Python, with interesting examples that illuminate the differences between each.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://python.hamel.dev/cpu.jpg" alt=""> Credit:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>As <a href="https://hamel.dev/">a data scientist who is spending more time on software engineering</a>, I was recently forced to confront an ugly gap in my knowledge of Python: concurrency.  To be honest, I never completely understood how the terms async, threads, pools and coroutines were different and how these mechanisms could work together.  Every time I tried to learn about the subject, the examples were a bit too abstract for me, and I hard time internalizing how everything worked.</p>
<p>This changed when a friend of mine<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> recommended <a href="https://youtu.be/MCs5OvhV9S4">a live coding talk</a> by <a href="https://www.dabeaz.com/">David Beazley</a>, an accomplished Python educator.</p>
<p><em>Because of restrictions with this YouTube video, I couldn’t embed <a href="https://youtu.be/MCs5OvhV9S4">the video</a> in this article, so you will have to open it in a different window</em>.</p>
<p>This talk is incredibly intimidating at first.  Not only is it coded live from scratch, but it also jumps immediately into socket programming, something that I had never encountered as a data scientist.  However, if you go through it slowly and understand all the components (as we do in this blog post) it turns out to be the best educational material on Python concurrency I have ever encountered.  This blog post documents what I learned along the way so others can benefit, too.</p>

<p>Before getting started, David sets up the following infrastructure that is used to demonstrate concurrency.</p>
<h2 id="a-cpu-bound-task-fibonacci">A cpu-bound task: Fibonacci</h2>
<p>To demonstrate concurrency, it is useful to create a task that can saturate your CPU (such as mathematical operations) for a noticeable period of time.  David uses a function that computes a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci number</a>.</p>

</div><p>This function takes much longer for large inputs versus smaller inputs<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, which allows us to profile different workloads.</p>
<h2 id="a-simple-web-server">A Simple Web Server</h2>
<p>A web server is one of the best ways to illustrate different types of concurrency.  However, to really demonstrate how things work it is useful to use something that is sufficiently low level enough to see how all the pieces work.  For this, David sets up a web server using socket programming.  If you aren’t familiar with socket programming, I’ll explain the important bits below, but feel free to dive deeper <a href="https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbaws-part1/">with this tutorial</a> later if you like.</p>
<p>To begin with, David starts with the below code (I’ve highlighted the most interesting bits):</p>

</div>
</div><p>Here is an explanation of this code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lines 6-9 are socket programming boilerplate.  It’s ok to just take this for granted as a reasonable way to set up a socket server.  This also matches the <a href="https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbaws-part1/">the tutorial</a> I linked to above.</li>
<li>Line 11 waits for an incoming connection from a client.  Once a connection is made, the server can begin receiving data from a client.  The code will stop execution on this line until a connection is made.</li>
<li>Line 13: Once a connection is established, the client object is passed to a function which can handle data sent by the client.</li>
<li>Line 17: waits for data to be sent by the client.  The code will stop execution on this line until data is received from the client.</li>
<li>Line 21: The server sends a response back to the client.  The code <em>could</em> stop execution on this line if the send buffers are full, but unlikely in this toy example.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the above example, the server will only be able to accept a connection from a single client, because the call to <code>fib_handler</code> will never return (because it will run in an infinite loop unless a kill signal is received).  This means that <code>sock.accept()</code> can only be called once.</p>
<p>You can test this out by first running the server:</p>
<p>Then establish a client:</p>
<p>You can type numbers in <a href="https://youtu.be/MCs5OvhV9S4?t=293">as David does in his video</a> and verifies that fibonacci numbers are returned.  However, if you try to connect with another client at the same time from a different terminal session:</p>
<p>You will notice that the second client just hangs and doesn’t return anything from the server.  This is because the server is only able to accept a single connection.  Next, we explore how to tackle this issue.</p>

<p>We can solve this issue with threads.  You can add threads to the handler so that more connections can be accepted with the following code highlighted in yellow:</p>

</div><p>You can verify that this works by connecting two separate clients to the server by running the following command in two separate terminal windows:</p>
<p>By executing the <code>fib_handler</code> in a thread, the main while loop in <code>fib_server</code> will continue, allowing <code>sock.accept()</code> to receive additional clients.  If you haven’t encountered threads before <a href="https://realpython.com/intro-to-python-threading/">this tutorial</a> provides a good introduction to the topic.</p>
<h2 id="thread-performance--the-gil">Thread performance &amp; the GIL</h2>
<p>When code stops execution and waits for an external event to occur (like a connection to be made, or data to be sent), this is often referred to as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2407589/what-does-the-term-blocking-mean-in-programming">blocking</a>.</p>
<p>One important utility of threads is that it allows blocking tasks to release control of the CPU when the CPU is not being used.  However, the Python interpreter can only run on one thread at a time due to the <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock">Global Interpreter Lock</a>.  Because Python can only run a single thread at any given time, any CPU-bound work in threads must take turn running one after the other.</p>
<p>Therefore, you have to think carefully about what kind of tasks you execute in threads with Python.  If you try to execute CPU bound tasks, these tasks will slow each other down.  David demonstrates this with the below script that sends requests to our threaded server:</p>

</div><p>If you run several instances of this script (after starting the server first):</p>
<p>You will see the execution times for each script linearly increase as you increase the number of these scripts running in parallel.  <strong>For this particular task, adding threads does not make anything faster.  But why?</strong>  This is because the fibonacci task is CPU bound so threads will compete with each other for resources.</p>
<p>Python threads work by interleaving the execution of different tasks on your CPU.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>  Only one thread runs at a time, and have the ability to take turns executing in small bits until all threads are done.  The details of how thread processing is interleaved is carried out by the GIL and your operating system, so you need not worry about this detail (with one exception mentioned below).  Interleaving a bunch of CPU bound tasks will not speed up the total runtime of those tasks.  However, if your tasks involve lots of non-CPU time, such as waiting for network connections, or disk I/O, threading tasks may result in a considerable speedup.  A canonical way of simulating a non-cpu bound task in python is to use the built-in function <code>time.sleep()</code>.</p>
<p>To check my understanding about threads and performance, I ran the below experiment<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> and changed <code>time.sleep(2)</code> to <code>fib(20)</code> and back again:</p>

<p>Self-control isn't merely a matter of eliminating your own weaknesses. Self control is primarily about compensating for those weaknesses. When you go on a diet, you don't just commit yourself to eating well – you also throw away the Oreos so you won't be tempted.</p>
<p>This manoeuvre has a name: a Ulysses Pact, named for the passage in the Odyssey in which Ulysses pilots his ship through the sirens' sea, eschewing wax-stoppered ears so that he could hear their song, protecting himself by lashing himself to the mast.</p>
<p>Ulysses knew he would face a moment of weakness in the future, so he used his strength in the moment to guard against his future self.</p>
<p>Tech was built on a Ulysses Pact: the irrevocable free software license: once a hacker applies the GPL, they can't unchoose it.</p>
<p>No pressure from investors, not even the risk of bankruptcy or physical coercion can remove a free software license once it has been applied.</p>
<p>A Ulysses Pact is an act of humility, an admission of frailty. Alas, humility is in short supply in tech (the GPL is an exception).</p>
<p>Far more common is to build systems that can be abused, and assume that you – and your successors, collaborators, and underlings – will never yield to temptation.</p>
<p>Think of when the W3C incorporated DRM into browser standards, sure that none of its members would use this to exclude future rivals, only to be proven wrong a mere three years later, when Google blocked all free/open entrants into the field.</p>
<p><a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2020/01/08/three-years-after-the-w3c-approved-a-drm-standard-its-no-longer-possible-to-make-a-functional-indie-browser/">https://memex.craphound.com/2020/01/08/three-years-after-the-w3c-approved-a-drm-standard-its-no-longer-possible-to-make-a-functional-indie-browser/</a></p>
<p>Or when Apple arrogated to itself the power to decide which software you can run on your phones and tablets, only to have the Chinese state order it to block working privacy tools to facilitate a system of violent, totalitarian control.</p>
<p><a href="https://locusmag.com/2021/01/cory-doctorow-neofeudalism-and-the-digital-manor/">https://locusmag.com/2021/01/cory-doctorow-neofeudalism-and-the-digital-manor/</a></p>
<p>As Pavel Chekov counselled us all those years ago on the Desliu lot, a phaser on the bulkhead in act one will go off by act three.</p>
<p>Back in 2015, we bought – and then returned – a Canary security camera. We'd just immigrated to the US and were feeling a little nervous.</p>
<p>I was suspicious of this gadget. Though I wasn't technically capable of auditing its software, I WAS able to read its privacy policy, in which they promised not to share footage from your home unless ordered to do so.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/09/canary-debuts-flex-cam-suited-for-your-living-room-and-your-lawn/?comments=1&amp;amp;post=31916515">https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/09/canary-debuts-flex-cam-suited-for-your-living-room-and-your-lawn/?comments=1&amp;amp;post=31916515</a></p>
<p>I suspected that meant that Canary didn't employ end-to-end encryption, meaning that company insiders could peek at that footage, and the only thing preventing such peeking was policy and integrity, not that such a thing was impossible.</p>
<p>I wrote to the company and they confirmed that this was so, explaining that having access to cleartext video streams helped them use ML models that could distinguish between intruders and pets, and promising that they carefully vetted people with access to the footage.</p>
<p>So far as I know, Canary hasn't had such a breach…yet. But ADT – an industry leader whose major investor is Google – did. An ADT technician named Telesforo Aviles admitted to spying on at least 200 ADT customers.</p>
<p><a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-home-security-worker-hacked-into-surveillance-systems-1846111569">https://gizmodo.com/a-home-security-worker-hacked-into-surveillance-systems-1846111569</a></p>
<p>Aviles wanted to spy on attractive women in order to see them in naked and having sex. ADT's system was designed to allow this; the primary means by which it was prevented was vetting staff – a process that is obviously too imperfect to trust in a high-stakes environment.</p>
<p>When ADT discovered this was happening, they tried to cover it up, offering laughable cash payments to survivors of Aviles's spying in exchange for confidentiality.</p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2020/05/19/adt-worker-accused-of-using-app-to-spy-on-people-for-7-years/">https://nypost.com/2020/05/19/adt-worker-accused-of-using-app-to-spy-on-people-for-7-years/</a></p>
<p>Doubtless certain technical aspects of the administration of ADT's security system were made simpler by choosing to create a system that was vulnerable to insider attacks. But by making this tradeoff, ADT demonstrated its unfitness to be in this market.</p>
<p>Maturity, after all, isn't about resisting temptation – it's about recognizing your own fallibility and taking measures to limit it. Exposing millions of customers to insider attacks on the obviously false belief that you will never hire the wrong person is unforgivable.</p>

<p>The pandemic has afforded all of us a refresher course on the five stages of grief, a theoretical and controversial framework for describing how people cope with tragedy: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_stages_of_grief">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_stages_of_grief</a></p>
<p>A far slower-moving unfolding of these stages can be seen in the reactions of the super-wealthy to the breakdown in neoliberal orthodoxy, the tale that says that inequality results from meritocracy, and makes us all better off:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/13/data-protection-without-monopoly/#inequality">https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/13/data-protection-without-monopoly/#inequality</a></p>
<p>Denial came out in the "rationalist" view: the world is better off than ever – richer, less violent, healthier, and any discontent you feel with your plummeting fortunes and the contracting possibilities for your kids is just your tunnel vision. Lack of perspective.</p>
<p>But the Great Financial Crisis and Occupy triggered the anger of the elites: violent suppression of protests, the "Doom Boom" in new luxury bunkers, Howard Schultz's insistence that "billionaire" is a slur (he says we should call him a "person of wealth").</p>
<p>The pandemic – and the "K-shaped recovery"- has revealed the existential threat inequality poses for our species, between price-gouging, fraud, profiteering, flouting health directives, and coercing the poor and vulnerable into risking their lives to keep the economy afloat.</p>
<p>A palpable desperation has set in among the ultra-wealthy, and with it, bargaining. VR execs and their major investors have begun to quietly assert that it will stabilize our unequal society by anaesthetizing the have-nots with virtual wealth.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/billionaires-use-vr-avoid-social-change/">https://www.wired.com/story/billionaires-use-vr-avoid-social-change/</a></p>
<p>John Carmack: "Not everyone can have a mansion. Not everyone can have a home theater. These are things we can simulate, to some degree, in virtual reality."</p>
<p>Gabe Newell: "The real world will seem flat, colorless, blurry compared to the experiences you'll be able to create in people's brains"</p>
<p>None of this will work. VR as opiate for the masses is a great Ernie Cline plot, but it's lousy social policy. After all, providing the desperate victims of the Great Financial Crisis unlimited access to Oxycontin and Fentanyl did not stabilize our society.</p>
<p>As Matthew Gault writes in Wired: "If you want a picture of the future, imagine a Facebook-branded set of VR goggles strapped to an emaciated human face—forever."</p>

<p>This week on my podcast, a spoken-word version of "Privacy Without Monopoly: Data Protection and Interoperability," a major new white-paper that Bennett Cyphers and I co-authored for EFF.</p>
<p><a href="https://craphound.com/news/2021/02/15/privacy-without-monopoly-data-protection-and-interoperability-part-1/">https://craphound.com/news/2021/02/15/privacy-without-monopoly-data-protection-and-interoperability-part-1/</a></p>
<p>It’s a paper that tries to resolve the tension between demanding that tech platforms gather, retain and mine less of our data, and the demand that platforms allow alternatives (nonprofits, co-ops, tinkerers, startups) to connect with their services.</p>
<p>I read the first half of it this week – about 40 minutes' worth – and I'll finish it next week. If you don't want to wait, you can dive in with the written version straightaway:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><h4>GNU Artanis-0.5 is ready for docker</h4></p><div><p>First, you need Docker, I recommend the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/install/" target="_blank">official installation document</a>.</p><p>Then you can pull Artanis image:</p><pre spellcheck="false">docker pull registry.gitlab.com/nalaginrut/artanis:latest
</pre><p>Because the contents created in docker environment is volatile, I'd recommend you create a workspace in the host environment before jump into docker environment.</p><pre spellcheck="false">mkdir myapp
</pre><p>Now you can run a container:</p><pre spellcheck="false">docker run -it --rm -p <span>3000</span>:<span>3000</span> -v $PWD/myapp:<span>/ registry.gitlab.com/</span>nalaginrut/artanis:latest bash
</pre><p>I'm going to explain something:</p><ol><li><span>--rm </span>means to remove the container when you exit, this is useful to keep you environment always clean.</li><li><span>-v $PWD/myapp:/ </span>means mapping the inside directory to outside, so that you can keep your work after exit. Please note that docker requires you specify the absolute path.</li><li><span>-p 3000:3000 </span>means mapping inside default port to outside, so that you can see your work outside.</li><li>The last option <span>bash</span> means running bash as shell. Unfortunately, our docker image didn't install other shells, so you have to install your favorite shell after you get into the environment.</li></ol><p>Now you can create your first Web App with Artanis:</p><pre spellcheck="false">art <span>create</span> hello
cd hello
art draw controller hello world
</pre><p>When everything is prepared, you should do this to boot up Artanis server:</p><pre spellcheck="false">art work -h 0.0.0.0
</pre><p>Because the default host is 127.0.0.1 which is impossible to map the socket port to the outside, so we set the host to 0.0.0.0 to make sure you can checkout your work in the outside browser.</p><p>You may want to visit http://localhost:3000/hello/world in your browser.</p><p>For more details, please read <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/artanis/manual/manual.html" target="_blank">the manual of GNU Artanis</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2><p>Lately I've been programming both in Go and Rust -- among other languages like Python, Erlang, or
Bash (and, yes, Bash is a programming language) -- thus those acquainted with Rust will observe that
the title is a hint to one of Rust's major selling points, that of zero cost abstractions, namely
that you don't pay for what you don't actually use (right now, but you might use in the future).</p><p>However, although the issue I'm about to describe is present to some extent in any programming
language -- from Bash (again, yes, Bash is a programming language, although a very bad one), to
Java, Python, Ruby, NodeJS, and even Rust -- unfortunately in Go it is made even worse by not having
a suitable workaround.</p><p>The issue might seem minor, and usually it is so, especially given that only lately when I've
focused on the start-up performance of one of my tools have I stumbled upon this issue. And in fact
the first time I tackled it was with the overhead introduced by loading some Python modules I didn't
always use.</p><p>But, with Python I expected this to be an issue, and I knew immediately where to look. With Go less
so, and I've done quite a bit of digging to find the problem (but unfortunately no usable
solution)...</p><h2 id="what-are-initializers">What are "initializers"?</h2><p>Starting with Go,
<a href="https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#init">package initializers</a>
are nothing more than anonymous functions, tagged <code>init</code>, without any arguments, that are executed (in
quite a
<a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec#Package_initialization">specific order</a>)
before the <code>main</code> function of an executable. (I say "anonymous" and "tagged" because inside the same file you
can have many such initializers, and they can't be called explicitly from anywhere.) Obviously these are
meant for libraries and not executables (which can just call that code at the beginning of <code>main</code>).</p><p>What can you do within these initializers? Basically anything you can in a normal function, just
that it executes before <code>main</code>. For example a library could initialize some private (but global)
variables with something that requires a bit of code to figure out, like configuration files,
runtime parameters, credentials, or loading previously computed and then cached data, etc.</p><p>Needless to say, the unwritten (but unenforced) rule of these initializers is that they should be
short and not stall the start-up needlessly... (Especially since Go has lightweight go-routines that
could do the initialization in the background if more effort is required...)</p><p>For example:</p><pre><code>package somePackage

var someGlobalA someTypeA
var someGlobalB someTypeB

func init () {
    // do some non-trivial, but quick, computation...
    someGlobalA = ...
    someGlobalB = ...
}
</code></pre><p>However, this feature is not specific to Go, and as mentioned all programming languages have some
sort of package / module / library initializers:</p><ul><li>Java has
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.7">class static initializers</a>,
again with a
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-12.html#jls-12.4">rigid execution order</a>;</li><li>Python, Ruby, NodeJS, and perhaps most similar interpreted languages, just allow arbitrary code
to be executed at the top-level of a module's body; for example as described
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html">here for Python</a>,
this code will be executed in the same order the modules are being loaded (first dependencies
then dependents, and so on recursively);</li><li>even Erlang, a functional programming language at heart, has something similar as part of OTP
(Erlang's runtime platform);</li><li>and I'm certain that by now -- in 2 AP, as in second "anno pandemus", or for those reading in the
past the year 2021 AD in the future -- C++ already has found a way to provide weapons of mass
feet shooting for its developers;</li><li>(I would bet the same goes for C# and the entire .NET ecosystem;)</li></ul><p>Regarding the other camp:</p><ul><li>Rust, by design, makes sure that
<a href="https://prev.rust-lang.org/en-US/faq.html#can-i-run-code-before-main">there is no life before main</a>;</li><li>(from what I know) C (the language) doesn't also provide a way to have non constant
static initializers;</li><li>moreover, many C-based libraries (and some well-written C++ ones) provide the user with a
<code>somelib_init</code> function that must be called before any other calls to their functions;</li><li>although GCC (and perhaps many other C compilers and runtimes) do provide a way to have
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Initialization.html">initialization functions</a>
(or constructors as they are called); however their main use-case seems to support languages
that do require them;</li><li>(I would also bet, but not a lot, that more functional languages like Haskel, and certainly
Scheme implementations of R7RS, are strict about this;)</li></ul><h3 id="but-wait-as-the-commercial-says-there-is-more">But wait, (as the commercial says), there is more...</h3><p>Most of the languages listed above, not only allow you to provide some means to execute arbitrary
code (in fact that feature is more on the advanced developers side), but also provide the developer
a way to initialize global variables with arbitrary expressions.</p><p>Again, in Go, for example:</p><pre><code>package somePackage

var someGlobalC someTypeC = newSomeC ()

func newSomeC () someTypeC {
    // do some non-trivial, but quick, computation...
    return ...
}
</code></pre><p>Thus, what initially might just seem as some harmless variable initialization, in fact could be a
call to a slow grinding wheel computing the answer to the ultimate question (to which we all know
the answer is usually 43 due to a one-off bug)...</p><h3 id="a-slight-detour-about-finalizers">A slight detour about "finalizers"</h3><p>Although many languages provide "initializers", few provide "finalizers", as in code that is assured
to be run before a program finishes.</p><p>The POSIX standard provides
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/atexit.3.html">atexit(3)</a>,
GCC does seem to also provide a way to register "destructors", some languages even expose some
wrappers for it, but none seem to provide some actual facility that are tailored for this specific
use-case... Granted some languages do provide some hooks that trigger when a "scope" finishes -- for
example we have <code>defer</code> in Go, and destructors for Rust and C++ -- however these are meant with
another use-case in mind.</p><p>Strange... Perhaps that's why many servers don't provide a clean way to be shutdown, and instead one
has to clobber them with a definitive <code>SIGKILL</code> after asking nicely in vain with <code>SIGTERM</code>, <code>SIGINT</code>
and other SIG-perhaps-this-works signals...</p><p>Also, as a funny irony, for one application in Rust I encountered a situation where calling the
finalizers (i.e. destructors) took quite some time compared to the total execution time, and I had
to resort to forcibly exiting the process without waiting for Rust to properly finalize.</p><h2 id="so-whats-the-issue">So what's the issue?</h2><p>Seeing that almost every programming language under the sun provides a way to sneak some code to be
executed before <code>main</code>, one would ask why I am complaining about this, and especially why I have
something against how it's implemented in Go?</p><p>Well for starters, Go is not the main culprit. Go doesn't force anyone to use the initializers
features, neither does any other language for that mater.</p><p>Moreover, there is the question of utility: if I <code>import</code> a library doesn't it mean I also intend to
use it? After all Go does an outstanding job of making sure (through compilation errors) that there
are no unused imports.</p><p>And here is where the argument (and especially Go's implementation) starts to show its weakness...</p><p>Imagine for a moment we are building a "do everything within a single statically linked binary"
tool.</p><h3 id="a-side-note-about-single-binary-do-all-tools">A side-note about single-binary do-all tools</h3><p>Why would one want to do this? (That is bundle a set of slightly related tools inside the same
executable.)</p><p>Because it's one of the places where Go really shines, as a systems programming language, especially
today with so many operating systems, let alone Linux and BSD distributions, flavors and
architectures. Thus given how easily I can build an OSX, BSD or even Windows executable from my
Linux, regardless if I use an Intel processor and I target Apple's new M1 ARM processor, and
corroborated with the fact that I don't want to dance the <code>rpm</code> or <code>deb</code> polka (not to speak about
the Windows MSI or OSX DMG baroque dance), I would prefer to just throw one binary for each
supported platform on GitHub's release page and be done with that.</p><p>And it seems this isn't a new or isolated trend, as lots of Go projects ship this way:</p><ul><li>starting with (the C-based)
<a href="https://busybox.net/">Busybox</a>
(that I believe powers at least 75% of all world-wide home and small-business networking
appliances), and its BSD alternative
<a href="https://www.landley.net/toybox/">ToyBox</a>;</li><li>Cloudflare's
<a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared">cloudflared</a>
or
<a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-go/tree/master/cmd/flarectl">flarectl</a>;</li><li>Netlify's former
<a href="https://github.com/netlify/netlifyctl">netlifyctl</a>;</li><li>open source projects like
<a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo">Hugo</a>
or
<a href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy">Caddy</a>;</li><li>(and I could keep on naming similar tools, written from Python to Erlang;)</li><li>(heck, if I think better, this is exactly what the FlatPack and AppImage projects are selling;)</li></ul><p>What all of these have in common? One (usually statically linked, or self-contained /
self-extracting) binary that can be thrown anywhere on the file-system, and as long as it's in the
<code>$PATH</code>, can easily be used.</p><p>What else do they have in common? Lots of slightly related functionality, which I bet are full of
initializers...</p><h3 id="getting-back-to-our-initializers">Getting back to our initializers...</h3><p>So in this case it seems that even though one imports lots of different libraries, they aren't used
all at the same time; at best one or two major libraries are used to implement a given sub-command.</p><p>However, given how initializers work in Go, that is each initializer for every package is run before
<code>main</code> regardless, all these "small but many" initializers add up and slow the startup process.</p><h3 id="so-you-say-this-is-make-believe-problem">So you say this is "make believe problem"?</h3><p>Well not quite... Let's for a second say that my argument about why I would like to bundle
multiple functionality in the same binary is moot; let's say I pay the cost of using a good tool for
the wrong job. Let's...</p><p>Let us imagine one wants to use the Go built-in
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/rpc/">net/rpc</a>
package, that allows one to easily implement RPC clients and servers over HTTP, plain TCP or UNIX
domain sockets. Now it seems that there are some "debugging" facilities that export some HTML for
the available services -- I don't use this, nor do I have any idea on how they are used, nor can
they be disabled -- and as a consequence in its source code, at line 39 in
<a href="https://golang.org/src/net/rpc/debug.go">debug.go</a>,
there is the following code, which unfortunately, based on my experiments, takes at least 0.5
milliseconds to initialize:</p><pre><code>var debug = template.Must(template.New("RPC debug").Parse(debugText))
</code></pre><p>So to summarize:</p><ul><li>Do I use it? No.</li><li>Can I disable it? No.</li><li>Am I …</li></ul></div></div>

<p>There are five algorithms which everyone who wants to compute 
the factorial n! = 1.2.3...n should know.</p>
<ul>
<li>The algorithm
<span>
<a href="http://www.luschny.de/math/factorial/csharp/FactorialSplit.cs.html" target="_blank">SplitRecursive</a></span>, 
because it is simple and the fastest algorithm which does not 
use prime factorization. </li>
<li>The algorithm
<span>
<a href="http://www.luschny.de/math/factorial/csharp/FactorialPrimeSwing.cs.html" target="_blank">
PrimeSwing</a></span>, because it is the (asymptotical) fastest 
algorithm known to compute n!. The algorithm is based on the 
notion of the 'Swing Numbers' and computes n! via the <em>
<a href="http://www.luschny.de/math/factorial/csharp/PrimeSieve.cs.html" target="_blank">prime factorization</a></em> 
of these numbers. </li>

<li>The ingenious 
algorithm of <span>
<a href="http://www.luschny.de/math/factorial/csharp/FactorialAdditiveMoessner.cs.html" target="_blank">
Moessner</a></span> which uses only additions! Though of no 
practical importance (because it is slow), it has the fascination 
of an unexpected solution.</li>
<li>The
<span>
<a href="http://www.luschny.de/math/factorial/csharp/FactorialPoorMans.cs.html" target="_blank">Poor 
Man's</a></span> algorithm which uses no Big-Integer library 
and can be easily implemented in any computer language and is 
even fast up to 10000!. </li>
<li>The
<span>
<a href="http://www.luschny.de/math/factorial/java/FactorialParallelPrimeSwing.java.html" target="_blank">
ParallelPrimeSwing</a></span> algorithm, which is the PrimeSwing 
algorithm with improved performance using methods of concurrent 
programming and thus taking advantage of multiple core processors.
</li>
<li>
If you do not attach great importance to high performance then
get a BigInteger library and use:
<pre>BigInt recfact(long start, long n) {
    long i;
    if (n &lt;= 16) { 
        BigInt r = new BigInt(start);
        for (i = start + 1; i &lt; start + n; i++) r *= i;
        return r;
    }
    i = n / 2;
    return recfact(start, i) * recfact(start + i, n - i);
}
BigInt factorial(long n) { return recfact(1, n); }
</pre></li>
<li>And here is an 
algorithm which nobody needs, for the <span>Simple-Minded</span> 
only: <span>long factorial(long n) {return n &lt;= 1 ? 1 : n*factorial(n-1);}</span>
Just don't use it!<br>
</li>
</ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>An example of a <span>PrimeSwing</span> computation:</p>
<p><img alt="swing" src="http://www.luschny.de/math/factorial/swing62.png" width="520px"></p><p>As this example shows an efficient computation of the factorial function
reduces to an efficient computation of the swinging factorial n≀.
Some information about these numbers can be found  
<a href="http://www.luschny.de/math/swing/SwingingFactorial.html">here</a>
and <a href="http://oeis.org/A056040">here</a>.
The prime factorization of the swing numbers is crucial for the implementation
of the PrimeSwing algorithm. 
</p><p>A concise description of this
algorithm is given in this <a href="http://www.luschny.de/math/factorial/SwingIntro.pdf">write-up (pdf)</a> and

I’m not diabetic or even prediabetic. But when I stumbled on the chance to wear a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) as part of a challenge partnered with Levels, I jumped on it. I’ve been conscious of blood sugar my whole life because I suffered from spells of hypoglycemia as a child.</span></p><p><span>Hypoglycemia is when your blood sugar drops below 70mg/dL. I still don’t know why it happened, but it wasn’t fun. When my glucose levels dropped too low, I’d experience cold sweats, lightheadedness, trembling hands, and an elevated heart rate. These symptoms were likely the result of my body releasing epinephrine (adrenaline) to stabilize my blood glucose.</span></p><p><span>Over the years, I started to pick up on which foods caused my blood sugar to crash. The biggest culprits were cereal for breakfast and sweet tea later in the day. Every time I ate a big bowl of cereal before school (usually Frosted Mini-Wheats or Honey Nut Cheerios), I would crash around 10:30 a.m. like clockwork. Sometimes the crashes were so bad that I thought I might pass out, so I’d call my mom to check me out of school.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-200x200.jpg" data-src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-200x200.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" data-srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-200x200.jpg 200w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture.jpg 512w" data-sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-200x200.jpg 200w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture.jpg 512w"></p><p><span>Experiencing low blood sugar not only made it hard to focus but was, quite frankly, a scary experience for someone who didn’t understand what was going on. After missing a few classes from these episodes, my mom decided it was time to change my diet.</span></p><p><span>I went from eating cereal in the mornings to eggs, bacon, and fruit (berries or avocado) and cut out the sweet tea (tough to do for a boy raised in Alabama). Once I made those changes, the crashes stopped, and I had energy throughout the day.</span></p><p><span>At the time, I didn’t fully understand why the switch worked, but I did understand even at a young age that consuming a bunch of carbs and sugar wasn’t good for me. Since then, I’ve become fascinated with maintaining a healthy lifestyle and finding ways to improve my health. My curiosity for seeking ways to optimize my diet is what eventually led me to put a CGM on my arm.</span></p><h2>The Challenge</h2><p><span>I first learned about the 28-day </span><a href="https://www.wearablechallenge.com/"><span>Wearable Challenge</span></a><span> from following </span><a href="https://twitter.com/jwmares"><span>Justin Mares</span></a><span> on Twitter. I’ve followed Justin for quite a while since he knew a lot about the health-and-wellness space after founding two health food companies, </span><a href="https://www.kettleandfire.com/"><span>Kettle &amp; Fire</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://perfectketo.com/"><span>Perfect Keto</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>In October, Justin shared an </span><a href="https://twitter.com/jwmares/status/1315696415213936641"><span>interesting tweet</span></a><span> about a weight-loss challenge that only required participants to track their blood glucose with a </span><a href="https://www.levelshealth.com/"><span>Levels</span></a><span> CGM. After reading the tweet, I knew this was something I had to try. Even though the challenge focused on weight loss, I enrolled immediately because I wanted to experiment with a CGM to see how my body reacts to my diet.</span></p><p><span>The challenge required me to keep my glucose levels below 120mg/dL even after a meal. For every day I went over, I’d lose $25 (talk about having skin in the game). The challenge started with a three-day grace period, so I could experiment with my diet to see how it impacted my glucose without getting penalized.</span></p><p><span>(For context, according to the</span><a href="https://www.idf.org/component/attachments/attachments.html?id=728&amp;task=download"> <span>International Diabetes Federation (IDF) guidelines</span></a><span>, your glucose values are “normal” if they stay below 140mg/dL after meals and return to pre-meal levels within two to three hours. Since this is a challenge geared towards weight loss, the upper limit was set slightly lower.)</span></p><p><b>Related article: </b><a href="https://www.levelshealth.com/blog/what-should-my-glucose-levels-be-ultimate-guide"><b>What should your glucose levels be? Here’s the ultimate guide to healthy blood sugar ranges</b></a></p><p><span>To help stay in the target range, each member of the challenge had access to a WhatsApp group chat to support each other. The group chat was a place for members to share what diet was working well, vent their frustrations when they failed, and provide a positive environment for motivation and encouragement. This aspect was less useful for me (I ended up muting it after a few days) because my goals were different. Still, I could see how much other members appreciated the accountability and support.</span></p><h2>What I Learned</h2><p><span>Overall, I found the challenge to be a learning experience filled with joyful moments of self-confirmation, times of utter disappointment, and a few surprises in between.</span></p><h3>The Good</h3><p><span>The best news was discovering that my typical breakfast of three eggs, bacon, and half an avocado drizzled in olive oil caused almost no glycemic response, nor did my afternoon snack of raw almonds. The app showed that these foods consistently hit a perfect score. Since I eat these foods most often, it was comforting knowing that I had a strong foundation.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3.png" data-src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3.png" alt="" width="400" height="600" data-srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3.png 400w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3-267x400.png 267w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3-133x200.png 133w" data-sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3.png 400w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3-267x400.png 267w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3-133x200.png 133w"></p><p><span>The challenge also confirmed my belief that eating a low-carb paleo/keto-inspired diet consisting of mostly meat, vegetables, and healthy fats (olive oil, coconut oil, and butter/ghee) was optimal for maintaining consistent glucose levels.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3.png" data-src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3.png" alt="" width="350" height="500" data-srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3-140x200.png 140w" data-sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3-140x200.png 140w"></p><p><span>Over the past four years, I’ve made a conscious effort to cook meals that avoid simple carbs, vegetable oils, and sweeteners, and it felt really good knowing I’d been making the right choices.</span></p><h3>The Not-So-Good</h3><p><span>The foods with the most considerable impact on my blood sugar were white rice and craft beer, although I can’t say I was surprised. Unfortunately, I love both of these things (so long Chipotle burrito bowls). It was disappointing to finally have to stare down the truth instead of continuing to live in willful ignorance.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1.png" data-src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1.png" alt="" width="350" height="500" data-srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1-140x200.png 140w" data-sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1-140x200.png 140w"></p><p><span>I was also disappointed to learn how much sweet potato spikes my blood sugar. I knew sweet potatoes had a lower </span><a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/glycemic-index-and-glycemic-load-for-100-foods"><span>glycemic index (GI)</span></a><span> than regular potatoes, but they still pushed me over the limit. I plan to keep them in my diet but will be more conscious about how often I eat them.</span></p><h3>The Surprising</h3><p><span>The biggest surprise of the challenge was discovering that quality tequila (G4 Reposado) had almost no effect on my blood sugar. Tequila that is 100% agave has zero carbs because of the distillation process (an average craft IPA has around 13g of carbs). Since beer is my usual go-to if I want a drink, I was happy to learn there was a healthier substitute I already enjoyed.</span></p><p><span>I also recognize I need to be careful here. Just because I didn’t experience a glucose spike doesn’t mean I didn’t have a biological response. </span><a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/85/6/1545/4632987"><span>Research suggests</span></a><span> that alcohol decreases the liver’s ability to make new glucose, so it can trigger hypoglycemia, especially if you’re fasting or in a ketogenic state.</span></p><p><b>Related article: </b><a href="https://www.levelshealth.com/blog/alcohol-and-metabolic-fitness"><b>What does alcohol do to my glucose levels?</b></a></p><p><span>Another big surprise was discovering that my glucose levels aren’t just impacted by <em>what</em> I eat but also <em>when</em> I eat. I confirmed this because I meal prep twice a week to save time by eating the same meal multiple days in a row. (You may find that boring; I find it efficient.)</span></p><p><span>Eating the same thing for lunch and dinner on several challenge days was great for understanding how my body responds to food at different times of the day. All else being equal, my glucose spikes more after dinner than it does for lunch—sometimes by as much as 20mg/dL!</span></p><p><span>Even more surprising was noticing how little change there was from eating the same meal from day to day, but then having a large variance between lunch and dinner. I’m sure there’s a reason why, but I couldn’t tease a convincing explanation out of the data.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1.png" data-src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1.png" alt="" width="350" height="500" data-srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1-140x200.png 140w" data-sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1-140x200.png 140w"></p><h2>What’s Changed</h2><p><span>Since the challenge ended, I’ve made a few adjustments to my diet. I’m not one to make radical changes (like cutting out a particular food from my diet forever), but now I’m more careful when I still want to splurge. Here are some of the changes I’ve made:</span></p><ul><li aria-level="1"><span>If I’m going to drink, I opt for quality spirits (neat or on the rocks) over craft beer or cocktails loaded with sugar.</span></li><li aria-level="1"><span>I’ve reconsidered the idea of a cheat day. I still plan on enjoying the occasional night of pizza and beer or tacos and margaritas, but a cheat day isn’t just a day. Now that I’m aware that the effects of an unhealthy meal can last for 2-3 days, I better make sure that the meal is worth it.</span></li><li aria-level="1"><span>I need to avoid any sweetened beverage, no matter how “healthy.”&nbsp; Smoothies, sweetened kombucha, and sweetened coffee wrecked my glucose levels, even though they’re often touted as healthy choices. Better to eat my sweets after a hearty meal than to drink them.</span></li><li aria-level="1"><span>I’m now more conscious of what I order when I eat out. For example, I opt for the salad at Chipotle instead of the burrito bowl. I’ve also switched to eating more sashimi instead of sushi to avoid eating as much rice.</span></li></ul><p><span>Even though the challenge only lasted 28 days, I learned more about my diet and lifestyle in those four weeks than I had from any previous blood test or book on dieting. The challenge confirmed that I already eat a healthy diet, but I need to make a few changes to ensure a healthy life for decades to come.</span></p><p><em><span>To learn more about the 28-day </span><a href="https://www.wearablechallenge.com/"><span>Wearable Challenge</span></a><span><a href="https://www.wearablechallenge.com/">, click here</a>.</span></em></p><p><em>Adapted from an original post <a href="https://lawsonblake.com/continuous-glucose-monitoring-levels-health/">here</a>.&nbsp;</em></p></div></div></div></section><section id="blog-single-content-related" data-ani-anchor=""></section></main>

Dial-up internet connections may feel like a relic of the past, but modern telephony equipment makes it cheap &amp; easy to set up your own dial-up ISP!
</p><p>Forget about pricey interconnects with the phone company: with a few pieces of commodity hardware and an hour of setup, you can emulate a blazing fast 56&nbsp;kbps <sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> network connection between two or more clients.

<h3><span id="Choosing_Modem_Hardware">Choosing Modem Hardware</span></h3>
<p>Despite variations in modem hardware, this guide should work with any dial-up modem that presents itself as a serial device to the operating system, whether it connects over USB, ISA, PCI, or RS-232.
</p><p>However, <b>you should avoid using <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmodem">software modems</a></b> (sometimes called "softmodems" or "Winmodems") because they are error-prone and difficult to debug. This guide uses three external serial modems (with USB to RS-232 adapters) and one USB modem. Dedicated serial hardware is easy to troubleshoot, and scales to as many lines as you have USB/RS-232 ports.
</p><p>Dial-up over VoIP can be unreliable so it is best to keep speeds low. If you don't already have a modem I would recommend looking for a 14.4k modem for the sake of reliability.

<p>Install a Linux or Unix distribution of your choice before proceeding. Installation instructions are beyond the scope of this guide; you should consult your distribution's instructions for help. The commands given in this guide may need to be changed if you're not using a Debian-derived Linux. (Click these links for installation instructions for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://help.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/installmanual">Debian</a>).

<h2><span id="The_Telephone_Network">The Telephone Network</span></h2>
<p>We need a way to connect our ISP modem to clients. There are many ways to approach this:
</p>
<ul><li>Use the actual PSTN (real phone lines)</li>
<li>Use a PBX to provide local connectivity</li>
<li>Build your own circuity</li>
<li>Build a fake PSTN using VoIP ATAs and a software PBX</li></ul>
<p>This guide builds a fake PSTN with SIP and ATAs. Here's the breakdown:
</p>
<ul><li>Asterisk — a VoIP PBX on the dial-in server — accepts connections from multiple SIP client accounts and routes calls between them.</li>
<li>Cisco-Linksys SPA-2102 ATAs — which support two phone lines each — act as SIP clients connected to the PBX.</li>
<li>The ISP-side modem(s) each connect to one phone line, and a client device to a second line.</li></ul>
<p>This design can scale up to as many modems and clients as desired: just add more ATAs!
</p>
<h4><span id="Asterisk_Setup">Asterisk Setup</span></h4>
<ol>
<li>Install your Debian-based Linux distribution of choice (Raspbian covered above)</li>
<li>Update to latest packages and reboot if required<br></li>
<pre>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo reboot</pre>
<li>Install Asterisk:<br></li>
<pre>sudo apt install asterisk</pre>
<li>Append configuration for the SIP clients to the end of <code>/etc/asterisk/sip.conf</code>:
<br>
<div>
<p>This configuration is for 4 modems and 4 clients on 4 ATAs, but can be extended to as many or as few as you need.
</p>
<div>
<pre>[ata-modem1]
context=default                 ; Using the default context because this is a simple design
type=friend                     ; Allow calls to be placed and received to keep things simple
secret=password                 ; Only the most secure passwords around here
qualify=200                     ; Qualify peer is no more than 200ms away
host=dynamic                    ; This device registers with us
directmedia=yes                 ; Send RTP directly to the peer to reduce latency and jitter
nat=no                          ; Only use symmetric IP routing

qualify=200
host=dynamic
directmedia=yes
nat=no
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li>Edit <code>/etc/asterisk/extensions.conf</code> and make two changes:<br>
<ol><li>Search for <code>[default]</code> (should be around line 672) and comment out <code>include =&gt; demo</code> by prepending it with a semicolon (<code>;</code>)</li>
<li>Underneath that line, add the new lines for the specific modems and the dial pool:
<pre>exten =&gt; 881,1,Dial(SIP/ata-modem1, 30)
exten =&gt; 882,1,Dial(SIP/ata-modem2, 30)
exten =&gt; 883,1,Dial(SIP/ata-modem3, 30)
exten =&gt; 884,1,Dial(SIP/ata-modem4, 30)
exten =&gt; _X!,1,Dial(SIP/ata-modem1&amp;SIP/ata-modem2&amp;SIP/ata-modem3&amp;SIP/ata-modem4, 30)
</pre>
The <code>_X!</code> tells this dial plan rule to match any number a client dials and send the call to all of the ata-modem[1-4] clients simultaneously with a 30 second timeout. To use a specific modemm, dial its extension and only that modem will ring.</li></ol>
</li>
<li>Enable the asterisk service so it starts on boot:<br>
<code>sudo systemctl enable asterisk</code><br>
</li>
<li>
Start Asterisk:<br>
<code>sudo systemctl start asterisk</code></li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Thread-local storage (TLS) provides a mechanism allocating distinct objects for different threads. It is the usual implementation for GCC extension <code>__thread</code>, C11 <code>_Thread_local</code>, and C++11 <code>thread_local</code>, which allow the use of the declared name to refer to the entity associated with the current thread. This article will describe thread-local storage on ELF platforms in detail, and touch on other related topics, such as: thread-specific data keys and Windows/macOS TLS.</p>
<p>An example usage of thread-local storage is POSIX <code>errno</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each thread has its own thread ID, scheduling priority and policy, errno value, floating point environment, thread-specific key/value bindings, and the required system resources to support a flow of control.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Different threads have different <code>errno</code> copies. <code>errno</code> is typically defined as a function which returns a thread-local variable.</p>
<p>For each architecture, the authoritative ELF ABI document is the processor supplement (psABI) to the System V ABI (generic ABI). These documents usually reference <em>The ELF Handling for Thread-Local Storage</em> by Ulrich Drepper. The document, however, mixes general specifications and glibc internals.</p>
<h2 id="representation">Representation</h2>
<h3 id="assembler-behavior">Assembler behavior</h3>
<p>The compiler usually defines thread-local variables in <code>.tdata</code> and <code>.tbss</code> sections (which have the section flag <code>SHF_TLS</code>). The symbols representing thread-local variables have type <code>STT_TLS</code> (representing thread-local storage entities). In GNU as syntax, you can give <code>a</code> the type <code>STT_TLS</code> with <code>.type a, @tls_object</code>. The <code>st_value</code> value of a TLS symbols is the offset relative to the defining section.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br><span>9</span><br><span>10</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>.section .tbss,"awT",@nobits</span><br><span>.globl a, b</span><br><span>.type a, @tls_object</span><br><span>.type b, @tls_object</span><br><span>a:</span><br><span>  .zero 4</span><br><span>  .size a, .-a</span><br><span>b:</span><br><span>  .zero 4</span><br><span>  .size b, .-b</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>In this example, <code>st_value(a)=0</code> while <code>st_value(b)=4</code>.</p>
<p>In Clang and GCC produced assembly, thread-local variables are annotated as <code>.type a, @object</code> (<code>STT_OBJECT</code>). When the assembler sees that such symbols are defined in <code>SHF_TLS</code> sections or referenced by TLS relocations, <code>STT_NOTYPE</code>/<code>STT_OBJECT</code> will be upgraded to <code>STT_TLS</code>.</p>
<p>GNU as supports an directive <code>.tls_common</code> which defines <code>STT_TLS SHN_COMMON</code> symbols. This is an obsecure feature. It is not clear whether GCC still has a code path which emits <code>.tls_common</code> directives. LLVM integrated assembler does not support <code>.tls_common</code>.</p>
<h3 id="linker-behavior">Linker behavior</h3>
<p>The linker combines <code>.tdata</code> input sections into a <code>.tdata</code> output section. <code>.tbss</code> input sections are combined into a <code>.tbss</code> output section. The two <code>SHF_TLS</code> output sections are placed into a <code>PT_TLS</code> program header.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>p_offset</code>: the file offset of the TLS initialization image</li>
<li><code>p_vaddr</code>: the virtual address of the TLS initialization image</li>
<li><code>p_filesz</code>: the size of the TLS initialization image</li>
<li><code>p_memsz</code>: the total size of the thread-local storage. The last <code>p_memsz-p_filesz</code> bytes will be zeroed by the dynamic loader.</li>
<li><code>p_align</code>: alignment</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>PT_TLS</code> program header is contained in a <code>PT_LOAD</code> program header. Conceptually <code>PT_TLS</code> and <code>STT_TLS</code> symbols are like in a separate address space. The dynamic loader should copy the <code>[p_vaddr,p_vaddr+p_filesz)</code> of the TLS initialization image to the corresponding static TLS block.</p>
<p>In executable and shared object files, <code>st_value</code> normally holds a virtual address. For a <code>STT_TLS</code> symbol, <code>st_value</code> holds an offset relative to the virtual address of the <code>PT_TLS</code> program header. The first byte of <code>PT_TLS</code> is referenced by the TLS symbol with <code>st_value==0</code>.</p>
<p>GNU ld treats <code>STT_TLS SHN_COMMON</code> symbols as defined in <code>.tcommon</code> sections. Its internal linker script places such sections into the output section <code>.tdata</code>. LLD does not support <code>STT_TLS SHN_COMMON</code> symbols.</p>
<h3 id="dynamic-loader-behavior">Dynamic loader behavior</h3>
<p>The dynamic loader collects <code>PT_TLS</code> program headers from the main executable and immediately loaded shared objects (via transitive <code>DT_NEEDED</code>), and allocates static TLS blocks, one block for each <code>PT_TLS</code>. For each <code>PT_TLS</code>, the dynamic loader copies <code>p_filesz</code> bytes from the TLS initialization image to the TLS block and sets the trailing <code>p_memsz-p_filesz</code> bytes to zeroes.</p>
<p>For the static TLS block of the main executable, the module ID is one and the TP offset of a TLS symbol is a link-time constant. The linker and the dynamic loader share the same formula.</p>
<p>For a shared object loaded at program start, the offset from the thread pointer to its static TLS block is a fixed value at program start, albeit not a link-time constant. The offset can be referenced by a GOT dynamic relocation used by the initial-exec TLS model.</p>
<p><em>The ELF Handling for Thread-Local Storage</em> describes two TLS variants and specifies their data structures. However, only the TP offset of the static TLS block of the main executable is a hard requirement. Nevertheless, libc implementations usually place static TLS blocks together, and allocate a space for both the thread control block and the static TLS blocks.</p>
<p>For a new thread created by <code>pthread_create</code>, the static TLS blocks are usually allocated as part of the thread stack. Without a guard page between the largest address of the stack and the thread control block, this could be considered as vulnerable as stack overflow can overwrite the thread control block.</p>

<p>The first condition is obvious. The second condition is becuase a non-default visibility means the variable must be defined by another translation unit in the executable.</p>

<p>For the static TLS block of the main executable, the TP offset of a TLS symbol is a link-time constant. Here is a list of common relocation types:</p>

<li>riscv: <code>R_RISCV_TPREL_HI20</code>, <code>R_RISCV_TPREL_LO12_I</code>, <code>R_RISCV_TPREL_LO12_S</code></li>
</ul>
<p>For RISC architectures, because an instruction typically has 4 bytes and cannot encode a 32-bit offset, it usually takes two instructions to materialize a TP offset.</p>
<p>In <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D93331">https://reviews.llvm.org/D93331</a>, I patched LLD to reject local-exec TLS relocations in <code>-shared</code> mode. In GNU ld, at least arm, riscv and x86's ports have the similar diagnostics, but aarch64 and ppc64 do not error.</p>
<h3 id="initial-exec-tls-model-executable-preemptible">Initial exec TLS model (executable &amp; preemptible)</h3>
<p>This model is less efficient than local exec. It applies when the TLS symbol is defined in the executable or a shared object available at program start. The shared object can be due to <code>DT_NEEDED</code> or <code>LD_PRELOAD</code>.</p>
<p>The compiler picks this model in <code>-fno-pic/-fpie</code> modes if the variable is a declaration with default visibility. The idea is that a symbol referenced by the executable must be defined by an immediately loaded shared object, instead of a dlopen loaded shared object. The linker enforces this as well by defaulting to <code>-z defs</code> for a <code>-no-pie/-pie</code> link.</p>

<p>Because the offset from the thread pointer to the start of a static block is fixed at program start, such an offset can be encoded by a GOT relocation. Such relocation types typically have <code>GOT</code> and <code>TPREL/TPOFF</code> in their names. Here is a list of common relocation types:</p>
<ul>
<li>arm: <code>R_ARM_TLS_IE32</code></li>
<li>aarch64: <code>R_AARCH64_TLSIE_ADR_GOTTPREL_PAGE21</code>, <code>R_AARCH64_TLSIE_LD64_GOTTPREL_LO12_NC</code></li>

<li>riscv: <code>R_RISCV_TLS_GOT_HI20</code>, <code>R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_I</code></li>
</ul>
<p>If the TLS symbol does not satisfy initial-exec to local-exec relaxation requirements, the linker will allocate a GOT entry and emit a dynamic relocation. Here is a list of dynamic relocation types:</p>
<ul>
<li>arm: <code>R_ARM_TLS_TPOFF32</code></li>
<li>aarch64: <code>R_AARCH64_TLS_TPREL64</code></li>
<li>mips32: <code>R_MIPS_TLS_TPREL32</code></li>

<li>ppc64: <code>R_PPC64_TPREL64</code></li>
<li>riscv: <code>R_RISCV_TLS_TPREL64</code></li>
</ul>
<p>While they have <code>TPREL</code> or <code>TPOFF</code> in their names, these dynamic relocations have the same bitwidth as the word size. This is a good way to distinguish them from the local-exec relocation types used in object files.</p>
<p>If you add the <code>__attribute((tls_model("initial-exec")))</code> attribute, a thread-local variable can use this model in <code>-fpic</code> mode. If the object file is linked into an executable, everything is fine. If the object file is linked into a shared object, the shared object generally needs to be an immediately loaded shared object. The linker sets the <code>DF_STATIC_TLS</code> flag to annotate a shared object with initial-exec TLS relocations.</p>
<p>glibc ld.so reserves some space in static TLS blocks and allows dlopen on such a shared object if its TLS size is small. There could be an obscure reason for using such an attribute: general dynamic and local dynamic TLS models are not async-signal-safe in glibc. However, other libc implementations may not reserve additional TLS space for dlopen'ed initial-exec shared objects, e.g. musl will error.</p>
<h3 id="general-dynamic-and-local-dynamic-tls-models-dso">General dynamic and local dynamic TLS models (DSO)</h3>
<p>The two modes are used when the TLS symbol may be defined by a shared object. They do not assume the TLS symbol is backed by a static TLS block. Instead, they assume that the thread-local storage of the module may be dynamically allocated, making the models suitable for dlopen usage. The dynamically allocated TLS storage is usually referred to as dynamic TLS.</p>

        <p>Thread-local storage (TLS) provides a mechanism allocating distinct objects for different threads. It is the usual implementation for GCC extension <code>__thread</code>, C11 <code>_Thread_local</code>, and C++11 <code>thread_local</code>, which allow the use of the declared name to refer to the entity associated with the current thread. This article will describe thread-local storage on ELF platforms in detail, and touch on other related topics, such as: thread-specific data keys and Windows/macOS TLS.</p>
<p>An example usage of thread-local storage is POSIX <code>errno</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each thread has its own thread ID, scheduling priority and policy, errno value, floating point environment, thread-specific key/value bindings, and the required system resources to support a flow of control.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Different threads have different <code>errno</code> copies. <code>errno</code> is typically defined as a function which returns a thread-local variable.</p>
<p>For each architecture, the authoritative ELF ABI document is the processor supplement (psABI) to the System V ABI (generic ABI). These documents usually reference <em>The ELF Handling for Thread-Local Storage</em> by Ulrich Drepper. The document, however, mixes general specifications and glibc internals.</p>
<h2 id="representation">Representation</h2>
<h3 id="assembler-behavior">Assembler behavior</h3>
<p>The compiler usually defines thread-local variables in <code>.tdata</code> and <code>.tbss</code> sections (which have the section flag <code>SHF_TLS</code>). The symbols representing thread-local variables have type <code>STT_TLS</code> (representing thread-local storage entities). In GNU as syntax, you can give <code>a</code> the type <code>STT_TLS</code> with <code>.type a, @tls_object</code>. The <code>st_value</code> value of a TLS symbols is the offset relative to the defining section.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br><span>9</span><br><span>10</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>.section .tbss,"awT",@nobits</span><br><span>.globl a, b</span><br><span>.type a, @tls_object</span><br><span>.type b, @tls_object</span><br><span>a:</span><br><span>  .zero 4</span><br><span>  .size a, .-a</span><br><span>b:</span><br><span>  .zero 4</span><br><span>  .size b, .-b</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>In this example, <code>st_value(a)=0</code> while <code>st_value(b)=4</code>.</p>
<p>In Clang and GCC produced assembly, thread-local variables are annotated as <code>.type a, @object</code> (<code>STT_OBJECT</code>). When the assembler sees that such symbols are defined in <code>SHF_TLS</code> sections or referenced by TLS relocations, <code>STT_NOTYPE</code>/<code>STT_OBJECT</code> will be upgraded to <code>STT_TLS</code>.</p>
<p>GNU as supports an directive <code>.tls_common</code> which defines <code>STT_TLS SHN_COMMON</code> symbols. This is an obsecure feature. It is not clear whether GCC still has a code path which emits <code>.tls_common</code> directives. LLVM integrated assembler does not support <code>.tls_common</code>.</p>
<h3 id="linker-behavior">Linker behavior</h3>
<p>The linker combines <code>.tdata</code> input sections into a <code>.tdata</code> output section. <code>.tbss</code> input sections are combined into a <code>.tbss</code> output section. The two <code>SHF_TLS</code> output sections are placed into a <code>PT_TLS</code> program header.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>p_offset</code>: the file offset of the TLS initialization image</li>
<li><code>p_vaddr</code>: the virtual address of the TLS initialization image</li>
<li><code>p_filesz</code>: the size of the TLS initialization image</li>
<li><code>p_memsz</code>: the total size of the thread-local storage. The last <code>p_memsz-p_filesz</code> bytes will be zeroed by the dynamic loader.</li>
<li><code>p_align</code>: alignment</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>PT_TLS</code> program header is contained in a <code>PT_LOAD</code> program header. Conceptually <code>PT_TLS</code> and <code>STT_TLS</code> symbols are like in a separate address space. The dynamic loader should copy the <code>[p_vaddr,p_vaddr+p_filesz)</code> of the TLS initialization image to the corresponding static TLS block.</p>
<p>In executable and shared object files, <code>st_value</code> normally holds a virtual address. For a <code>STT_TLS</code> symbol, <code>st_value</code> holds an offset relative to the virtual address of the <code>PT_TLS</code> program header. The first byte of <code>PT_TLS</code> is referenced by the TLS symbol with <code>st_value==0</code>.</p>
<p>GNU ld treats <code>STT_TLS SHN_COMMON</code> symbols as defined in <code>.tcommon</code> sections. Its internal linker script places such sections into the output section <code>.tdata</code>. LLD does not support <code>STT_TLS SHN_COMMON</code> symbols.</p>
<h3 id="dynamic-loader-behavior">Dynamic loader behavior</h3>

<p>I listen to a lot of podcasts. A lot of podcasts. I was listening to the <a href="https://dgshow.org/">Dave and Gunnar Show</a> podcast <a href="https://dgshow.org/212">episode 212</a> with guest <a href="https://twitter.com/drdavidawheeler">David A. Wheeler</a>. The Titanic was used as an example of changing process after a security incident. This opened up a flood of thoughts to me, but not for the reasons intended in the conversation. The point of the suggestion was the Titanic sinking created changes to international requirements to help avoid a similar disaster next time, and we should be viewing SolarWinds in a similar way. The idea being we should use the SolarWinds event to drive meaningful change to make security better. Why no change will come of this is a different conversation: TL;DR it’s because nobody important died from SolarWinds, the Titanic killed a lot of important people. But I think this is an interesting way to talk about how we tend to deal with problems in software and how we deal with them in real life.</p>



<p>I won’t bore you with a bad retelling of what happened to the Titanic. Historians have covered this topic at length and from every possible angle you can imagine. What’s not always covered is what happened after the Titanic had its historic voyage. Wikipedia has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changes_in_safety_practices_after_the_sinking_of_the_Titanic">page</a> dedicated to changes in safety the Titanic caused. If you read this list it seems pretty obvious in hindsight. This is how many disasters work. There are a lot of little things that have to go wrong for an accident to turn into a disaster. If we could avoid even one or two of those little things, it can change the result dramatically, changing the story from “disaster” to “accident”.</p>



<p>So what does this have to do with software? When we have failures in the world of software it seems like we rarely change anything. How many organizations have changed the process due to Solar Winds? There was a lot of momentary panic, and A LOT of empty talk, but from what I’ve seen most companies have basically just gone back to doing thing the same old way. Most of the suggestions on what to do was what I like to call “security harder!” This is where leadership says they take security very seriously, but their actions tell a different story.</p>



<p>It seems like if we reacted to the Titanic in the same way we handle software incidents the solutions would be “Titanic harder next time”. We would have launched thousands of boats through iceberg filled waters with varying degrees of success. Every time a boat sank we just told the ship builders to use more Titanic the next time. They of course have no idea what that means, but as long as the checks clear they keep building boats.</p>



<p>I think we lack realistic understandings of what happened to SolarWinds. If you listen to the Dave and Gunnar Show mentioned above, the proposed solution to all of this is something called reproducible builds. I’ve <a href="https://opensourcesecurity.io/2016/05/01/trusting-trusting-trust/">written</a> and <a href="https://opensourcesecurity.io/2020/05/17/episode-197-beer-security-and-consistency-the-newer-better-triad/">talked</a> about reproducible builds at length, they are a modern solution to a malicious build system the same way an iceberg satellite tracking system would have been a solution for the Titanic. It’s not a realistic option because the technology doesn’t exist. I hope it does someday, but it’s just not there right now no matter how hard we want it to be. The tooling doesn’t exist. If we want to have an honest conversation about reproducible builds it needs to be with the creators of build systems. And when I say “conversation” I really mean patches. If this is something society wants, we have to do the work. Talking isn’t work (says the guy with a blog). Anyone who has reproducible builds today have done it in spite of the tools, not because of the tools. The number of organizations and projects that can do this is a very very small number.</p>



<p>The obvious question about all this supply chain talk now is “what can we do?” And there isn’t a great answer to this question today. There is no shortage of opinions about how SolarWinds could have Titanic’d harder. But what there is shortage of is actionable advice the rest of us can use. If you asked someone how you could better secure your supply chain, you aren’t going to get advice, you are going to get guesses. There aren’t a lot of people who actually understand what a modern open source supply chain looks like. There are however plenty of opinions on how to secure a modern open source supply chain.</p>



<p>I of course know how to secure the supply chain because I have a blog named “Open Source Security”. This is sadly the closest thing to a real qualification that exists in this space. While I offer a great deal of advice on various open source topics, the most important takeaway is anything I talk about is verifiable by anyone. This is open source after all. You don’t have to take my word for it, go figure it out for yourself. If you find I’m wrong, let me know so I can change what I’m talking about.</p>



<p>So you don’t want to be the next SolarWinds, but you also don’t know what that means. I just wrote a <a href="https://opensourcesecurity.io/2021/01/29/you-cannot-manage-your-supply-chain/">blog</a> post about not trying to manage your supply chain. Find someone else to help you. There are many companies and projects that are better at supply chain tasks than you will ever be (unless you’re in the business of open source software, don’t spend your valuable time worrying about it). But even that post misses some important points. “What should you do first” is a pretty important question for example.</p>



<p>Lately I’ve been imaging the work I have to do as an apple tree. There are some apples close to the ground, and some high up in the tree that will need a ladder to get. If you’re like any normal person, you pick the low apples first. I don’t even have to explain why (if you’re the sort of person who picks the apples on top first this is why nobody likes you). The work we have to do for making our supply chain secure is a lot like this. There are some tasks we can do right away because they’re the low hanging fruit. Low hanging fruit is easy to pick.</p>



<p>By doing the easy things first we get two huge benefits. The first is we are doing the work we need to do. We’re not talking about it, we’re not building some plan, we’re actually doing work. <a href="https://opensourcesecurity.io/2020/12/14/committee-or-community-slowing-down-the-future/">Work beats talk</a> every day of the week. The second benefit is we start to learn more about the problems. Even if you do a task that ends up failing or not really mattering, you will learn something along the way. The more we learn the more we can decide which apples should be picked next. And when in doubt, just pick the apple closest to you.</p>



<p>Here’s a simple thing you can go do right now that can make a difference. <a href="https://opensourcesecurity.io/2020/06/07/episode-200-talking-container-security-with-liz-rice/">Aqua</a> Security have a scanner tool called Trivy. Go run it against your code (it can also scan containers). Here’s an example that scans the Signal Desktop app.</p>



<pre><code>docker run --rm aquasec/trivy repo https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Desktop.git</code></pre>



<p>Of course, I’ve also <a href="https://opensourcesecurity.io/2020/03/10/the-security-scanner-problem/">talked</a> about what this scanner output really means, so be sure to take it with a grain of salt 🙂</p>



<p>But the point is if you run this tool and look at the output, you are going to learn new things and have a different understanding for what you’re doing. It will help shape your future work and ideas.</p>



<p>And the absolute most important thing you can do once you start this journey is to talk about it. When you do something that works, tell the rest of us. When you do something that doesn’t work, tell the rest of us. We have enough talking heads giving out unrealistic advice. I want advice from people doing the work. I don’t need to hear what the guy with an expensive suit thinks. He’s the reason we’re in this mess.</p>

<p><span>B</span>y the time Mudassir Azeemi wrote to Apple CEO Tim Cook in 2014, he’d tried everything he<em> </em>could think of to make it easier to type in his native language, Urdu. In 2010, the now 42-year-old Pakistani-American developed a keyboard app you could use on iOS devices; within two years, it had been downloaded over 165,000 times. But even with an Urdu-language keyboard, the characters appeared on the screen in an entirely different font.</p>



<p>“Dear Mr Tim Cook,” he wrote. “Urdu language’s beauty lies in the typeface.”</p>



<p>Spoken by nearly 170 million people in South Asia and the South Asian diaspora, Urdu is written in an alphabet derived from Arabic. But while Arabic is written in a script called <em>naskh</em>, simpler and more linear in its appearance, many other people — including Iranians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Urdu-speakers in India, and Uighur-speakers in parts of China — employ an ornate style of writing that originated in 14th-century Persia called <em>nastaʿlīq</em>. When Azeemi sat down to write his letter to Cook, nastaʿlīq was almost nowhere to be found online. To communicate in Urdu, you either had to type in naskh or spell words phonetically in Latin script.</p>



<p>Azeemi, a software developer now working and living in Silicon Valley, grew up in Pakistan’s sprawling seaside city, Karachi. As a teenager during the days of dial-up, he once racked up an internet bill that cost half of his father’s monthly salary; in his early 20s, he learned to code on one of those old calculator-sized computers called palmtops. He didn’t give much thought to Urdu’s digital future until he moved to California and became a father. Watching his children learn English through songs on YouTube, he’d felt a pang of loss — the anxiety that they might never speak or appreciate Urdu the way he does. One of the earliest apps Azeemi developed, even before the keyboard, was for nursery rhymes in Urdu.</p>



<p>These early attempts at yanking Urdu on to the internet hadn’t been particularly profitable — Azeemi says he lost over $50,000 in the process. He remained determined. In 2013, Apple introduced an Urdu keyboard for iOS devices, but, much to the chagrin of Urdu users, the default font was still naskh, the Arabic font. In Azeemi’s eyes, the solution was now pretty straightforward: operating systems — Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others — had to be persuaded to adopt nastaʿlīq.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His open letter, addressed to Cook and Apple’s chief design officer at the time, Jonathan Ive, described the need for a nastaʿlīq font on iOS platforms. “The only hurdle for us is to bring the typeface that truly represent[s] the language,” wrote Azeemi. “And every language, when it is written, shines when using the typeface which it truly presented in the world.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>When Urdu calligraphers speak of nastaʿlīq, it is with deep reverence. In the subcontinent, it was the script that disseminated the Quran, considered the word of God. Mir Ali of Tabriz, a 14th-century Persian calligrapher known as the father of the script, is said to have developed it after a dream in which Ali, son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad, instructed him to draw letters that looked like “the wings of flying geese.” Squint at an Urdu verse in nastaʿlīq, and it might very well begin to resemble a flock of birds taking flight, or a branch in bloom. Nastaʿlīq characters, <a href="https://archive.org/stream/fromconcepttocon00fush/fromconcepttocon00fush_djvu.txt">per one observation</a>, appear to “swing from the upper right to the lower left of each word as if suspended by an imaginary line.”</p>



<p>In some ways, this emphasis on the <em>form</em> of writing a language runs contrary to conventional wisdom. We tend to think of text as a means to an end, that the characters depicted are there only to convey meaning. If you could write the same Urdu word in the Arabic naskh script, even if it looked a little different — naskh is smaller, simpler, and sans serif — wasn’t the demand for digitized nastaʿlīq just a minor typographical quibble?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nastaʿlīq, after all, is a nightmare to code. It moves right to left, like all Arabic scripts, but also slopes downward: the longer the word, the steeper the slope. The shape of each letter changes, depending on the letter that comes before and after; in a 39-letter alphabet, there are thousands of permutations. Its multifaceted nature is precisely why coders haven’t developed nastaʿlīq fonts as easily as, say, Cyrillic.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>We tend to think of text as a means to an end, that the characters depicted are there only to convey meaning.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>It didn’t have to be this way. As early as 1951, just four years after wresting off British rule, Pakistan — where Urdu is both the official language and played a key role in the movement for independence — set up a national printing press that could compose in both English and Urdu, a substantial investment for the young, cash-strapped country and an indication, perhaps, of Urdu’s importance for its nation-building project. But even though Monotype and Linotype, the predominant printing technology firms of the time, kept developing typefaces for the Urdu market, local publishers kept rejecting them because they just didn’t match up to the local nastaʿlīq aesthetic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Part of the reason nastaʿlīq ran into trouble was because the technology at the time — specifically the typewriter — was built with English in mind. Subsequently, as historian Thomas S. Mullaney notes in his book, “The Chinese Typewriter,” all other languages are seen as permutations from that norm. Hebrew is English but backward. Arabic is English backward and in cursive. Russian: English with different letters. Siamese: English with too many letters. Perhaps the only major language to escape the thumb of Latin hegemony was Chinese, a script that is neither alphabetic nor syllabic, and thus <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/wubi-effect">had to be imagined entirely outside the box of existing technology</a>. But nastaʿlīq, presumably not quite significant enough to send typographers back to the drawing board, remained stalled until the 1970s, its mechanical rendering nowhere close to the sweep and flourish of the handwritten script.</p>



<p>In modern-day Iran, where nastaʿlīq originated, the font changed to meet the limitations of the existing technology. Over the years, Farsi slowly developed a typographical identity that worked within the constraints of the block printing press but was stylistically different enough from the Arabic naskh to feel sufficiently “Persian.” If you pick up a newspaper in Tehran today, it looks significantly different from a paper in Karachi.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why didn’t Urdu, and Pakistan, go down a similar typographical route as Farsi did in Iran? Stubborn fidelity to nastaʿlīq aside, one reason may be the ways in which Urdu differed from other nastaʿlīq-favoring languages. One letter, “the <em>baṛī ye</em> (ے), is particularly influential on the look of written Urdu,” writes typographer and historian Titus Nemeth in “Arabic Type-Making in the Machine Age” (2017), “and its typographic rendering is among the most challenging design questions in an Arabic font.”</p>



<p>The baṛī ye, which resembles a bent elbow, produces all sorts of mechanical obstacles with regard to kerning and the placement of dots and diacritics. Baṛī ye and letters like it posed a problem that seemed so insurmountable, in fact, that, in the 1960s — mimicking Mustafa Kemal Atatürk’s <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2013-06-25/some-turks-reconsidering-arabic-connection-turkish-language">mission to convert Turkish script into a Latin alphabet</a> — Pakistan’s military ruler Ayub Khan proposed officially writing Urdu in Latin letters. He was met with near-instant pushback: the nastaʿlīq script, protested local religious leaders, was an essential marker of Pakistan’s Islamic identity. Without meaningful progress in the printing process, Urdu publications in Pakistan, including dailies, continued to be written by hand well into the 1980s, armies of calligraphers scribbling furiously day and night.</p>

<p><strong>Ahmed Mirza Jamil,</strong> owner of a printing business in Karachi, inherited his love for nastaʿlīq from his father, who, in his later life, took up the daunting task of writing the Quran in his own hand. He’d completed only a third of the holy book before he fell ill and died, but his sons vowed to finish his cherished project. They photographed their father’s nine handwritten chapters, then cut and pasted his letter formations to piece together — like a jigsaw puzzle — the remaining two-thirds of the Quran. It was a staggeringly elaborate labor of love that took 14 years to complete. And it sowed the seeds for a long-awaited breakthrough in Urdu typesetting.</p>



<p>In 1980, Mirza Jamil wrote out every combination of Urdu letters that he could think of — roughly 20,000 by most accounts. These combinations, known as ligatures, became the basis of a new Urdu typeface: Noori Nastaliq, a font Jamil named after his father. It solved the difficulty posed by the shape-shifting nature of nastaʿlīq: instead of representing letters, it represented entire <em>combinations</em> of letters written together. The 20,000 ligatures were by no means exhaustive, but the chances of any other combination cropping up, Mirza Jamil reckoned, were negligible. He’d been inspired to address Urdu typographical troubles after encountering a Chinese keyboard, a 48-inch contraption with up to 500 characters, on a trip to Singapore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I thought, if the Chinese could do it,” he told a journalist in 1996, “so could we.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the advent of Noori Nastaliq, Mirza Jamil was hailed as Pakistan’s Gutenburg and bestowed with state honors. Urdu’s path to progress, <a href="http://elite.com.pk/epl/portfolio/noori-nastaliq/revolution/">one writer wrote</a>, “will be lit with the candle of Noori Nastaliq.” Still, adoption was tentative: for a while, according to the historian Nemeth, the country’s largest national newspaper, <em>Daily Jang,</em> carried typographically composed text alongside columns that were still handwritten, hoping to convince the nastaʿlīq purists that their beloved font could be printed too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For decades, Noori Nastaliq remained the …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="blog-post-text"><p>On December 14, we launched <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-12-16-data-bounties/">our first data bounty</a> to <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-12-14-make-money-data-wrangling/">earn a share of $25,000 by wrangling US Presidential Precinct-level data</a>. The bounty ended yesterday. How did it go? This blog entry will answer that question.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.doltdb.com/">Dolt</a> is a SQL database with Git-style versioning. It's the first SQL database you can branch and merge. <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/">DoltHub</a> is a place on the internet to share and collaborate on Dolt databases. Without both, data bounties would not be possible.</p>

<p>We built the <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/dolthub/us-president-precinct-results">best open database of US Precinct-level Election results</a> on the internet. </p>
<p>Here's some statistics:</p>

<p>Now that the bounty is complete, we must figure out what to do with this data. How do we get the most out of our investment in the data?</p>
<h2>Clean up the data we got</h2>
<p>Given the heavily keyed nature of this data, we decided early on to not accept PRs for standardization or normalization of things like party names. Because most columns are part of the primary key, any change looks like a deletion and corresponding addition to Dolt. Thus, changes like that give the corrector credit for the whole row in the bounty instead of just the cell he or she changed. We queued up a number of these types of changes and we'll execute them now that the bounty is over.</p>
<h2>Find some users</h2>
<p>We collected the best US presidential Precinct level results on the internet. Now, we want people to use it. We think potentially the data is good enough that an open data community could be bootstrapped around it. The people who use it would have incentive to finish it as new state level data is released. We will reach out to the people at <a href="http://openelections.net/">Open Elections</a> and <a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/">MIT Elections Lab</a> and start a conversation. If you know anyone else who could use this data, <a href="https://discord.com/invite/RFwfYpu">come let us know in our Discord</a>.</p>
<h2>Run another bounty?</h2>
<p>We're still missing 12 states and about 22% of the vote from 2020. If we want to get complete data and an open data community can't be bootstrapped, we may run another bounty in a couple months to finish the dataset. Let us know if you'd be interested in another bounty or the complete dataset.</p>

<p>We think <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/bounties">DoltHub Bounties</a> may be the fastest, cheapest way to build databases from open data. For $25,000 and 8 weeks, we were able to assemble a 1.7GB database of election results. </p>
<p>Our plan is to run at least one bounty per month for the rest of the year across a number of distinct data disciplines. We're running a <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2021-01-14-hopsital-prices-bounty/">hospital price transparency bounty</a> right now. We'll be launching two more over the next month or so. Hang out in <a href="https://discord.com/invite/RFwfYpu">our Discord</a> to keep up to date. Start wrangling data as your new side hustle.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    

    
<p><a href="https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich">Rich</a> has become a popular (20K stars on GH) way of beautifying CLIs, and I'm pleased to see a number of projects using it.</p>
<p>Since Rich is mature and battle-tested now, I had considered winding-down development. Until, I saw this tweet:</p>
<h2>The Tweet</h2>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Do you want to see something really cool you can do with <a href="https://twitter.com/willmcgugan?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@willmcgugan</a> 's rich library? </p><p>Checkout ghtop <a href="https://t.co/mn7oLbpw8e">https://t.co/mn7oLbpw8e</a>. It's a really fun CLI tool that demonstrates the power of rich (and other things).</p><p>Examples below 🧵👇 (1/8)</p></div>— Hamel Husain (@HamelHusain) <a href="https://twitter.com/HamelHusain/status/1357771218095546368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 5, 2021</a></blockquote> 
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/HamelHusain">@HamelHusain</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward">@jeremyphoward</a> used Rich to enhance <a href="https://github.com/nat/ghtop">ghtop</a> (a repo owned by the CEO of Github, no less). Ghtop shows a realtime a stream of events from the Github platform. And it looks good! So good that I realised how much potential Rich has for these type of htop-like applications.</p>
<p>Hamel and Jeremy had to overcome a few technical hurdles to make that work. Fortunately this will no longer be required as the latest version of Rich has first-class support for full-screen interfaces via a new Layout system.</p>
<h2>Full-screen terminal interface</h2>
<p>Here's a video demonstration of a terminal interface built with Layout:</p>
<p>
<iframe width="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/slrdSojCvlk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>
<h2>Layout API</h2>
<p>The API to create a flexible layout is surprisingly simple. You construct a <code>Layout()</code> object, then call <code>split()</code> to create sub-layouts. These sub-layouts may then be further divided. Layouts have a small number of settings which define their size relative to the terminal window. It's a simple system that can create terminal interfaces that almost resemble modern web apps.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<h2>Finally, some code</h2>
<p>Here's how you would create a basic layout with a header, a footer, and two side-panels.</p>
<pre><code>from rich.console import Console
from rich.layout import Layout

console = Console()
layout = Layout()

# Divide the "screen" in to three parts
layout.split(
    Layout(name="header", size=3),
    Layout(ratio=1, name="main"),
    Layout(size=10, name="footer"),
)
# Divide the "main" layout in to "side" and "body"
layout["main"].split(
    Layout(name="side"),
    Layout(name="body", ratio=2),
    direction="horizontal"
)
# Divide the "side" layout in to two
layout["side"].split(Layout(), Layout())

console.print(layout)
</code></pre>
<p>Running the code above produces the following output:</p>

<p>Terminal split in to 5 sub-layouts. The boxes are placeholders, you can insert any content in their place.</p>


</figcaption>

</figure>
</div>
<p>Any renderable (text, table, progress bars etc) may be placed inside those sub-layouts.</p>
<p>We can now use the <a href="https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/live.html">Live</a> class to create an application that adapts itself to the terminal window:</p>
<pre><code>from rich.live import Live
from time import sleep

with Live(layout, screen=True):
    while True:
        sleep(1)
</code></pre>
<p>In a real app, that do-nothing loop will be doing something useful like pulling data from the network to update contents.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/layout.html">layout docs</a> for an in-depth tutorial.</p>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>I think it's clear that Rich is acquiring more TUI (text user interface) features, and I've decided not to fight it. Rich's core purpose is still to beautify CLI output, but I think there is an opportunity here for a new way to create terminal apps. Ultimately it will be less like curses and more like HTML in a browser.</p>
<p>There are a number of things to do before Rich could replace a full TUI library (keyboard and mouse input for one) but the potential is there. Stay tuned for progress.</p>

<h3 id="about-this-contest">About this contest</h3>

<p>Hello everybody!</p>

<p>I decided to try new thing at the beginning of 2019. You probably heard about competitive programming and about popular web-sites like <a href="https://www.topcoder.com/">Topcoder</a>, <a href="https://www.codility.com/">Codility</a> and others. The idea is that you can try yourself in solving programming puzzles. Usually it’s not enough to just solve the puzzle, your solution must qualify for certain criterias such as algorithmic complexity and memory usage. Also on a real challenges it is improtant how fast you solved the problem.</p>

<p>Those sort of challenges usually test your problem solving skills as well as your knowledge of algorithms and data structures. It is a kind of tasks we usually see on programming job interviews. You need to write the code from scratch to a complete solution.</p>

<p>What I am starting is also a form of contest but aims at developing different set of skills. <strong>We will train to optimize already optimized code</strong>. We will learn hardware optimizations. This is briefly how it will look like: I will pick one existing benchmark of my choice and will send it to all my subscribers. You will have the time to play with the benchmark and find all performance headrooms you can find. You then send all your findings to me (modified sources/assemblies/compiler patches?/whatever speeds up the benchmark) and I check it and run on my hardware. At the end I will anounce the winners.</p>

<p>Before I explain it in more details I feel a need of writing disclaimer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This is absolutely non-profit effort. I’m not looking for make any money from it or using someone’s knowledge in my own purposes. I will not use submissions to extract any intellectual property they might have. Also this is not aiming to advertise any particular software product including benchmarks/compilers. That’s why all the benchmarks and compilers I will use require to be open sourced. Neither it aims to advertise any particular HW.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this contest I try to emulate the situation in performance critical projects on the final stages. When all the functionality is delivered and tested. But before shipping the binary to the customers you were asked to tune the app to it’s peak performance. You know the hardware it will be deployed to. You have the sources in your hands and freedom to modify it (without introducing any bugs :) ). You are the build master, so you can add any compiler flags you want.</p>

<p>For the challenges that I will send I’m not looking for optimizations that fall into the category: “Oh, I just used quicksort instead of bubblesort”. Expect the benchmark to be already optimized to some degree. Your task is to tune it for particular hardware to the peak performance.</p>

<h3 id="qa">Q&amp;A</h3>

<h4 id="q0-why-the-hell-on-earth-i-should-participate-in-this-contest">Q0: <em>Why <del>the hell</del> on earth I should participate in this contest?</em></h4>

<p><strong>A0</strong>: You will learn/practice how to do optimizations for HW. This might include eliminating cache misses by inserting prefetch instructions, getting rid of <a href="https://easyperf.net/blog/2018/01/18/Code_alignment_issues">Code alignment issues</a>, improving performance by helping compiler to vectorize/unroll the loop better. You will learn different techniques as you go.</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="q1-what-benchmarks-are-taken-into-the-contest">Q1: <em>What benchmarks are taken into the contest?</em></h4>

<p><strong>A1</strong>: It will be open sourced benchmark written in C/C++. Usually several source files. It should be easy to build, require minimal dependencies. Preferably it should have some form of validation.</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="q2-what-is-the-machineenvironment-we-will-be-optimizing-for">Q2: <em>What is the machine/environment we will be optimizing for?</em></h4>

<p><strong>A2</strong>: Most likely it will be 64 bit Linux with Intel x86 CPU (probably Haswell architecture). For a start I will not bother with disabling CPU <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_frequency_scaling">dynamic frequency scaling</a> features or setting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_affinity">thread affinity</a>. I might do this in future.</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="q3-what-if-i-dont-have-the-environment-you-are-using">Q3: <em>What if I don’t have the environment you are using?</em></h4>

<p><strong>A3</strong>: It doesn’t matter much. If you don’t have Intel CPU or you are on Windows/Mac, just optimize for whatever you have. I would be happy to know about optimizations that help other CPUs, operating systems, etc.
<strong>I don’t have real prizes to give, so it’s mostly practicing and learning</strong>.</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="q4-how-i-should-find-performance-headrooms">Q4: <em>How I should find performance headrooms?</em></h4>

<p><strong>A4</strong>: Use all of your knowledge. Start with profiling the benchmark. You can browse through posts on this blog. Additionally I will write a separate post that might help begginers.</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="q5-what-optimizations-are-allowed">Q5: <em>What optimizations are allowed?</em></h4>

<p><strong>A5</strong>: Good news! <strong>All the dirty tricks allowed</strong>! The goal of this contest is to learn how to squeeze as much performance as possible from the hardware using any means available. You can modify sources and insert any compiler hints like pragmas, builtins, function attributes, etc. Also you can generate assembly listing (<code>-S</code> compiler option) and modify it. Finally, you can add some compiler option that might speed up the benchmark.</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="q6-whats-not-allowed">Q6: <em>What’s NOT allowed</em></h4>

<p><strong>A6</strong>: 1) Do not rewrite the benchmark completely or introduce major changes in algorithms. The good judging rule is “everything interesting should be calculated in runtime”.</p>

<p>2) Do not manually parallelize the benchmark, e.g converting it from single- to multi-threaded or offload computations to the GPU. I mean, I’m glad that you can do it and I will be happy to take a look what you did, but it’s not the intent of the contest.</p>

<p>3) Using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profile-guided_optimization">PGO</a> is allowed, however you can use it only for driving you optimizations, not for the submission. So, you can check how the benchmark gets better with PGO and understand why. And then make this optimization manually. Again, the purposes is practicing and learning.</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="q7-how-should-the-submission-look-like">Q7: <em>How should the submission look like?</em></h4>

<p><strong>A7</strong>: 1) I will not accept binaries for security reasons.</p>

<p>2) You can send patch files that I can apply to the sources of the benchmark or just assembly listing. If you did multiple optimizations please split them in separate patches. <code>git format-patch</code> is the right tool for that. This will save me a lot of time.</p>

<p>3) If you send assembly listing files please do also include diff file from the baseline (what you changed in the assembly). If you provide modified assembly listings it should be genearted only with open-sourced C/C++ compilers like gcc and clang. You can of course cheat and generate assembly with some other compiler that is better for the benchmark, but I will probably easily detect that. And it’s not about tricking, it’s about learning.</p>

<p>4) Make sure you specify clearly the compiler options if they are different from the baseline.</p>

<p>5) If you are capable of hacking compiler that’s also acceptable. You can send me patches for gcc/llvm compilers which I can apply and use for building the benchmark. Please use the top of tree revisions because it will be easier for me to apply them. We can then use it for improving our open source compilers. Also it would be very nice if you can send me textual description of all the optimizations you made.</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="q8-how-i-will-test-your-solutions">Q8: <em>How I will test your solutions?</em></h4>

<p><strong>A8</strong>: I will take your sources, build them on my machine and run the benchmark. I will run your binary multiple times (depends on the running time) and <a href="http://blog.kevmod.com/2016/06/benchmarking-minimum-vs-average/">take the minimum</a>. I’m thinking about testing all the solutions on some cloud machine, but that’s not settled yet.</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="q9-how-i-will-select-the-winner">Q9: <em>How I will select the winner?</em></h4>

<p><strong>A9</strong>: I will calculate your score as a ratio between execution time of the binary with your optimizations and the baseline.</p>

<hr>
<p>I know there is a lot more concerns you might have. This is just a first attempt with focus on learning how to do HW optimizations. In the end I don’t have real prizes to give out. :) After each contest I will share all the findings people did, so there is a big opportunity to learn from others! I know that a number of really experienced guys read this blog, so I encourage everyone to participate. Everyone is welcome!</p>

<p>All communication (including sending benchmarks and score submissions) will happen through emails, so <strong>make sure to subscribe</strong> using the form at the bottom of the page! I am planning to start first contest in the end of February 2019.</p>

<p>Let me know what you think about it or if you have any ideas or comments. You can also vote if you like it using the buttons below.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-get-started">How to get started?</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Collect the baseline (use <code>time</code> or analogs).</li>
  <li>Find the hotspot (use <code>perf record</code>).</li>
  <li>Find performance headroom
    <ul>
      <li>Take a look at the assembly and try to guess how you can do better.</li>
      <li>Run through <a href="https://easyperf.net/blog/2019/02/09/Top-Down-performance-analysis-methodology">TMAM</a> process.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Build the benchmark, run it and compare against baseline.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="hints">Hints</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Do not try to understand the whole benchmark. For some people (including me) it’s crucial to understand how every peace of code works. For the purposes of optimizing it will be wasted effort. There are CPU benchmarks with thousands LOC (like <a href="http://spec.org/cpu2017/">SPEC2017</a>) it’s absoultely impossible to understand them in a reasonable time. What you need to familiarize yourself with are hotspots. That’s it. You most likely need to understand one function/loop which is not more than 100 LOC.</li>
  <li>You have specific workload for which you optimize the benchmark. You don’t need to optimize it for any other input/workload. The main principle behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-oriented_design">Data-oriented design</a> is that you know the data of your application.</li>
</ul>
