                <div><p><em>Following this guide, you only need to change a single line of code to train an <a href="https://models.roboflow.ai/object-detection">object detection model</a> on your own dataset.</em></p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/01/chess-detection-longer.gif" alt=""><figcaption>In our guided example, we'll train a model to recognize chess pieces. (Full <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLispu-Yb_0">video</a>)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Note</strong>: <a href="https://models.roboflow.ai/object-detection/yolov5">YOLOv5</a> was released recently. You may also want to consider visiting our post on <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/training-yolov4-on-a-custom-dataset/">how to train YOLO v5 in PyTorch tutorial</a> as it gets much better results than YOLO v3.</p><p><a href="https://models.roboflow.ai/object-detection">Object detection models</a> are extremely powerful—from finding dogs in photos to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.05747.pdf">improving healthcare</a>, training computers to recognize which pixels constitute items unlocks near limitless potential. However, one of the biggest blockers keeping new applications from being built is adapting state-of-the-art, open source, and free resources to solve custom problems.</p><p>In this post, we’ll walk through how to prepare a custom dataset for object detection using tools that simplify image management, architecture, and training. In each section, we’ll first follow what I’ve done for a specific example and and then detail what modifications you’ll need to make for your custom dataset. My recommendation is that you follow along step-by-step to duplicate my process before adapting these steps to your problem.</p><p>Let’s start with a clear description of our process.</p><p>Any given machine learning problem begins with a well-formed problem statement, data collection and preparation, model training and improvement, and inference. Often, our process is not strictly linear. For instance, we may find our model performs very poorly on one type of image label, and we need to revisit collecting more data on that example.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/01/data-process.png" alt=""><figcaption><em>The general machine learning workflow.</em></figcaption></figure><hr><h2 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h2><p>Chess is a fun game of wit and strategy. Improving your playing ability requires understanding where you’ve previously made notable mistakes and what move(s) a superior player to you may have made in the same situation. </p><p>Thus, having a system that recognizes the state of the game and records each move would be valuable. This requires not just determining what a given chess piece is, but where that piece is on the board—a leap from image recognition to object detection. For the purposes of this post, we will constrain the problem to focus on the object detection portion: <u>can we train a model to identify which chess piece is which and to which player (black or white) the pieces belong, and a model that finds at least half of the pieces in inference.</u></p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/01/computer-vision-problems-1.png" alt=""><figcaption><em>Image Processing Problems, adapted from Stanford’s CS231N course</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>For your non-chess problem statement</em>, consider constraining the problem space to a specific piece. Moreover, consider the minimal acceptable criteria for the model’s performance. (In this example, we are constraining to just the identification of correct bounding boxes, and setting a relatively low bar for acceptable criteria. To be more rigorous, we may want to identify our model’s <a href="https://giou.stanford.edu/">IOU</a> or <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/what-is-mean-average-precision-object-detection/">mAP</a> - but that is for <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/what-is-mean-average-precision-object-detection/">a different post</a>.)</p><hr><h2 id="data-collection">Data Collection</h2><p>To identify chess pieces, we need to collect and annotate chess images.</p><p>I made a few assumptions in my data collection. First, all my images were captured from the same angle. I set up a tripod on the table near my chess board. For inference, this would require that my camera is at the same angle as the training data was captured — and not all chess players may be setting up tripods before their games. Second, I created 12 different classes: one for each of the six pieces times the two colors.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/01/IMG_0167.JPG" alt=""><figcaption>An (unlabeled) image example from our dataset.</figcaption></figure><p>Ultimately, I collected 292 images. I labeled all the pieces in each of these images, totaling 2894 <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/glossary/#:~:text=annotation">annotations</a>. This <a href="https://public.roboflow.ai/object-detection/chess-full">chess dataset</a> is publicly available on <a href="https://public.roboflow.ai/">Roboflow Public Datasets</a>. For labelling, there are many high quality, free, and <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/getting-started-with-labelimg-for-labeling-object-detection-data/">open source tools available like LabelImg</a>. I happened to use <a href="https://rectlabel.com/">RectLabel</a>, which is $3/month.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/01/rectLabel-example.png" alt=""><figcaption><em>An example image I labeled in RectLabel.</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>For your non-chess problem</em>, consider collecting images that are in-context of where your model will perform in production. This means ensuring you have a similar angles, lighting, quality, and objects in frame. The more situations your training set takes into account that your model may encounter in production, the better its performance will be. When labelling, it is best to draw bounding boxes that include the entirety of your objects, even if there’s a small amount of space between the object and the bounding box. Simply put, do not cut out any of the underlying object with your bounding boxes. If one piece blocks view (occludes) that of another, label as though you could see the full object (see the white-bishop and white-rook example above).</p><p>If you’re seeking already annotated images, consider <a href="https://public.roboflow.ai/object-detection">object detection datasets</a> on sites like <a href="https://public.roboflow.ai/">Roboflow Public Datasets</a> which hosts a variety of free, high quality datasets.</p><hr><h2 id="data-preparation">Data Preparation</h2><p>Going straight from data collection to model training leads to suboptimal results. There may be problems with the data. Even if there aren’t, <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/tag/augmentation/">applying image augmentation</a> expands your dataset and reduces overfitting.</p><p>Preparing images for object detection includes, but is not limited to:</p><ul><li>Verifying your annotations are correct (e.g. none of the annotations are out of frame in the images)</li><li><a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/exif-auto-orientation/">Ensuring the EXIF orientation of your images is correct</a> (i.e. your images are stored on disk differently than how you view them in applications, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21207411">see more</a>)</li><li><a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/you-might-be-resizing-your-images-incorrectly/">Resizing images and updating image annotations to match</a> the newly sized images</li><li>Various color corrections that may improve model performance like <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/when-to-use-grayscale-as-a-preprocessing-step/">grayscale</a> and <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/when-to-use-contrast-as-a-preprocessing-step/">contrast adjustments</a></li><li>Formatting annotations to match the requirements of your model’s inputs (e.g. generating <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/how-to-create-to-a-tfrecord-file-for-computer-vision/">TFRecords for TensorFlow</a> or a flat text file for some <a href="https://models.roboflow.ai/object-detection/yolov4">implementations of YOLO</a>).<br></li></ul><p>Similar to tabular data, cleaning and augmenting image data can improve your ultimate model’s performance more than architectural changes in your model.</p><p><a href="https://roboflow.ai/">Roboflow Organize</a> is purpose-built to seamlessly solve these challenges. In fact, Roboflow Organize cuts the code you need to write <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/eliminating-boilerplate-code-with-roboflow-to-monitor-security-footage/">roughly in half</a> while giving you access to more <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/tag/preprocessing/">preprocessing</a> and <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/tag/augmentation/">augmentation</a> options.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/01/tweet-loading-images.png" alt="Twitter Poll from Vicki Boykis (@vboykis): Learning PyTorch by doing a project.

Auto-orient is important because images are sometimes stored on disk in different orientations than the applications we use to view them. If left uncorrected, this can cause silent failures in our models (see a discussion on HackerNews <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21207411">here</a>).

This specific model is a one-shot learner, meaning each image only passes through the network once to make a prediction, which allows the architecture to be very performant, viewing up to 60 frames per second in predicting against video feeds. Fundamentally, <a href="https://models.roboflow.ai/object-detection/yolov3-keras">YOLO is a convolutional neural network (CNN)</a> that divides an image into subcomponents, and conducts convolutions on each of those subcomponents before pooling back to create a prediction. A recommended deeper dive on <a href="https://models.roboflow.ai/object-detection/yolov3-keras">YOLO</a> is available <a href="https://blog.roboflow.ai/a-thorough-breakdown-of-yolov4/">here</a>.</p><p>Now, even though we’re training our model on a custom dataset, it is still advantageous to use another already trained model’s weights as a starting point. Think of this like we want to climb a mountain as quickly as possible, and instead of starting completely from scratch in creating our own trail, we’ll start with assuming that someone else’s trail is a better faster than us randomly trying to guess twists and turns to follow.</p><p>To power our model’s computation, we’ll be using Google Colab, which provides free GPU compute resources (up to 24 hours with your browser open).</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/01/training-loss.png" alt="Google Colab Screenshot: loss over time (171/500 epochs, 15s 2s/step - loss: 75.3233, val_loss - 63.4790)"><figcaption>As validation loss drops, our model is improving.</figcaption></figure><p>In our notebook, we are predominantly doing six things:</p><ol><li>Selecting up our environment, model architecture, and pre-fit weights (someone else’s “trail”)</li><li>Loading in our data via the Roboflow code snippet shared above</li><li>Determining our model configuration, like how many epochs to train, training batch sizes, the size of our training vs test set, and our learning rate</li><li>Initiating training (...and waiting!)</li><li>Using our trained model for inference (predictions!)</li><li>(Optional bonus) Save our newly trained weights to our Google Drive so we can …</li></ol></div></div></div></div>

<p>If you want to do interesting work, a great starting point is to work on things you find interesting. Instead of trying to optimize for what you think others are likely to find interesting—chasing the market is a Sisyphean task—just keep digging deeper into what <i>you</i>&nbsp;find interesting.</p><p>That way, making your work interesting to others is simply a matter of sharing your enthusiasm. I took a geology class my freshman year of college. It’s easy to imagine how boring a class about rocks could be. But my professor <i>loved</i>&nbsp;rocks. She had contributed to the discovery of plate tectonics. She took us up into the mountains and showed us how you could decode geological layers laid bare by erosion to reveal the violence and wonder of how the Earth took shape. She could forge a path through the entire universe starting from a single grain of sand. Another professor could have taught the same curriculum to no effect. My professor’s love for the material brought it to life. She used her enthusiasm to ignite our curiosity.</p><p>But working on things you find interesting is not sufficient to make your work interesting to other people. We’ve all been bored to death by experts who speak in impenetrable acronyms or super-fans who get lost in their own rabbit holes. Their individual interest in the material may be genuine, but it isn’t contagious because they lack empathy. You (probably) wouldn’t tell a dirty joke to your grandmother in the same way you’d tell it to your best friend. Empathy is meeting people where they are so you can take them someplace new. That’s why rock stars shout out the name of the city they happen to be performing in. Despite her academic fame and scientific expertise, my geology professor didn’t get stuck in solipsistic obsession. Instead, she <i>used</i>&nbsp;her enthusiasm as a tool to inspire her students, to pry open new worlds for us. As a result, we found her work tremendously interesting.</p><p>So doing interesting work doesn’t require guessing what others might like or a benevolent hiring manager offering you your dream job. Doing interesting work requires working on things you find interesting, and then cultivating sufficient empathy to find effective ways to share your enthusiasm with the right people. Empathy is the catalyst that makes curiosity contagious. You’ll know you’re doing it right when the people you seek to reach find your work at least as interesting as you do.</p><p>*</p><p>Complement with <a href="https://www.eliotpeper.com/2020/12/quantity-is-route-to-quality-not-its.html">Quantity is a route to quality, not its opposite</a>, <a href="https://www.eliotpeper.com/2020/10/lasting-value.html">Lasting value</a>, and <a href="https://www.eliotpeper.com/2020/07/creativity-is-choice.html">Creativity is a choice.</a></p><p><b>Get new posts delivered straight to your inbox:</b></p><!--Begin MailChimp Signup Form-->

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-59">

<div>
<p>Sunday morning while I was scrolling through my Twitter feed one tweet caught my eye,</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/JavaScript?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#JavaScript</a> Challenge:</p><p>Can you make a TO-DO app within a single Tweet?

<p>The challenge was to make a todo app that fits in a single tweet, just like any other todo app, you should be able to add or remove tasks and clear the task list. I thought how hard this can get, I thought to myself this is doable just by using plain JavaScript.</p>
<p>So since I don’t have a laptop, what resulted was a whole day of torture having to code though my iPad on codepen.</p>
<h2><strong>Plain JavaScript</strong> </h2>
<p>Soon after I started using plain JavaScript it became obvious that I was not able to make it within one tweet, the DOM manipulation was taking too much characters<em>, document.createElements, document.getElements. </em></p>
<p>It was obvious that was not the right approach.</p>
<h2>Using vue</h2>
<p>Vue framework won’t require any build tools, so I don’t have to go through setting up Webpack,</p>
<p>Also I can easily create the DOM within the script tag using simple HTML. So that will save some characters for me in DOM manipulation.</p>
<p>The first version I made use the <em>method</em> option in Vue app to handle button clicks, the button click event will call the function in methods to add new tasks and clear the task list.</p>
<p>However, I was unable to reduce it to one tweet. Then I went back to in-line functions, the same methods were added to button click events inline and not within the <em>methods</em> section.</p>
<p>Also I had to change buttons to anchor tags, in order to save some characters, and I had to use emojis instead of button text to save some more characters.</p>
<p>I also had to drop few buttons like a button to add a task, and instead I had to go with pressing enter key to add a task instead.</p>
<p>So I made the final version, the JavaScript code looked like this, </p>
<p data-height="300" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="js" data-user="rukshn" data-slug-hash="qBaXmpE" data-pen-title="qBaXmpE">
<span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/rukshn/pen/qBaXmpE">
qBaXmpE</a> by Rukshan Ranatunge (<a href="https://codepen.io/rukshn">@rukshn</a>)
on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>

<p>Then I ran the code through an online JavaScript minifier and then the whole HTML though an HTML minifier, and ended up with this piece of code,</p>
<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=https://unpkg.com/<a href="https://ruky.me/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="1c6a69795c72796468">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;var x={data:()=&gt;({t:[],k:""}),template:'&lt;input @keyup.enter="t.push(k)" v-model="k"&gt;&lt;a @click="t=[]"&gt;❎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p v-for="(v,i) in t"&gt;&lt;a @click="t.splice(i,1)"&gt;🅾️&lt;/a&gt;{{v}}&lt;/p&gt;'};Vue.createApp(x).mount("body")&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>With my fingers crossed, I copied the code on to Twitter, and guess what it fits perfectly inside a single Tweet.</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=<a href="https://t.co/FY9eWOxLgZ">https://t.co/FY9eWOxLgZ</a>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;var x={data:()=&gt;({t:[],k:""}),template:'&lt;input <a href="https://twitter.com/keyup?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@keyup</a>.enter="t.push(k)" v-model="k"&gt;&lt;a <a href="https://twitter.com/Click?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@click</a>="t=[]"&gt;❎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p v-for="(v,i) in t"&gt;&lt;a <a href="https://twitter.com/Click?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@click</a>="t.splice(i,1)"&gt;🅾️&lt;/a&gt;{{v}}&lt;/p&gt;'};Vue.createApp(x).mount("body")&lt;/script&gt;</p>— Rukshan (@JustRuky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JustRuky/status/1340862545322762240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 21, 2020</a></blockquote>
<p>And here is the code in action, <a href="https://jsbin.com/venihiliha/1/edit?html,output">link</a> </p>
<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="result" data-user="rukshn" data-slug-hash="qBaXmpE" data-pen-title="qBaXmpE">
<span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/rukshn/pen/qBaXmpE">
qBaXmpE</a> by Rukshan Ranatunge (<a href="https://codepen.io/rukshn">@rukshn</a>)
on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>

<h2>What I failed to achieve </h2>
<p>The original Tweet says, that the completed tasks should have a strike through.</p>
<p>But because css was costing me too much characters I had to fall back to remove completed tasks instead, but I’m sure someone will figure a solution for that as well.</p>
<p>At the same time, I think you can save even more characters by using <a href="https://mithril.js.org/">mithril</a>, because you have short-codes for DOM elements as well, but I haven’t tried mithril in awhile.</p>
<h4>One last thing</h4>
<p>No I didn’t waste my whole Sunday on this problem, but I had to spend few hours, thinking and trying different versions. </p>
<p>I would have cut back some more time if I had a laptop. Somerimes I feel like buying an old laptop and refurbishing it and installing Ubuntu on it.</p>
<p>Sunday well spent? Absolutely yes.</p>
<h2>Best answer?</h2>
<p>One thing I love about HN is the fact that there are lot of bright minds out there. Since I posted this on HN I knew it was just a matter of time since someone figures this out.</p>
<p>I guess this is the best answer and also ticks all the boxes, well done.</p>
<pre><code> &lt;script&gt;document.write(`&lt;style&gt;:checked+*{text-decoration:line-through}#t{display:none}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;p id="t"&gt;&lt;input type="checkbox"&gt;&lt;input&gt;&lt;div id="f"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;button onclick="f.appendChild(t.cloneNode(true)).id=''"&gt;+&lt;/button&gt;&lt;button onclick="f.innerHTML=''"&gt;×&lt;/button&gt;`)&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>My daily driver is a desktop that I originally built as a Hackintosh for my wife's use. She outgrew it a year
or so ago for a new iMac, and I inherited it. Over the year, I've been using macOS less and less, and have spent
much more time on the dual-booted Windows 10 installation, especially since WSL is getting better and better
all the time. It's almost not painful to use for just about all the coding, writing, and occasional photography
or design projects I undertake.</p>
<p>Two days ago, I noticed while doing some file cleanup that there really was a terrific lot of crap that had
accumulated on the Windows drive. I'm fairly certain that this drive started out as a Windows 7 install, then
probably skipped Windows 8 and has been on Windows 10 through several Insider Ring upgrades over the years.
Anyway, I thought I'd just finish my backup and then re-install Windows to have a nice clean start. At the same
time, I figured since I wasn't really using the macOS installation that much, I'd move that one to a slower SATA
SSD and move Windows over to the <a href="https://amzn.to/2KGpd3x">Western Digital 500GB NVMe M.2 drive</a> that previously
hosted the Hackintosh boot drive.</p>
<p>Based on my recollection of the last time I'd installed/updated Windows, it seemed like a reasonable afternoon
project that should be pretty straightforward. As it turns out, the actual installation of Windows 10 is even quicker
than I had remembered, but the getting to the point where installation was possible was more than I bargained for.</p>
<p>This is a write-up because I ran into a few problems that were difficult to find great answers for, and I'm sure
there's someone else out there who will get into a similar situation. That someone is most likely to be a future
version of me…</p>

<p><strong>Windows 10 install media</strong></p>
<p>This is the easy part. I remembered having had issues in the past with the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10">Windows Media Creation Tool</a>,
and so I went out of my way to download the plain old ISO.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pro-tip: if you want to do this you need to
<a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/427223/how-to-download-a-windows-10-iso-without-the-media-creation-tool/">spoof your User-Agent</a>
if you're on Windows.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Pro-pro-tip: you probably don't need to do this. I ended up using WMCT and had no issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyway, if you want to get the ISO then you'll probably want something like <a href="https://rufus.ie/">Rufus</a> to help
you burn it into a USB thumb drive. As I mentioned above, during the course of about 15 installation attempts,
I ended up recreating the bootable media with WMCT and that's the version I ultimately successfully used. The
other failures weren't due to the ISO or Rufus, but it's probably easier to just use WMCT unless you have some
other burning reason not to.</p>
<p><strong>Hard drive prep</strong></p>
<p>I had already cleaned everything I needed off of the M.2 drive, and had reformatted it before leaving macOS.
The drive doesn't need to be in any particular state, format, or partitioning scheme - you can take care
of that in the Windows installer.</p>
<p>Some motherboards have little quirks about whether you can actually have more than one M.2 drive connected,
and if so, what other SATA ports you might lose access to, or which other PCIe slots get degraded lanes or
just stop working altogether. In my case, I'd already connected it up correctly several years ago and didn't
need to make any changes, but worth checking if you're using the M.2 drive for the first time.</p>
<p><strong>BIOS prep</strong></p>
<p>I'm going to skip all of the many, many things I tried that didn't work with BIOS settings for this, and
just make note of what I ended up finding was important. Obviously all BIOSs are different and so this won't
be an exact prescription unless you also happen to have a GIGABYTE GA-Z170X-UD5 on F21 BIOS version, but
it may be helpful nonetheless.</p>
<p><strong>CSM needs to be turned off.</strong> This is Compatibility Support Module, and it (possibly among other things) will
force the boot media into MBR mode, and not UEFI mode. You want UEFI mode unless your motherboard is somehow
so old that it's not enabled. But if that were the case you're probably not trying to install Windows 10 on it.</p>
<p>If you have CSM enabled, it's very likely that you'll see an error message like “Windows cannot be installed to this disk.
The selected disk is of the GPT partition style.”</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://ansonvandoren.com/images/the-selected-disk-is-of-the-gpt-partition-style.png#center" alt="This may mean you have CSM enabled"> <figcaption>
            <p>This may mean you have CSM enabled</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I also needed to set <strong>Secure Boot to Disabled</strong> otherwise I couldn't even get to the BIOS screen… I needed to
hard-reset the CMOS a few times before I figured this out definitively.</p>
<p>The final setting that mattered was the <strong>“Windows 8/10 Features”</strong>, which needed to be set to “Windows 8/10”.
The WHQL setting isn't needed, and the “Other OS” had been my previous setting when the boot manager was
Clover from the Hackintosh EFI partition, but didn't work with a Windows EFI boot loader.</p>
<p>I also had “Fast Boot” turned off, but I don't think it should matter either way. All these settings (in my BIOS)
were under the tab labeled “BIOS”.</p>

<p>I don't know why this is a problem. Others seem to have it as well, but not consistently. I don't know if
it's related to this being a clean install with multiple internal hard drives connected, or to something
about USB 3.x vs USB 2.0 for the installer media, or maybe something entirely different. Either way, as I made
it through the initial few steps of the Windows 10 installation, I kept running into a failure with the error
message “Windows could not prepare the computer to boot into the next phase of installation. To install Windows,
restart the installation.” Of course, restarting the installation doesn't change anything.</p>
<p>Before getting to this point, I had used the partition manager in the installer to delete all partitions from
the target NVMe drive, then chose the Unallocated Space on which to install Windows. I also tried creating
the partitions manually myself, with the same error message.</p>
<p>After much swearing both at the installer and the garbage that is the Microsoft Community Forums, I finally
found my way to a gentleman who went by <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/7a26b9f6-6f40-419f-a7bd-9fc6389899c8?sort=LastReplyDate&amp;dir=Desc&amp;tab=Threads&amp;forum=allcategories&amp;meta=&amp;status=&amp;mod=&amp;advFil=&amp;postedAfter=undefined&amp;postedBefore=undefined&amp;threadType=All&amp;page=1">RichardKay1</a> and seemed
to have not only the same exact problem as I, but also a solution that <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/windows-10-fresh-install-fails/f9614ae4-6dbd-4715-9a81-8586b16dfaf7?page=2">looked like it might have merit</a>.</p>
<p>His steps outlined on the forum were not exact, and mostly dealt with the <code>diskpart</code> utility, with which
I am not all that familiar, so I also spent some time trying to figure out how to safely use that tool
without deleting all the data on the 4 other disks that I had connected still.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pro-tip: probably safer to disconnect all the other disks you're not using for the actual install
before messing around with <code>diskpart</code>. Unless you're very careful. Or brave/stupid.
I decline to identify into which category I fell.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>WARNING: <code>diskpart</code> can seriously ruin your day. BE CAREFUL BEFORE YOU HIT ENTER. You have been warned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Mr. RichardKay1, the root cause is that the USB installer <em>actually</em> tries to install Windows
onto the same USB stick, despite me having chosen an internal drive as the target. I don't really know how
to verify this, but regardless, his solution worked.</p>

<p>This is the key takeaway to solve the “Windows could not prepare the computer to boot into the next phase
of installation”. Or it was in my case, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Reformat the target drive</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Boot into the USB installer (I assume you can do this, else you probably the target audience.).</li>
<li>Select the language, time, and keyboard type, click Next.</li>
<li>Click “Repair your computer”, then “Troubleshoot”, then “Command Prompt”.</li>
</ol>
<p>This puts you on the X: drive (temporary RAM disk with some command line utilities) and able to access
the rest of the connected drives. First step is to fully erase the target disk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: it's up to you to choose the correct disks, and make sure that erasing them is actually what you
want to do!</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>From the command prompt, type <code>diskpart</code> to start the utility. You'll get a little prompt like <code>DISKPART&gt;</code>
and not much else.</li>
<li>Type <code>list disk</code> to show all disks, and identify (by size or whatever) which is your target.</li>
</ol>

<p>WARNING: the next step will erase EVERYTHING on the disk you have selected!</p>

<ol start="7">
<li>Type <code>clean</code> to erase all partitions on this disk. If you run <code>list disk</code> again after this you should

<li>We eventually want to boot in UEFI mode, and so need the partition scheme to be GPT. Type
<code>convert gpt</code> to accomplish this.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is where I diverged a bit from the forum answer. I wanted to create a EFI partition manually so that
I could keep it big enough to later use <code>grub</code> for a dual-boot Linux install, and also to get the EFI partition
in the right spot on the disk so when I collapsed partitions later I wouldn't leave a gap.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Create an EFI partition with <code>create partition EFI size=500</code> (size is in MB).</li>
<li>Format the EFI partition to FAT32 (important) with <code>format FS=FAT32 label=System</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that EFI was ready to go, I wanted to create a ~10GB partition to hold the install media that was currently
on the USB thumb drive. The process is similar to creating the EFI partition except that it's a ‘primary’ partition
and formatted as NTFS:</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>Create installer partition with <code>create partition primary size=10000</code>.</li>
<li>Format installer partition with <code>format quick FS=NTFS label=Installer</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Next, I needed to access files on both the installer USB and also on the new internal partition. To do that
I needed to assign a drive letter.</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>To see what letters are assigned, type <code>list volume</code></li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cmd">DISKPART<span></span>&gt; list volume

December 20, 2020 | https://www.boringcactus.com/2020/08/21/survey-of-rust-gui-libraries.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.boringcactus.com/2020/08/21/survey-of-rust-gui-libraries.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <p>a popular trend in the Rust community is to ask "Are We X Yet" for various things that it would be nice to be able to develop easily in Rust - <a href="https://arewegameyet.rs/">game</a> and <a href="https://www.arewewebyet.org/">web</a> are the most prominent ones as far as i can tell - and one such question is <a href="https://areweguiyet.com/">Are We GUI Yet</a>.
that's a good question; <em>are</em> we GUI yet?
Are We GUI Yet has a list of libraries for building GUIs: let's go through them in alphabetical order and see if we can build a simple to-do list with them without too much struggle.</p>
<p>some notes before we get started.</p>
<ol>
<li>this is all extremely subjective.</li>
<li>the only ui toolkits i have used and not hated are Swing (i know), Electron (<em>i know</em>), and wxWidgets, which doesn't have Rust bindings because Rust bindings to C++ libraries are generously described as a nuisance to create (i've tried, and i'm writing this post instead of trying harder).
as such, i might be using some of these wrong, who knows.</li>
<li>i use windows, and so anything that's a nuisance to set up on windows is not going to fare well regardless of how cool it is once you get it working.
it could be the best thing since sliced bread or Meteor on release and i wouldn't care.
do not @ me.</li>
<li>the people who wrote these libraries have done more than i have to make the rust gui ecosystem not suck, and i don't want any of this to come across as suggesting that they suck and their work is bad.
the strongest thing i want to say is that a library is not designed in a way that i would want it to be designed, or that it doesn't work for me.
doing this shit at all is really goddamn difficult, and i don't want to minimize that by being unhappy with the results.</li>
<li>i started drafting this post in early July 2020, and finished it in late August 2020.
some things may have changed in the meantime while i wasn't paying attention.</li>
</ol>
<h2>azul</h2>
<p>first on our list is <a href="https://azul.rs/">azul</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A free, functional, immediate-mode GUI framework for rapid development of desktop applications written in Rust, supported by the Mozilla WebRender rendering engine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the wiki says we need cmake installed, which is never a good sign, but conveniently, i've already got that set up on my computer, for reasons i forget but probably didn't enjoy.
the runtime dependencies on linux are a mile long, but fortunately i don't have to care.
azul isn't currently available on crates.io for reasons that presumably exist but are difficult to explain, so we have to add it directly as a git dependency.</p>
<p>once we've got it added as a dependency, we can attempt to run our test crate, just to make sure everything's not on fire. unfortunately:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>error: failed to run custom build command for `servo-freetype-sys v4.0.5`

Caused by:
  process didn't exit successfully: `D:\Melody\Projects\we-are-not-gui-yet\target\debug\build\servo-freetype-sys-1fae054761ff82c5\build-script-build` (exit code: 101)
--- stdout
running: "cmake" &lt;snip&gt;

--- stderr
CMake Error: Could not create named generator Visual Studio 16 2019
</pre></div>
<p>this is an inauspicious beginning.
one version history crawl later and it looks like my cmake is from April 2019, which is not all that old but maybe they hadn't caught up on the latest visual studio yet, who knows.
this is already more work than i was prepared to do, but i've come this far, so it's time to update my cmake.</p>
<p>okay one installer later and it's time to try again.
armed with a cmake from May 2020, let's give this another shot:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>error[E0433]: failed to resolve: could not find `IoReader` in `bincode`
   --&gt; C:\Users\Melody\.cargo\registry\src\github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823\webrender_api-0.60.0\src\display_list.rs:270:35
    |
270 |             let reader = bincode::IoReader::new(UnsafeReader::new(&amp;mut self.data));
    |                                   ^^^^^^^^ could not find `IoReader` in `bincode`
</pre></div>
<p>welp.
the cmake update fixed things, i guess, but now we've got a whole other pile of mess.
this might be fixable, it may have been fixed by the time you read this.
regardless, this library does not work for me.</p>
<h2>conrod</h2>
<p>next up is <a href="https://github.com/pistondevelopers/conrod">conrod</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An easy-to-use, 2D GUI library written entirely in Rust.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>i've actually used this one before in a couple of projects, but it's been a minute, so i forget the details.</p>
<p>they do not have a real tutorial, which is unfortunate, but they do have some examples.
unfortunately, step one is to pick which of the half dozen backends i want.
do i want glium or vulkano or rendy or piston?
do i look like i know what a vulkano is?
i just want a picture of a <a href="https://youtu.be/EvKTOHVGNbg">god dang hot dog</a>.
okay that's not quite fair, i recognize three of those and can infer from context what the fourth one is, but that's only because i've been down this road before, and i still have no clue which one is the right one to pick.
all the examples live under glium, though, so let's go with that.</p>
<p>wait actually i'm staring at these examples and there's an entire ass event loop in the support code for the examples.
something in here mentions a <code>GliumDisplayWinitWrapper</code> and i'm scared.
i have literally used this library before - on two different projects - and i'm at a loss.
i don't want to just copy and paste the examples without actually understanding what's going on, i can't understand what's going on in the examples, and there's nowhere else to get started.
so there goes that i guess.</p>
<h2>core-foundation</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Bindings to Core Foundation for macOS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>oh hey, it's an OS i don't have access to at all.
next.</p>
<h2>druid</h2>
<p>our next contender is <a href="https://linebender.org/druid/">druid</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Druid is a framework for building simple graphical applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>apparently this sprung out of that vi-like text editor a couple googlers were working on, so apparently it's at least possible to use it for real software.
there's a tutorial, they're on crates.io, they're describing it as "conceptually simple and largely non-magical" which i am always a fan of, i am cautiously optimistic.
if we throw it in our dependencies and just see if anything breaks, we find the surprising result that everything just works.</p>
<p>oh hey the first real chapter in the tutorial starts with</p>
<blockquote>
<p>this is outdated, and should be replaced with a walkthrough of getting a simple app built and running.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>you love to see it.
fortunately, we can just ignore that and skip to the hello world example, reproduced here in its entirety:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>druid</span>::<span>{</span><span>AppLauncher</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>WindowDesc</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Widget</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>PlatformError</span><span>};</span><span></span>
<span>use</span><span> </span><span>druid</span>::<span>widget</span>::<span>Label</span><span>;</span><span></span>

<span>fn</span> <span>build_ui</span><span>()</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>impl</span><span> </span><span>Widget</span><span>&lt;</span><span>()</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>Label</span>::<span>new</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello world"</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(),</span><span> </span><span>PlatformError</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>AppLauncher</span>::<span>with_window</span><span>(</span><span>WindowDesc</span>::<span>new</span><span>(</span><span>build_ui</span><span>)).</span><span>launch</span><span>(())</span><span>?</span><span>;</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>Ok</span><span>(())</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>and somehow, this actually works.</p>
<p>the tutorial ends here, which is unfortunate, but there's more documentation, including explanations of core concepts with examples that are... todo lists!
with even more features than what i was planning to include here!
so that's convenient.
the UI hierarchy is based on CSS Flexbox, which i also appreciate.
this is what peak UI layout API looks like:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>fn</span> <span>build_new_todo</span><span>()</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>impl</span><span> </span><span>Widget</span><span>&lt;</span><span>TodoState</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>textbox</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>TextBox</span>::<span>new</span><span>()</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>.</span><span>with_placeholder</span><span>(</span><span>"New todo"</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>.</span><span>lens</span><span>(</span><span>TodoState</span>::<span>next_todo</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>button</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Button</span>::<span>new</span><span>(</span><span>"Add"</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>.</span><span>on_click</span><span>(</span><span>|</span><span>_</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>data</span>: <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>TodoState</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>_</span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>create_todo</span><span>());</span><span></span>

<span>    </span><span>Flex</span>::<span>row</span><span>()</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>.</span><span>with_flex_child</span><span>(</span><span>textbox</span><span>.</span><span>expand_width</span><span>(),</span><span> </span><span>1.0</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>.</span><span>with_child</span><span>(</span><span>button</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>1 hour and 80 lines of code later, we've got ourselves a perfectly valid and working todo list!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.boringcactus.com/assets/2020-08-21-survey-of-rust-gui-libraries-1.png" alt="our sample druid application, showing a todo list"></p>
<p>i'm not quite happy with this, though: we can type text and hit the button and it adds the todo, but pressing enter in the text field doesn't do anything.
there's no way out-of-the-box to make that happen; let's see if we can build that ourselves.</p>
<p>~30 lines of code later, we've got it!
the <code>Controller</code> trait is designed for exactly this sort of thing, when you need to wrap the behavior of an existing component and intercept some events to inject your own logic.</p>
<p>if you're curious, you can take a look at <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~boringcactus/survey-of-rust-gui-libraries/tree/main/druid-test">the source for our druid example</a>.</p>
<p>so apparently druid is actually pretty darn usable.
i only have a couple tiny issues with it:</p>
<ol>
<li>it doesn't use platform native UI widgets, so it doesn't look quite like a windows app should, and it won't look quite like a mac or linux app should either if i test it there.
this one is a feature as far as some people are concerned, but i am not on that list.</li>
<li>accessibility features like being able to tab between UI widgets (<em>update 2020-12-14</em>: and also literally any screen reader support) are missing, so you'd have to roll those yourself in a real application.
 maybe they'll add that by default in future versions, maybe not, but it would be neat if it existed.</li>
<li>high-level documentation is incomplete.
the individual struct/function docs are really good, but at a high level you don't really have a convenient place to jump in.</li>
</ol>
<p>i was about to add "no support for web" to that list, but even though the high-level docs don't mention it, the crate root docs and the examples do.
on the plus side, it just works, and i didn't have to make any changes to my code because i use <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack/pull/736">this patch to wasm-pack that lets you just use binary crates in wasm-pack</a> even though it hasn't been merged yet upstream.
on the minus side, it points everything at a <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> tag, which means you get none of the accessibility features of actually using the DOM.
so that one's a mixed bag.</p>
<p>but yeah, overall druid is perfectly usable for gui development.
i was originally calling this post "we are not gui yet" but i guess we are at least a little bit gui already.
pleasant surprises are the best kind.</p>
<h2>fltk</h2>
<p>following up that success is <a href="https://github.com/MoAlyousef/fltk-rs">fltk</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The FLTK crate is a crossplatform lightweight gui library which can be statically linked to produce small, self-contained and fast gui applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>cross-platform and statically linked are both good things.
the upstream FLTK website makes my eyes bleed, which is never a good sign for a UI library, but that doesn't mean much one way or the other.
the simple hello world example is once again a mere handful of lines:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>fltk</span>::<span>{</span><span>app</span>::<span>*</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>window</span>::<span>*</span><span>};</span><span></span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>app</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>App</span>::<span>default</span><span>();</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>wind</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Window</span>::<span>new</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>100</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>400</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>3…</span></pre></div></div></div>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>It’s that time of year again where I’m fiddling around with Z3Py. I’m booting it back up because I’m scheduled to do a <a href="https://fmie2021.github.io/agenda.html">tutorial on Z3</a> on Feb 3. It’s kind of silly because I probably already have too much content, and the tutorial is aimed at newbies, but there are some fun new things that I’ve learned in the last year I can do in Z3. As one example, it’s not so hard to build a pretty reasonable simulacrum of TLA+ in Z3.</p>

<p><a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html">TLA+</a> is a modelling/specification language for computational processes. It is particularly useful for modeling concurrency, where our intuitions fail us <a href="http://deadlockempire.github.io/">http://deadlockempire.github.io/</a>. It’s the mind child of Leslie Lamport, the same guy behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTex</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)">Paxos</a>. The language doesn’t aim for deep verification of your actual code as is sometimes the goal with tools like Coq, but because of that it is significantly more lightweight and easy to use. 
The <a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/toolbox.html">TLA+ Toolbox</a> is a freely available IDE and checker to TLA+, but I think it is kind of a neat idea to replicate something in the flavor of TLA+ in all too familiar python. By leveraging Z3, we can get a lot of logical mileage and solver power for free.</p>

<p><a href="https://rise4fun.com/z3/tutorial">Z3</a> is an SMT solver. Its input language <a href="http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/examples.shtml">smtlib2</a> is a kind of typed first order logic with special support for things like booleans, integers, reals, bitvectors, and algebraic datatypes. You can ask Z3 if propositions are valid, or if not it can provide a counterexample. It works pretty crazy good, especially if you work around its weaknesses (mostly quantifiers and nasty nonlinear stuff). Z3 has top class performance and its <a href="https://z3prover.github.io/api/html/namespacez3py.html">python bindings</a> are widely regarded as very good.</p>

<p>The main unusual things TLA brings into play compared to bog standard logics is the primed variables \(x'\), representing the values of variables at the next time step, and some temporal operators like always \(\Box\) and eventually \(\Diamond\).</p>

<p>We could mark primes by creating variables in pairs</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>z3</span> <span>import</span> <span>*</span>
<span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>xnxt</span> <span>=</span> <span>Ints</span><span>(</span><span>"x x'"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But I’ve chosen to mark the prime variables using a special uninterpreted function, which we strip out later.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>nxt</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>):</span> <span># next is a special function for generators in python, so we shouldn't use that name
</span>    <span>assert</span> <span>is_const</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>f</span><span>.</span><span>decl</span><span>().</span><span>kind</span><span>()</span> <span>==</span> <span>Z3_OP_UNINTERPRETED</span><span>:</span>
    <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>sort</span><span>()</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>Function</span><span>(</span><span>"nxt"</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>)(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One breakage here as compared to with TLA+ is the use of types. TLA+ curiously insists on a lack of intrinsic types and argues against them as a foundational feature. Types are instead propositions that are proved in the system. This just is really not convenient for using with Z3, so from the get-go I’m going to take liberties.</p>

<p>We can implement an <code>always</code> operator via a fairly simple procedure, we just roll out the execution of any formula for <code>n</code> time steps. This is the trick of bounded model checking. This rollout can be achieved by using the Z3 <code>substitute</code> function, a surprisingly useful little fellow.</p>

<p>You do have to be careful with using always. Arbitrarily nesting it’s usage may give unexpected results. Lamport makes an argument that specs very rarely do or should make sophisticated use of the temporal operators. Maybe this is good enough or maybe there is a way to patch this up.</p>

<p>Z3 does in fact return a counter model that fills the buckets up as desired.</p>

<p>TLA+ has a tendency to use functions/records which are not so obvious how to encode. There are different ways of going about this. One aspect of playing around with Z3py is that it makes extremely clear the existence of the logic language and a metalanguage. The logic is Z3 expressions, but the metalanguage is python and they are obviously very different. But there is often a choice of whether to encode things in the logic vs the metalanguage. It is usually better I think to encode as much in python as possible if you can get away with it. Z3 likes piles of simple constraints more than it likes complicated quantifiers and things.</p>

<p>For example, we can want to encode an Enum type in python or in Z3.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>enum</span> <span>import</span> <span>Enum</span><span>,</span> <span>auto</span>
<span>#python enum
</span><span>class</span> <span>RMState</span><span>(</span><span>Enum</span><span>):</span>
     <span>WORKING</span> <span>=</span> <span>auto</span><span>()</span>
     <span>PREPARED</span> <span>=</span> <span>auto</span><span>()</span>
     <span>COMMITTED</span> <span>=</span> <span>auto</span><span>()</span>
     <span>ABORTED</span> <span>=</span> <span>auto</span><span>()</span>

<span># z3 enum
</span><span>RMState</span> <span>=</span> <span>Datatype</span><span>(</span><span>"RMState"</span><span>)</span>
<span>RMState</span><span>.</span><span>declare</span><span>(</span><span>"working"</span><span>)</span>

<span>RMState</span> <span>=</span> <span>RMState</span><span>.</span><span>create</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or we can choose to encode records in Z3 vs python.</p>

<p>Downsides:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Very ad hoc. The use of special autogenerated names is a great way to inadvertently smash things together</li>
  <li>TLA syntax is designed to be readable. The python adds a lot of noise</li>
  <li>TLA toolbox can format specs nicely using latex.</li>
  <li>TLA has a lot of thought gone into it. Making changes to it in an afternoon of thought is probably not to be trusted</li>
</ul>

<p>Upsides:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Better fits Z3, so we get good automation from the get go</li>
  <li>python is lingua franca of computing. It is comforting compared to TLA+, even if Z3py might be discomfiting.</li>
  <li>Having to download the toolbox and figure out how to use it is always going to be a slight speedbump. There is a TLA+ vscode extension now though. That might help</li>
</ul>

<p>Using Python ast parsing <a href="https://greentreesnakes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">https://greentreesnakes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html</a>, we could probably use regular simple python syntax as a PlusCal like DSL and compile it into the above Z3-TLA+ hybrid.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if the CHOOSE operator of TLA+ will be easy to implement. It kind of seems like it requires nested solves? Can it be encoded using</p>

<p>I don’t particularly understand the TLA+ module system yet and I’m not so sure how to emulate it. Python modules might be one way, or perhaps classes.</p>

<p>Although I tried to copy exactly, perhaps one shouldn’t spec in precisely the style of standard TLA+.</p>

<p>I mean, is this even up for argument?</p>

<p>One of the whitest-ass things in the world is our people’s obsession with songs at sporting events, and indeed, in large crowds. If you’re reading this and you’re from Europe, feel free to replace my references to Sweet Caroline with Seven Nation Army, same diff. That said, you can fairly reliably trigger this behavior in most cultures in most parts of the world by finding a sufficiently rowdy bar around midnight and playing <em>something</em> on the jukebox that gets folks going. Humans, we’re social creatures, yeah? A few bars of Neil Diamond, a couple people singing along, and by the time you’re at ‘Hands, touching hands’ you’ll have a swelling crescendo that culminates in a ear-shattering and atonal screech of ‘SWEEEEEEEEEEEEET CAR-O-LINE (WOAH OH OH)’ making the bartenders silently plot the murder of everyone in their line of sight.</p>
<p>People like being around people, and most people don’t treat everyone around them as some sort of incredibly delicate faberge egg. There’s a lot of “wow look at all these accomodations people are making that disabled people have asked for now that nobody is supposed to leave their house! hypocrisy, much??” and I’m like, yeah, duh? Pointing out hypocrisy is the lowest form of engagement in 2020. This is why virtual events suck – because nobody is actually planning on doing them any longer than they need to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the benefits of in-person conferences is that they temporarily remove you from your day-to-day work and immerse you in a community of like-minded individuals. It’s not just about getting to hear new ideas, but also about the break from your daily routine. This is one of the things that is hardest to replicate in a virtual event. DIDevOps was perhaps the most successful virtual conference I’ve seen in making their event feel like An Event. This event was clever and whimsical, the community was engaged, and it definitely didn’t feel like just another video call.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://redmonk.com/rstephens/2020/04/30/deserted-island-devops/">Rachel Stephens, RedMonk</a></p>
<p>I wrote earlier this year about the idea of a <a href="https://aparker.io/posts/deserted-island-devops/">decisive moment</a> and how that influenced the thinking behind Deserted Island DevOps. To elaborate a bit, Cartier-Bresson was a street photographer who coined this phrase in the introduction to his 1947 book.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Photography is the simultaneous recognition, in a fraction of a second, of the significance of an event as well as of a precise organisation of forms which give that event its proper expression.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is, then, the ‘decisive moment’ of a tech conference? My original criteria was that an event was <em>etherial</em> or placeless; From the smallest DevOpsDays to the largest re:Invent, an event is defined less by the where than by the who. As an attendee, you are swept away from the status quo for a time (even as it inorexably pulls you back in, given the amount of people I see working on laptops during events) into a convention center or hotel or theater or whatever, specifically to focus on something other than what you normally would. Quite literally, you are being moved out of your comfort zone. This can prime you to accept ideas that normally you wouldn’t, can rejigger your brain chemistry for a few hours to make you see things from a different perspective. That’s valuable! As a speaker, you’re transported to a new stage, with a new audience, a new set of eyes and ears to reflect off of. It’s almost like being a comedian and testing out material – you try some new lines, some new jokes, add an anecdote here, shave one off there. Repetition builds mastery. Next week, or next month, you’re going to do it all again. Our traversal through the liminal spaces between these potemkin stages lends itself to inward focus where we must Do The Work to shut out the world around us. To be less floral about it, the demands of the road make us better speakers because the only way we don’t go fuckin’ mad is to focus on the work.</p>
<p>Virtual events offer none of this, unfortunately. As attendees, another Slack, another Zoom call, another wave of talking heads and PowerPoint. As speakers, our audience disappears behind a chat window. We lose our reflection. It’s sad and terrible and great for some people, but on the balance I think we dislike it more than we like it.</p>
<p>The bad is part of the fun! You can’t replicate the feeling of gnawing on an underripe banana while chugging overly-hot-but-not-terribly-flavorful coffee watching someone who’s company paid way too much for a keynote while mentally ticking off the people you need to talk to that day while working out the soreness in your back from the bed that isn’t yours that you got maybe four productive sleeping hours in due to jet lag while figuring out who you’re going to catch up with after the show wraps that day as you muse about how it looks like your competitors have a much nicer booth than yours, and you wonder if they’re hiring except that one asshole still works there and so on and so forth. “That sounds terrible!” you may be musing, <em>and you’d be right</em>, but I love the terrible. I thrive in the terrible. I’m drinking single origin fair trade coffee beans that were roasted in small batches locally brewed in a fancy coffee maker and I can tell you that when this is all over and I can have a cuppa brewed in the backroom of a Hilton it is going to be the sweetest thing I can possibly imagine for five seconds right before I start hating everything about it again and <em>that’s fine</em>.</p>
<p>The bad of an in-person event is terrible, but it’s a terrible I can work with. I go outside like once or twice a week now to get groceries and that’s all I’ve done for the past nine months. <em>I want the workable terrible, not this horrific stasis</em>.</p>

<p>The reason that virtual events suck is that we’re trying to replicate in-person events. We’re doing old-school iOS skeumorphism but for primarily social gatherings. No wonder they suck! There’s a few broad reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Bad UX</em>: Sometimes I like to style on babies by displaying object permanance, but you wouldn’t know that given the utter contempt event platforms seem to have for their audiences by doing dumb skeumorphic “conference halls” with badly ‘shopped people standing around.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://aparker.io/images/kubeconlobby.png" alt="KubeCon EU ‘Lobby’"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Pervasive Surveillence</em>: I use ad blockers but a bunch of people don’t, on principle though it’s really fuckin’ creepy that every click you make on one of these event platforms is tracked. Simply navigating to a sponsor booth counts as a ‘lead’ to the sponsor. Yikes!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Poor AV Quality</em>: I get that people have to record from their homes but maybe recording someone’s Zoom isn’t the best way to do this? I’m sympathetic, this is legit a hard problem to solve, but many large conferences are still charging an arm and a leg to sponsors (and less for attendees but that’s a different point) so how about you do local recording then edit things later? If you’re going to charge me at <em>all</em> then I expect the production values to at least beat out a random Twitch streamer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Poor Viewing Experience</em>: A tiny pop-out 720p video that artifacts when I change the size is… not great. Integrate chat and Q&amp;A better. Do <em>something</em> unique with the format. I sit on enough Zoom calls. Like, why would I <em>pay money</em> to <em>watch videos</em> with a <em>worse player than YouTube</em>? There’s millions of hours of shit out there for free!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Yet Another Slack</em>: I just don’t want to join more Slack channels where people are randomly @here’ing and I never know if it’s an event organizer with an announcement or some salesperson trying to coax people into their virtual booth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Did I Mention Virtual Booths Yet</em>: I have never interacted with anyone in a Virtual Booth and I never will. This appears to be a common sentiment.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Alright, let’s flip the script. I’m wearing my business hat now.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Bad UX</em>: You think the <em>attendee</em> experience is bad, the admin/sponsor controls and views on these platforms is worse. Arbitrary requirements, poor control over look and feel, nah fam miss me with this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Poor Interactivity</em>: You know what’s great about a real booth? People wander by and they get interested. Why do they wander by? Because they’re not at home, they need to kill time, and the snacks are on the trade floor. Maybe they just want a t-shirt or whatever, fine, but we do actually get a lot of really valuable feedback and eyes on the product by doing demos. This is extremely useful, and it simply doesn’t happen at virtual events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Attendee Impedence Mismatch</em>: This is more of a theory but I suspect that the attendee mix for virtual events in terms of titles is significantly out-of-balance compared to in-person events. One popular (<em>n</em> = ~1300) virtual event this year had self-reported attendance of only 4% for management roles, but over 40% IC (developer/devops/ops) roles. My hypothesis is that “decision makers” are less likely to attend virtual events because they’re intensely overbooked during the in-person -&gt; distributed team transition period and are oversubscribed on other things, which translates into less useful direct sales conversations, but I could be off-base here. If nothing else, my anecdata from talking about this seems to indicate that attendees just don’t really go to virtual booths.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Success Looks Different</em>: This is one of those ‘two-way street’ problems, but I don’t think organizers did a great job in general making sponsors successful, and I don’t think sponsors had the muscle to make themselves successful in a lot of ways. Trying to be too different caused a lot of friction, however, and during a time of reinvention this friction reduced experimentation in my opinion.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Last part - the speaker experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>My Home Is Not Your Home</em>: One of the low key worst things about the pandemic has been the idea of us ‘opening up our homes’ and letting people see how we live. Could we fuckin’ not? Like I don’t believe that I even have to discuss this but we should probably put the Room Rater person on trial for crimes against humanity. I don’t <em>want</em> to have to be super concious about my webcam or audio or whatever, I don’t <em>want</em> to …</p></li></ul></div></div></div>

<h4>This classic article from Mario Wolczko first
appeared on Usenet in 1986.  </h4>

Have you ever left your terminal logged in, only to find when you
came back to it that a (supposed) friend had typed "<kbd>rm -rf
~/*</kbd>" and was hovering over the keyboard with threats along the
lines of "<em>lend me a fiver 'til Thursday, or I hit return</em>"?
Undoubtedly the person in question would not have had the nerve to
inflict such a trauma upon you, and was doing it in jest.  So you've
probably never experienced the worst of such disasters....<p>


It was a quiet Wednesday afternoon.  Wednesday, 1st October, 15:15
BST, to be precise, when Peter, an office-mate of mine, leaned away
from his terminal and said to me, "<em>Mario, I'm having a little
trouble sending mail.</em>" Knowing that msg was capable of confusing
even the most capable of people, I sauntered over to his terminal to
see what was wrong.  A strange error message of the form (I forget
the exact details) "<kbd>cannot access /foo/bar for userid 147</kbd>"
had been issued by msg.  My first thought was "<em>Who's userid 147?;
the sender of the message, the destination, or what?</em>" So I leant
over to another terminal, already logged in, and typed</p><blockquote>        <kbd>grep 147 /etc/passwd</kbd></blockquote>

<p>only to receive the response</p><blockquote>        <kbd>/etc/passwd: No such file or directory.</kbd></blockquote>

Instantly, I guessed that something was amiss.  This was confirmed
when in response to<blockquote>        <kbd>ls /etc</kbd></blockquote>

<p>I got</p><blockquote>        <kbd>ls: not found.</kbd></blockquote>

I suggested to Peter that it would be a good idea not to try anything
for a while, and went off to find our system manager.<p>

When I arrived at his office, his door was ajar, and within ten
seconds I realised what the problem was.  James, our manager, was
sat down, head in hands, hands between knees, as one whose world has
just come to an end.  Our newly-appointed system programmer, Neil, was
beside him, gazing listlessly at the screen of his terminal.  And at
the top of the screen I spied the following lines:</p><blockquote>
        <kbd># cd <br>
        # rm -rf *</kbd>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, shit, I thought.  That would just about explain it.</p><p>


I can't remember what happened in the succeeding minutes; my memory
is just a blur.  I do remember trying <kbd>ls</kbd> (again),
<kbd>ps</kbd>, <kbd>who</kbd> and maybe a few other commands beside,
all to no avail.  The next thing I remember was being at my terminal
again (a multi-window graphics terminal), and typing</p><blockquote>
        <kbd>cd /<br>
        echo *</kbd>
</blockquote>
<p>I owe a debt of thanks to David Korn for making <kbd>echo</kbd> a
built-in of his shell; needless to say, <kbd>/bin</kbd>, together
with <kbd>/bin/echo</kbd>, had been deleted.  What transpired in the
next few minutes was that <kbd>/dev</kbd>, <kbd>/etc</kbd> and
<kbd>/lib</kbd> had also gone in their entirety; fortunately Neil had
interrupted <kbd>rm</kbd> while it was somewhere down below
<kbd>/news</kbd>, and <kbd>/tmp</kbd>, <kbd>/usr</kbd> and
<kbd>/users</kbd> were all untouched.</p><p>


Meanwhile James had made for our tape cupboard and had retrieved what
claimed to be a dump tape of the root filesystem, taken four weeks
earlier.  The pressing question was, "<em>How do we recover the
contents of the tape?</em>".  Not only had we lost
<kbd>/etc/restore</kbd>, but all of the device entries for the tape
deck had vanished.  And where does <kbd>mknod</kbd> live?  You
guessed it, <kbd>/etc</kbd>.  How about recovery across Ethernet of
any of this from another VAX?  Well, <kbd>/bin/tar</kbd> had gone,
and thoughtfully the Berkeley people had put <kbd>rcp</kbd> in
<kbd>/bin</kbd> in the 4.3 distribution.  What's more, none of the
Ether stuff wanted to know without <kbd>/etc/hosts</kbd> at least.
We found a version of <kbd>cpio</kbd> in <kbd>/usr/local</kbd>, but
that was unlikely to do us any good without a tape deck.</p><p>


Alternatively, we could get the boot tape out and rebuild the root
filesystem, but neither James nor Neil had done that before, and we
weren't sure that the first thing to happen would be that the whole
disk would be re-formatted, losing all our user files.  (We take dumps
of the user files every Thursday; by Murphy's Law this had to happen
on a Wednesday).  Another solution might be to borrow a disk from
another VAX, boot off that, and tidy up later, but that would have
entailed calling the DEC engineer out, at the very least.  We had a
number of users in the final throes of writing up PhD theses and the
loss of a maybe a weeks' work (not to mention the machine down time)
was unthinkable.</p><p>


So, what to do?  The next idea was to write a program to make a
device descriptor for the tape deck, but we all know where
<kbd>cc</kbd>, <kbd>as</kbd> and <kbd>ld</kbd> live.  Or maybe make
skeletal entries for <kbd>/etc/passwd</kbd>, <kbd>/etc/hosts</kbd>
and so on, so that <kbd>/usr/bin/ftp</kbd> would work.  By sheer
luck, I had a <kbd>gnuemacs</kbd> still running in one of my windows,
which we could use to create <kbd>passwd</kbd>, etc., but the first
step was to create a directory to put them in.  Of course
<kbd>/bin/mkdir</kbd> had gone, and so had <kbd>/bin/mv</kbd>, so we
couldn't rename <kbd>/tmp</kbd> to <kbd>/etc</kbd>.  However, this
looked like a reasonable line of attack.</p><p>


By now we had been joined by Alasdair, our resident UNIX guru, and as
luck would have it, someone who knows VAX assembler.  So our plan
became this: write a program in assembler which would either rename
<kbd>/tmp</kbd> to <kbd>/etc</kbd>, or make <kbd>/etc</kbd>, assemble
it on another VAX, <kbd>uuencode</kbd> it, type in the uuencoded file
using my gnu, <kbd>uudecode</kbd> it (some bright spark had thought
to put <kbd>uudecode</kbd> in <kbd>/usr/bin</kbd>), run it, and hey
presto, it would all be plain sailing from there.  By yet another
miracle of good fortune, the terminal from which the damage had been
done was still <kbd>su</kbd>'d to root (<kbd>su</kbd> is in
<kbd>/bin</kbd>, remember?), so at least we stood a chance of all
this working.</p><p>


Off we set on our merry way, and within only an hour we had managed
to concoct the dozen or so lines of assembler to create
<kbd>/etc</kbd>.  The stripped binary was only 76 bytes long, so we
converted it to hex (slightly more readable than the output of
<kbd>uuencode</kbd>), and typed it in using my editor.  If any of you
ever have the same problem, here's the hex for future reference:</p><blockquote>
   <kbd>070100002c000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br>
        0000dd8fff010000dd8f27000000fb02ef07000000fb01ef070000000000bc8f<br>
		8800040000bc012f65746300</kbd>
</blockquote>

<p>

I had a handy program around (doesn't everybody?) for converting
ASCII hex to binary, and the output of <kbd>/usr/bin/sum</kbd>
tallied with our original binary.  But hang on---how do you set
execute permission without <kbd>/bin/chmod</kbd>?  A few seconds
thought (which as usual, lasted a couple of minutes) suggested that
we write the binary on top of an already existing binary, owned by
me...problem solved.

So along we trotted to the terminal with the root login, carefully
remembered to set the umask to 0 (so that I could create files in it
using my gnu), and ran the binary.  So now we had a <kbd>/etc</kbd>,
writable by all.  From there it was but a few easy steps to creating
<kbd>passwd</kbd>, <kbd>hosts</kbd>, <kbd>services</kbd>,
<kbd>protocols</kbd>, (etc), and then <kbd>ftp</kbd> was willing to
play ball.  Then we recovered the contents of <kbd>/bin</kbd> across
the ether (it's amazing how much you come to miss <kbd>ls</kbd> after
just a few, short hours), and selected files from <kbd>/etc</kbd>.
The key file was <kbd>/etc/rrestore</kbd>, with which we recovered
<kbd>/dev</kbd> from the dump tape, and the rest is history.</p><p>


Now, you're asking yourself (as I am), what's the moral of this
story?  Well, for one thing, you must always remember the immortal
words, <strong>DON'T PANIC</strong>.  Our initial reaction was to
reboot the machine and try everything as single user, but it's
unlikely it would have come up without <kbd>/etc/init</kbd> and
<kbd>/bin/sh</kbd>.  Rational thought saved us from this one.</p><p>


The next thing to remember is that UNIX tools really can be put to
unusual purposes.  Even without my <kbd>gnuemacs</kbd>, we could have
survived by using, say, <kbd>/usr/bin/grep</kbd> as a substitute for
<kbd>/bin/cat</kbd>.</p><p>


And the final thing is, it's amazing how much of the system you can
delete without it falling apart completely.  Apart from the fact that
nobody could login (<kbd>/bin/login</kbd>?), and most of the useful
commands had gone, everything else seemed normal.  Of course, some
things can't stand life without say <kbd>/etc/termcap</kbd>, or
<kbd>/dev/kmem</kbd>, or <kbd>/etc/utmp</kbd>, but by and large it
all hangs together.</p><p>


I shall leave you with this question: if you were placed in the same
situation, and had the presence of mind that always comes with
hindsight, could you have got out of it in a simpler or easier way?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week, <a href="https://twitter.com/EmmaBostian/status/1334435314673348609">Emma Bostian tweeted about how she was sick of “[CSS]’s shit.”</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/EmmaBostian/status/1334863522749145096">She later apologised</a>, but her wording suggests she still thinks it isn’t lack of knowledge. It’s fairly common for software engineers to complain about CSS. Interestingly enough, that portion of the web development community also thinks CSS is easy.</p>
<p>In contrast, <a href="https://twitter.com/meyerweb/status/1334862797822373889">Eric Meyer</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan/status/1334796914831855617">Sara Soueidan</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/brucel/status/1334818455275626499">Bruce Lawson</a>, and more (principal) web developers seem to agree that CSS is hard to master. It’s interesting how experts say CSS is hard, while a group of people who specialise in other technology say otherwise.</p>
<p>I feel we, the community, have to acknowledge that CSS is easy to get started with and hard to master. Let’s reflect on the language and find out what makes it hard.</p>
<h2 id="syntax-and-common-properties"><a href="#syntax-and-common-properties">#</a> Syntax And Common Properties</h2>
<p>Back in 2013, Hugo “Kitty” Giraudel published <a href="https://hugogiraudel.com/2013/04/15/css-is-easy/">CSS is Easy</a>, in which they also write about how CSS is perceived as easy. In the article, Kitty makes an excellent point: “CSS is easy… syntactically.” I wholeheartedly agree. Consider the following example:</p>
<pre><code><span>body</span> {
  <span>background-color</span>: black;
  <span>color</span>: white;
}

<span>@media</span> (<span>min-width:</span> <span>64em</span>) {
  <span>body</span> {
    <span>background-color</span>: white;
    <span>color</span>: black;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this snippet, you can see much of the syntax used in CSS. There are selectors, declarations, I even added an at-rule (<code>@media</code>). The properties and values in this example are straight-forward; they just work. The at-rule, although syntactically simple, adds some cognitive load to understanding this snippet. It creates a relationship between what’s inside and outside the at-rule. In other words, to determine what colour the <code>body</code> is, we have to parse the entire file mentally.</p>
<p>This snippet isn’t too complex, but as we get more code the number of relationships (like the at-rule) do too.</p>
<h2 id="a-web-of-relationships"><a href="#a-web-of-relationships">#</a> A Web Of Relationships</h2>
<p>Syntax and basic properties are pretty easy, indeed. However, the learning curve of CSS quickly gets steeper when you start dealing with various relationships. Let’s look at some.</p>
<h3 id="property-sets"><a href="#property-sets">#</a> Property Sets</h3>
<p>Many properties are part of a set, meaning you may need several others to make one work. For instance, the <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>, <code>top</code>, <code>bottom</code>, and the <code>z-index</code> properties are ignored until you add the <code>position</code> property and set it to anything but <code>static</code>. That means that you have to learn a couple of properties of a set and how they relate to each other before being able to use one. If you’re unaware which properties rely on others, it can be extremely frustrating because it may appear that a declaration just doesn’t work.</p>
<p>Additionally, it’s not always obvious which pieces of the set are declared. Consider the following example:</p>
<pre><code><span>.snackbar</span> {
  <span>position</span>: fixed;
  <span>bottom</span>: <span>1rem</span>;
  <span>left</span>: <span>1rem</span>;
  <span>right</span>: <span>1rem</span>;
}

<span>@media</span> (<span>min-width:</span> <span>64em</span>) {
  <span>.snackbar</span> {
    <span>bottom</span>: <span>2rem</span>;
    <span>left</span>: <span>2rem</span>;
    <span>right</span>: <span>2rem</span>;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>If we look at the first rule, we can easily tell how an element with the <code>snackbar</code> class would be positioned on our page. If we look at the second rule, the one in the <code>@media</code> at-rule, we’re not so sure. We’d have to look up the <code>.snackbar</code> rule outside the at-rule. This example is fairly obvious, but it can get pretty obscure. The <code>position: fixed</code> declaration could be set elsewhere, on another selector, or inline.</p>
<h3 id="the-dom"><a href="#the-dom">#</a> The <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr></h3>
<p>We can’t determine which styles are applied just by looking at your CSS. The HTML, or rather the DOM, also affects them. We have to consider the tag name of the element, its attributes, its siblings, its parents all the way up to the root node, and all relevant styles. If you render HTML server- or client-side, all of this may be dynamic and influenced by the application state.</p>
<p>The adjacent sibling combinator (<code>+</code>) is a simple example of how HTML influences CSS. The following style is only applied when a <code>li</code> is followed by another:</p>
<pre><code><span>li</span> + <span>li</span> { <span>margin-top</span>: <span>1rem</span>; }
</code></pre>
<p>This example is quite expressive but doesn’t have to be. Another example that took me a while to get as a beginner was using <code>position: absolute</code> on an element with a parent with <code>position: relative</code>. The element with <code>position: absolute</code> is positioned relative to the viewport or relative to an ancestor element with <code>position: relative</code>. In order to place this <code>absolute</code> element correctly in the interface, we have to know whether the element sits in a container with <code>position: relative</code>. Again, we’d have to look at the DOM, and at all it’s states, to be sure this is the case.</p>
<p>A similar, perhaps more familiar, example is the <code>flex</code> property. It only works if the element is a direct child of an element with the <code>display: flex</code> declaration.</p>
<p>When we write CSS, we always have to consider the DOM.</p>
<h3 id="cascade"><a href="#cascade">#</a> Cascade</h3>
<p>Let’s say I want text and links in the <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element to be red. We might write the following CSS:</p>
<pre><code><span>nav</span> { <span>color</span>: red; }
<span>nav</span> <span>a</span> { <span>color</span>: inherit; }
</code></pre>
<p>These two simple declarations imply various relationships. The link colour is now dependent on the colour of the text. Because of that, we can set the text colour of the <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element and the link will inherit this colour. If we remove either of these two declarations, the link colour won’t be red anymore.</p>
<p>The flexibility cascade gives has its benefits, but it’s not hard to imagine that it can get difficult to track the relationships between all styles. It’s no surprise that many opt to use cascade as little as possible.</p>
<h2 id="compatibility"><a href="#compatibility">#</a> Compatibility</h2>
<p>Designing an interface with CSS that doesn’t break is no easy task. There are numerous devices, browsers, resolutions, and users we have to take into account. We can also account for device settings, like dark mode using <code>prefers-color-scheme: dark/light</code>. On top of that, there are often various conditions in the interface that affect the styling as well.</p>
<p>Every combination of all these states and overrides have to be taken into account to produce the right output style. Again, this is no easy feat. It often involves a lot of tools and testing during and after development.</p>
<h2 id="maintainability"><a href="#maintainability">#</a> Maintainability</h2>
<p>Like all other code, CSS should be clean, readable, and maintainable. We can group styles into various files, or prefix selectors, but all rules live globally. This is a challenge, but also greatly contributes to keeping the code <abbr title="Don’t Repeat Yourself">DRY</abbr>.</p>
<p>I earlier explained various types of relationships in CSS. They play a part in maintainability as well. Some of the methodologies used in CSS — like atomic design, <abbr title="Block Element Modifier">BEM</abbr>, <abbr title="Inverted Triangle CSS">ITCSS</abbr>, and others — help to keep the coupling in check. They’re similar to paradigms and best practises in programming, and also steepen the learning curve and requires additional knowledge.</p>
<p>Then there are also preprocessors. We have a lot of them (e.g. PostCSS, Sass, LESS, and Stylus) at our disposal to do things we can’t do with vanilla CSS. This usually improves maintainability but does add another layer of complexity.</p>
<p>Finally, not unlike other languages, there often are various solutions to one problem. A common example is deciding between <code>display: inline-block</code>, the <code>float</code> property, flexbox, or grid to horizontally stack a list of items. Each has its pros and cons. When mentoring beginners, I found this is a challenge for them. It’s also difficult to convey the differences of these options — that are often subtle — and which is the most robust in a given situation.</p>
<p>All together, maintainability in CSS is a tradeoff. The code gets more complex syntactically and bound by self-imposed rules, but (hopefully) reduces the effort it takes to understand and modify the code.</p>
<h2 id="concluding"><a href="#concluding">#</a> Concluding</h2>
<p>CSS may seem simple at first, but the learning curve isn’t linear; mastering it is hard. By no means is the language perfect, but it’s amazingly efficient at what it’s designed to do. Despite its simple syntax, there’s little it can’t do.</p>
<p>I think mastering CSS comes down to having a good amount of knowledge about it, recognising the subtle dependencies between different declarations, rules, and the DOM, understanding how they make your CSS complex, and how to best avoid them. Reaching that point is naturally frustrating because you will run into code that is a tangled mess where the tiniest edit might change the interface in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>I worry that the way we think about CSS might affect how beginners perceive the language. If they are taught that CSS is easy, they might be discouraged from seeking help when they struggle or just blame the language. Admitting you struggle with something is difficult enough. Let’s not make it worse for them.</p>
<p>I feel it’s better if we acknowledge the complexity of writing CSS. We might also stop looking down on CSS specialists. Today, they’re often considered half a developer, whilst (JavaScript) software engineers (or UI engineers, or whatever they’re called nowadays) that know little about the complexities of CSS are considered full-fledged front-end developers. We see this on social media, in job openings, and in pay.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> See the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25491568">Hacker News thread</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/kh6ox0/cakelisp_a_programming_language_for_games/">/r/programming</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/kh6gh2/cakelisp_a_programming_language_for_games/">/r/ProgrammingLanguages</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/kh1p0a/cakelisp_a_programming_language_for_games/">/r/gamedev</a> posts for discussions on this article and Cakelisp.</p>
<p>I have been working on a new programming language since the end of August 2020. It is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/makuto/cakelisp/">Github</a>, and mirrored on <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/cakelisp/">my site</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to see a working example first, <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/gamelib/src/branch/master/test/src/VocalGame.cake">VocalGame.cake</a> is a simple audio looper with Ogre 3D graphics and SDL for windowing, input, and audio. This demo supports code hot-reloading and doesn't require an external build system, only Cakelisp. You can also check <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/cakelisp/src/branch/master/runtime/Macros.cake">Macros.cake</a>, which demonstrates some use-cases for compile-time code.</p>
<p>I figured showing non-trivial examples would be much more interesting. It also proves that Cakelisp is working.</p>

<p>Cakelisp is built for me first, but it should appeal to fellow programmers who know what they're doing and want to try a more powerful language.</p>
<p>Cakelisp might be for you if you want…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Uncompromised performance</strong></li>
<li><strong>Trust in you, the programmer</strong></li>
<li><strong>Powerful code generation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If any of the things in that list don't make sense to you, or you think you're already getting them in language <em>X</em>, then Cakelisp isn't for you, and that's okay! We have different domains and different problems, so it makes some sense to use different languages and methodologies.</p>
<p>While many languages have these features, few have the combination of all three. Lisp has extremely powerful code generation, but makes serious performance compromises. C is great for performance but can require extremely repetitive code writing to accomplish tasks a simple code generator could handle. Rust is fast (well, apart from compilation, which is very important for iterative development to be productive), but doesn't trust the programmer.</p>

<p>My goal is to "have my cake and eat it too", meaning all three of these features in one coherent package. Importantly, there isn't one dominating principle in Cakelisp (no <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH9VCN6UkyQ">Big Idea</a>). I've found that the small things like removing the need for header files, no longer dealing with external build systems, or being able to run Cakelisp files like scripts, end up making a big difference when combined in one package.</p>
<p>It is useful to go over the goals in detail so you can understand my decisions.</p>
<h2 id="uncompromised-performance">Uncompromised performance</h2>
<p>This means no garbage collection, no type boxing/unboxing, etc. Fewer abstractions (besides the ones you create) between you and what the computer is actually doing. Idiomatic usage of the language should result in performance comparable with C (in most cases, it should be identical, because it's only a thin layer on C).</p>
<h2 id="trust-in-you-the-programmer">Trust in you, the programmer</h2>
<p>While languages like Rust offer benefits in terms of security and stability, they cost programmers in terms of productivity. It makes sense to value safety so highly if your code is safety-critical (operating systems, aerospace, automotive, etc.), but it's much less valuable when safety isn't as important (e.g. in games).</p>
<p>In a perfect world all programs would be as robust as space flight software, but in reality, that level of robustness is unnecessary for most programs. It's important to realize that the safety focus is just one way of doing things, not the <em>One True Way</em> or anything.</p>
<h2 id="powerful-code-generation">Powerful code generation</h2>
<p>In my opinion, most languages offer far too little opportunity for the programmer to automate the actual writing of code. This power also relates to trusting in the programmer, because gone wild, the code can become incomprehensible.</p>
<p>The company I work for has what I consider to be a state-of-the-art code generator built for the company's use-case: multi-platform MMOs. It's used very effectively on serialization, RPC, automatic commands, monitoring, automatic documentation, and more.</p>
<p>To give more credence to the use of code generation in games, <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/ProgrammingAndScripting/GameplayArchitecture/index.html">Unreal</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiJqUWfR90I">Naughty Dog</a> also rely on code generation.</p>
<h2 id="simplify-project-setup-and-management">Simplify project setup and management</h2>
<p>I want to dramatically reduce time wasted on C++ project set-up and "code logistics". This includes setting up build systems, creating header files, adding and managing new C/C++ 3rd party libraries, and other things of that ilk.</p>
<h2 id="gain-more-power">Gain more power!</h2>
<p>Every language has limitations. The lack of straightforward, all-powerful code generation was my primary gripe with C++.</p>
<p>For example, automatically creating function and structure bindings using C++ template metaprogramming is very complex. These are two very useful tools in game development: function bindings for commands, scripting languages, and RPC; structure bindings for serialization or game monitors.</p>
<p>I also wanted features like hot-reloading (being able to load new versions of the code without restarting the program/losing runtime state). Cakelisp made it possible to implement hot-reloading entirely in "user-space", thanks to code modification.</p>
<h2 id="have-my-cake-and-eat-it-too.">"Have my cake and eat it too."</h2>
<p>By this I mean lose little-to-nothing on metrics I care about, which include build time, runtime performance, overall complexity, and various other things. I looked into several languages in my <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/LanguageTests">LanguageTests</a> experiment and found they all had major drawbacks I couldn't accept.</p>
<h2 id="unexpected-freedom">Unexpected freedom</h2>
<p>I did not realize when I started Cakelisp how freeing it felt. All of the sudden, I got to decide what made sense to <em>me</em>, not what made sense to previous language designers.</p>
<h3 id="freedom-in-syntax">Freedom in syntax</h3>
<p>A simple example is type declarations. In C:</p>

<p>The same variable, in Cakelisp:</p>

<p>In my opinion C type declarations are much harder to parse than my explicit type declarations. You need to work backwards from the name to properly interpret the type. The parentheses do add more typing, but they're more clear, machine-parseable, and can be read naturally (e.g. read left to right "pointer to constant character" vs. C's "constant character pointer", which seems worse in my mind).</p>
<p>My form also handles arrays as part of the type: <code>(var my-array ([] 5 int))</code> rather than <code>int myArray[5];</code>, another way it is more consistent, readable, and parsable.</p>
<p>I chose to swap the order of name and type because it places more emphasis on the name. A well-written program will convey more useful information in the name than in the type, so it makes sense to me to have it come first for the reader.</p>
<h3 id="freedom-in-process">Freedom in process</h3>
<p>I also found that having an executable which preprocesses my code exactly how I want it opens the door to a huge amount of awesome features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compile-time code execution. "Macros" and "Generators" are defined in-line with the rest of your code, making them feel like a natural part of your code. Defining them in-line makes it acceptable to add one-off macros, whereas adding such a thing to an external code generator would quickly become unmaintainable</li>
<li>Build optimization. A recent idea I discovered is automatically creating precompiled headers for large batches of 3rd-party headers. This would be a complex task that would need to be integrated in whatever build system you use, whereas Cakelisp can have it built-in</li>
<li>Other data processing. Compile-time code execution means you can do things like prepare assets, download 3rd-party code, run tests, etc. without having to set up all these additional tools</li>
</ul>

<p>I was inspired by Naughty Dog's use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Oriented_Assembly_Lisp">Game Oriented Assembly Lisp</a>, GOOL, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSmqbnhHp1c">Racket/Scheme</a> (on their modern titles). I've also taken several ideas from Jonathan Blow's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jblow888">talks on Jai</a>.</p>
<p>I'm a software engineer in the game industry. I've been working since July 2015 at a studio that makes cross-platform MMOs. The company has a custom engine written in C (with some C++).</p>
<p>I <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/LanguageTests">experimented</a> with other languages before deciding I needed to write my own.</p>

<p>Now that my goals are clear, I will show you how I approached achieving them.</p>
<h2 id="notation">Notation</h2>
<p>Cakelisp uses an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression">S-expression</a>-style notation. Here is some Cakelisp code from <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/gamelib/src/branch/master/test/src/VocalGame.cake">VocalGame</a>:</p>

<p>There are a few things you can notice from reading this code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Types. Cakelisp is strongly- and explicitly-typed. I prefer reading code with explicit types because I can better imagine what the computer is actually doing, and what possibilities I have with each variable</li>
<li>Name-type order. I talked about this in a previous section. I wanted to emphasize the name of a variable for conveying meaning, especially when you may have many variables of the same type</li>
<li>Explicit <code>return</code>. I find I prefer code where return points are made explicit. Lisp will implicitly return the result of the last evaluation</li>
<li>Lisp-y style. The parentheses, plus keywords like <code>unless</code>, <code>defun</code>, <code>var</code>, <code>at</code>, and <code>incr</code>. I matched Lisp only when I didn't have strong opinions for a better notation. I am not trying to create something which is compatible with existing Lisps</li>
<li>C types and function calls. Cakelisp has seamless C interop, which means Cakelisp's "standard library" <em>is</em> C's standard library. No bindings had to be written to use the C types or make the function calls</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read more Cakelisp code in <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/gamelib/src/branch/master/src">Gamelib</a>.</p>
<p>You should think of Cakelisp more as "C in S-expressions" rather than "Lisp with C performance". If you know C, you'll have a relatively smooth transition to Cakelisp. If you only know Lisp, you're going to have a rougher time.</p>
<h3 id="why-s-expressions">Why S-expressions?</h3>
<p>When I set out to make Cakelisp, I decided on S-expressions syntax for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parsability. S-expressions shift the burden of creating a syntax tree onto the programmer. This does result on more work for the human, but I value its extremely explicit nature. It also facilitates simpler tokenization, domain-specific-language implementation, and external tool support</li>
<li>Consistency. There are only four types of tokens in Cakelisp: open and close parenthesis, symbol, and string. The consistency is admittedly limiting, so things like paths (<code>myThing-&gt;member.member</code>) become much more verbose to type, unfortunately. However, this limitation keeps Cakelisp code parsable, and has an elegant feel that I appreciate</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't believe there is one notation to rule them all, especially after I've encountered the disadvantages of using S-exprs. I'm still happy with the decision though, and it does give Cakelisp a novel and distinguishing characteristic from the many …</p></article></div>

<p>The Apple M1 available in the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro 13”, and Mac Mini has
been the focus of a ton of benchmarking writeups and blog posts about
the new chip. The performance overall, and especially performance/watt,
that Apple has achieved with the chip is very impressive.
As a ray tracing person, what caught my eye the most was the
performance AnandTech reported in their
<a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16252/mac-mini-apple-m1-tested/2">CineBench benchmarks</a>.
These scores were 1.6x higher than I got on my old Haswell desktop and 2x
higher than my new Tiger Lake laptop!
I had also been interested in trying out the new
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10012/">ray tracing API for Metal</a>
that was announced at WWDC this year,
which bears some resemblance to the DirectX, Vulkan, and OptiX GPU ray tracing APIs.
So, I decided to pick up a Mac Mini to do some testing
on my own interactive path tracing project,
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT">ChameleonRT</a>,
and to get it running on the new Metal ray tracing API.
In this post, we’ll take a look at the new Metal ray tracing
API to see how it lines up with DirectX, Vulkan, OptiX and Embree,
then we’ll make some fair (and some extremely unfair) ray tracing
performance comparisons against the M1.</p>

<!--more-->



<p><a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT">ChameleonRT</a> is an open source
interactive path tracer that I’ve been working on to learn the different ray tracing APIs,
and to provide an example or starting point for myself and others working with them
in other projects.
ChameleonRT provides backends for the GPU ray tracing APIs:
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/tree/master/dxr">DirectX Ray Tracing</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/tree/master/vulkan">Vulkan KHR Ray Tracing</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/tree/master/optix">OptiX 7</a>.
Through the work discussed in this post, it also has a new
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/tree/master/metal">Metal</a> GPU backend.
ChameleonRT also has an <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/tree/master/embree">Embree backend</a>
for fast multi-threaded and SIMD accelerated ray tracing on CPUs through
<a href="https://www.embree.org/">Embree</a>, <a href="https://ispc.github.io/">ISPC</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB">TBB</a>.
The rendering code in each backend is nearly identical and they produce almost pixel exact outputs,
with some possible small differences due to subtle differences in the ray tracing
libraries or shader languages.</p>

<p>ChameleonRT is different from popular ray tracing benchmark applications like
<a href="https://www.maxon.net/en/cinebench">CineBench</a>, <a href="http://www.luxmark.info/">LuxMark</a>,
and <a href="https://opendata.blender.org/">Blender Benchmark</a>, in that ChameleonRT is
a minimal interactive path tracer. CineBench, LuxMark, and Blender Benchmark are excellent
for getting a full picture of what performance to expect from a production film
renderer, as they are production renderers. However, there’s a lot more going
on in a production renderer than just ray tracing to support the kind of complex
geometries, materials, and effects used in film; and the large code
bases can be challenging to quickly port to a new architecture or API.
ChameleonRT is the exact opposite, supporting just one geometry type,
triangle meshes, and one material type, the Disney BRDF.
The rest of the code is similarly written to achieve interactive path tracing performance,
though I have tried to balance this with how complex the code is to read.
For example, the renderers use iterative ray tracing instead of recursion,
support only a simple sampling strategy, and don’t support alpha cut-out effects.
The use of iterative ray tracing is valuable on both the CPU and GPU, but is
especially important on the GPU, as the
overhead of recursive ray tracing calls in the pipeline can have a significant performance impact.
Similarly, ignoring alpha cut-out effects allows the GPU renderers
to skip using an any hit shader (and the Embree on to skip needing an intersection
filter). The any hit shader (or intersection filter) would be called during
BVH traversal after a candidate intersection with a triangle is found.
In the case that the BVH traversal is hardware accelerated, this ends up
producing a lot amount of back and
forth between the fixed function traversal hardware and the shader cores to run the any hit
shader during traversal, limiting the hardware’s performance.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What’s a path tracer? Path tracing is a technique in computer graphics for
rendering photo-realistic images by simulating the light transport in
the scene. It is a Monte Carlo technique, meaning that it randomly samples
light paths emitted from lights in the scene that reach the camera
by bouncing off objects in the scene. This is done by tracing the paths in reverse,
starting from the camera and tracing the path back through the scene.
A large number of light paths need to be sampled to produce a noise-free
image. Path tracing is not restricted to photo-realism, and is the
core rendering algorithm used in major film renderers, such as: Pixar’s Renderman,
Disney’s Hyperion, Autodesk’s Arnold, and Weta’s Manuka.
See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_tracing">Wikipedia</a> for more.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The new ray tracing API in Metal will be familiar to those who’ve used inline ray
tracing in DirectX or Vulkan. For a good introduction to Metal’s API, check out the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10012/">Discover ray tracing
with Metal</a> video from WWDC 2020,
and the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/accelerating_ray_tracing_using_metal?language=objc">accompanying sample</a>.
Inline ray tracing allows applications to make ray tracing calls in any shader stage,
e.g., fragment/pixel shaders, vertex shaders, compute shaders, etc.
Inline ray tracing allows ray tracing effects, for example accurate reflections and shadows,
to be integrated into the regular rasterization pipeline.
Inline ray tracing can also be used from a compute shader to implement a standalone
path tracing based renderer. ChameleonRT is a standalone path tracer, and takes
the compute shader approach for Metal.</p>

<p>At a high-level, ray tracing in Metal proceeds as follows: you upload your
geometry data, build bottom-level primitive acceleration structures over them, then create instances
referencing those acceleration structures and build a top-level acceleration structure over
the instances.
To render the scene you dispatch a compute shader and trace rays against the top-level
acceleration structure to get back intersection results. The intersection results provide
you with the intersected primitive and geometry IDs, and if using instancing, the instance ID.
Your shader can then look up the geometry data for the object that was hit and shade it,
after which it can continue tracing the path.</p>

<p>At this time Metal only supports inline ray tracing, in contrast to DirectX and Vulkan, which
also provide support for ray tracing pipelines. Ray tracing pipelines are used
to implement standalone ray tracing renderers, and is the approach ChameleonRT
uses in its DirectX and Vulkan backends.
OptiX only supports ray tracing pipelines.
Ray tracing pipelines require the creation of a Shader Binding Table to
provide the API with a table of functions to call when specific objects
in the scene are intersected. The SBT can be difficult to setup and debug,
and is a common point of difficulty for developers learning these APIs.
For more information about the SBT, check out my post
<a href="https://www.willusher.io/graphics/2019/11/20/the-sbt-three-ways">“The RTX Shader Binding Table Three Ways”</a>.
However, the potential benefit of the SBT is that the GPU can reorder or group function
calls to reduce thread divergence. With inline ray tracing, the developer
must do this themselves, or do without
(check out another video from <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10013/">WWDC20</a>
for information here).
Right now, ChameleonRT does not do any reordering to reduce divergence.</p>

<p>Those familiar with Metal may know of the previous
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metalperformanceshaders/metal_for_accelerating_ray_tracing?language=objc">Metal Performance Shaders ray intersector</a>.
The new support for inline ray tracing improves on this by allowing the renderer
to move entirely to the GPU. The previous ray intersector worked by taking
batches of rays, finding intersections in the scene, and writing these results
back out to memory. Multiple compute shaders would need to be dispatched to
trace the primary rays and create shadow and secondary rays, then trace the shadow rays
and continue the secondary rays while filtering out paths that terminated.
This requires significantly more memory traffic and compute dispatches, introducing overhead
to the renderer. Such an approach is also not well suited to augmenting traditional
rasterization pipelines with ray tracing effects.
Approaches based on tracing and sorting rays and intersection information to extract
coherence are valuable for complex film renderers, and can be implemented efficiently using inline
ray tracing as well.
For example, <a href="https://www.yiningkarlli.com/projects/hyperiondesign.html">Disney’s Hyperion renderer</a>
uses sorting and batching extensively to
extract coherent workloads from an otherwise incoherent and divergent distribution of rays.
There’s also an excellent higher-level <a href="https://youtu.be/frLwRLS_ZR0">video</a> explaining how this
works.</p>

<p>The Metal ray tracing API is quite nice to work with.
It bears a lot of similarity to the other ray tracing APIs, but has been streamlined
to be easier to use.
For example, compare the code required to build and compact a BVH in
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/blob/master/dxr/dxr_utils.cpp#L877-L977">DirectX</a>
or <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/blob/master/vulkan/vulkanrt_utils.cpp#L46-L214">Vulkan</a>
with <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/blob/master/metal/metalrt_utils.mm#L318-L396">Metal</a>.
OptiX’s API provides a similar simplification, here’s the
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/blob/master/optix/optix_utils.cpp#L183-L244">BVH build in OptiX</a>
for reference.
It’s also nice to have templates and C++ style functionality in the shader language,
a feature Metal shares with OptiX, which uses CUDA for the device side code.</p>

<p>This simplicity also has some drawbacks. For example, while in DirectX, Vulkan, and OptiX
you have control over where the acceleration structure memory is allocated,
Metal makes this allocation for you. As a result, you cannot allocate the acceleration
structures on a <code>MTLHeap</code>, and so to make sure they’re available for your rendering
pipeline, you must individually mark them as used in a loop instead of a single <code>useHeap</code> call.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="objc"><span></span><span>// Use our top level acceleration structure</span>
<span>[</span><span>command_encoder</span> <span>setAccelerationStructure</span><span>:</span><span>bvh</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>bvh</span> <span>atBufferIndex</span><span>:</span><span>1</span><span>];</span>
<span>// Also mark all mesh acceleration structures used, as they're indirectly</span>
<span>// referenced by the top level one</span>
<span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>auto</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mesh</span> <span>:</span> <span>bvh</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>meshes</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>[</span><span>command_encoder</span> <span>useResource</span><span>:</span><span>mesh</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>bvh</span> <span>usage</span><span>:</span><span>MTLResourceUsageRead</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This can add some overhead if you have a lot of bottom level BVHs, as can be the
case in scenes with many instances.
It’d be nice to be able to allocate the acceleration structures on a heap, and replace this loop
with a single <code>[command_encoder useHeap:data_heap-&gt;heap];</code></p>

<p>The API is also simplified significantly by not including ray tracing pipelines and
only requiring a Shader Binding Table-esque
structure when implementing custom geometries or other operations that need
to happen …</p></div></div></div>

For a local installation, supply instead of "pil" the actual path like "./pil"
or "../pil21/pil".

The pieces are indicated by the letters 'K'ing, 'Q'ueen, 'R'ook, 'B'ishop,
k'N'ight and 'P'awn, with black pieces in angular brackets.

You can enter your moves with the field names (in lower case) for the "from" and
"to" positions:

: (go e2 e4)

Castling may be entered by just specifying the king's move:

: (go e1 g1)

To promote a pawn to some piece other than a queen, you can specify a class:

: (go h7 h8 +Knight)

To undo one or several moves, enter

: (go -)

and to redo them

: (go +)

To switch sides (and have the computer play against itself), call 'go' without
arguments:

: (go)

The initial board position can be restored with

: (main)

The global variable '*Depth' holds the maximal depth of the alpha-beta tree
search. It defaults to 5. You may change it to some smaller value for a faster
response, or to a larger value for a deeper search:

: (setq *Depth 7)

The same effect can be achieved by passing the desired depth as the first
argument to 'main':

: (main 7)

The second (optional) argument to 'main' is your color ('NIL' for white and 'T'
for black).

To setup some given board position, call 'main' with a list of triples, with
each describing:

   1. The field
   2. The piece's classes
   3. An optional flag to indicate that the piece did not move yet

: (main 5 NIL

At any time, you can print the current board position in the above format to a
file with

: (ppos "file")

which later can be restored with

: (load "file")


   === PilBox and Web App ===

If you have the PilBox App installed on your Android device, just type "chess"
in the settings and press the "Download" button.

To start the Web application, use

   $ pil chess/main.l -chess~main -go +

Alternatively, you can start it with German localization as

   $ pil chess/main.l -'chess~main "DE" "de"' -go +

then point your browser to http://localhost:8080

In both cases you can interact with the chess board in this way:

   â€” To enter a move, drag a piece to the new field.
   â€” A click on the board does an auto-move and then switches sides.
   â€” The search depth can be changed with a drop-down menu.
   â€” The "New" button starts a new game, and the "Undo" and "Redo" buttons
     navigate in the history.
   â€” The text "White" or "Black" indicate who is to move next. It changes to
     "White ..." or "Black ..." while the computer is thinking.
   â€” After a move, the moved piece and the old and new positions are indicated
     above that text.

The "Setup" button switches to edit mode and allows you to change the position
manually:

   â€” A click on a piece removes it from the board.
   â€” Dragging a piece moves it to another field.
   â€” A new piece can be placed on the board by dragging it from the setup area.
   â€” The "Clear" button removes all pieces from the board.
   â€” The "New" button sets up all pieces for a new game.
   â€” The "Game" button switches back to play mode.

As in any PilBox app, you can go to the settings (wheel icon on top right) and

   â€” switch to another language in the "Language" tab or
   â€” view the App's source code by clicking on the app name "chess" in the
     "PILs" tab.

                            <p>In May 2020, Riverlane revealed that they will lead a consortium which has been <a href="https://www.riverlane.com/news/2020/05/uk-companies-to-build-radically-new-operating-system-for-quantum-computers/">awarded a £7.6m grant to build a radically new operating system</a> for quantum computers. We marked a ‘hello world’ moment in September, with the first <a href="https://www.riverlane.com/news/2020/09/commercial-breakthrough-following-success-of-deltaflow-os-trials/">successful trials of Deltaflow.OS</a>, using quantum hardware belonging to leading trapped-ion company, <a href="https://www.oxionics.com/">Oxford Ionics</a>.</p>
<p>The latest milestone is the public release of the first version of Deltaflow.OS; ‘Deltaflow-on-ARTIQ’. The product has been built to enable quantum hardware companies as well as algorithm and app developers to accelerate their research by making collaboration easier and reduce down-time in labs. This version uses simulated hardware and <a href="http://m-labs.hk/experiment-control/artiq/">ARTIQ</a> as a backend. ARTIQ is a control system which is widely used in the trapped-ion community.</p>
<p>Deltaflow-on-ARTIQ consists of the Deltaflow language (Deltalanguage), and various hardware models on which the language can be run, including an emulator of the ARTIQ control system. The Deltalanguage lets users define a graph of different hardware nodes corresponding to the type of hardware elements found in labs. After defining a programme, users can test it on increasingly realistic hardware models.</p>
<p>Robert Jördens of M-Labs commented, “My hands are twitching because I really want to see and try that&nbsp;emulator and Deltaflow. There are so many valuable pieces in there.”</p>
<p>A first <a href="https://vimeo.com/480247763/d8fd4a0708">public demonstration of Deltaflow.OS</a> took place at the virtual National Quantum Technologies Showcase on 6 November 2020, where the team demonstrated how a Rabi-Oscillation would be performed.</p>
<p>The release of Deltaflow-on-ARTIQ marks a significant step towards Riverlane’s mission to build a quantum operating system that is high performance, portable across all qubit technologies and scalable to millions of qubits.</p>

        <div data-layout-label="Post Body" data-type="item" data-updated-on="1608502170327" id="item-5fdfcb4e7f4e6a3367419e89"><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-bdf991a0b97667eb45b2"><div><p>Linux provides an amazing suite of functionality for embedded systems, and it is hard to overstate the benefits of using such a feature rich and well tested base. </p><p>This functionality comes at a price however, as when compared to non-Linux systems it generally means increased complexity, binary size, and more often than not startup time. For some systems, this longer startup time can be mitigated by never fully shutting down, and relying on sleep modes to reduce power consumption when the system is not in use. However for some systems, such as non-battery-backed devices where each usage requires a full power-on sequence, it is important that the cold power-on time is minimised.</p><p>As is often the case with complex systems, slow boot speed is generally not caused by one single issue, but rather a large collection of smaller factors. Following that, we find that fast overall startup time tends to be achieved as the result of the culmination of say 10 to 20 minor improvements.</p><p>When looking at startup time, we typically break the boot time of a Linux system down into three broad stages:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Power-on to Linux kernel load. This is typically referred to as the bootloader, but on some systems this can be entirely performed by the boot ROM. This phase starts when power is applied to the system, and is finished when the Linux kernel has been loaded from non-volatile storage into RAM.</p></li><li><p>Linux boot. This covers the time it takes the Linux kernel to unpack itself and initialise sufficient hardware to mount a root filesystem and begin executing application (userspace) software.</p></li><li><p>Application startup. This phase covers not just the start of the final application itself, but also all of the dependencies it might have - such as mounting filesystems, initialising network interfaces, performing any pre-run checks and so on.</p></li></ol><p>Before attempting any improvements, it is important to analyse the existing system to determine the baseline boot speed. </p><p>For some systems this can be done by simply monitoring the console output, however this has two drawbacks - it cannot capture any time taken before the serial port is initialised, and as the serial port is often one of the slowest peripherals, outputting to it will actually slow the boot down. For these reasons, it is often good to instrument some lower level timing mechanisms. The simplest is to use spare GPIO pins, toggling them at various stages in the boot. Monitoring these signals on an oscilloscope can produce highly accurate timing without interfering with the boot itself. This kind of system can also be left enabled in the production software to make regression testing of boot speed easier (or even automated).</p><p>Once a baseline has been established, various techniques can then be used to begin making improvements. There are far more of these techniques than can reasonably be covered here, however the main areas we focus on are:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Ensuring that the initial kernel load is being performed as fast as the hardware can support. Typically backing storage systems, such as SPI, often have multiple modes or speeds. Often conservative defaults are supplied for these to ensure maximum compatibility with hardware designs. However if the particular hardware design has faster chips, this speed may not be being exploited in the default configuration.</p></li><li><p>Ensuring that busy-wait loops in the bootloader are minimised. Before Linux has started, the bootloader tends to be a much simpler, single-threaded system. This means that one operation will not be started until the previous operation has fully completed. However overlapping some operations (such as beginning kernel uncompression in parallel with loading it from storage), can provide significant gains.</p></li><li><p>Ensuring that only the drivers used on the embedded system are included in the kernel. By default Linux provides support for a massive array of hardware. For desktop environments, this is ideal as it provides maximum flexibility. However embedded systems typically have a much narrower target, and as such do not benefit from this flexibility. Reducing the drivers in the kernel will not only reduce the binary size (which makes for a faster kernel load time), it will also drop the driver initialisation code, which directly impacts boot speed.</p></li><li><p>Choosing the correct filesystem for the application. In particular, using a read-only filesystem for the core system, and using a read-write filesystem for user data. This allows for the read-write filesystem to be initialised in parallel with the application startup.</p></li><li><p>Ensuring parallel execution of application startup. This may require some rework of the application, but having a system that can cope with some subsystems not being immediately available can provide significant speedups. For instance, it may be that the user cannot save new data for the first 2-3 seconds of the application startup. However this allows other functionality to be fully available in that time, and can dramatically improve the perceived performance of the system.</p></li></ul><p>Boot speed is an issue heavily discussed online, and is constantly evolving as new hardware becomes available and new software is written.

                Cyberpwned: Beating Cyberpunk 2077's hacking minigame in 50 lines of Python
            </h3>
            <p>
                December 20, 2020
            </p><p>
                If you have a passing interest in anything gaming related and haven't been living under a rock for the last couple years, you're probably somewhat familiar with Cyberpunk 2077.
                After a long and repeatedly extended wait, it's finally here! And it has a hacking minigame! And getting a good score gets you better gear! 
                Can some quick Python magic give us the edge we need in this cruel, cruel Net? You bet. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A quick overview of the minigame: You're given a square matrix and one or more sequences of hexadecimal numbers, along with a buffer of certain length. 
                Your goal is to complete the most amount of sequences choosing as many nodes as the buffer allows.
                Each sequence will advance in progress if the node chosen is the next node in the sequence.
                When the game starts, you may choose any of the values in the first row of the matrix.
                After that, the values you can choose will alternate between the Nth column/row each turn, with N being the index of the last picked value.
                If this horrible description wasn't helpful, click <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/12/14/cyberpunk-2077-hacking-minigame-breach-protocol-explained/">here</a> for a more detailed one, courtesy of RPS.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                All valid paths are considered and the final score of each path is calculated depending on how many sequences were completed by traversing it.
                The path with the best score is then printed to screen.
                The algorithm itself isn't particularly interesting nor efficient, unfortunately. However, it should be fast enough to solve any of Cyberpunk's minigames in a few seconds, so fast enough!
                I'm sure there's some low hanging fruit that could speed up execution, but I thought I'd share what I have so far and update the post as new ideas/suggestions come up.
            </p>
            

            <p>
                Let's start off with the game's components:

    [0x55, 0xe9, 0xe9, 0xbd, 0xbd],

            <p>
                The path generation is pretty similar to a DFS graph traversal. 
                The only significant difference is that the nodes accessible will vary depending on the current turn and the previous node's coordinates.

    # first row. For the second turn, it would return the nth column, with n
    # being the coordinate's row

                Let's run it and check that everything is working correctly.
                While most of the breach protocol minigames have randomized values, the "Spellbound" quest involves a fixed state and the best solution is already known. Courtesy of GamerJournalist:

            </p>

            <pre><code>
paths = [(path, PathScore(path, sequences, buffer_size).compute()) for path in generate_paths(buffer_size)]
max_path = max(paths, key=lambda path: path[1])
# [(0, 1), (2, 1), (2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 0), (4, 0), (4, 3)] -&gt; Should traverse 3rd and 4th sequences, finishes in ~3 seconds
print(max_path[0])
            </code></pre>

            <p>
                Success! Out of curiosity, I thought I'd try increasing the buffer size until I could find a path which cleared all sequences. 
                Be warned though, the result might take some time to compute since it has to go through every possible path of length 11.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
buffer_size = 11
paths = [(path, PathScore(path, sequences, buffer_size).compute()) for path in generate_paths(buffer_size)]
max_path = max(paths, key=lambda path: path[1])

# [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 3), (3, 3), (3, 1), (0, 1), (0, 3), (2, 3), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2)] -&gt; Should traverse all sequences, finishes in ~40 seconds
print(max_path[0], max_path[1])
            </code></pre>

            <p>
                OK, optimization time! We'll assume that there's at least 1 path with a non-negative score.
                That way, we can actually stop traversing a partial path if its current score (adjusted depending on buffer's size and current turn) is lower than 0.
            </p>

            <pre><code>
def generate_paths(...):
    ...
    def _walk_paths(...):
    ...

                # Full path is added to the final return list and removed from the partial paths stack
                if len(new_path.coords) == buffer_size:
                    completed_paths.append(new_path)
                # If the partial path score is already lower than 0 we should be able to safely stop traversing it
                elif PathScore(new_path, sequences, buffer_size).compute() &lt; 0:
                    continue
                else: # Add new, lengthier partial path back into the stack
                    partial_paths_stack.append(new_path) 
                    _walk_paths(buffer_size, completed_paths, partial_paths_stack, turn + 1, candidate_coords(turn + 1, coord))
    ...
            </code></pre>

            <p>
                Let's try to get our original result with a buffer of length 7 again: 
            </p>

            <pre><code>
buffer_size = 7
paths = [(path, PathScore(path, sequences, buffer_size).compute()) for path in generate_paths(buffer_size)]

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <div>
        <p>In this post we'll get a basic semgrep environment set up in Docker
running some custom rules against our code.</p>
<h3 id="existing-linters">Existing linters</h3><p>Linters like <a href="https://www.pylint.org/">pylint</a> for Python or
<a href="https://eslint.org/">eslint</a> for JavaScript are great for general,
broad language standards. But what about common nits in code review
like using print statements instead of a logger, or using a defer
statement inside a for loop (Go specific), or the existence of
multiple nested loops.</p>
<p>Most developers don't have experience working with language
parsing. So it's fairly uncommon in small- and medium-sized teams to
see custom linting rules. And while no single linter or language is
that much more complex than the other (it's all just AST operations),
there is a small penalty to learning the AST and framework for each
language linter.</p>
<h3 id="semgrep">Semgrep</h3><p><a href="https://semgrep.dev/">Semgrep</a> is a generic tool for finding patterns
in source code. Unlike traditional regex (and traditional grep) it can
find recursive patterns. This makes it especially useful as a tool to
learn for finding patterns in any language.</p>
<p>An advantage of semgrep rules is that you can learn the semgrep
pattern matching syntax (which is surprisingly easy) and then you can
write rules for any language you'd like to write rules for.</p>
<p>And while the <a href="https://semgrep.dev/editor">online rule tester</a> is
awesome, I had a hard time going from that to a working sample on my
own laptop with Docker. We'll do just that.</p>
<h3 id="catching-print-statements-in-python">Catching print statements in Python</h3><p>Let's say we want a script to fail on any use of print statements in
Python:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat test/python/simple-print.py
def main():
  print("DEBUG: here")
  print("DEBUG: ", "now here")
</code></pre>
<p>The current <a href="https://semgrep.dev/editor">default example</a> shown in the
online editor happens to be for just this. Click the Advanced tab and
you'll see the following:</p>
<pre><code>rules:
- id: fail-on-print
  pattern: |
    print("...")
  message: |
    Semgrep found a match
  severity: WARNING
</code></pre>
<p>Copy this into <code>config.yml</code>. Let's modify the pattern to
warn on all print calls, not just print calls with a single string
argument:</p>
<pre><code>rules:
- id: fail-on-print
  pattern: |
    print(...)
  message: |
    Semgrep found a match
  severity: WARNING
</code></pre>
<p>The editor doesn't mention it (nor do any docs I can find) but we also
need to include two keys in the individual rule
object: <code>mode</code> and <code>languages</code>.</p>
<pre><code>rules:
- id: fail-on-print
  pattern: |
    print(...)
  message: |
    Semgrep found a match
  severity: WARNING
  mode: search
  languages: ["generic"]
</code></pre>
<p>Semgrep fails really weirdly if you set <code>mode</code> to
anything other than <code>search</code>, but it won't warn you that
what you set is garbage. The <code>languages</code> setting is
similarly fickle and doesn't give you much feedback if you set it
incorrectly.</p>
<p>
  Also, I'm using the "generic" language here because I don't
  understand the difference between languages and as far as I'm
  concerned the syntax I'm using here is already pretty generic.
</p><p>We run the semgrep Docker image:</p>
<pre><code>$ docker run -v "${PWD}:/src" returntocorp/semgrep --config=config.yml test/python
A new version of Semgrep is available. Please see https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep#upgrading for more information.
running 1 rules...
test/python/simple-print.py
severity:warning rule:fail-on-print: Semgrep found a match

2:print("DEBUG: here")
ran 1 rules on 1 files: 1 findings"")
</code></pre>
<p>And there we've got our warning!</p>
<p>
  Not completely clear to me why we're getting warned about a new
  version when we've pulled <code>latest</code> as the linked docs
  suggest. Maybe there's a newer version that hasn't made it into a
  Docker image yet.
</p><h3 id="catching-fmt.print*-statements-in-go">Catching fmt.Print* statements in Go</h3><p>Let's say we also want to fail on print statements in Go (because we
should use a logger instead):</p>
<pre><code>$ cat test/golang/simple-print.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  a := fmt.Sprintf("here")
  fmt.Println(a)
  fmt.Printf("%s\n", a)
  e := fmt.Errorf("My crazy error")
}
</code></pre>
<p>We could try to look for any <code>import "fmt"</code> code in a file
but that would fail on uses of <code>fmt.Sprintf</code>
or <code>fmt.Errorf</code> which are fine. Instead we'll just focus on
uses of <code>fmt.Printf</code> or <code>fmt.Println</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat go-config.yml
rules:
- id: fail-on-print
  pattern-either:
    - pattern: fmt.Printf(...)
    - pattern: fmt.Println(...)
  message: |
    Semgrep found a match
  severity: WARNING
  mode: search
  languages: ["generic"]
</code></pre>
<p>Run the Go config against the Go files:</p>
<pre><code>$ docker run -v "${PWD}:/src" returntocorp/semgrep --config=go-config.yml test/golang
A new version of Semgrep is available. Please see https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep#upgrading for more information.

</code></pre>
<p>Cool! Making some sense. Now let's try a harder pattern.</p>
<h3 id="catching-triple-nested-for-loops">Catching triple-nested for loops</h3><p>Let's try to warn on the triple-nested loop in this code:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat test/golang/loopy.go
package main

import "log"

func main() {
  doneFirst := false
  for i := 0; i &lt; 10; i++ {
    log.Print(i)

<p>Well great. The 3-nested loop still exists but we can't find it
anymore because it's not syntactically obvious anymore.</p>
<p>At this point we'd need to start getting into linting based on runtime
analysis. If you know of a tool that does this and lets you write
rules like semgrep for it, please tell me!</p>
<h3 id="in-summary">In summary</h3><p>In the end though, it's still very useful to be able to learn a single
language for writing syntax rules at a high level to enforce behavior
in code. Furthermore, a generic syntax matcher helps you write easily
write rules for things that don't already have linters like YAML
or JSON configuration or Vagrantfiles.</p>
<p>It can be annoying to work around some missing docs in semgrep but
overall it's a great tool for the kit.</p>

December 20, 2020 | https://filipnikolovski.com/posts/ebpf/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://filipnikolovski.com/posts/ebpf/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was doing some research at work for tracing and observability for microservices, when I came across <a href="https://pixielabs.ai/">Pixielabs</a>. This tool advertises that you can instantly troubleshoot applications without any instrumentation or special code inside the apps, which sounded ✨magical✨ to me. So naturally I wanted to know a little more about what enables this technology to work, and after scrolling through the site, under the “No Instrumentation” section was this acronym <strong>eBPF</strong>.</p><p>After some further digging on the internet, reading the <a href="https://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.pdf">design papers</a> and watching several videos, it was safe to say this technology caught my attention, so I wanted to write some notes on it and I hope this post will spark some further interest in you as well.</p><h2 id="so-what-is-ebpf-exactly">So what is eBPF exactly?</h2><p>The TL;DR version is that this technology enables sandboxed user space applications to run in the Linux kernel itself. In a way it makes the kernel <em>programmable</em> which unlocks tremendous possibilities.</p><p>You can pick <strong>any function</strong> from the kernel and execute the program every time that function runs. Running a program that “attaches” to network sockets, tracepoints and perf events can be extremely useful. Developers can debug the kernel without having to re-compile it. There are plenty of use cases such as:</p><ul><li>Application performance &amp; troubleshooting</li><li>Networking &amp; security</li><li>Runtime security</li><li>Application tracing</li><li>Observability</li></ul><p>That’s what enables tools like Pixie to do blackbox analysis, without requiring any tinkering inside the applications that we’re trying to debug.</p><p>Originally BPF was <a href="https://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.pdf">designed</a> for capturing and filtering network packets that matched specific rules, discarding any unwanted packets. That’s why it was called the “Berkeley Packet Filter”. If you’ve ever used <strong>tcpdump</strong> you’ve probably already used it. Nowadays eBPF can be used for many different things and not just packet filtering but the name stuck for some reason.</p><p>This architecture of network monitoring was vastly superior to the current existing packet capture technologies in terms of performance, mainly because the filtering was done in the kernel instead of copying all of the packets in user space and doing
the calculations there. But with the advancement of processors it didn’t hold up so well with it’s initial design. That’s why the <strong>extended BPF</strong> (eBPF) design was introduced, to take advantage of the modern processing power.</p><p>Initially eBPF was to be also used as a network packet filtering solution, but the ability to run user-space programs inside the kernel proved to be very powerful. The new design extended what the BPF virtual machine could do, which was to allow it to run on all kinds of events, not just packets, and also do certain actions instead of just the ability to filter things.</p><h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2><p>An eBPF program is just a sequence of 64-bit instructions. The virtual machine’s instruction set is fairly limited and it has two goals in mind:</p><ol><li>The code needs to be executed as fast as possible.</li><li>All BPF instructions must be verifiable at load time to ensure the safety of the kernel.</li></ol><p>Okay so, eBPF code is run in a safe virtual machine inside the kernel. Writing these programs is done with the help of some frameworks (like <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc">bcc</a> and <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace">bpftrace</a>) and the program bytecode is then loaded via the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bpf.2.html"><code>bpf</code></a> system call.</p><p>To nullify the security and stability risks when running a user space program inside the kernel, several checks are performed
to ensure that the code we run is safe and that it terminates so our computer won’t freeze up.</p><p>Firstly, to even be able to run a user program which loads eBPF code, it needs root privileges to do so, unless unprivileged eBPF is enabled, in which case the process can load a program with a reduced functionality. Secondly, there’s the eBPF verifier which all eBPF programs must go through before they can be executed.</p><p>The verifier runs several checks on the code that safeguards the kernel. The first check ensures that any unbounded
loops which could freeze up the kernel are prohibited. The second check, which is more extensive, simulates the execution of the code making sure that all paths of the code run to completion, no out of bounds memory is accessed and overall the state of the virtual machine is valid.</p><p>The last step of the verification process involves restricting the eBPF program abilities, which kernel functions are callable and which data it can access. The verifier knows how to apply those restrictions because of the <strong>program type</strong>. The program type is determined when we associate the program with a certain event.</p><p>After the verification process is done, the BPF bytecode is then interpreted, or compiled by a JIT compiler, into native instructions that run efficiently whenever an event happens in the kernel.</p><h2 id="kprobes--uprobes">kprobes &amp; uprobes</h2><p>We can create and insert kernel probes or kprobes for short to virtually any function in the kernel, and attach an eBPF program so that it executes each time that function is invoked.</p><p>Here’s a simple hello world example from the <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/tree/master/examples">bcc</a> repository:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> bcc <span>import</span> BPF
<span>from</span> bcc.utils <span>import</span> printb

</span><span>    return 0;
</span><span>}
</span><span>"""</span>
<span># load BPF program</span>

</code></pre></div><p>The eBPF program is written in a pseudo-C code and it’s placed in the variable <code>prog</code> as a string. The bcc framework does all the heavy lifting of generating the bytecode, loading the programs and all that stuff, which makes writing these programs a bit easier.</p><p>In this example, the hello function invokes a bpf helper function called <code>bpf_trace_printk</code> which outputs a “Hello, World!” trace. Then we load the program and we attach a kernel probe for the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html"><code>clone</code></a> event, basically saying that we want to call the <code>hello</code> program each time <code>clone</code> is called.</p><p>After that the script waits for new traces to arrive, fetches the fields and prints the values to the screen.</p><p>Let’s try running it:</p><pre><code>$ sudo python3 hello-ebpf.py
TIME(s)            COMM             PID    MESSAGE
</code></pre><p>The script has successfully loaded the program and now we wait for the traces to arrive. The next thing to do is to try and invoke the <code>clone</code> syscall. We can run any command on the terminal, such as <code>ls</code> and a child process will be created. Since I had firefox running, it created some child processes in the meantime and traces started to show up:</p><pre><code>611.247475000      firefox          5378   Hello, World!
</code></pre><p>As we can see, the message “Hello, World!” is printed on the screen along with the other trace fields. Super cool!</p><p>Besides attaching to kernel functions, we could also observe functions invoked in user space, such as <strong>malloc</strong> or <strong>strlen</strong>. This is possible via another Linux kernel feature - <strong>uprobes</strong>.</p><p>Here’s an interesting script that counts frequencies of strings by tracing strlen() and using a hash map to store the strings along with the count of their recurrence: <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/examples/tracing/strlen_count.py">https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/examples/tracing/strlen_count.py</a></p><h2 id="helper-functions">helper functions</h2><p>Since arbitrary kernel functions are prohibited to be called by ebpf programs, there are several helper functions which the kernel provides for us, such as the <code>bpf_trace_printk</code> function. We can use them to:</p><ul><li>Get the current time</li><li>Interact with eBPF maps</li><li>Manipulate network packets</li><li>Print debugging messages</li></ul><p>Note that each program can only use a subset of these helpers because of the different contexts the programs can run in. Here’s the extensive <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/bpf-helpers.7.html">list</a> of bpf helpers.</p><h2 id="map-storage">map storage</h2><p>To write more complicated programs you’ll need some type of data store, and that is where <strong>maps</strong> come in. They are an important part of the BPF internal system, which allows programs to store information that can be accessed from userspace.</p><p>BPF supports different <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/docs/reference_guide.md#maps">types</a> of data stores - you can use a hash map, an array, or even a stack or a queue, depending on the use case of course.</p><h2 id="conclusion">conclusion</h2><p>eBPF opens up all kinds of possibilities for observability. You can treat a system as a blackbox, without really knowing anything about it, and run all kinds of interesting analysis: count the most frequently called functions, trace network packets, do performance tracing and debugging, etc.</p><p>There are a myriad of tools that you can use to observe every component of the system: the CPU, memory, file system, networking, containers, applications…</p><figure><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b19abde4b1ccfe4ce140969c8bf44f39d1c2fe70/f9ed3/images/ebpf/bcc_tracing_tools_early2019.png" alt="ebpf-tracing-tools"><figcaption>BCC performance tools (courtesy of Brendan Gregg)</figcaption></figure><p>I’ve only scratched the surface on this subject and I can’t wait to learn more about it, as well as Linux performance in general.

<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>China has received abundant ridicule for its role in Covid-19, from its <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/82574e3d-1633-48ad-8afb-71ebb3fe3dee" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>early negligence</span></a>, to its <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/05/china-global-influence-who-united-states/611227/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>influence</span></a> over the World Health Organization, to its <a href="https://time.com/5796425/china-coronavirus-lockdown/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>draconian measures</span></a> to control the virus. Part of the negative perception in the West was an assumption that reporting on Covid cases and deaths within China was not to be trusted — just as the Chinese political system had failed to acknowledge the emergence of the virus, surely the government would use its extensive societal control to downplay the disease’s impacts within China.&nbsp;</p>
<!--more-->
<div><p>Months later, however, the evidence suggests that China indeed succeeded in controlling the virus. While many advanced Western democracies <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>continue to flounder</span></a>, China is almost entirely open, with kids in school, families traveling, and economic growth returning to normal. This week, The Factual used 30 articles from 20 sources across the political spectrum to explore how China achieved this outcome, whether official data for China can be trusted, and what this apparent success portends.</p></div>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/LhbaqO6B3R89g-SeB_4ce3UsWk3ZyK_XDD2KnfJImK5eO-ZEXwgr-B2xihV_cIVrJKPiIETuD34ZBAZnUHLFzK06JxqbxYFYTyiVV_o8drZB5GxnhDpA5YAHPi8GpvRwGIjujqeq" width="624" height="417"></p>
<div><p>Note: China’s case count is imperceptible in comparison to the U.S., EU, and UK counts. (U.S. population = 328 million; EU population = 446 million; UK population = 67 million; China population = 1.39 billion)<br>Source: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Our World in Data</span></a></p></div>
<h4><strong>By Controlling Its Population, China Controlled The Virus</strong></h4>
<p>As Wuhan experienced the first severe urban outbreak of Covid-19, media attention focused on the dystopian elements of China’s response. Citizens were locked in their residences, <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2020/02/how-china-is-using-drones-to-contain-the-coronavirus.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>drones</span></a> played out public health warnings, and government entities assumed responsibility for the delivery of necessities to citizens. But these responses were part of one of the world’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/30/world/asia/china-covid-coronavirus.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>most effective</span></a> Covid-19 interventions.</p>
<div><p>On April 7, as case counts and deaths climbed around the world, China reported its <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlieporterfield/2020/04/07/china-heavily-criticized-for-its-coronavirus-numbers-claims-no-new-deaths/?sh=3ba3b7ae77ad" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>first day without a Covid-19 fatality</span></a>. By that point, Wuhan — the epicenter of the disease — had only reported two new cases in the prior week. The Chinese government, learning rapidly, exercised its societal control to avoid similar outbreaks in other cities. Today, China’s official statistics show a total of around 90,000 cases and less than 5,000 deaths. By contrast, the U.S. has officially registered 17 million cases, almost 190 times more than China, despite having just a quarter of China’s population.</p></div>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/38aoRz3ugRGds0xMtDZjr8SoGZWFX_9peIj-dXLtJvgvahsA-Y8KoY4DiwyHd81_WfSLm8RVdfhe-2wKl4KWJTzXuGcud5fs0T-L_xtQ5xOk1XTAkdpEJzCCgz7iQnscB3RZc6Qg" width="676"></p>

<p>At the most extreme, China’s interventions involved <a href="https://reason.com/2020/03/30/the-world-must-not-mimic-chinas-authoritarian-model-to-fight-covid-19/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>intensive restrictions</span></a> on the movement of citizens on as many as <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2020/06/china-didnt-stop-virus-cold-outside-wuhan/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>750 million people</span></a>. However, since the intense first weeks, the measures have seemed comparatively less extreme, relying mostly on the routine monitoring of citizens. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/covid-19-runs-riot-across-world-china-controls-pandemic-n1246587" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>These measures</span></a> include “color-coded designations based on a person’s health status,” widespread testing, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/08/17/how-china-controlled-the-coronavirus" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>routine temperature taking</span></a>, and careful monitoring of people entering the country — now seen as the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/10/16/924382187/city-in-china-tests-10-million-people-after-13-covid-19-cases-are-found" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>primary source</span></a> of most new cases in China. Mask wearing was compulsory, though such orders have largely been lifted now.</p>
<p>New cases are comprehensively attacked through a combination of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/nov/23/china-tests-millions-after-coronavirus-flare-ups-i/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>testing</span></a>, contact tracing, and quarantines. For example, in October in the port city of Qingdao, the emergence of a handful of new cases led local authorities to conduct over <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/china-testing-qingdao-city-9-million-after-12-cases-hospital-2020-10" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>9 million tests</span></a> in the course of five days, ultimately identifying around a dozen cases. Similarly, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2020/11/23/china-launches-mass-testing-in-three-cities-chaotic-scenes-follow-at-shanghai-airport/?sh=783168a93ede" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>a video emerged</span></a> in Western media in November of a confrontation between workers in a Shanghai airport and hazmat-wearing government officials. It was later revealed that, upon learning of a potential case, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tianjin-shanghai-coronavirus-pandemic-china-united-states-8d46e90bc0a3b75c1b5a66c196e45025" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>17,719 workers were tested</span></a> to locate a single positive case.</p>
<div><p>While it’s easy to see China’s purported success in controlling the virus as solely the result of the government’s active measures, citizen compliance and appreciation for science and health messaging has also likely <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/covid-19-runs-riot-across-world-china-controls-pandemic-n1246587" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>played a consequential role</span></a>, as has the clarity and consistency of official messaging and pre-existing proclivities toward mask usage. There has not been similar skepticism toward virus mitigation efforts nor a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/30/world/asia/china-covid-coronavirus.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>politicization of the pandemic</span></a>, as seen in Western democracies. High levels of compliance meshed with government action to bring about what is likely one of the fullest and fastest recoveries anywhere in the world.</p></div>
<h4><strong>Can China’s Numbers Be Trusted?</strong></h4>
<p>Skepticism of China’s handling of Covid-19 has been consistent, and it’s no surprise that many also doubt the official tallies of cases and deaths. Already receiving flak as the origin of the virus and for a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/82574e3d-1633-48ad-8afb-71ebb3fe3dee" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>failure to contain its spread early</span></a>, China has much to gain from positive press, meaning that “conquering” the virus would be the beginning of a much-needed win. But while this nominally gives China a motivation to underreport cases and deaths, and it by many accounts has much of the control needed to do so (consider China's <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/leaked-documents-show-how-chinas-army-of-paid-internet-trolls-helped-censor-the-coronavirus" rel="noopener">extensive censorship efforts</a> early on), there is no evidence that it is hiding significant numbers of either — at least not at a magnitude that would alter its narrative of success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Critics point to a number of choices and anecdotes to substantiate the claim that China is obfuscating the real extent of the virus within its borders. For example, China has altered its definition of a confirmed case <a href="https://time.com/5813628/china-coronavirus-statistics-wuhan/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>numerous times</span></a> over the course of the pandemic and made the choice not to include asymptomatic cases in the official tally, moves that some argue are aimed at limiting the official extent of the virus. However, others have pointed out that some of these redefinitions <a href="https://quillette.com/2020/09/06/the-china-syndrome-part-iv-did-china-fudge-its-data/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>have resulted</span></a> in case counts being revised upward as well as downward and that some changes in definition are expected, given the novelty of the virus. Furthermore, the decision to exclude asymptomatic cases, while perhaps counterintuitive, has been both ridiculed and defended by experts as a plausible epidemiological choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, the anecdotes used to suggest significantly worse outcomes in China do not hold up to scrutiny. For example, one such popular story from Wuhan suggested that crematoriums were <a href="https://time.com/5813628/china-coronavirus-statistics-wuhan/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>distributing huge numbers of burial urns</span></a> during the worst part of Wuhan’s outbreak, and extrapolations were made to suggest that many times more people were dying. Further scrutiny, however, suggests that such evidence is rather <a href="https://quillette.com/2020/09/06/the-china-syndrome-part-iv-did-china-fudge-its-data/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>flimsy</span></a>, and while we can’t be sure just how many people died in the worst days in Wuhan, there’s scant evidence to suggest that there’s been any coordinated coverup of a large number of cases and deaths.</p>
<div><p>Quite plainly, if China was trying to hold back more severe outbreaks or impacts, Chinese society would not be so <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/covid-19-runs-riot-across-world-china-controls-pandemic-n1246587" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>obviously recovering</span></a>, with 240 million students in school and 637 million Chinese <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/china-attractions-630-million-people-travel-during-golden-week.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>travelling in the first week of October</span></a> for the mid-autumn festival, not far behind the 782 million that travelled during the same period in 2019. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/08/17/how-china-controlled-the-coronavirus" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Full flights</span></a>, classrooms, and events returned fairly quickly to China, with authorities gathering that the risk was sufficiently low in many areas. And while China has first-rate censorship capabilities and enormous influence on the behavior of citizens, it lacks the ability to cover up or hide a serious crisis on the scale of Covid-19 outbreaks. People would be <a href="https://quillette.com/2020/09/06/the-china-syndrome-part-iv-did-china-fudge-its-data/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>documenting, discussing, and sharing</span></a> the events the same way they were able to in Wuhan at the onset of the pandemic — from watching out for family, friends, and neighbors, to recording videos of government officials, to noticing the construction of new <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-china-can-build-a-coronavirus-hospital-in-10-days-11580397751" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Covid-specific hospitals</span></a>. The Chinese government knows its strengths, but probably also its limitations, and seems to understand that containing the actual virus is far more beneficial and feasible than containing information about its spread.&nbsp;</p></div>
<h4><strong>China’s Wins</strong></h4>
<div><p>Given what we know about the virus in China, the evidence suggests that the country really has Covid-19 under control, that the Chinese government has strategies that effectively and comprehensively keep it at bay, and that the reported numbers of cases and deaths are likely not hugely different from what has been officially reported. Western media has at times been distracted by China’s behavior in the first weeks of the pandemic, allowing those decisions to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/11/china-coronavirus-covid-19-medical-research" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>color or even discount</span></a> what has happened since. A sober assessment now reveals <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/25/world/asia/china-xinjiang-covid.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>heavy-handed</span></a> but exceedingly effective management of the virus on a scale likely impossible anywhere else in the world.</p></div>

<p>While questions are still being asked about China’s early role in the virus’s spread, attention must also be paid to what this apparent success means for China. Economically, it has managed a rapid recovery, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-gdp/chinas-economic-recovery-quickens-as-consumption-returns-idUSKBN27404Z" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>growing by 4.9%</span></a> between July and September and profiting handsomely from a world stuck at home and dependent Chinese goods. In terms of global health, its success in managing the virus has allowed it to engage in <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/11/global-push-covid-19-vaccines-china-aims-win-friends-and-cut-deals" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>vaccine diplomacy</span></a> (rather than vaccine nationalism), helping develop and disseminate vaccines in close collaboration with other countries. And internally, some surveys show Chinese citizens indicating <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/09/23/913650298/as-u-s-views-of-china-grow-more-negative-chinese-support-for-their-government-ri" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>more faith in the Chinese government,</span></a> especially in contrast to the dawdling responses seen elsewhere around the world. At least internally, China’s pandemic successes seem to be quickly outweighing the costs of its mistakes.</p>
<div><p>To assume that China has been similarly afflicted by the virus as other advanced countries and has simply hidden the truth would be to ignore the fundamental differences in pandemic response and government that many so keenly point out. All things considered, China’s experience with Covid-19 first reflects its weaknesses, in the hiding of the initial outbreak, but then demonstrates its <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2020/06/china-didnt-stop-virus-cold-outside-wuhan/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>strengths</span></a>, through intense control and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/11/10/us-has-absolutely-no-control-over-coronavirus-china-is-top-tiniest-risks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>exacting management of risks</span></a>. It turns out the truth might be rather boring: China has the capacity to implement effective physical restraints to stop the virus but probably not the ability to cover up huge numbers of Covid-related deaths. In short, the story adds up.</p></div>

<h2>Why I even started working on this madness?</h2>
<p>Anyone who is working with geospatial data, will probably sometime in h/er/is career will need to aggregate data based on a common field. For a project of mine, I wanted to provide insights about neighborhoods and how they are evolving over time.</p>
<p>As I started mining the web and aggregate the data, the Least Common Multiple I could find, the foreign key for all the tables or name it however you want, was the Postcode or Postal Code or Zipcode.</p>
<p>So far so good, but when I started searching for ways to visualize the data, I quickly found out that there is not a single postcode boundary map on the web to serve my needs. If you live in the U.S. someone else has probably worked to help you. But many countries lack those data.</p>
<h2>Using Open Data to solve this problem</h2>
<p>After searching for quite a long time and writing on forums like <a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/questions/77790/postal-code-clustering-from-osm-dataf">help.openstreetmap.org</a> I started having a feeling that there is a chance that I can produce an approximate map myself using open data.</p>
<p>Below are the steps I followed to create my country’s (Greece) postcode boundary map. You can perform similar steps to produce your map.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Finding the right data</h3>
<p>OpenStreetMap dataset is huge. Even if you try to parse the whole dataset, I am sure that your PC will have a really hard time. The best thing to do when you are working for a specific country is to download a specific dataset from a website like <a href="https://www.geofabrik.de/">Geofabrik</a>.</p>
<p>Geofabrik is a company offering consulting services for OSM related projects. For our luck, they offer clean datasets for each country. <a href="https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/greece.html">Here</a> you can find the OSM data for Greece.</p>
<p>Download the latest <code>pbf</code> file and then we will continue with the next step.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is <code>pbf</code>? <code>pbf</code> is a Protocol Buffer Binary Format and is used as a more efficient alternative of XML. For more info about <code>pbf</code> and why OSM are using it read <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/PBF_Format">here</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Step 2: Cleaning the data</h3>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>.</span>
└── <span>[</span><span>4</span>.1G<span>]</span>  greece-latest.osm</code></pre></div>
<p>I downloaded the file, and now I have a <code>4GB</code> file, full of data. Most of them are not essential to our task, so let’s find out how we can reduce the data to the minimum.</p>
<p>For the process of pruning the dataset, there is a beautiful tool, called <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmfilter">osmfilter</a>.</p>
<p>After reading the documentation, I figured out which data was essential for producing the map, all the addresses that included a postcode. The command to keep only these data is the following</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>osmfilter greece-latest.osm --keep<span>=</span><span>"addr:postcode"</span> <span>&gt;</span> greece-post-only.osm</code></pre></div>
<p>This will take some time, so don’t worry if you cannot see anything printing for a while in the bash.</p>
<p>Now our file size went from <code>4.1GB</code> to <code>37M</code>. Now it is easier for programs like QGIS to handle our file.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>.</span>
├── <span>[</span><span>4</span>.1G<span>]</span>  greece-latest.osm
└── <span>[</span> 37M<span>]</span>  greece-post-only.osm</code></pre></div>
<p>If we want further pruning of our data, let’s keep only the nodes that have a postcode and drop ways and relations. Feel free to read OSM documentation on what do these data represent.</p>
<p>Execute the following command and let’s check the result.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>osmfilter greece-latest.osm --drop-ways --drop-relations --keep<span>=</span><span>"addr:postcode"</span> <span>&gt;</span> greece-post-only-nodes.osm</code></pre></div>
<p>Now you will see that the resulted document will be smaller (hopefully). In our case, it is <code>9MB</code> smaller than the previous one.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>.</span>
├── <span>[</span><span>4</span>.1G<span>]</span>  greece-latest.osm
├── <span>[</span> 28M<span>]</span>  greece-post-only-nodes.osm
└── <span>[</span> 37M<span>]</span>  greece-post-only.osm</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>
<p>As I imported the data in the GQIS, I found that the postcode attribute is nested inside the <code>other_tags</code> field. Find the relevant post I made <a href="https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/380685/unpacking-attributes-from-osm">at gis.stackexcange</a>, but I did not have any luck.</p>
<p>A workaround I found, is to get the data I wanted from Overpass Turbo, executing this query, and download them as GeoJSON:</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>
<span>[</span>out<span>:</span>json<span>]</span><span>[</span>timeout<span>:</span><span>25</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>

<span>{</span><span>{</span>geocodeArea<span>:</span>Greece<span>}</span><span>}</span><span>-</span><span>&gt;</span><span>.</span>searchArea<span>;</span>

<span>(</span>
  
  node<span>[</span><span>"addr:postcode"</span><span>]</span><span>(</span>area<span>.</span>searchArea<span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>)</span><span>;</span>

out body<span>;</span>
<span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
out skel qt<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>Step 3: Import them to QGIS</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>QGIS is a Free and Open Source Geographic Information System</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now it’s time to import our data to QGIS and start playing around to create our boundary map. Not sure what QGIS is? Do not worry, I did not know anything either, but there is a ton of documentation and a lovely community ready to support you.</p>
<p>Open the QGIS app and import the file we downloaded from Overpass Turbo.</p>
<p>To import our data perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click Layer → Add Layer → Add Vector Layer</li>
<li>Then Navigate to the file you created in the previous step and select it</li>
<li>Click Add</li>
</ol>
<p>You should see a screen like the one below if everything worked right.</p>

    <figcaption>Our data successfully loaded.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Also, click a node and you should see in the Feature window the attribute <code>addr:postcode</code>.</p>
<p>If you wish to display a map behind to get a better feeling of your data, in the Browser panel on your left click <code>XYX tiles → OpenStreetmap</code> and voila.</p>
<h3>Step 4: Voronoi to the rescue</h3>
<p>Now that we imported the data what? We need to find an algorithm to somehow connect all these dots and occupy the space they deserve.</p>
<p>Voronoi, a Russian Mathematician, gave us a pretty elegant solution for this problem. The theory behind although technically is pretty complex, the following GIF will help you visualize what we are going to perform with the help of QGIS.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Voronoi_growth_euclidean.gif/220px-Voronoi_growth_euclidean.gif">
    <figcaption>How Voronoi works.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Read more about how Voronoi works <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram">here</a> and let’s continue building this map.</p>
<p>To run the Voronoi algorithm perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the layer that contains our data</li>
<li>Click on Vector → Geometry Tools → Voronoi Polygons</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you can press <code>Run</code> immediately or you can play around with the <code>Buffer region</code> variable. <code>Buffer region</code> is explained <a href="https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/220894/what-does-buffer-mean-in-qgis-voronoi-dialog">here</a>, but also take a look at the meaning in the image below.</p>

<p>Now let’s click Run and check the results (note that the process takes some time, hopefully they enable parallelization of the process in the future).</p>

<h3>Step 5: Connecting Polygons</h3>
<p>Our polygons are ready. But many of them have the same postcode. To merge them into one polygon we will use the <code>Dissolve</code> function.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the layer that contains our Voronoi Polygons</li>
<li>Click on Vector → Geometry Tools → Dissolve</li>
<li>In the Dissolve fields select the <code>addr:postcode</code> to tell our algorithm to merge them based on the postcode attribute</li>

    <figcaption>And now we have the polygons grouped  based on the postcode. But they overflow the land.

<h3>Step 6: Union</h3>
<p>As you can see in the picture above, our polygons are spread across the sea. To avoid that, we can import a boundary map of our country.</p>
<p>I found one map for Greece from <a href="https://geodata.gov.gr/en/dataset/op1a-anuot1kwv-ko1votntwv/resource/b387a8a0-69b9-42a4-a08b-e33136096b95">GeoData.gov</a> and imported the shapefile. This shapefile includes the boundaries for all the municipalities, but it fits our needs.</p>

<p>The results seem promising. I can see a pretty high accuracy in some areas, but unfortunately some areas with only a few nodes are not able to get represented appropriately.</p>

<p>If by any means you are someone from the QGIS or OSM community, I would appreciate your feedback on how to make the map even more accurate. Although this method worked, I feel that higher accuracy can be achieved!</p>
<p>The simplest way to achieve higher accuracy would be to generate more nodes with postcodes. If anyone knows how, please comment or reach me directly on my <a href="https://twitter.com/CostasAlexoglou">twitter</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

	<div>
		
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptual_control_theory">Perceptual Control Theory</a> is a very popular model of how the brain works. Its basic premise is this: our perception of the world is not merely based on what our senses perceive. It is also based on what we “expect to perceive”. For instance, when I am in a car driving down a road, I “expect” to see some trees, perhaps some houses, people walking on the sidewalk, etc. Hence, on staring out of the window of the car, if I continue seeing just these things, the conscious part of my mind will zone out, while my unconscious brain will keep registering these things passing by the window. However, if I suddenly see a Royal Bengal tiger jumping on my car, the unconscious brain will make the conscious brain zap back into attention, and I will reflexively crouch, or perhaps shield my body somehow. </p>



<p>If I were to re-phrase what perceptual control theory says, I would say that it talks about expectation, and how that expectation aligns with the world around us. When I sleep, I expect to be surrounded by relative peace and calm. Hence, on hearing a loud noise, this expectation has been falsified, and I wake up in order to understand what is happening around me. I need to create a new model of the world, in which such disturbances are possible while I sleep. The good thing about these expectations and models of the world is that they can be corrected quickly and decisively. If I don’t expect to see snakes in my house, and I suddenly see a snake one day, my mental model of my house will change to include the possibility of snakes. I’ll now be more careful when I open cupboards and peer down drain pipes, in order to improve my chances of survival. </p>



<p>However, our brain also forms expectations and models of the world that cannot be corrected so quickly and decisively. Hence, we stick to these models for a long period of time, almost always to our detriment. Why am I writing about this? Because I have often made mental models of the world that were incorrect, and proved to have significant impacts on my life in terms of career, social life, etc. In this article, I will talk about one particular example. </p>



<p>I have a mental model of the world which is perhaps more aspirational than realistic. When I pick up a book, or a paper, I expect that if I <strong>really focus</strong>, I will be able to able to read it within a few hours, and well within a day. This is my expectation. However, reality is different. Time after time, I have noticed that I am not able to read more than a couple of pages of a mathematics paper or textbook in one sitting. It is possible that I am slower than usual, or maybe this is the pace at which everybody reads. However, I refuse to accept that this is fundamentally true for me, because I may have ambitions of blazing through lots of books and papers in no time, and doing good research as a consequence. Hence, one part of my brain has an expectation that aligns with my lofty goals, and there is another part of my brain that knows that this is not possible. </p>



<p>What happens as a result of this incoherence? When my “expectation” and “reality” are different, instead of crouching like I did when I saw the tiger, I decide to not read that book or paper at all. I decide to do something completely different, like reading another book. Note the difference: sense perception forces us to change our model of the world much more quickly and easily. If I expect to not see a tiger on the road, and I see a tiger, my model of the world changes instantaneously to include the possibility of tigers on the road. If I expect to see Trump-Pence banners on the roads, and I see Biden-Harris banners instead, my model of the world quickly changes to accommodate the fact that there may be many Democrats in my neighborhood. However, when I have two models of productivity in my brain, even though one may have resulted from past experience, it is very difficult to abandon the aspirational model for the more realistic model. </p>



<p>In this case, the aspirational and ambitious model in my brain suggests that I should be able to blaze through thick tomes in no time if I <strong>really focus</strong>. However, the more realistic model, which has been informed by past experiences, suggests that on average, I do not read more than 4 pages of math in a day. At this stage my brain does two things: it says that the former model may still not be wrong, because I didn’t <strong>really focus</strong> when I read only 4 pages. When I do, I will obviously be able to read more. This is perhaps similar to “True Communism has never really been tried. When the one true Communist establishes a state, humanity will progress like never before.” The other thing that my brain does is that it recognizes that I will probably not be able to truly focus and read large parts of this book. Hence, in order to avoid potentially falsifying my ambitious model, it forces me to read something completely different, through which I can escape judgement. </p>



<p>I have suffered because of this for a long time. I don’t work on homework assignments until the last moment because I think that I will be able to do them the day before class. I don’t work on papers on time because I think that I will be able to do them at the last minute. I don’t read the texts I am supposed to. Because I cannot find a way to falsify the ambitious part of my brain. </p>



<p>Yesterday, I attended a productivity workshop. In that workshop, one interesting perspective that I gained was that I need to manage my expectations. To think “I will be happy if I am able to read 4 pages of this book” as opposed to “I will be happy only when I am able to read this whole book in a short time”. Although it may sound counterintuitive, lowering expectations over the short term may lead to much better results in the long run. Perhaps managing expectations is an extremely important part of my life that I never quite recognized before. If I have a model of the world, I should write down the circumstances in which I will accept it as an accurate model of the world, and also the circumstances in which I will abandon it. In this case, I should write down that if I am not able to read 50 pages of a textbook in a day, I will probably never be able to do it, and hence this expectation is false. I should revise my expectations, until my model of the world aligns with the actual world. </p>



<p>In some ways, this is akin to the scientific method. And it is equally powerful when falsifying theories of black magic, as it is in falsifying delusional theories of the self. </p>

<p>Tesla unlocks the full range of the new 2021 Tesla Model 3 with its latest software update version 2020.48.12.1. Tesla started offering all the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/10/16/tesla-launches-the-refreshed-2021-tesla-model-3-with-range-boost/#range-boost">new Model 3 variants with range boost</a> back in October, but the cars were showing the old ranges on the center display screen.</p>



<p>In the meantime, the owners of imported Tesla Model 3 cars in Germany found out that the new versions of the car had an 82 kWh battery pack instead of the usual ~74 kWh. This discovery was posted by a German Model 3 owner on a local Tesla forum when he took the following screenshot from his vehicle registration book.</p>

<p>So, the mystery of the boosted <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-3/">Tesla Model 3</a> range is solved. This has been possible due to Panasonic producing more energy-dense 2170 cells at its Gigafactory Nevada cell production plant.</p>

<p>The 2020.48.12.1 release notes state the newly extended / unlocked range as:</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>Range Display</strong></p><p>Your car will now display a slightly higher range to more accurately reflect the capacity of the battery.</p><cite>Get the full release notes (2020.48.12.1) at <a href="https://teslascope.com/teslapedia/software/2020.48.12.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TeslaScope.com</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>The North American reservation holders of the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/10/16/tesla-launches-the-refreshed-2021-tesla-model-3-with-range-boost/">new and refreshed Tesla Model 3</a> have not been able to verify the larger battery pack because the European owners received their deliveries first.</p>



<p>Just yesterday I was talking to several new Model 3 reservation holders from the United States, mostly from California, they are all still waiting for their deliveries. Some are hoping their cars will be delivered after Christmas.</p>



<p>The biggest beneficiary of this range boost will be the owners of the Tesla Model 3 Long Range AWD, as it got a staggering +30 miles of extended range in the new 2021 Model 3 version.</p>



<p>Besides this, Tesla is soon going to release the most exciting <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/ota-updates/">software update</a> of the year, the feature-packed <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/v11-update/">firmware version v11</a>.

		<p>His name might not spark wild-eyed fascination with many retro gaming enthusiasts, but Steve Moraff was a little bit of a legend in his own time. When we first <a href="https://intotheverticalblank.com/encyclopedia/go/" target="_self" title="Mt. Fuji towers 3776 meters as Japan’s highest mountain range &nbsp; It’s a striking landmark, that rises almost impossibly out of an unassuming plain, to a pinnacle of ice-capped beauty.&nbsp; After it’s mammoth breadth is realized, it settles back down again into a valley as if it was never there. &nbsp; It was formed by…">go</a>t a PC (non-Atari machine) in the early 1990’s, we jumped on the early CD-Rom craze. &nbsp;The best use of CDs at that time was for “shovel-ware” compilations of share-ware games. One developer out-shined all but Apogee and Id. The developer’s name &nbsp;was Moraffware. &nbsp;Started by Steve Moraff &nbsp;in the mid-80’s, Moraffware would pioneer shareware and especially the shareware &nbsp;RPG genre on DOS machines.</p>
<p>As we plunged into the the various piles of shareware games we found on the shovel-ware cds, Steve Moraff’s name kept surfacing on some very nice titles. He was one of the first developers anywhere to use SVGA graphics so his titles were always colorful and unique to play.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moraff%27s_Revenge">Moraff’s Revenge</a> was one of the first 3D RPGs on the PC Dos platform. These early PCs didn’t have the raw speed on an Atari ST or Amiga, but Steve made some great games given the limitations of the hardware.</p>
<p>I remember some other various Moraff games such as a beautiful Arkanoid clone and probably the best Mahjongg game of its’ time. &nbsp;It seems that Steve has shifted his focus to Mahjongg almost entirely. His <a href="http://www.softwarediversions.com/">current site focuses of on this game type</a>, but also has pages (and the ability to purchase) his classic RPG games:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.softwarediversions.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=28&amp;products_id=68">Moraff’s World</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.softwarediversions.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=28&amp;products_id=69">Moraff’s revenge</a></p>
<p>and probably his best game,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.softwarediversions.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=28&amp;products_id=70">Moraff’s Dungeons of the Unforgiven</a></p>
<p>There is also a<a href="http://www.softwarediversions.com/catalog/index.php?cPath=31"> World Of Games link</a> on his site that lists some of the other&nbsp; classic and relatively recent games he has created.</p>
<p>It looks like Steve is doing well. I would certainly like to see some of his classic RPGs re-made for today’s machines, but with DosBox or Boxster, the originals can still be enjoyed today.</p>

<div id="How-PyNNDescent-works">

<p>PyNNDescent uses neighbor graph based searching to efficiently find good candidates for the nearest neighbors of query points from a large training set. While the basic ideas turn out to be quite simple, the layers of refinements and tricks used to get the highest degree of efficiency complicate things a lot. With that in mind we will begin with the simple naive approach and gradually work out further refinements and details as we go. The core concept, upon which most everything else is based,
is using a nearest neighbor graph to perform a search for approximate nearest neighbors.</p>
<div id="Searching-using-a-nearest-neighbor-graph">
<h2>Searching using a nearest neighbor graph<a href="#Searching-using-a-nearest-neighbor-graph" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Suppose we are given a nearest neighbor graph (let’s ignore, for now, how we can have obtained such a thing without the ability to find nearest neighbors already). By a graph, I simply mean a network – a set of nodes connected by edges. By a nearest neighbor graph I mean that the graph has been derived from data existing in some sort of space for which we have a quantitative notion of similarity, or dissimilarity, or distance. In particular the graph is derived by making each data point a node
and connecting that data point, via edges, to the <span>\(k\)</span> most similar, least dissimilar, or closest other points. We would like to use this graph as an index structure for searching to find the nearest neighbors (points in the graph) of a new query point (potentially not a point in the graph) with respect to that notion of similarity of distance. How can we do this? We can do it via a kind of pruned breadth-first search of the graph, always keeping only the <span>\(k\)</span> best points we’ve found
so far. The algorithm, therefore, looks something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a starting node in the graph (potentially randomly) as a candidate node</li>
<li>Look at all nodes connected by an edge to the best untried candidate node in the graph</li>
<li>Add all these nodes to our potential candidate pool</li>
<li>Sort the candidate pool by closeness / similarity to the query point</li>
<li>Truncate the pool to <span>\(k\)</span> best (as in closest to the query) candidates</li>
<li>Return to step 2, unless we have already tried all the candidates in the pool</li>
</ol>
<p>We can see this play out visually on a small graph. For this case we will let <span>\(k=2\)</span> and have a 2-neighbor graph constructed by points in a plane. The query point will be drawn as an orange ‘x’. We then search, exactly as described, and find ourselves steadily traversing the graph towards the query point.</p>
<p>While that did indeed find the points closest to the query point, it was hardly more efficient than a linear search of all the points – there are only two points we didn’t try! This is ultimately about having such a small graph: while it is good for showing the algorithm clearly, the algorithm doesn’t really scale down that well to this case. If we want to see it providing benefits we’ll need a larger graph. That’s not hard to generate, so let’s see a larger example.</p>
<p>Now, with about as bad a start as we could hope to get, the algorithm efficiently traverses across the graph and find the neighbors of the orange query point, and this time we see that only a small fraction of the total number of points in the graph had to be tried. If we had been a little luckier with our start point we could have done significantly better again. We can scale up to even larger examples:</p>
<p>Again we had about as bad a starting point as possible, but again it very efficiently traverses the graph, steadily improving as it goes, until the algorithm eventually find the nearest neighbors of the orange query point. Notably the algorithm will continue to scale well as the number of points increases, and even as the dimension of the data increases – as long as the data itself has a low enough intrisic dimension.</p>
<p>There are, of course, several things that can be done to refine this algorithm to be a little more efficient, and more flexible at the same time. They include such things as keeping a hashtable of visited nodes to ensure you don’t compute distances twice, and keeping a slightly larger priority queue of candidate nodes to expand – anything with (1+:math:<cite>varepsilon</cite>) of the <span>\(k\)</span>th best candidate found so far will suffice. This latter point allows us greater flexibility in search,
allowing a degree of backtracking around local “optima” in the search. It also provides a parameter which we can tune to get a trade-off between the speed and accuracy that we desire: smaller epsilon gives a faster search, but less accuracy, while a large epsilon can give good accuracy but at the cost of a slower search.</p>
<p>All of this presumed, however, that we had a nearest neighbor graph to start with – the thing that we were using as our search index. The question remains: how are we to build that, since we could potentially just use the nearest neighbor search technique used to build the graph (which presumably has to be cheap) instead of the graph search described here. The answer, as it happens, is that we are going to use the graph search technique to build the graph itself – pulling ourselves up by our
own bootstraps so to speak.</p>
</div>
<div id="NNDescent-for-building-neighbor-graphs">
<h2>NNDescent for building neighbor graphs<a href="#NNDescent-for-building-neighbor-graphs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A good way to get to grips with the NNDescent algorithm for constructing approximate k-neighbor graphs is to think of it in terms of the search algorithm we’ve already described. Suppose we had a decent, but not exact, k-neighbor graph. We could use that graph as our search index – it won’t be great, and our search will be particularly approximate and often get stuck in local minima because of that, but it will still work a lot of the time. So, given that graph we could do a nearest neighbor
search, using that graph as the index, for each and every point in the dataset. Because of the nature of the search we could end up finding new neighbors for a node that are closer than the ones in our not-so-good graph. We could use that information to update our graph – make it better by using these newly found closer neighbors. Having improved the graph, we can run the search again for each and every point in the dataset. Since the graph is better we will do an even better job of finding
neighbors than before and potentially find some new neighbors that will let us update the graph again.</p>
<p>And that’s actually the core of the algorithm. Start with a bad graph, use the nearest neighbor search on that graph to get better neighbors, and make a better graph. Rinse, repeat, and eventually we will end up with a good graph. In fact, the better the graph is, the faster and more accurate the search will run. So each iteration will go faster than the last, and we will steadily converge toward the true k-neighbor graph.</p>
<p>There are a couple things to take note of at this point: a better graph results in a better search, so making a better graph sooner will help the search; finding a good initial candidate node for the search was generically a problem (our animations all had particularly bad initial candidates), but we can always use the point itself as the initial candidate since it is guaranteed to be in the graph. So, given a good initial candidate (the node itself), and a desire to update the graph as soon as
possible, it may not be worth running a full search to exhaustion. Instead we could run the search just far enough to potentially find some new neighbors that we haven’t seen before. The first round of search, starting from the node itself, will only find the neighbors we already have. The second round, however, will step out to neighbors of neighbors (friends of friends if you will), and potentially find some nodes that are closer neighbors than the ones currently in the graph. That would be
enough information to improve the graph – since we would have found new better neighbors. So the algorithm would now run:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with a random graph (connect each node to <span>\(k\)</span> random nodes)</li>
<li>For each node:</li>
<li>Measure the distance from the node to the neighbors of its neighbors</li>
<li>If any are closer then update the graph accordingly, and keep only the <span>\(k\)</span> closest</li>
<li>If any updates were made to the graph then go back to step 2, otherwise stop</li>
</ol>
<p>We can see this play out on some example data (the same data as the medium sized search example):</p>
<p>You can see the graph starts out looking nothing like a <span>\(k\)</span>-neighbors graph – just a mess of edges all over with no structure. Quickly, however, we update the graph, and the better the graph gets the better our updates go. After not very long at all the algorithm is simply refining an already very good graph with few, if any, updates at all actually occurring. We can see this most clearly by looking at things in terms of each round of iteration of the algorithm – consider the graph at
the point where we’ve updated neighbors for every node and we are at step 3, considering whether to loop back to step 2 or not. At each such iteration we can both look at the state of the graph and measure how close we are to the true <span>\(k\)</span>-neighbor graph. We start with a random graph:</p>
<!-- ![Iteration 0](how_pynn_works_naive_nndescent_iter0.png) --><p><a href="https://pynndescent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/how_pynn_works_naive_nndescent_iter0.png"><img alt="Iteration 0" src="https://pynndescent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/how_pynn_works_naive_nndescent_iter0.png"></a></p>
<p>After we have touched each node once and updated the neighbors based on the friends of friends we get the following:</p>
<!-- ![Iteration 1](how_pynn_works_naive_nndescent_iter1.png) --><p><a href="https://pynndescent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/how_pynn_works_naive_nndescent_iter1.png"><img alt="Iteration 1" src="https://pynndescent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/how_pynn_works_naive_nndescent_iter1.png"></a></p>
<p>Already, after just one pass through, the graph looks a whole lot less random. And, indeed, we have already improved from the sort of accuracy of neighbors we would expect at random, to a graph that has 30% of the neighbors correct for each node (on average). That is a much better graph for doing searches on than the purely random graph, so we would expect to be able to do a lot better when we do another iteration performing updates based on friends of friends in this new much better graph.</p>
<!-- ![Iteration 2](how_pynn_works_naive_nndescent_iter2.png) --><p><a href="https://pynndescent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/how_pynn_works_naive_nndescent_iter2.png"><img alt="Iteration 2" src="https://pynndescent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/how_pynn_works_naive_nndescent_iter2.png"></a></p>
<p>So now after just two passes we already have a graph that is 95% accurate! A search on this graph will be quite accurate, especially since we are guaranteed to be starting with a good candidate (the query itself). Running another pass should get a near perfect result.</p>
<!-- ![Iteration 3](how_pynn_works_naive_nndescent_iter3.png) --><p><a href="https://pynndescent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/how_pynn_works_naive_nndescent_iter3.png"><img alt="Iteration 3" src="https://pynndescent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/how_pynn_works_naive_nndescent_iter3.png"></a></p>
<p>The accuracy improved nicely, but you should note that visually there is very little difference between this graph and the previous graph. Very …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

						<p>According to <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-12/uarl-asf121720.php">an announcement in EurekAlert</a>!, The U.S. Army has been researching with Duke University a technological approach that uses robotics and "biohybrid" muscle elements.</p><p>Army researchers claim that robotic systems filled with muscle tissue will deliver a new level of agility and flexibility. In order to maximize efficiency, biohybrid robotics incorporates living organisms into mechanical systems. The team's first applications are legged platforms similar to the LLAMA and Marine Corps Legged Squad Support System (LS3), the legged locomotive and movement adaptation device of the Army.</p><p>"Though impressive in their own right, today's robots are deployed to serve a limited purpose then are retrieved some minutes later," said research scientist Dr. Dean Culver, "ARL wants robots to be versatile teammates capable of going anywhere soldiers can and more, adapting to the needs of any given situation." Culver added, "Organisms outperform engineered robots in so many ways. Why not use biological components to achieve those remarkable capabilities?"</p><figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580835239846-5bb9ce03c8c3?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDl8fHJvYm90fGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" alt="Humanoid robot Robotis Bioloid with the hands in the air, cheering." srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580835239846-5bb9ce03c8c3?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDl8fHJvYm90fGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580835239846-5bb9ce03c8c3?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDl8fHJvYm90fGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580835239846-5bb9ce03c8c3?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDl8fHJvYm90fGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580835239846-5bb9ce03c8c3?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDl8fHJvYm90fGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@anilinverse?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Adam Lukomski</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>In addition, a separate team from Duke University will focus on the characteristics of macroscopic performance of muscles, tendons and ligaments in skiping animals using legged robots.</p><p>The muscle tissue is excellent for generating a certain mechanical strength, and its flexibility is unrivaled in today's robotic service.

<p>It's been a decade since danah boy introduced me to the idea of "email sabbaticals." That's when you go away and turn off your email.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2010/12/08/i-am-offline-on-email-sabbatical-from-december-9-january-12.html">http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2010/12/08/i-am-offline-on-email-sabbatical-from-december-9-january-12.html</a></p>
<p>Not just setting an out-of-office message, but rather deleting all inbound mail and asking correspondents to try again after the break. In her message, boyd explains to those correspondents who know how to reach her mother that this is the only way to reach her.</p>
<p>Here's the rationale: if you allow email to pile up while you're trying to unwind, it'll take months to catch up on when you get back, and you'll immediately burn out, incinerating all the value you got out of your break.</p>
<p>What's more, you'll still fail to clear the backlog – you'll have to declare "email bankruptcy" and fail everyone who'd contacted you anyway. It's a bad deal for you <em>and</em> for the people who email you during your break.</p>
<p>Here's how boyd's email sabbaticals work: six months prior, she informs her collaborators that she'll be taking some protracted downtime; a month before she confirms her commitments to collaborators and composes a checklist to ensure that she meets them prior to departure.</p>
<p>A week in advance, she warns everyone again that she's going offline and shuttering her inboxes. Close family members and her network administrator are given instructions for reaching her while on break, but no one else is.</p>
<p>She leaves, and shuts down her email. She knows she's going to miss new, time-sensitive stuff, but makes peace with it. In return, she gets the peace of mind that comes from knowing that she's going to come home to an empty in-box.</p>
<p>At the close of business today, I'm going on email (and work) sabbatical until Jan 4, 2021. Apart from one live event (the remote Chaos Communications Congress on Dec 27) I won't be accepting emails and I won't be replying to DMs or other messages.</p>
<p><a href="https://rc3.world/">https://rc3.world/</a></p>
<p>I really, really need it.</p>
<p>Over the years, many people have expressed their admiration at my "productivity" – but the dirty secret of that productivity is that work is how I cope with stress.</p>
<p>It's not the worst problem to have: I wrote a whole novel since the crisis, while also launching four books and keeping up with my day-job at EFF.</p>
<p>But working to cope with stress has its limits. It's a good temporary fix, but it's no long-term solution.</p>
<p>For one thing, I've got a serious, untreatable, degenerating chronic pain condition, and working is how I hope with the pain, too – distraction works far better than any prescription meds for me.</p>
<p>But ignoring your body's pain signals is a dangerous tactic. It's why I'm now experiencing the worst continuous pain of my adult life (it's been a stressful year). Last week it was so bad I was walking with a cane.</p>
<p>I say all of this not to humblebrag about my commitment to my work, but rather in the interests of transparency. I'm keenly aware that we live our own blooper reels and everyone else's highlight reels.</p>
<p>I'm grateful for my work habits, truly – but they come at a really high cost, and balancing work-as-distraction and work-as-pathology is really, really hard. If you're wondering how to do what I do, have a little peek into the blooper reel, first.</p>
<p>It's been a high-stress, crazy year. We nearly went broke, then had a spectacular recovery (thank you, Kickstarter backers!), have tried our best to be good parents (with varying degrees of success). We've gone through blazing rows and many sleepless nights.</p>
<p>I've spent most of the year with sores at the corners of my mouth, which I only get under in the most extreme times of stress.</p>
<p>And we've had it <em>good</em>. We're solvent, safe, and healthy. Thinking about what this would be like if any of those changed is terrifying.</p>
<p>Hanging out with my digital community is a huge net benefit to me, but unplugging from that community is something I increasingly value as I head towards my 50th birthday next July.</p>
<p>My first digital community experience was sending IMs to other users of the timeshare mainframe we plugged into when I was six years old, in 1977, when my dad brought home an acoustic coupler and my mom found 1,000' of brown paper towel to feed into the teletype.</p>
<p>Some (most) of my life's most important relationships, friendships, and discussions have taken place over this medium, and an enormous amount of that good stuff started with a conversation with a stranger.</p>
<p>I never felt the outrage that attended the introduction of the telephone into Edwardian England: "Anyone — any wild fool off the street — could simply barge bellowing into one's office or home, preceded only by the ringing of a telephone bell."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mit.edu/hacker/part1.html">https://www.mit.edu/hacker/part1.html</a></p>
<p>For me, finding my people (and being found by them) has been the highlight of my half-century. Touring and speaking turned these digital relationships into personal ones.</p>
<p>But: moderation in all things. I'm writing four of these threads this morning, doing a couple interviews and meetings, and then putting my lid down until 2021 (save for a brief dial-in to CCC on the 27th).</p>
<p>I'm going to swim in our lovely outdoor public pool, which, thankfully, has figured out how to remain open during the pandemic. I'm going read in the backyard hammock and hike in Griffith Park.</p>
<p>I'm not going to answer – or accept – email while I'm gone.</p>
<p>And I say all of this because it's taken a decade for me to really understand what danah was getting at (she's a very smart person and I often benefit from reflecting on our conversations).</p>
<p>And also, to show you a bit of the blooper reel. Coping strategies are great and necessary, but they're no substitute for addressing the underlying problems. I'm proud of the work I do, but I'm also still learning how to do it right.</p>

<p>I'm about to go offline until 2021 and I had planned to do <em>absolutely no work of any sort</em> while on break, but I made an exception, for an exceptional opportunity: the 32nd Chaos Communications Congress, which is remote this year.</p>
<p><a href="https://rc3.world/">https://rc3.world/</a></p>
<p>CCC is – notoriously – held during Christmas week, which means that the attendees are limited to people who either care about tech policy and security more than their families, or people who can talk their families into coming along.</p>
<p>It's one of the best events I've ever attended (I brought my family along). My talk at that event, "The Coming War on General Purpose Computing," has had a long afterlife, in large part because of the kind and thoughtful reactions of the attendees.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUEvRyemKSg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUEvRyemKSg</a></p>
<p>I've been trying to get back ever since but haven't managed it – until this year. RC3 (the first all-remote CCC) has invited me to speak on Dec 27.</p>
<p>I'm doing two back-to-back events: a talk called "What the cyberoptimists got wrong – and what to do about it" then a "fireside chat" (a reading from my book ATTACK SURFACE followed by a Q&amp;A;).</p>
<p>They're back-to-back, starting at 10AM Pacific (7PM CET) and running to 12/9PM.</p>
<p>The tickets are currently sold out, but they've mooted releasing another block. If you're attending, I hope you'll consider tuning into my talk (and of course, as with all CCC talks, these will be online shortly thereafter for public viewing).</p>

<p>The Panama Papers, the Paradise Papers, Swissleaks, Luxembourg Leaks, the Fincen Files – the past decade has been filled with financial secrecy scandals wherein we learned how the world's worst people hide the world's dirtiest money.</p>
<p>Governments have fallen as a result of these leaks. Journalists have been murdered for reporting them, whistleblowers have been imprisoned for telling the truth. These are a high-stakes window on the corruption, self-dealing and viciousness of the 1% and their criminal pals.</p>
<p>One critical revelation is the role that "onshort-offshore" plays in money-laundering: rich countries with a reputation for a strong rule of law and good governance are the lynchpin of global financial secrecy, thanks to lax corporate enforcement.</p>
<p>Money laundering, tax-evasion, bribery and other finance crimes were only possible because places like New Zealand, the City of London, Scotland, and US tax-havens like Delaware, Nevada and Wyoming knowingly abetted them.</p>
<p>Anti-financial-secrecy campaigners have made major progress in shutting down onshore-offshore havens, and now they've scored a massive victory in the USA, with the inclusion of an anti-money-laundering amendment to the defense bill.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/advocates-celebrate-major-us-anti-money-laundering-victory/">https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/advocates-celebrate-major-us-anti-money-laundering-victory/</a></p>
<p>It's a must-pass bill, and there's always intense jockeying to attach other legislation to it, virtually guaranteeing its passage (this is not always a good thing: Trump wants terrible, dangerous changes to internet law included in the bill):</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/its-not-section-230-president-trump-hates-its-first-amendment">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/its-not-section-230-president-trump-hates-its-first-amendment</a></p>
<p>The Corporate Transparency Act requires that all US companies report their true owners to the US Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (Fincen). This will make Fincen investigations vastly cheaper…and more effective.</p>
<p>It's got strong bipartisan support, and is the culmination of a decade of debate, consultation and coalition-building. It passed the House and Senate with a nominally …</p></div></article></div>

All I know is this: Where the topic of GNOME’s health goes, accurate data rarely follows. Of course, there <em>is</em> data — lots of it in fact, in public source code repositories. Though flawed in many ways, it allows us to make comparisons to the past — and maybe predictions for the future: Are a few organizations carrying most of the workload, making them critical points of failure? Are new contributors able to pick up the slack from those who leave? Is the project graying (i.e. increasingly dominated by veterans)?</p><p>In one of my occasional fits of hubris, I set out to process this data to see if I could shake out anything meaningful. I’m usually fine with just satisfying my own curiosity and leaving it at that, but it’s one of those times where the results seem interesting enough for a blog post. So here we are.</p><p>I’m going to lead with the nice graphs and follow on with a <a href="https://hpjansson.org/blag/2020/12/16/on-the-graying-of-gnome/#methodology">section on methodology</a>. The latter is long, boring, and mandatory reading.</p><h2 id="contributors">Active contributors</h2><h3>By generation</h3><figure><a href="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-year-2020.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1920" height="900" src="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-year-2020-1920x900.png" alt="Active GNOME authors per year, first-year cohorts" srcset="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-year-2020-1920x900.png 1920w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-year-2020-300x141.png 300w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-year-2020-768x360.png 768w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-year-2020-1536x720.png 1536w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-year-2020-2048x960.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></a></figure><p>The stacked histogram above shows the number of contributors who touched the project on a yearly basis. Each contributor is assigned to a generational cohort based on the year of their first contribution. The cohorts tend to shrink over time as people leave.</p><p>There’s a special “drive-by” cohort (in a fetching shade of off-white) for contributors who were only briefly involved, meaning all their activity fits in a three-month window. It’s a big group. In a typical year, it numbers 200-400 persons who were not seen before or since. Most of them contribute a single commit.</p><p>According to this, GNOME peaked at slightly above 1,400 contributors in 2010 and went into decline with the GNOME 3.0 release the following year. However, 2020 saw the most contributors in a long time, even with preliminary data — there’s still two weeks to go. Who knows if it’s an anomaly or not. It’s been an atypical year across the board.</p><figure><a href="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1920" height="900" src="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-1920x900.png" alt="Active GNOME authors per month, first-year cohorts" srcset="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-1920x900.png 1920w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-300x141.png 300w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-768x360.png 768w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-1536x720.png 1536w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-2048x960.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></a></figure><p>This is the same histogram, but with per-month bins. There’s a clear periodicity caused by the semiannual release cycle. The peak month was March 2011, right before the <a href="https://www.gnome.org/press/2011/04/gnome-3-0-released-better-for-users-developers-3/">GNOME 3.0 release</a>. About 450 contributors got involved that month.</p><p>The drive-by cohort is relatively smaller on a monthly basis. This makes sense, as it has little overlap from month to month, and the per-year bins tend to add them all up.</p><h3>By affiliation</h3><figure><a href="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-domain-year-2020.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1920" height="900" src="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-domain-year-2020-1920x900.png" alt="Active GNOME authors per year, top-15 domain cohorts" srcset="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-domain-year-2020-1920x900.png 1920w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-domain-year-2020-300x141.png 300w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-domain-year-2020-768x360.png 768w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-domain-year-2020-1536x720.png 1536w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-domain-year-2020-2048x960.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></a></figure><p>Above, the top 15 affiliations of active contributors.

For what it’s worth, it mostly lines up with my memory of things.</p><p>The pattern tracks well with the total despite only capturing a minority portion of it. I think this means that paid and unpaid contributions are driven by the same underlying trends, or that there’s a lot of the former hiding in the latter.</p><h2 id="commitcount">Commit count</h2><h3>By generation</h3><figure><a href="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-commits-firstyear-year-2020.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1920" height="900" src="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-commits-firstyear-year-2020-1920x900.png" alt="Number of GNOME commits per year, first-year cohorts" srcset="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-commits-firstyear-year-2020-1920x900.png 1920w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-commits-firstyear-year-2020-300x141.png 300w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-commits-firstyear-year-2020-768x360.png 768w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-commits-firstyear-year-2020-1536x720.png 1536w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-commits-firstyear-year-2020-2048x960.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></a></figure><p>Here I’m counting the number of commits per year in the various cohorts.</p><p>At first glance, this looks much less dire.

But:</li><li>Every metric has the project peaking around 2010.</li><li>A diminishing number of veterans is doing an increasing share of the work.</li><li>Although recruitment is stable, newcomers don’t seem to be hitting their stride in terms of commits.</li><li>Corporate sponsorship is probably necessary to keep the project going, but the field of sponsors has kept thinning.</li></ul><p>I think GNOME is addressing the risk factors competently by modernizing infrastructure (<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/">GitLab</a>, <a href="https://discourse.gnome.org/">Discourse</a>). This has obvious value even in the absence of quantifiable results, but it’ll be interesting to see if the effect can be measured over the next couple of years.</p><p>Diminished enthusiasm may also be due to there being fewer ways for a new contributor to make their mark or assume a role of responsibility. GNOME has become more conservative, certainly much more so than it was a decade ago in the run-up to GNOME 3. The rationale and phrasing in <a href="https://discourse.gnome.org/t/new-gnome-versioning-scheme/4235">the announcement of the new versioning scheme</a> (e.g. <em>“Radical technological and design changes are too disruptive for maintainers, users, and developers”</em>) seems indicative of this trend<sup>1</sup>.</p><h2 id="methodology">Notes on methodology</h2><p>So what’s wrong with this analysis? If you’re so inclined, you can find the details under the next couple of subheadings and pass harsh, harsh judgement.</p><p>I’ve set the unscientific rigor bar high enough to hopefully yield something useful, but low enough that I could do it in my spare time and not get stuck in the dreaded state commonly known as “90% done”.</p><h3>Module selection</h3><p>I aggregated data from <a href="https://github.com/hpjansson/fornalder/blob/45d4e9703dfa1fed1f9396b2cfc6f8425fae9389/projects/gnome-repos">189 Git repositories</a>. The vast majority of these are hosted on <code>gnome.org</code>, with a handful from <code>freedesktop.org</code> and <code>github.com</code>. Commits are uniquely identified by their commit hash, meaning trivial duplicates are counted only once.</p><p>GNOME has always been a decentralized, big-tent project, so it’s not obvious how to delineate it. I’ve tried to be fair by including most of the repositories from a full meta-gnome-desktop jhbuild, including fairly low-level dependencies like Cairo, Pango, and Pipewire, as well as past, present and would-be flagship applications under the GNOME umbrella. Documentation and infrastructure is represented, as are many archived projects (e.g. ORBit2, Bonobo, Sabayon, GAL).</p><p>I was a little uncertain about what to do with X.Org and Wayland. In the end I decided to include the latter, but not the former, since Wayland has close ties to GNOME (it even references GTK+ in its TODO file), while X.Org has its roots in the much older XFree86.</p><p>Mono is another project I resisted including; its development was tangential to GNOME proper, diverging completely in the most recent decade. However, I did include GtkSharp and several GNOME-hosted C# applications common on desktops in the 2005-2010 time frame.</p><p>Since I haven’t established hard criteria for module selection, it’s subject to various biases. Older code is probably underrepresented, since providers of important functionality were more loosely attached to the project early on (e.g. GNOME Online Accounts and Telepathy got pulled in, should I have included Gaim or Pidgin too? How about XChat?).</p><p>Anyway, the list isn’t terrible, but there’s room for improvement.</p><h3>Contributor identities</h3><p>Similar studies often identify contributors by their e-mail addresses. I used full author names instead, since there’s good reason to think they’re more stable over a 20-year time span. We’re fairly consistent in spelling our own names, and we change them rarely (often never). On the other hand, e-mail addresses come and go with different hosting arrangements, employers, etc.</p><p>An added challenge with this approach is that sometimes different people have the exact same name. In practice, I’m not aware of any instances of this happening in GNOME. It seems to be rare enough that I doubt it’d introduce significant error in most projects.</p><p>I should add here that the drive-by cohort depends on a fair amount of hindsight (you never know when someone might come back with more contributions, but the likelihood drops off quickly as time passes). This means the cohorts for 2020 are preliminary. They’ll be a lot more accurate with another run late next year.</p><h3>Domain names</h3><p>I’m using e-mail domain names as a proxy for organizations in some of the graphs. This is a notoriously unreliable approach for at least three reasons:</p><ol><li>Contributors often use personal e-mail addresses for paid work, leading to significant undercounting in general.</li><li>Specific companies may require their employees (or ask them nicely) to use company e-mail for collaboration. Out of the listed companies, I know of at least one that definitely did this. However, there are many that don’t, and these will be comparatively less well represented.</li><li>The mapping between DNS and organizations isn’t one-to-one. A company may operate under multiple names or TLDs (e.g. <code>.co.uk</code> and <code>.com</code>).</li></ol><p>Despite these weaknesses, it’s common to slice the data this way. It’s difficult to do better without access to semi-closed data troves, and depending on your views on privacy and ability to handle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data">PII</a> safely, it might not be something you’d want to get into anyway. But I bet you’d be well-positioned for it if you were, say, the corporate owner of both LinkedIn and GitHub.</p><p>When grouping by organization, the goal is to get an idea of which outside entities are sponsoring contributions. Therefore, I’ve filtered out addresses from the biggest mass e-mail providers like <code>@gmail.com</code> and project-centric providers of personal accounts (e.g. <code>@gnome.org</code>, <code>@gtk.org</code>).</p><p>I took the liberty of reassigning the personal domains of a few extra prolific authors who would’ve otherwise showed up as individual organizations. Since there’s no way I’m doing it for everyone, this introduces some bias. The full details are in <a href="https://github.com/hpjansson/fornalder/blob/45d4e9703dfa1fed1f9396b2cfc6f8425fae9389/projects/gnome-meta.json">the project’s metadata file</a> (see: <a href="https://hpjansson.org/blag/2020/12/16/on-the-graying-of-gnome/#code">code</a>).</p><h3>Version control systems</h3><p>Changeovers in version control systems divide GNOME’s VCS history into three eras with noticeable discontinuities between them.</p><h4>Before 1998: Dark ages</h4><p>In the Bad Old Days, Free Software would often use plain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_Control_System">RCS</a> or no version control at all.

Notice, incidentally, that the theory of syntactic features developed earlier suffices to account for the system of base rules exclusive of the lexicon.
Of course, a subset of English sentences interesting on quite independent grounds is necessary to impose an interpretation on an abstract underlying order.
We have already seen that the natural general principle that will subsume this case can be defined in such a way as to impose the traditional practice of grammarians.
It must be emphasized, once again, that relational information is not quite equivalent to a parasitic gap construction.

						<p>Researchers have created a new microscope that can visualize relatively large pieces of cell-resolved tissue to help surgeons examine tumor margins within minutes from removal.</p><p>Removable tissue is typically sent to a hospital laboratory where specialists either freeze it or treat it with chemical agents until they make extremely thin slices to be mounted on a slide. This careful selection and mounting is a time-consuming procedure that involves advanced machinery and a bench of professionals. </p><p>"Current methods to prepare tissue for margin status evaluation during surgery have not changed significantly since first introduced over 100 years ago," said study co-author Ann Gillenwater, M.D., a professor of head and neck surgery at MD Anderson. "By bringing the ability to accurately assess margin status to more treatment sites, the DeepDOF has potential to improve outcomes for cancer patients treated with surgery."</p><p>Researchers at Rice University and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center developed the modern microscope which can easily view relatively thick tissue with cell-level resolution. It was developed by Rice engineers and Applied Physicists and was presented in a study published in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Science</em> this week.</p><figure><iframe width="356" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Iv1wBvPMguE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>The microscope uses a cheap conventional optic lens for photographing entire tissues. The tool provides depths of field up to five times the existing state-of-the-art microscope. Using an AI technique dubbed "DeepDOF", the microscope software employs a deep learning network that can analyze vast volumes of data. </p><p>To train the dataset, Investigators showed 1,200 photographs from a database of histological (cell) slides to the system. The system would then capture and process photographs in less than two minutes.</p><p>"Traditionally, imaging equipment like cameras and microscopes are designed separately from imaging processing software and algorithms," said study co-lead author Yubo Tang, a postdoctoral research associate in the lab of co-corresponding author Rebecca Richards-Kortum. "DeepDOF is one of the first microscopes that's designed with the post-processing algorithm in mind."</p><p>According to the authors, data developed from the device provides a profound learning histopathology of intact specimens with comprehensive depth of field in real time. In the long term, the DeepDOF microscope may contribute considerably to the evaluation of intact biopsy specimens and surgical organisms, in particular for intra-operative assessment and in restricted tools.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	

	<p>ClickHouse is a polyglot database that can talk to many external systems using dedicated engines or table functions. In modern cloud systems, the most important external system is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_storage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">object storage</a>. First, it can hold raw data to import from or export to other systems (aka a data lake). Second, it can offer cheap and highly durable storage for table data. ClickHouse now supports both of these uses for S3 compatible object storage.</p><p>The first attempts to marry ClickHouse and object storage were merged more than a year ago. Since then object storage support has evolved considerably. In addition to the basic import/export functionality, ClickHouse can use object storage for MergeTree table data. While this functionality is still experimental, it has already attracted a lot of attention at meetups and webinars. In this article, we will explain how the integration works.</p><p><h2 id="h-s3-table-function">S3 table function</h2>
</p><p>ClickHouse has a powerful method to integrate with external systems called ‘table functions’. Table functions allow users to export/import data into other sources, and there are plenty of sources available, e.g. MySQL Server, ODBC or JDBC connection, file, url, and, lately, S3-compatible storage. At the time of writing the s3 table function is not in <a href="https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/sql-reference/table-functions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the official list</a>, but it should be fixed soon. The basic syntax is the following:</p><p><code>s3(path, [aws_access_key_id, aws_secret_access_key,] format,</code>  <code>structure, [compression])</code></p><p>Input parameters</p><div><ul>
<li><code>path</code> — bucket url. Path to file.&nbsp; Supports following wildcards in readonly mode: *, ?, {abc,def} and {N..M} where N, M — numbers, `’abc’, ‘def’ — strings.</li>
<li><code>format</code> — The <a href="https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/interfaces/formats/#formats" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">format</a> of the data.</li>
<li><code>structure</code> — Structure of the table. Format ‘column1_name column1_type, column2_name column2_type, …’.</li>
<li><code>compression</code> parameter is optional, currently ‘gzip’ is the only option but other methods are being added.</li>
</ul>
</div><div><pre><code>INSERT INTO tripdata
SELECT *
FROM s3('https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/altinity-clickhouse-data/nyc_taxi_rides/data/tripdata/data-20*.csv.gz',&nbsp;
'CSVWithNames',&nbsp;
'pickup_date Date, id UInt64, vendor_id String, tpep_pickup_datetime DateTime, tpep_dropoff_datetime DateTime, passenger_count UInt8, trip_distance Float32, pickup_longitude Float32, pickup_latitude Float32, rate_code_id String, store_and_fwd_flag String, dropoff_longitude Float32, dropoff_latitude Float32, payment_type LowCardinality(String), fare_amount Float32, extra String, mta_tax Float32, tip_amount Float32, tolls_amount Float32, improvement_surcharge Float32, total_amount Float32, pickup_location_id UInt16, dropoff_location_id UInt16, junk1 String, junk2 String',&nbsp;
'gzip');

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 238.439 sec. Processed 1.31 billion rows, 167.39 GB (5.50 million rows/s., 702.03 MB/s.)</code></pre>
</div><p>Note the wildcards! They allow you to import multiple files in a single function call. For example, our favorite <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NYC taxi trips dataset</a> that is stored in one file per month can be imported with a single SQL command:</p><p><strong>On an Altinity.Cloud ClickHouse instance it takes me less than 4 minutes to import a 1.3B rows dataset!</strong></p><p>A few important hints:</p><div><ul>
<li>As of the 20.10 ClickHouse version, wildcard paths do not work properly with ‘generic’ S3 bucket URLs, region specific one is required. So we have to use:<br><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; “https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/altinity-clickhouse-data/”,<br></em>instead of<br><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; “https://altinity-clickhouse-data.s3.amazonaws.com/”</em></li>
<li>On the other hand, single file download can use convenient bucket URLs.</li>
<li>The S3 import performance heavily depends on the level of client side parallelism. In glob mode multiple files can be processed in parallel. The example above used 32 insert threads. If you have a smaller server and VM try setting higher values of max_insert_threads setting. It can be done by a ‘SET’ command, for example:
<p><code>set max_threads=32, max_insert_threads=32;<br></code></p></li>
<li>From the other side, ‘input_format_parallel_parsing’ setting may result in overcommitting the memory, so better to turn it off.</li>
</ul>
</div><p>S3 table function can be used not only for imports but for exports as well! This is how an ‘ontime’ dataset can be uploaded to S3.</p><div><pre><code>INSERT INTO FUNCTION s3('https://altinity-clickhouse-data.s3.amazonaws.com/airline/data/ontime2/2019.csv.gz', '*****', '*****', 'CSVWithNames', 'Year UInt16, &lt;other 107 columns here&gt;, Div5TailNum String', 'gzip') SELECT *
FROM ontime_ref
WHERE Year = 2019

Ok.

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 43.314 sec. Processed 7.42 million rows, 5.41 GB (171.35 thousand rows/s., 124.93 MB/s.)</code></pre>
</div><p>Uploading is pretty slow because we can not benefit from the parallelism in this case. ClickHouse can not automatically split the data into multiple files, so only one file can be uploaded at a time. There is a feature request to enable automatic partitioning when inserting to an external table function. That would make export more efficient and convenient.</p><p>Also it is a bit annoying that ClickHouse requires table structure to be supplied to the S3 table function. This is going to be improved in the future releases as well.</p><p><h2 id="h-clickhouse-storage-architecture">ClickHouse storage architecture</h2>
</p><p>S3 table function is a convenient tool for exporting or importing data but it can not be used in real insert/select workloads. The closer integration with ClickHouse storage system is required. Let’s look at ClickHouse storage architecture in more detail.</p><div><ul>
<li>Storage policies define what volumes can be used, and how data migrates from volume to volume;</li>
<li>Volumes allow to organize multiple ‘disk’ devices together;</li>
<li>Disk represents the physical device or mount point.</li>
</ul>
</div><div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/36Pvq-MZVcWezKbm3tYvkh-IuOSW2HMoqo9AqmETg6zOooXZNurWZ4hELaHRw9M1rPli7GP7uOM1YPmjZTqFaR_ebZ-M_s6PPRgQM6kqQtkCPP19bIOjBLwBISEsl5kxOug2sky-" alt="storage configuration" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
</div><p>When this storage design was implemented in early 2019, ClickHouse supported only one type of disk that maps to OS mount points. A few months later the ClickHouse development team added an extra abstraction layer inside the disk itself, that allows to plug in different disk types. As one can probably guess the rationale for this was object storage integration. The new disk type ‘S3’ was added shortly after. It encapsulated the specifics of communicating with S3-compatible object storage. Now we can configure S3 ‘disks’ in ClickHouse, and store all or some data on the object storage.</p><p><h2 id="h-object-storage-configuration">Object storage configuration</h2>
</p><p>Disks, volumes, and storage policies can be defined in the main ClickHouse configuration file config.xml or, better, in the custom file inside /etc/clickhouse-server/config.d folder. Let’s define the disk S3 first:</p><p><strong>config.d/storage.xml:</strong></p><p>This is a very basic configuration, ClickHouse supports quite a lot of different options here; we will discuss some of them later.</p><p>Once the S3 disk is configured, it can be used in volume and storage policy configuration. We can setup several policies for different use cases:</p><div><ul>
<li>S3 volume in a policy next to other volumes. It can be used for TTL or manual moves of table partitions.</li>
<li>S3 volume in a policy with no other volumes. This is an S3-only approach.</li>
</ul>
</div><div><pre><code>&lt;yandex&gt;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/s3only&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/policies&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/storage_configuration&gt;
&lt;/yandex&gt;</code></pre>
</div><p>Now let’s try to create some tables and move data around.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 id="h-inserting-data">Inserting data</h2>
</p><p>We will be using an ‘ontime’ dataset for this example. You can get it from <a href="https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/getting-started/example-datasets/ontime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ClickHouse Tutorial</a>, or download from an Altinity S3 bucket. The table has 193M rows and 109 columns, that’s why it is interesting to see how it performs with S3, where file operations are expensive. The reference table name is ‘ontime_ref’ and it uses default EBS volume. We can now use it as a template for experiments with S3.</p><div><pre><code>CREATE TABLE ontime_tiered AS ontime_ref
ENGINE = MergeTree
PARTITION BY Year
ORDER BY (Carrier, FlightDate)
<mark>TTL toStartOfYear(FlightDate) + interval 3 year to volume 's3'
SETTINGS storage_policy = 'tiered';</mark>

CREATE TABLE ontime_s3 AS ontime_ref
ENGINE = MergeTree
PARTITION BY Year
ORDER BY (Carrier, FlightDate)
<mark>SETTINGS storage_policy = 's3only';</mark></code></pre>
</div><p>‘ontime_tiered’ table is configured to store a full 3 years of data on block storage, and move earlier data to S3. ‘ontime_s3’ is the S3-only table.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, let’s insert some data. Our reference table has data up to March 31st, 2020.</p><div><pre><code>INSERT INTO ontime_tiered SELECT * from ontime_ref WHERE Year=2020;

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.634 sec. Processed 1.83 million rows, 1.33 GB (2.89 million rows/s., 2.11 GB/s.)</code></pre>
</div><p>That was almost instant. The data still goes to the normal disk. What about the S3 table?</p><div><pre><code>INSERT INTO ontime_s3 SELECT * from ontime_ref WHERE Year=2020;

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 15.228 sec. Processed 1.83 million rows, 1.33 GB (120.16 thousand rows/s., 87.59 MB/s.)</code></pre>
</div><p>Same amount of rows takes 25 times more to insert!&nbsp;</p><div><pre><code>INSERT INTO ontime_tiered SELECT * from ontime_ref WHERE Year=2015;

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 16.701 sec. Processed 7.21 million rows, 5.26 GB (431.92 thousand rows/s., 314.89 MB/s.)&nbsp;

INSERT INTO ontime_s3 SELECT * from ontime_ref WHERE Year=2015;

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 15.098 sec. Processed 7.21 million rows, 5.26 GB (477.78 thousand rows/s., 348.33 MB/s.)</code></pre>
</div><p>Once data lands on S3 insert performance degrades quite a lot. This is certainly not desirable for a tiered table, so there is a special volume level setting that disables TTL moves on insert completely, and runs it in the background only. Here is how it can be configured:</p><div><pre><code>&lt;policies&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;tiered&gt;

<p>Last week I <a href="https://twitter.com/fatih/status/1338272277712969730">announced on Twitter that I’m leaving the U.S.</a> and going back to my country. I’m writing these lines from my home in Ankara, Turkey. Many people have asked me <em>why</em> I am leaving. 2020 was one of the most dramatic years in modern history due to the pandemic. Still, there are many other points, and I wanted to share my journey and feelings.</p>
<p>I also want to leave a trail for myself, for the future Fatih, to remind myself how things can sometimes <em>evolve</em> in a very natural (and unexpected) way.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-started">How it started</h2>
<p>It’s crucial in the first place to understand why I moved to the U.S. As some of you know, I was working for DigitalOcean, which is a cloud company based in NYC. I was working remotely (before it became cool) for almost four years for DigitalOcean. The work was challenging, and I had a lot of fun during my time there. We created many internal and external products (i.e., Managed Kubernetes offering), and it’s something I’m very proud of.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/c309d2b056548c0fcc9525ad9379a220768a9fe7/879a5/images/why-i-left-the-us-2.jpeg" alt="Kubecon 2018, Seattle"> <figcaption>

</figure>

<p>However, there was always the feeling that I should be in the U.S. for the <em>next big thing</em> (whatever that is). Most of my friends gradually moved abroad (mostly to the U.S.) over the past 5-10 years. With time, friends and family members around me also started questioning my lifestyle. They started asking questions like: “Why are you still living in Turkey?” or “Why is someone like you not living abroad, such as in a European country or U.S.?”</p>
<p>I received these kinds of questions most of the time, but it increased a lot in the 2018/2019 years. At the end of 2018, my wife and I decided that moving abroad to a Western country could be a nice improvement and that we should give it a shot. My daughter was due in 2019, so my wife wouldn’t work for 1-2 years as she wanted to take care of her. That was the perfect time to do the switch (more on this later).</p>
<p><strong>Which country would that be?</strong> I was born and grew up in Germany, and being a German citizen also means that Germany was always the first place in my head. Half of my family is still living there, so it would entirely make sense to move to Germany. However, my wife wanted to live in an English-speaking country. Because we once lived in San Francisco temporarily in 2013/2014 and most of our friends moved to Bay Area, we focused on living there.</p>
<figure>

</figure>

<p>Once we decided where we wanted to live, I started looking around and preparing myself for the interviews in Spring 2019. I talked to various companies and looked for a place where I could work on the things I was passionate about. The interview process and later the negotiation part was a very energy-draining process (some of you know this already), so I won’t go into that.</p>
<p>In the end, I had several offers from several companies (all based in the Bay Area), and I accepted an offer from GitHub to lead the Go framework and libraries team. This position was the perfect job, and it had the potential for me to do impactful work at GitHub.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b6e2d08586ce6375596f5e4c3c9473efbad7ccac/13151/images/why-i-left-the-us-4.jpeg" alt="My first day at GitHub (HQ, San Francisco)"> <figcaption>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p><strong>I joined GitHub in August 2019</strong>, but because we didn’t have any place to live and it would be challenging for us to look for a new house with two kids (one being a newborn), I came alone. GitHub supported me a lot during this time, and I could find a lovely apartment at the end of August. I bought all the furniture and the things that we needed to function as a family of four. Once I finished, I flew back to Turkey and brought the family back to the Bay Area. It was October 2019, when my kids and my wife finally arrived in the U.S.</p>
<h2 id="life-in-the-us">Life in the U.S.</h2>
<p>Let me explain why we decided to live in the Bay Area:</p>
<ul>
<li>Great job and career opportunities</li>
<li>One of the best weather climates in the world (if you don’t count the wildfires)</li>
<li>Nature and parks</li>
<li>A diverse and welcoming place for immigrants like us</li>
<li>We lived with my wife once temporarily in San Francisco for around six months and knew the area very well</li>
<li>There were friends we knew from Turkey</li>
</ul>
<p>As a side note, <strong>we didn’t move for a better financial life.</strong> We were already comfortable, and I want to make sure that’s known throughout the blog post. I understand that’s one of the biggest reasons people move abroad from countries like Turkey (and I fully support that), but for me, that wasn’t the case.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8c56ff3360bf9cf27e385b3c59237fc58a0c0b02/0749e/images/why-i-left-the-us-6.jpeg" alt="I still need to buy furniture, for now, I was sleeping on this mattress."> <figcaption>

</figure>

<p>The first couple of months were not easy due to the adoption of a new country. Because I have traveled a lot to the U.S., I already knew how things work. But for my wife and the kids, that wasn’t the case. Even small things like “what kind of milk should we get?” or “what bread tastes good?” took some time to figure out. These were small concerns but worth mentioning because all of these eventually add up.</p>
<p>We slowly started meeting new friends, had gatherings with some of our old friends, etc. I applied for a driver’s license and also bought a car, which was very much needed because the U.S. is mostly a car-centric country. Once we had the car, we also started to explore our surrounding neighborhoods and cities. It was so great. Each weekend we would go somewhere in the Bay Area, and as I said, the Bay Area has many things to offer. It’s one of the best metropolitan areas in the world.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ce48e868cda0e80fe27e181bccc935edd16cb92c/32472/images/why-i-left-the-us-7.jpeg" alt="A weekend trip to Sausalito, CA."> <figcaption>

</figure>

<p>I also started going to the GitHub office. Our apartment was just next to a BART station, so it was convenient to go to the office. It was also something I wanted a lot. Working for years and years remotely, you miss being among people and working from an office. My wife also supported me a lot during this time, so every Tuesday and Thursday (sometimes it would be just Tuesday), I would go to the office.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/bd5c7bb1588a003af95998b4872a923e4ab51fe2/5947f/images/why-i-left-the-us-8.jpeg" alt="My favorite place in the GitHub San Francisco office."> <figcaption>
            <p>My favorite place in the GitHub San Francisco office.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Those days were just fantastic. And because GitHub was a remote-first company, the office was designed in a way with many great amenities. We had a library + lounge area where speaking and eating were forbidden. I would usually work from there. We also had a coffee shop inside the office (with real baristas and dope coffee). As a coffee lover, I loved every single bit. <strong>Being at the office just made me happy.</strong></p>
<p>The kids also started loving the area. My son started going to a preschool and picked up English words quickly. It wasn’t easy for him because he couldn’t communicate his needs anymore, but he slowly adapted. And seeing his progress brought us a lot of happiness because one of the reasons we wanted to live abroad was so that the kids could pick up a foreign language.</p>
<p>Due to the visa restrictions, my wife wasn’t able to work legally. I was on H1B, and my wife on H4. <strong>Unfortunately, the H4 visa restricts spouses to work legally in the U.S.</strong> But as I said earlier, because we had a newborn daughter, it wasn’t an issue. She wanted to take care of her for one year until she would looking for a job.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, GitHub was going to apply for the Green Card process, giving her the legal foundations to work here. Previously she was working for Deloitte and was a CPA in Turkey. Hence, the plan was to get the training and the necessary education to be a CPA in the U.S. and then start working once we got the Green Card.
As you see, the initial 4-5 months were pretty good. Everything was on track and going according to the plan. We had a great start at the beginning.</p>
<p>In December, we started hearing about the case in Wuhan, China. A deadly virus has begun to spread. A couple of months later, we heard from the news that a ship in California was infected. We found ourselves at the beginning of the pandemic. Everything happened so fast that we even didn’t know what to do.</p>
<h2 id="pandemic">Pandemic</h2>
<p>Just like everyone else, we didn’t know what was going on. <strong>Everything just happened instantly</strong>. I think the first instinct and feeling I had at that time was: “I’m stranded in the U.S. alone. I have a family to take care of, and I’ll have to do everything in my hands to make that happen”. Of course, as a tech worker, financially, we were in a good position in the Bay Area. But the pandemic slightly changed that perspective, especially for me.</p>
<p>Gradually, things got worse and worse. They closed down the schools, afterward the playgrounds as well. I wasn’t able to go to the office anymore. We got stuck at home with our two kids. And any parent knows how miserable it if you’re staying for an extended period at home with the kids. We realized that being cut off from the family and support network made things a lot harder.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/96b1c44f772de989ad47df8485c9b6b7d469edf5/2145e/images/why-i-left-the-us-9.jpeg" alt="Preparing a birthday party for my son&amp;rsquo;s birthday (due to the pandemic it was just the four of us)"> <figcaption>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>By now social distancing had started. We would probably experience the same thing in Turkey, but it would be quite different. In Turkey, friends with families would arrange for one of the parents to come and stay with them for months. There is a vast network, and culturally, people lived with their parents. So, it was a common thing where your parent would live with you.</p>
<p>For us, <strong>being in the Bay Area meant that we didn’t have this support network.</strong> It was just extremely difficult for my wife and me. I started to sleep around 8/9 pm with the kids and then wake up around 4 am to work without disruption for a couple of hours. In the morning, my wife would take care of the kids, and then during the evening, I would cook the food or take care of the kids. I’m not sure how we would handle the pandemic without my wife’s extraordinary support. As I said, it wasn’t easy, and things didn’t get better.</p>

  </p>

  <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>A scheduling faux-pas earlier this year led to the accidental discovery of a best practice that has improved knowledge sharing, discussion, and documentation at thredUP while requiring minimal time investment.</p>
<h2 id="an-odd-handoff">An Odd Handoff</h2>
<p>I work on the thredUP merch-science team as Director of Engineering. The merch-science team has always been good about collaboration between product leaders and engineering to ensure that we are fully covered in the case of vacations, leaves of absence, and departures.</p>
<p>This past fall, what would have been a routine handoff was complicated when I scheduled time off  that began the day a product leader returned from a week away, giving us zero overlap. thredUP’s marketplace saw huge shifts over the course of the pandemic, and even though she was only gone for a week, there was a fair bit of catch-up to do. I addressed this issue by writing up a digest of everything our team learned about the marketplace that week and the decisions we made based on those learnings. I jokingly titled the document “The Weekly Jenn”, as it was intended only for her, sent her the link, then shelved my laptop for a much-needed respite.</p>
<h2 id="the-revelation">The Revelation</h2>
<p>When I returned to work, I was surprised to find many requests for access to this document; it was duplicated and widely shared in my absence. It fostered discussion across teams and with thredUP’s executives. With so many people getting value from “The Weekly Jenn”, what was intended as a one-off morphed into an actual weekly digest. After continuing to write weekly digests for the past quarter and seeing the results, I am convinced it is a best practice more teams should adopt. The rest of this article will detail the problems this digest solves and best practices for writing the digest itself.</p>
<h2 id="problems-solved">Problems Solved</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visibility and Transparency</strong><br>
The merch-science team manages thredUP’s two sided marketplace and hence has wide-ranging responsibilities that affect most other teams in some way. This makes disseminating learning and decision making problematic, but I think this problem is largely resolved by writing up major happenings.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion</strong><br>
Another benefit is that this document is a great way to foster discussion. The Weekly is a Google doc open for comments to everyone in the company, and in practice, people make great use of comments, asking and answering questions, pointing out opportunities for collaboration, highlighting areas for follow-up, and celebrating wins.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong><br>
Lastly, this document is turning into a piece of our institutional memory and knowledge management. Institutional memory in practice usually means “the memories of the longest tenured employees”, but this is less than ideal, even at a company like thredUP with many long-tenured folks. Some issues and questions tend to recur, and remembering what decisions were made or which experiments succeeded or failed is often insufficient. The context surrounding what decisions we made can be as critical to understand as the decisions themselves, and in a growing company facing shifting consumer behavior, context can change very quickly. In addition to helping future decisions, I also see this document as a great onboarding resource as we continue to grow our merch-science team.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h2>
<p>With the above problems in mind, I’ve arrived at a handful of best practices for starting and maintaining a weekly digest:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set reasonable expectations</strong><br>
I made it clear from the outset, especially to executives, to expect a low-polish document. We’re all busy enough and I doubt maintaining such a document is sustainable if it’s tacking another four hours of work on to your week.</li>
<li><strong>Back it up with data</strong><br>
Include data, graphs, and charts <em>and</em> link to sources. This provides further transparency to everyone viewing the document and will save a lot of time in the future should you find yourself revisiting problems and decisions discussed in the digest.</li>
<li><strong>Keep it simple</strong><br>
Make the writing as accessible to the widest group of people at your company that you reasonably can. Tailoring content to your audience is a critical skill for engineering leadership; I’ve found it beneficial having another vehicle to refine this skill.</li>
<li><strong>Make it a habit</strong><br>
Share the document in the same place every week with a short summary of this week’s topics. We use a public, well-trafficked Slack channel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you to Eddie Salazar and Teague Hopkins for reviewing drafts of this post.</p>

<![CDATA[Why Another C++ (and More) Conference?]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
  
      <p>For those of you late to the party, Shepherd’s Oasis and I are starting <a href="https://twitter.com/__phantomderp/status/1338582889487855618">a new Systems Programming conference named CoSy Tech</a>! There’s the lingering question from the people outside of my immediate circle who keep asking: <!--more-->why?</p>

<p>It’s a good question. After all, it’s not like we have a shortage of C++ conferences. C++ Paris, C++ on Sea, CppCon, C++Now, Pacific++, MeetingC++, code::dive, Italian C++… there’s a lot of C++ conferences, user groups, and meetups that have really come to the table to play. So…</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>There are a number of reasons to start a new Systems Programming conference. The two primary reasons are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Broadening the scope to accept folks from other professional backgrounds, hobbies, and walks of life; and,</li>
  <li>Getting out from the crushing despair that is the current landscape to survive.</li>
</ul>



<p>Several people (myself included) noticed that there <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2018/11/21/">was no conference for C programmers</a>. A lot of my work ties to C, talks to C, and as I’ve begun to uncover much more deeply there are a large number of people who have forsaken C++ for C intentionally or use plain C because their environment offers no alternatives. That means there’s a wealth of modern, current C practices that aren’t really elucidated upon by current literature. Meanwhile, most mainstream text about C spends time dunking on it (myself included!), talking about its vulnerabilities, or talking about it as “that ancient thing we need to worry about every now and then”.</p>

<p>How do these people make do?</p>

<p>So, we’re going to invite those developers into the fold, to talk about what makes their code successful in professional and hobby environments. This doesn’t apply to just C or C++, of course: Rust, Zig, FORTH, Nim, OCaml, Haskell, and many more languages have gotten a chance to solve some problems people have. I’d like to give those people a seat at the table and have them focus on <em>how they used their tools to solve the problem at hand</em>, rather than focusing on the tool itself. Which leads me to talk about…</p>

<h2 id="submissions-">Submissions! 📜</h2>

<p>Submissions for CoSy aren’t open yet, but we wanted to approach how submissions are treated and what kind of content we received differently from other conferences. There are essentially two kinds of conference systems: academic and industrial.</p>

<p>Industry conferences zero in on either a specific community/technology (Node, .NET, the JVM) all the way down to an exact tool (Kubernetes, LLVM). They sometimes have themes that encourage a broader range of talks and submissions, but ultimately it’s fairly focused what they’re going after. Talk submissions are generally just an IOU (“I owe you”): you promise to furnish a talk at the appointed time with the necessary bells and whistles. (This changes a little for Poster submissions to said industry conferences, where you have to usually show something real by the deadline.)</p>

<p>Academic and journal-related conferences tend to have higher barriers to entry even if they have broader scope, such as requiring a journal article/paper-like submission subject to rigorous peer review rather than just an outline of a talk or an idea with an IOU to show up and deliver. They tend to require the ability that you write a journal article, have the intent to publish, or are going to publish very soon (preferably, in the journal related to the conference).</p>

<p>There is room for a mix, where we have hobby, industry, and academic professionals/hobbyist strive for a low-cost environment to share what they either love to do or professionally work on, without the high submission cost of needing a whole article. That’s what CoSy is going to be focusing on: everyone, academics and professionals alike, can focus on just delivering a good talk, while still having a pretty broad scope to talk about (Systems Programming). We also hope to reach out to organizations, companies, and people who don’t normally contribute to the aforementioned C++ conferences so we can cycle in many new and wonderful faces and names.</p>

<h2 id="double-blinded-">Double-Blinded 🕶</h2>

<p>Another big difference is that we’re going to be internally doing double-blinded reviews. This means that all personally-identifying information will be removed (Name, Age, and any other details) from all submissions before being passed on to the Program Committee. The primary reason for this is fairness: we want to be sure that everyone gets their submissions processed with the same opportunity to impress. This actually applies more to “famous people” than it does to any other metric.</p>

<p>For example, some people blindly submit great reviews for talks attached to e.g. Chandler Carruth, Kate Gregory, or JF Bastien because they “want to see their take on the subject”. This can come regardless of the quality of the actual submission. While some people might think this is awesome, this actually hurts JF or Kate or Chandler more than it helps! If they wanted to submit on a new topic they’ve never spoken about before, it can be hard to trust the reviews because they’re biased by the clout/notoriety of who they are. This provides less critical feedback that could actually result in a great talk, resulting in an echo chamber.</p>

<p>Double-blind submission removes that kind of bias, as well as other biases inherent in humans processing other humans’ work. Of course, it’s not always possible to double-blind everything! If someone writes a submission about how they wrote a Great Book On Large Scale Software Architecture That’s Really Good And Helps You Modularize And Structure Large Software And The Sequel Is Out You Should Buy It Now, they have vastly reduced the pool of people they could be talking about. But that’s the beauty of the system: if you want to rely on fame, then you can name yourself in the submission outline or spell out some easily-identifiable detail.</p>

<p>But! The default is that your identity is unknown, and your work is being evaluated for the quality of its presentation. Name-drop yourself, but only if you dare!</p>



<p>At this point, you can stop reading the article. Most people would be content with the above handling and just leave it at that. But this is one of the most important and driving reasons why CoSy needs to be created, and that’s because the current systems we have created around our conferences and industry are not remotely fixable.</p>

<h2 id="--w-a-r-n-i-n-g--">⚠ ⚠ W A R N I N G ⚠ ⚠</h2>

<p>The following sections will reproduce some people’s words, exactly. That includes slurs such as the n-word, f-word, s-word and more. If you don’t have a stomach for it, then just take my word for it that it’s nasty and go read some other cool programming articles! But if you want to know why we need a new programming conference and why we can’t just build it like the old ones, well.</p>

<p>Travel on, brave reader.</p>

<h2 id="closed-wont-fix-">Closed: Won’t Fix ❌</h2>

<p>Yes. I say this after myself and many others have participated deeply in the systems, attempting to influence behavior and ask for changes that protect and prioritize the most vulnerable in our communities. The long and short of it is that the folks who run these programs, donate the most money, and sit at the top of the food chains for these organizations are not open to changing the way they do things. This is fine for them, but it is not fine for the rest of us.</p>

<p>On top of what I myself and many others in the C++ community have experienced, more and more stories have come into my e-mail, Signal, and Discord messages describing in fairly unfortunate detail the level of harassment, sabotage, and bigotry that has infested tech and ultimately destroyed many promising individuals – young and old – out of our most prominent and prestigious spaces. I thought <a href="https://twitter.com/__phantomderp/status/1324766113402638336">C++ was unique in its terribleness</a>,</p>

<p>but I could not have been more wrong.</p>

<p>From Python to JavaScript, harassment and abuse is a lot more common than I ever wanted it to be. Still, I do not want to talk over other people’s experiences: they can share them at a time when they feel appropriately equipped to do so. I am instead going to talk to, specifically, why I could not do something like hope that C++Now might fix itself or expect that any other existing event might suddenly pivot for the better.</p>

<h2 id="reactionary-rhetoric-crafting-a-bigot-">Reactionary Rhetoric: Crafting a Bigot 🔨</h2>

<p>We know that there exist places <a href="https://thephd.github.io/assets/img/2020/12/4chan-full-thread.jpg">like 4chan where the brutally disgusting “discussions”</a> are disguised under the mantle of “technocracy” and “equal work, equal merit” policies. Obviously, 4chan isn’t a reflection of Boost, any C++ conference, its leadership, or its donors. Unfortunately, I and many others do not have to go to 4chan or the underbelly of reddit to find this kind of plain talk of “niggers” and “faggots”: it was happening right within the CppLang Slack. No other story is as illustrative of that as is Douman’s Story.</p>

<h3 id="an-outsiders-history-of-douman-">An Outsider’s History of Douman 📚</h3>

<p>When I joined the CppLang Slack around 2017-2018, an incident occurred. A user by the name of Douman said “nigger”, hard R and everything. Moderation came down on Douman eventually, and he ended up getting banned from one of CppLang’s most rancorous “off topic” channels to help him resist the urge to say it again while still being able to participate. (Don’t ask me how this is supposed to be an effective deterrent.) Afterwards, Douman stated he was sad about the event and donned a Slack emoji in his name with the tag to the effect of “Garbage human being”.</p>

<p>What happened privately, however, was an entirely different story.</p>

<p>Incensed at being slapped on the wrist for his transgression, Douman confided in authorities higher than the Moderation team itself: the CppLang Admins. And in them, Douman found exactly what he was looking for: righteous justification against the “snowflakes” who couldn’t handle his “bad language”. He linked up in a Slack channel called Unfiltered, an at-times locked channel where users did and could scream nigger, faggot, and all sorts of other things, at anybody they wanted to. You think of a slur, and it was said in Unfiltered.</p>

<p>I know this, because for a brief moment I was in there.</p>

<p>The first time I left the CppLang Slack …</p></section></div>

December 20, 2020 | https://tkainrad.dev/posts/app-to-show-shortcuts-of-current-application-windows-linux-macos/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tkainrad.dev/posts/app-to-show-shortcuts-of-current-application-windows-linux-macos/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="contentdiv">

<p>Looking up keyboard shortcuts on the web takes you out of the current context and breaks your workflow. That’s why, <a href="https://tkainrad.dev/posts/setting-up-linux-workstation/">as a Linux user</a>, I have always been a bit envious of macOS users, who had access to tools that could instantly show the current application’s shortcuts, such as <a href="https://www.mediaatelier.com/CheatSheet/">CheatSheet</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/amiechen/pretzel">Pretzel</a>.</p>
<p>On Windows and Linux, there was no such thing. You had to find shortcut information in the software’s documentation and hope that it was searchable. Or even worse, suffer a massive context switch and google for the shortcuts, until now. KeyCombiner Desktop is free to use and can show the active application’s shortcuts on Windows, Linux, and macOS.</p>
<p>Suppose you are on macOS and already use one of the existing solutions. In that case, you might still want to read further because KeyCombiner goes far beyond looking up the active application’s shortcuts.</p>

<p>If a picture says more than 1000 words, an animation will speak for itself:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://tkainrad.dev/images/keycombiner/lookup-three-apps2.gif" alt="Instant shortcut lookup for three example applications."> <figcaption>
<p>Instant shortcut lookup for three example applications.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Upon pressing the global trigger, the lookup will appear with a search field in focus, where you can start to type right away. The default trigger is <kbd>super</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> on Windows and Linux, and <kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>k</kbd> on macOS. This can be configured, I use <kbd>super</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> on Linux.</p>
<p>The search terms will be applied to the shortcut description, the key binding, and some hidden fields like the shortcut category. Do you want to search for all file-related bindings that use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>? Type something like <code>file ctrl</code> and you have your answer.</p>
<p>The lookup window disappears whenever you click outside of it, when you press <kbd>esc</kbd>, or when you switch to another application via <kbd>cmd</kbd>/<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>tab</kbd>. If you close via <kbd>esc</kbd>, the search term will be cleared. If you use <kbd>cmd</kbd>/<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>tab</kbd>, you can switch back to the active application without losing the cursor position.</p>

<p>If you carefully watched the animation above, you might have noticed that the rows are grouped. The first group has the prefix <code>Active:</code> and is highlighted with a blue background. This group shows the shortcuts for the active application. Everything that is shown below this group is from the user’s personal shortcut and command collections.</p>
<p>To explain what these are, I have to provide some background. KeyCombiner is an application to organize, learn, and practice keyboard shortcuts. A core idea is to learn precisely the shortcuts you need. The only way to achieve this is to choose them yourself, which is done by creating personal collections of shortcuts and text snippets. I like to compare this concept to how you build playlists in music software. Instead of browsing your favorite artists’ albums, KeyCombiner allows you to browse shortcut collections of your favorite applications. Instead of adding songs to your playlists, you can add keyboard shortcuts and text snippets to your personal collections.</p>
<p>The instant lookup of KeyCombiner Desktop profits immensely from these collection building features, and vice-versa. Having instant access to your collections makes them a lot more valuable. In short, these two features complete each other.</p>
<p>The instant lookup works offline. Your personal collections are downloaded only on application startup. If you modified your collections while KeyCombiner Desktop was running, you may reload the lookup via (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>).</p>
<p>I will try to illustrate this with my personal experience. Currently, I have 10 personal KeyCombiner collections. My largest one contains more or less all shortcuts that I already knew when I started to use KeyCombiner. This collection is publicly accessible via this <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collecting/collections/shared/89e47af4-0f2e-4d5d-98fa-6966bc7453cc/">shareable link</a>. Then, I did a <a href="https://tkainrad.dev/posts/how-i-learned-50-new-keyboard-shortcuts-in-42-minutes/">blog post challenge to learn 50 new keyboard shortcuts as fast as possible</a>. More recently, I <a href="https://tkainrad.dev/posts/learning-all-vscode-shortcuts-evolved-my-developing-habits/">learned <em>all</em> VSCode keyboard shortcuts</a>, which evolved my developing habits and added another collection with 151 shortcuts to my repertoire.
Add to that a few smaller collections I used for learning the shortcuts of Chrome DevTools, Nautilus, Spotify, and Vimium. Having instant access to all of these shortcuts without leaving my current context feels like a superpower, even though I admit that some of those superpowers you see in movies look even more powerful.</p>
<p>My most recent new use case is to look up regular expressions. There is an <a href="https://tkainrad.dev/posts/automatically-add-kbd-tags-with-a-single-regex/">article</a> on how to automatically add HTML &lt;kbd&gt;-tags to any text via a single regex replace operation. I use this for all of my blog posts, all &lt;kbd&gt; tags you see in this post are added this way. However, it wouldn’t be so convenient if I couldn’t instantly look up and copy-paste the required regular expression:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://tkainrad.dev/images/keycombiner/lookup-regex.gif" alt="The lookup also shows shortcuts and text snippets from your personal collections."> <figcaption>
<p>The lookup also shows shortcuts and text snippets from your personal collections.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>KeyCombiner’s instant lookup is a cheatsheet of sorts. But it is context-aware, searchable, and you can expand it quickly by importing from public or shared collections. It is also friendlier to the environment than printing out PDFs and hanging them next to your desk.</p>

<p>There is a very boring answer to this question: By maintaining an extensive public database of keyboard shortcuts. You might have noticed from reading this post that I am quite excited about Keycombiner. That’s why I spend considerable time to parse the documentation pages of software tools for their keyboard shortcuts. It’s not as dull as it sounds like; creative use of regular expressions makes it quite fun. Don’t judge me; everyone has a weird hobby.</p>
<p>You can browse the database at <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collections/">https://keycombiner.com/collections/</a>.<br>
The instant lookup works for all desktop-based applications that are listed there. In particular, it should work for all apps that an average software developer uses (VSCode, JetBrains IDEs, Vim, Eclipse, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Nautilus, Finder, Notion, Slack, Explorer, Terminal, iTerm2, Obsidian,…). This list is growing fast, and I am happy to take suggestions.</p>
<p>One downside of this approach is that KeyCombiner can only show the default bindings for the active application. If you have changed these bindings, that’s not ideal. Fortunately, If you went through the trouble of changing a binding, you usually won’t need to look it up. In any case, you can add the customized binding to a personal collection, and the lookup will show it as explained above.</p>
<p>Existing tools for macOS use a different approach. They rely on a macOS API to retrieve menu keyboard shortcuts for the current application. This has its advantages and disadvantages. The great thing about it is that it works automatically for all applications that have a menu. On the other hand, applications
don’t necessarily register all of their shortcuts as menu shortcuts.</p>



<p>Simply go to <a href="https://keycombiner.com/desktop/">https://keycombiner.com/desktop/</a> and grab the installer for your system. On macOS, you need to grant some permissions for the instant lookup to work. Please refer to the bottom of the linked page for instructions on how to do that.</p>
<p>KeyCombiner is a SaaS with a generous free tier. <strong>All features described in this article are entirely free to use.</strong> If you use KeyCombiner a lot, please consider upgrading to a Pro subscription to get access to additional features and to support hosting and development efforts.</p>


<p>KeyCombiner can do a lot more things than what’s described in this post. However, the instant lookup has quickly become one of my favorite features. Admittedly, I don’t use KeyCombiner every day for learning shortcuts. Usually, after I have <a href="https://tkainrad.dev/posts/learning-all-vscode-shortcuts-evolved-my-developing-habits/">mastered all shortcuts</a> of a new collection, it takes a couple of days or even weeks until I get back to frequent practice.</p>
<p>In contrast, I use the instant lookup <em>all the time</em>. If I am on a different computer without KeyCombiner installed, I notice that something is missing after a couple of minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Enough about me, though. I’d be thrilled to hear about your experience with the software.</strong></p>

  <article>
    <p>For a while now I have wanted to write a simple dictionary app for the Apple
Watch. The goal was to be able to quickly look up words from paper books,
by storing the book on the watch to be able to do fuzzy matches against the text.
While Apple ships amazing dictionaries with macOS and iOS, they only provide a very
limited API.
On iOS, all you get is 
a <em>view</em> into the dictionary via <code>UIReferenceLibraryViewController</code>,
for the Watch, there is no API at all,
and on OS X you get an antique <code>DCSCopyTextDefinition</code> that only
returns a plain-text definition, which is not nice to display. The whole
definition is returned as one blob of non-rich text, no newlines.</p>

<p>It was while attempting to parse this output that I realized it would be so much
easier to get the source, which I’m showing here how to do.
I open-sourced the code to parse the dictionary
<a href="https://github.com/fab-jul/parse_dictionaries">on github</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a pic of the OS X dictionary:</p>

<p><img src="https://fmentzer.github.io/assets/img/dictionary.png"></p>

<p>And here is what I managed to extract:</p>

<p><img src="https://fmentzer.github.io/assets/img/dictionary_watch.jpg"></p>

<p>I started by trying to figure out where dictionaries are stored.
Some googling <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250861549?answerId=251679363022#251679363022">revealed</a>
that they are burried in <code>/System</code> 
(at least for macOS 10.15 and possibly higher), at</p>

<div><div><pre><code>/System/Library/AssetsV2/
  com_apple_MobileAsset_DictionaryServices_dictionaryOSX/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This folder contains various cryptically-named folders ending in <code>.asset</code>,
which represent the different installed dictionaries. E.g., for me:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ ls
24effbf40402f823bb9d9f6f12b75af3e679a4a6.asset
26e585a43423edb02b25fa7ba9af3fdc08eed6d7.asset
4094df88727a054b658681dfb74f23702d3c985e.asset
96d637557afb292134db05d7d7f30c0fed9cef9f.asset
976258f0b1fad70dd8e7ee7c1b4be8f8536e19a7.asset
a1d5710e8c3932361413f22ff588a1a3c7c337bf.asset
com_apple_MobileAsset_DictionaryServices_dictionaryOSX.xml
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Of these, <code>4094df88727a054b658681dfb74f23702d3c985e.asset</code> is the 
“New Oxford American Dictionary”. Going into that folder and
a few levels deeper, we land at a promisingly named “Resources” folder:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ ls /System/Library/AssetsV2/
  com_apple_MobileAsset_DictionaryServices_dictionaryOSX/
  4094df88727a054b658681dfb74f23702d3c985e.asset/

<p>which is filled with a whole bunch of files. Sorting by size, it turns out
that <code>Body.data</code> could be a promising candidate at 23MB.</p>

<p>Sadly, it seems to be a binary blob without a discernible content.</p>

<p>Scanning through the file with <code>xxd</code>, I did not find any visible structure.</p>

<p>However, given that the file is only ~23MB, I was thinking it may just be a ZIP file
in disguise.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>unzip Body.data
Archive:  Body.data
  End-of-central-directory signature not found.  Either this file is not
  a zipfile, or it constitutes one disk of a multi-part archive.  In the
  latter case the central directory and zipfile comment will be found on
  the last disk(s) of this archive.
unzip:  cannot find zipfile directory in one of Body.data or
        Body.data.zip, and cannot find Body.data.ZIP, period.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>No luck! Same for <code>tar xvf</code>.</p>

<p>At this moment, I remembered
that the last time I had been thinking about this problem, years ago,
I had stumpled upon some cryptic C code. I remembered fiddling around with
XML, so I tried to dig up old projects, but sadly, I must have deleted them.</p>

<p>Some googling later, I stumpled upon the very <a href="https://gist.github.com/josephg/5e134adf70760ee7e49d">gist</a>
I had found years ago. It’s a very short and sweet python script to
extract entries from <code>Data.entry</code>. However, it’s also somewhat magical
in that it’s not documented, seeks random offsets, and even makes use
of the <code>struct</code> library.</p>

<p>But, it also does <code>import zlib</code>, so I thought, let’s try
to reverse engineer it myself.</p>

<p>The first simple
thing to try was to just attempt to find a ZIP file by going through the
bytes of the file one by one. After all,
it was very plausible that the file starts with some Apple
header followed by some compressed data.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>zlib</span>
<span>import</span> <span>itertools</span>

<span>DATA_FILE_PATH</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span>

  <span>content_bytes</span> <span>=</span> <span>f</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>()</span>

<span># Try all offsets to see if we find a ZIP file
</span><span>for</span> <span>offset</span> <span>in</span> <span>itertools</span><span>.</span><span>count</span><span>():</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>'Trying {offset}...'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>try</span><span>:</span>
    <span>content_decompressed</span> <span>=</span> <span>zlib</span><span>.</span><span>decompress</span><span>(</span><span>content_bytes</span><span>[</span><span>offset</span><span>:])</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'Found ZIP!'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>break</span>
  <span>except</span> <span>zlib</span><span>.</span><span>error</span><span>:</span>  <span># Current content_bytes is not a zipfile -&gt; skip a byte.
</span>    <span>pass</span>

<p>… and, low and behold, at byte number 108, a ZIP file starts!</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Trying 102...

Found ZIP!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Very exciting! What’s in this ZIP?</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; content_decompressed.decode()
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xa3 in position 0: invalid start byte
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ok, so already the first byte cannot be decoded by ‘utf-8’, that’s a bit sad.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(content_decompressed[:20])
b'\xa3\x02\x00\x00&lt;d:entry xmlns:d'
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Aha, already a few bytes later, some XML starts. For now, let’s just 
ignore the first four bytes.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; content_decompressed[4:].decode()
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xe7 in position 2065: invalid continuation byte
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s already more promising, we can decode 2065 bytes.
Looking around position 2065, we find:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(content_decompressed[2055:2085])
b'an&gt;&lt;/d:entry&gt;\n\xe7\x02\x00\x00&lt;d:entry xml'
#              ^ |              |
#        newline |__ 4 bytes ___|
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We see the entry ends, followed by a newline <code>\n</code>, some more
seemingly random bytes, and another entry starts!</p>

<p>For reference, here is the first entry (defining <code>007</code>, as it turns out):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;d:entry</span> <span>xmlns:d=</span><span>"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/DictionaryService-1.0.rng"</span>

            <span>&lt;d:def/&gt;</span>

      <span>&lt;/span&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/span&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/span&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/d:entry&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Exploring some more,
I did not find a pattern in these delimiter bytes except it always being
 4 bytes. I’m assuming they somehow tell you how long the next entry is.
 But we can just always ignore the 4 bytes and keep reading until the
 next newline appears.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>split</span><span>(</span><span>input_bytes</span><span>):</span>
  <span># The first four bytes are always not UTF-8.
</span>  <span>input_bytes</span> <span>=</span> <span>input_bytes</span><span>[</span><span>4</span><span>:]</span>
  <span>entries</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
  <span>while</span> <span>True</span><span>:</span>
    <span># Find the next newline, which delimits the current entry.
</span>    <span>try</span><span>:</span>
      <span>next_offset</span> <span>=</span> <span>input_bytes</span><span>.</span><span>index</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>.</span><span>encode</span><span>(</span><span>'utf-8'</span><span>))</span>
    <span>except</span> <span>ValueError</span><span>:</span>  <span># No more new-lines -&gt; no more entries!
</span>      <span>break</span>
    <span>entry_text</span> <span>=</span> <span>input_bytes</span><span>[:</span><span>next_offset</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>decode</span><span>(</span><span>'utf-8'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>entries</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>entry_text</span><span>)</span>

    <span># There is always 4 bytes of chibberish between entries. Skip them
</span>    <span># and the new lines (for a total of 5 bytes).
</span>    <span>input_bytes</span> <span>=</span> <span>input_bytes</span><span>[</span><span>next_offset</span> <span>+</span> <span>5</span><span>:]</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>entries</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Aaaand… that yielded a measly 152 entries. Very sad. Where is the rest?

<p>Early in November, Daniel Piker (aka <a href="https://twitter.com/kangaroophysics">@KangarooPhysics</a>) suggested that a group of people could get together online, and each create a short segment of animation, arranged so that all the start and end frames are identical. We could then assemble all the segments into one long loop and enjoy each others’ work. The idea was based on loops that I had been posting on Twitter for fun, under the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/swirlysquaresunday">#swirlysquaresunday</a>, and for that reason I called the group project <a href="https://isohedral.ca/swirled-series/">Swirled Series</a>.</p>
<p>Well, wow. I had hoped that maybe I would collect 10–20 submissions, and assemble a short video around a minute long, which could be shared on Twitter. I guess I wasn’t the only one looking for a creative outlet! In all, I received 115 loops from 81 contributors, totalling over six minutes of animation. I am honoured and humbled to serve as the curator of such a fun and diverse collection.</p>
<p>The best way to watch Swirled Series is at the top of this page. The animation is constantly remixing 115 short video clips, playing them in random order. You can also control the speed (I find it looks good slowed down a bit). Finally, I’ve uploaded <a href="https://youtu.be/LXr-DFr5vgI">a video</a> to YouTube, showing the 115 loops in a fixed random order. If you’re on a small device like a phone, and the videos are cut off, you might have better luck with <a href="https://isohedral.ca/other/SwirledSeriesNovember2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a separate page containing just the viewer</a>.</p>



<p>Of course, none of this would be possible without the tremendous response from an enthusiastic community of creators!&nbsp; Thanks to @C010011012, @CyanidesDuality, @FlyingOctopus0, @GeometryDad, @SlimRunner, @TilingBot, @beesandbombs, @jn3008, @sandvrs, @teadrinker, 落葉子, Zach Abel, Dan Anderson, Dan Bach, Sebestyén Balázs, David Berardo, Daniel Berio, Elijah Bevers, Jim Bumgardner, Dina Buric, Neil Butler, Toby Cathcart Burn, Paul Chaikin, Tim Cieplowski, Tom Edgar, Matt Enlow, Frank Farris, Tony Finch, Lucas Garron, Sam Gates, Pierre Gidel, Andrew Glassner, John Golden, Chris Hanusa, Edmund Harriss, Sam Hartburn, Esther Hecky, Ian Henderson, Matthew Henderson, Jason Hise, Martin Holtham, Chris Johnson, Alex Jones, Roman Karavia, Roni Kaufman, Elliot Kienzle, William Knowles-Kellett, Eryk Kopczyński and Dorota Celińska-Kopczyńska, Tom Lechner, Jose Linares, Colin Liotta, Xing Liu, Nan Ma, Olivier Mercier, Fabrice Neyret, Andrew Osborne, Dave Pagurek, Jon Palin, Vincent Pantaloni, Juan Carlos Ponce Campuzano, David Reimann, Ricky Reusser, Juan Rinaudo, Jesus Rivera, Tanner Rogalsky, Chip Rollinson, Toby Sargeant, Henry Segerman and Saul Schleimer, Tomas Sirgedas, Ben Sparks, Zachary Stein, Tim Straubinger, stuebinm, Rashmi Sunder-Raj, David Swart, Patrick Traynor, Adrian-Teodor Tudorică, Jason Tully, Joachim Wedekind, August Wiklund, and Stasiu Wolanski. (Please tell me if I’ve left your name out or otherwise messed it up—with so many people, there could very well be mistakes!)&nbsp; And special thanks to Daniel Piker for gettting the whole project going.</p>
<p>These submissions constitute a non-trivial dataset, comprising over 18,000 frames and nearly a gigabyte of data. That’s enough information that aggregate measurements of the process become interesting. Here are a few observations.</p>
<ul>
<li>People were allowed to submit a loop of up to 180 frames. The average submission was 158 frames, and the majority of submissions were 180 frames—most artists wanted their full 3.6 seconds of fame!</li>
<li>It would be interesting to categorize the visual and mathematical devices used to create loops. You’ll see fractals, complex numbers, non-Euclidean geometry, aperiodic tilings, physics simulation, 3D animation, strange loops, and all sorts of other sequences. In some ways the project provides an entertaining overview of techniques in mathematical art.</li>
<li>The first and final frames were required to be identical 8 × 8 checkerboards of black and white squares, in a 512 × 512 PNG image. You’d think that there wouldn’t be a lot of variability in the files for those frames. Ha! Of all the files containing starting frames, the smallest was a meagre 214 bytes (way to go, Lucas Garron!) and the biggest was around 750 KB (what’s up with that, Chris Hanusa?).&nbsp; That’s about a 3000× difference in size, which I suppose says a lot about variation in PNG encoding algorithms.</li>
<li>Information theory offers interesting measurements here too. To a first approximation, an image that’s visually simpler will be represented by a smaller file (assuming you’re using a good encoder!). Here are 115 superimposed graphs, showing a measurement of the file size of each frame in a loop over its lifetime:<br><a href="https://isohedral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/graphs.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://isohedral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/graphs.png" alt="" width="1000" height="723" srcset="https://isohedral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/graphs.png 1000w, https://isohedral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/graphs-300x217.png 300w, https://isohedral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/graphs-768x555.png 768w, https://isohedral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/graphs-700x506.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></a>Each graph shows a loop’s frame file sizes as a fraction of the average size for that loop, represented by the black horizontal line (to which all graphs have been normalized). The most obvious trends are that most animations tend to start simple and end simple (naturally, since checkerboards are simple and you’re expected to do something interesting in your loop), and that there’s a noticeable dip in the middle (many loops go through two “phases”, delineated in the middle by a relatively simple pause). I’m left wondering what other measurements I could extract, though it would make sense to re-encode the frames first with a standardized compression algorithm.</li>
<li>This project required a lot of manual labour.&nbsp; First, I maintained a spreadsheet of submissions and collected them manually via email. Then, many submissions contained errors. The most common errors were incorrectly named or numbered files. There were occasional problems with file formats or resolutions. And a lot of people submitted loops that started and ended with a black square in the lower-right corner, where I had asked for a white square. The process would definitely benefit from automated submission and validation!</li>
<li>Many different tools were used to produce submissions. I’m aware of people using Processing, GeoGebra, Shadertoy, and Desmos, and that’s just for starters.</li>
</ul>



<p>Based on the enthusiasm of the many contributors, I can certainly imagine doing this again, though perhaps not right away. I would likely restrict submissions to one per person to keep from being inundated. Ideally I would also automate the process of collecting and validating submissions.</p>
<p>This was a fun experience, thanks again to all the contributors!</p>

    <h3>How Changing One Sentence led to 2.5x more Reviews</h3>
    
        <h6>December 17, 2020</h6>
    
    </p>
  </div><div>
    <div>
		<p><strong><u>June 2019</u></strong><br>
Fifteen years in business and we had a measly three reviews on Google.</p>
<p>Sigh.</p>
<p>I reminded myself that this is <em>exactly</em> why I moved back from the Bay area to work on the family business – to use technology to expand. Let’s fix this!</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.wints.org/img/articles/2020.12.17/2.stoneland-reviews-dec-2019.jpg" alt="Stoneland Reviews December 2020" width="60%"> 
</figure>

<p>I’d read somewhere that people are most willing to review right after their experience – good or bad.
I’d been itching to use Twilio, and this was the perfect use case!
Our inside sales person saves a visitor’s contact information right after a visitor leaves. Their phone number is included in this.</p>
<p>So, June 2019 I wrote a python script that sent an SMS to the visitor an 1 hour after they left. The SMS said:</p>
<div>
	<div>
<blockquote><small><i>If you enjoyed your visit (or didn't), please let us know how we did!<br>http://bit.ly/stoneland-google-stl <br>-Stoneland Team</i></small></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p>I thought it was pretty slick, getting the URL, a cohesive message and proper formatting into one SMS.</p>
<p>At the same time, our sales team made a push to get reviews by emailing old customers.</p>
<p><strong><u>December 2019</u></strong><br>
We have 18 reviews now! While a big improvement over the last 15 years, it was still far below our competition.
And most of the reviews were in September when our sales team made the push. Now the trickle had dried up.</p>
<p>I’d been reading and listening to a lot of <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/">Indiehackers</a>, especially interviews with founders who were marketing specialists. After ingesting Indiehacker nuggets, I settled on changing one factor at a time to understand what drove reviews.</p>
<p>In January 2020, I tweaked the copy of the SMS to read:</p>
<div>
	<div>
<blockquote><small><i>If you enjoyed your visit, leave us a 5 second rating!<br>http://bit.ly/stoneland-google-stl<br>-Stoneland Team</i></small></blockquote></div></div>
<p><strong><u>December 2020</u></strong><br>
That tiny change made all the difference! As of December 15, 2020, we have <strong>93 reviews</strong> with a 4.9 rating!
We’ve outstripped all our competitors in the area, as well as several of our customers.</p>
<p>Bottom line? Copywriting matters.</p>
<figure>

</figure>

<p>P.S. For anyone wondering about the math around ‘2.5x’, here’s the breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>June 2019 - December 2020 (~6 months): 15 reviews</li>
<li>Extrapolated over 12 months: 30 reviews</li>
<li>January 2020 - December 2020 (~12 months): 75 reviews</li>
</ul>
<p><span>75/30 = <strong>2.5</strong></span></p>

<h2>To Tmux or Not to Tmux, That Is the Question!</h2>

<p>
Before getting started with tmux, let us go over some questions to see
if tmux is right for you:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Do you use a terminal as part of your your development workflow?
  </li>
  <li>
    Do you use multiple terminals in different tabs or windows to
    navigate files, edit text, compile and run code, tail log files,
    push code to repository, and run one-time adhoc commands?
  </li>
  <li>
    Do you work on multiple projects at a time, each with its own set of
    workflow and environment requirements, and often have to switch
    context?
  </li>
  <li>
    Do you SSH into remote systems?
  </li>
  <li>
    Have you ever got disconnected from a remote SSH session in the
    middle of a task that you were running and monitoring?
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
If you answered yes to any of these questions, then tmux is for you!
</p>


<h2>What Is Tmux?</h2>

<p>
Tmux is a terminal multiplexer. You can run multiple terminal programs
inside tmux, all of which can be accessed from the single terminal that
is running tmux. This is called a tmux session. You can have multiple
such tmux sessions, say one for each project you are working on. You can
detach from a tmux session and later reattach to it. When you run
programs in a tmux session, the session remains intact and continues
running your programs even if you detach from the session. You can start
where you left off the previous day, or you can even access the session
from a different computer.
</p>

<p>
If you have worked with remote servers using remote desktop connection,
you will be familiar with how the applications that you open in the
server are kept as is even when you disconnect. You can then resume the
session by reconnecting to it. You can even reconnect to the remote
desktop using a different client or a different computer. Tmux helps you
to achieve similar results for terminal sessions.
</p>

<p>
When you run the <code>tmux</code> command, tmux starts a server process
if it is not already running, and a tmux session is created. The tmux
server runs as a background process in your system and manages all the
terminals running inside tmux. You can create additional sessions in the
tmux server if needed by using the <code>tmux</code> command. A tmux
session is a group of related tmux windows. Think of all the terminal
tabs you open to get to your development workflow of a particular
project. All these can be grouped together as windows in a tmux session.
A tmux window comprises of one or more panes. Each pane is like a
terminal by itself. Panes can be organized vertically, horizonatally, or
a mix of both. Think of editing, compiling, and executing code on the
left pane while tailing a related log file on the right pane as an
example. At any given time, there is one active pane where the commands
you type are accepted. You can switch between panes, windows, and
sessions as needed.

<p>
Let us now see how to get started with tmux.
</p>


<h2>Install Tmux</h2>

<p>
If you are on a Debian, Ubuntu, or another Debian-based system, enter
the following command:
</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install tmux</code></pre>

<p>
If you are on macOS with Homebrew installed, enter the following
command:
</p>

<pre><code>brew install tmux</code></pre>

<p>
If you are on any other system or environment, see
<a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Installing">Tmux Wiki:
  Installing</a> for installation details.
</p>


<h2>Create, Detach From, and Attach to Sessions</h2>

<p>
To create a new tmux session, enter the following command:
</p>

<pre><code>tmux</code></pre>

<p>
Run some program in this session. Maybe tail a log file. This will help
with the next steps where you detach and reattach to a session.
</p>

<p>
To detach your terminal from a tmux session, enter the following
command:
</p>

<pre><code>tmux detach</code></pre>

<p>
Tmux will keep your session intact. All your programs keep running on
the server. To attach your terminal as a client back to an existing tmux
session, enter the following command:
</p>

<pre><code>tmux attach</code></pre>

<p>
Note that it is not necessary to type out the <code>tmux</code> commands
in full. You can use any unambiguous abbreviation of the commands. For
example, <code>tmux det</code> and <code>tmux at</code> are equivalent
to <code>tmux detach</code> and <code>tmux attach</code>, respectively.
</p>

<p>
By default, the new sessions are named 0, 1 and so on. To choose another
name for the session, use the following command to start a new session:
</p>

<pre><code>tmux new -s &lt;session-name&gt;</code></pre>

<p>
Here <code>&lt;session-name&gt;</code> denotes the name of the session
you choose. You can also rename an existing session with this command:
</p>

<pre><code>tmux rename &lt;new-name&gt;</code></pre>

<p>
If you have multiple tmux sessions running and you want to target a
specific session to rename, you can use the <code>-t</code> option to
specify the session name you want to target, like this:
</p>

<pre><code>tmux rename -t &lt;session-name&gt; &lt;new-name&gt;</code></pre>

<p>
Without the <code>-t</code> option, it renames the current session.
</p>

<p>
The <code>-t</code> option is useful for attaching to a specific tmux
session too when multiple tmux sessions are running. By default
<code>tmux attach</code> attaches to the most recently used session that
is not attached. You can attach to a specific session like this:
</p>

<pre><code>tmux attach -t &lt;session-name&gt;</code></pre>

<p>
Sometimes while attaching to a tmux session, you might want to detach
the other clients to connected to it. That can be achieved with the
following commands:
</p>

<pre><code>tmux attach -d</code></pre>
<pre><code>tmux attach -d -t &lt;session-name&gt;</code></pre>

<p>
While you are inside a tmux session, you can also change the name of the
attached session by using the key-sequence <code>C-b $</code> which
prompts for a new name for the session. The key-sequence <code>C-b
$</code> is bound to the <code>rename</code> command that you saw above.
Similarly, the key-sequence <code>C-b d</code> is bound to the
<code>detach</code> command. To understand how tmux key bindings and
commands work together, read the next two sections.
</p>


<h2>Understand Tmux Prefix Keys</h2>

<p>
Once you attach your terminal as a client to a tmux session, all
keystrokes are sent to the program running in the active pane of the
current tmux window. By default it is your shell. For key-sequences that
control tmux itself, a special key-sequence called the prefix key must
be pressed. By default the prefix key is <code>C-b</code>. Here
<code>C</code> denotes the <code>Ctrl</code> modifier key, i.e., to
enter <code>C-b</code>, press and hold the <code>Ctrl</code> key, then
press and release the <code>b</code> key, and finally release the
<code>Ctrl</code> key. When the prefix key is entered like this, tmux
waits for another keystroke or key-sequence to determine which tmux
command needs to be executed. For example, when you enter <code>C-b
$</code> to rename the current session, <code>C-b</code> is the prefix
key that tells tmux that you are going to invoke a tmux command and then
the <code>$</code> keystroke tells tmux that you want to invoke the tmux
<code>rename</code> command.
</p>


<h2>Key Bindings, Commands, and Command Prompt</h2>

<p>
The key-sequence <code>C-b ?</code> shows the list of key bindings along
with short descriptions about what they do. The output is shown in the
view mode in the active pane. The pane in view mode has its own key
bindings which don't need the prefix key. By default the view mode has
Emacs key bindings that you can use to navigate the output. However, it
can be configured to use vi key bindings too.
</p>

<p>
Any time key bindings are used, they run the underlying tmux commands.
For example <code>C-b c</code> runs the <code>neww</code> command that
creates a new window. Commands can be run directly from the shell as you
saw when you created new session using the <code>tmux new</code>
command. Just like any other Unix commands, tmux commands have zero or
more command line options that may or may not accept arguments. For
example, the <code>attach</code> command that you saw earlier accepts
the <code>-d</code> option to detach any other clients that are attached
to the session. This option does not require an argument. The
<code>attach</code> command also accepts another option <code>-t</code>
that requires an argument to specify the name of the target session you
want to attach to.
</p>

<p>
You might mostly want to use the key bindings to manipulate tmux because
they are convenient. However, the tmux commands can be useful especially
when you want to perform a task that is supported only by an option. The
tmux commands are also useful if you want to write a script to
manipulate tmux.
</p>

<p>
Tmux commands can be run from the shell as you have seen so far. There
is also an interactive command prompt available within tmux that you can
open using <code>C-b :</code>. This prompt accepts tmux commands. For
example, <code>C-b :neww</code> creates a new window in the attached
session. Some of the tmux commands run in this manner show the output in
the view mode in the active pane. For example, <code>C-b :ls</code>
shows the list of all available sessions.
</p>


<h2>Create New Windows in a Session and Switch Between Them</h2>

<p>
You can create new window in a session by using <code>C-b c</code> or
<code>C-b :neww</code>. Each window is numbered starting from 0. Every
new window is created at the first available index. This means that if
there are gaps in the list of window numbers, a new window occupies the
first available number in the gaps. The new window thus created becomes
the current window of the session. The current window is identified by
the <code>*</code> suffix in its name and the previous window is
identified by the <code>-</code> suffix in its name.
</p>

<p>
If you want to create a new window but not make it the current window,
you can do so with the <code>-d</code> option like this: <code>C-b :neww
-d</code>. You can also create a window at a specific index by using the
<code>-t</code> option like this: <code>C-b :neww -t 9</code>.
</p>

<p>
<code>C-b 0</code> takes you to window 0, <code>C-b 1</code> takes you
to window 1, and so on until <code>C-b 9</code>. <code>C-b '</code>
prompts for an index to switch to that window. This can be useful if you
want to go to windows with indices greater than 9. <code>C-b p</code>
takes you to the previous window and <code>C-b n</code> takes you to the
next window in the window list by index. <code>C-b l</code> takes you to
the last window that was active before the current one. This is very
useful for alternating between two windows again and again.
</p>

<p>
To rename the current window, you can use <code>C-b :renamew
  &lt;new-name&gt;</code> or <code>C-b ,</code> which prompts for the
new name for the window.
</p>

<p>
I find it convenient not to exceed 10 windows (indices 0-9) in a
session, so that I can switch between them using <code>C-b
&lt;number&gt;</code>.
</p>


<h2>Create New Panes in a Window and Switch Between Them</h2>

<p>
You can create a new pane by splitting a pane in a window. <code>C-b
  %</code> splits the current pane into left and …</p></div></div>

<p>
I've always enjoyed terse programs that show how things work
<i>without</i> magic hiding incidental complexity. After realizing that my
initial attempt at a neural net only cost <span>less than 200 lines of Rust</span>,
I decided to take a snapshot and write about building it before I go
on and extend (and possibly over-complicate or abandon) the system.
</p>

<p>
More than anything else, treat this as encouragement to write your own
neural network – the core implementation turned out to be
surprisingly compact – enough to encourage me to write about it.
</p>

<p>
<b>This is not an introduction to neural nets</b>: There are several excellent
resources already available online that can describe the underlying
math and structure of networks; I'll just talk through them enough to
explain the structure of the code.
</p>

<p>
It's also entirely likely that I have mistakes in here; this was
written quickly with the main <b>aim</b> of encouraging more people to write
their own nets from scratch – and given one simple point for
comparison. If you do write your own, please share it with me!

<div id="outline-container-orgd2852bf">
<h2 id="orgd2852bf">Choosing a simple problem &amp; architecture</h2>
<div id="text-orgd2852bf">
<p>
Achieving SotA on MNIST is an explicit non-goal: this project is aimed
at exploring the mechanics of a neural network, and being able to play
around with it while changing one feature at a time.
</p>

<p>
Instead of trying to see if the network can accurately predict results
from data I can't understand or reason about, I'm going to have the
network try to behave like a simple continuous function of my choice
instead – I'll play with different functions like \(y=x^2\), \(y=x^3\),
\(y=x * sin(x)\), etc.
</p>

<p>
This greatly simplifies some parts of the network – there's a single
input, and single output. The <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap4.html">Universality Theorem</a> suggests that I
should be able to get fairly far with a single layer, so that's where
I'm starting.
</p>

<p>
I like <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/rectified-linear-units-relu-in-deep-learning">ReLU</a> and leaky ReLU because of their simplicity, and I'll stick
with them here – though I don't have any strong justification about
the choice of activation function yet.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgcfce027">
<h3 id="orgcfce027">Storing a network</h3>
<div id="text-orgcfce027">
<p>
The very first decision was figuring out how to store the neural
network – my very first attempt at doing this involved a lot of pure
functions and state being passed around all over the place which
quickly became messy – it was much more maintainable to have a single
place to represent a neural network.
</p>



<p>
Happily enough, with the decision to have a single input and output, a
single hidden layer means that there are only so many weights I need
to store. 
</p>

<p>
The overall structure is fairly simple:
</p>
<pre>
    o
  /   \
x - o  - y
  .   .
   . .
    o 

</pre>

<p>
Before drawing in the calculations that need to happen, I'm going to
introduce a system for indexing nodes which should make this much
easier to talk about and parse:
</p>
<pre>
          Layer -&gt;
   +-------------------------&gt;
   |    
N  |               0       1
e  |               |       |
u  |          0 -  o       .
r  |       /         \     .
o  | 0 - x -  1 -  o - 0 - y
n  |       .         .
|  |        .       .
v  |         ns -  o
   v               

</pre>

<p>
It's a fairly simple system for drawing neurons – a layer index that
starts at the first hidden layer; and a per-layer index into the
neuron itself.
</p>

<p>
For each <b>weight</b> in the system, there are going to be 3 coordinates:
the neuron it's at, and then the <i>input</i> it's specified for – this is a
little bit different than most online courses, because I'm <i>not</i>
directly using vectors to be very explicit about the underlying
calculations (both avoiding matrix calculations and paying the price
in terms of speed as the price).
</p>

<p>
Drawing in the calculations for evaluating the network forward to make
this a little bit more concrete:
</p>

<pre>         0    1
         |    |                   layer input   
                                    |     |
     0 - o &lt;------- n[0,0] = relu(w[0, 0, 0]x + b[0, 0, 0])
  /        \                           |
x -  1 - o -  y                      neuron   
  .        .   \
   .      .     relu(sum(w[1, x, i]*n[0, i] + b[1, x, i]))
    ns - o

</pre>

<p>
I also have somewhat stronger constraints on the potential values for
my indexes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>for layer = 0
<ul>
<li>the neuron's index can go from 0 -&gt; <code>ns</code> (number of neurons)</li>
<li>the input can only be 0</li>
</ul></li>
<li>for layer = 1
<ul>
<li>the neuron's index can only be 0 (just one output)</li>
<li>and the input can go from 0 -&gt; ns (# of neurons in previous layer)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>
In the code, I often refer to the <code>[layer, neuron, input]</code> index as <code>[x,
y, z]</code>.
</p>

<p>
Having this written out explicitly helped me a lot in implementing the
network, and I hope the constraints should make sense to you given the
structure of the network.
</p>

<p>
Finally, instead of dealing with initializing and taking care of
multi-dimensional vectors or arrays, I'm going to use a trick I often
rely on in Advent of Code for complex grid structures and keep a
single vector – with a function to translate my custom indexing
system into offsets.

Starting the network with all weights initialized to 0 is a good way
to get stuck with 0 gradients during gradient descent: and a good
experiment to run while running the code yourself.
</p>

<p>
For this first iteration, I'm hard coding random initialization of
weights into the program – but I'll expose another function that
accepts custom initial weights in the next iteration for exploration.

I admit being disappointed about having to use an external crate that
<i>does</i> have some magic, but RNGs are another black box to open and play
with for another day.

<div id="text-org2965953">
<p>
Up next is evaluating the value predicted by the network at a single
point, which is a straight forward traversal through the network. I'm
going to use a leaky ReLU as my activation function, so I'll quickly
define it:
</p>

<div>

<p>
First, I'm going to throw in several utility functions to access or
calculate values in different parts of the net – in my first
implementation, I extracted these out after implementing back-prop,
but there's no harm in putting them up here first.
</p>

<div>

<p>
Iterating through the net and calculating values lends itself
comfortably to Rust's beautiful iterator/expression based system:
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>impl</span> <span>Net</span> {
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>eval</span>(<span>self</span>: &amp;<span>Self</span>, <span>val</span>: <span>f64</span>) -&gt; <span>f64</span> {
        relu(
            (0..<span>self</span>.ns)
                .map(|i| <span>self</span>.rwxb(<span>self</span>.rwxb(val, 0, i, 0), 1, 0, i))
                .sum(),
        )
    }
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If you look at the diagram, I need to calculate the values of the
individual neurons – \(Relu(w * x + b)\) – which can be expressed as
<code>rwxb(x, 0, i, 0)</code> with <code>x</code> as the input and <code>i</code> ranging from <code>0</code> to <code>ns</code>
(number of neurons).
</p>

<p>
Then, the value of y is the value of these neurons as inputs added up,
and passed through Relu <i>again</i>. Which  is exactly what the function
above does.
</p>

<p>
(I admit to messing up the naming convention a little bit with x
playing double duty as both the input and the first coordinate; I'll
try to clean this up later if I find anyone actually reading this post.)

<p>
Keeping loss as simple as possible, I'm simply calculating it as \((y -
y')^2\) at a data point. The <i>cost</i>, or loss across a given set of data
is then the average of the total loss. The implementation is as
straightforward as you would expect, given data in the form of tuples.
</p>

<p>
This is yet another decision to play around with in the future with
alternative functions.

Training involves calculating the cost for a given set of inputs,
determining the gradients of the cost for that set of inputs in terms
of all the weights and biases.

And then updating the weights and biases with the given learning rate

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/convos/convos.png" alt="The IRC Client: Convos"></p><p>Throughout 2020, in large part due to the lockdown, many people have started to become familiar with internal communication tools. Microsoft Teams, Slack, Telegram, Mattermost, and a few others are the most widely used and recognizable of these tools, but there still seems to be some people using Internet Relay Chat (IRC) ― one of the first online messaging services.</p><p>Many of the widely used international communication tools have been inspired by IRC, which is gradually falling into disuse due to the modern UI and UX and additional features being offered by these more well-known messaging applications.</p><p>Despite IRC being considered archaic, it is still being used today as a meeting place for many online communities. For example, people who are nostalgic for the early days of the Internet and users of, and contributors to, open-source software projects make IRC a place for discussion ― where it is not the identity that defines who you are, but the content.</p><p>In this article, I will illustrate what IRC is and share with you a product that greatly enhances the IRC protocol by adding features that are common to modern messaging applications. If you are searching for a convenient, self-hosted solution to connect to IRC, then this article is for you.</p><p>In the following paragraphs, we will discuss:</p><ul><li>What the IRC communication protocol is;</li><li>Getting a persistent, always-online chat on IRC;</li><li>Convos, an alternative to IRCCloud and its features;</li><li>The installation of Convos on Debian/Ubuntu; and</li><li>Convos configuration.</li></ul><h2 id="the-irc-communication-protocol">The IRC Communication Protocol</h2><p>IRC is a service that facilitates online communication via messages based on the “client-server” model. In a more technical and precise way, IRC can be considered a network protocol (at the application level) that uses a network composed of servers to easily send messages to network participants.</p><p>Developed in 1988 by Jarkko Oikkarinen, a Finnish student who wanted to create a communication system that would enable real time discussions for a network at his university, IRC quickly expanded to the point where more than 200,000 users were connected every day.</p><p>To start exchanging messages, the user must first connect to the IRC network via a client (e.g., <a href="https://www.pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a>, mIRC), which then connects to the server closest to the user in order to ensure high-speed performance. There are several networks, such as <a href="https://freenode.net/">Freenode</a>, <a href="https://www.swiftirc.net/">Swift IRC</a>, <a href="http://www.ircnet.org/">IRCNet</a>, and <a href="https://www.quakenet.org/">QuakeNet</a>.</p><p>Within IRC, you log in with a nickname (ASCII characters). This allows you to be recognized by the network to which you have connected. To initial a conversation, there are two different ways: start <strong>a private chat</strong> with another user (query) or connect to a <strong>channel</strong>.</p><p>A channel is a dedicated place to chat with a group of users, without writing to each one separately. It might sound strange nowadays, but in the late 1980s and early 1990s, this was viewed as revolutionary and a game changer with regard to how people connected over the Internet. A channel is typically administered by users, called operators, with special privileges and the ability to turn people away and invite them, make the channel private (invisible to the network), set a password, and much more.</p><p>From a technical point of view, an IRC network, currently described by the standard <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfc/rfc1459.txt">RFC 1459</a>, is composed of several nodes maintained by a centralized entity. When a user with a special client connects to one of the servers, the whole network must be informed about the presence of this client, replicating across all servers the following: nickname, name of the host from which the client has access to the Internet, and the name of the server to which this host is connected.</p><p>Regarding the nickname, you might wonder if another person could impersonate your nickname. The solution to this problem is to register your nickname with a password, so that (in the future) the server can ask you to identify yourself with the password. Here you can read about <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/IRC/Instructions">How to register your nickname on Freenode</a>.</p><p>As alluded to above, from a historical point of view, IRC represents a consolidated communication protocol that is still used today as a discussion environment for people who are nostalgic for the early days of the Internet and users of, and contributors to, open-source software projects. In a way, this has influenced the basic UI and UX of IRC. Today, this appreciation has gone well beyond these users, as IRC has inspired our modern day messaging applications. As an example, Slack is a sexier version of IRC ― dressed up with better UI and UX and having a few modernized features. At their core, though, IRC and today’s messaging applications are no different, as groups are the channels, queries are the private chats, and operators are the administrators.</p><p>If you would like to discover all the commands to better manage your own channel, I suggest you to read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_commands">the list of commands available on IRC</a>.</p><p>For a long time, IRC has been a gathering place for many communities, including Firefox, Bitcoin, Gnome, and many others. IRC has also been the site of many historic “jokes'' on the Internet. It would be remiss of me not to mention some of these most notable moments: <a href="http://bash.org/?244321">Hunter2</a>, <a href="http://bash.org/?5273">the guy who lost a device in his apartment</a>, and the timeless <a href="http://bash.org/?400459">“does anyone speak python here?"</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/team_chat.png"><figcaption><h4>IRC will never die (gently provided by XKCD)</h4></figcaption></figure><p>Arguably the biggest disadvantage of IRC is that you cannot always be connected to a specific server, unless you leave the client on all the time. Unlike normal messaging clients, you will not receive messages if you are not present on the IRC network. In fact, the remote nodes of IRC do not store any messages!</p><p>One of the solutions for this problem is to buy a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server">VPS</a> and manage the connection to IRC via a text client with a command line interface. However, this can be inconvenient on mobile devices and, specifically, for a person unfamiliar with the command line. To get around this problem, there is a free self-hosted alternative called Convos that allows you to connect via a web interface to IRC, but that’s not all!</p><h2 id="convoschat-the-solution-to-always-being-connected">Convos.chat: The Solution to Always Being Connected</h2><p><a href="https://convos.chat/">Convos</a> is an open-source, self-hosted client for connecting to IRC maintained by <a href="https://thorsen.pm/">Jan Henning Thorsen</a> and <a href="https://marcus.means.no/">Marcus</a>. The backend was developed with <a href="https://mojolicious.org/">Mojolicious</a>, a Perl framework, while the front-end used the Javascript framework <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>.</p><p>Developed in 2014, Convos has evolved into a very interesting project, despite being maintained by only one person. Among its main features, we find the persistent IRC connection that eliminates the risk of missing some important discussions! The user is connected as long as the Convos daemon is active and each message is stored in a log accessible only to the owner of the server.</p><p>Convos is one of the simplest ways to use IRC and it is always online, so initiating and staying in a discussion has never been easier. Its simple interface allows you to send messages on IRC from any device, be it a smartphone or a fridge ― you just need a browser. You can also choose a theme from those available or <a href="https://convos.chat/blog/2020/6/14/create-your-own-theme-detailed-walkthrough">write your own</a>. Another advantage of Convos is its self-hosted nature. There is no centralized third-party server (like with <a href="https://irccloud.com/">IRCCloud</a>) that stores your messages. With Convos, no one besides you will see your IRC messages and logs.</p><figure><img src="https://serhack.me/images/convos/screenshot.jpg"><figcaption><h4>Convos User Interface</h4></figcaption></figure><p>If you need to upload a file, but do not want to share it with third parties, Convos allows you to upload a file of any extension to your server. Drag and drop the file and Convos will do the rest, creating a unique link for you to share in order to access the file. Want to delete it? You can do it without any problem!</p><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/convos/drag_and_drop.gif" alt="Drag and Drop per Convos"></p><p>For text files, it gets even better. All messages that will have more than four “line breaks” will be uploaded to a personalized pastebin.</p><p>As we are all well aware, in 2020, having an <a href="https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html">Emoji</a> available is a must! Just type <code>:emoji_name</code> to see the list of emojis available on Convos. Note that all <a href="https://unicode.org/">Unicode</a> characters are also compatible, so across smartphones there will be no problems. You can also add links and make <strong>bold</strong> and/or <em>italicize</em> your posts with <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">Markdown</a>.</p><p>Given that IRCCloud is a service (with similar features) that is both <strong>centralized</strong> and <strong>expensive</strong>, <a href="https://convos.chat/">Convos</a> is the leading free alternative. Over the past few years, IRCCloud’s infrastructure has suffered several periods of downtime, which has impacted many (if not all) its users. Unlike IRCCloud, the expenses and stability of running a private server for Convos is more cost-efficient and reliable, especially when compared to the pricing model (per user/per month) and the fragile nature of the IRCCloud infrastructure.</p><h3 id="how-to-start-chatting-with-convos">How to Start Chatting with Convos</h3><p>Installation and configuration of Convos is very simple and does not require any special knowledge of shell scripting. The developers have prepared a very convenient way to run script, so that you will be able to install the Web client quickly.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">root@nodo#: curl https://convos.chat/install.sh | sh -</code></pre></div><p>Here is the <a href="https://convos.chat/install.sh">Script code</a>, if you want to view it. If the script did not show any problems, we can proceed by starting the Convos daemon:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">root@nodo#: ./convos/script/convos daemon</code></pre></div><p>Launch your browser and enter <code>http://localhost:3000</code> to start chatting. There are no additional steps. You only have to choose the IRC network (e.g. Freenode) and Convos will do the rest!</p><p>Since you will be the first user, by default you will be set up as the Convos administrator. This will allow you to manage users, reset passwords as needed or create new ones, and set some <a href="https://convos.chat/doc/config#global-config-settings">global environment variables</a> as the default Convos connection.</p><p>You can change the listening port or IP address via the <a href="https://convos.chat/doc/config#listen"><code>--listen</code></a> flag; although, it is strongly recommended to run Convos behind a proxy server.</p><p>If you want to run Convos through a proxy server, I recommend you read the guide <a href="https://convos.chat/doc/reverse-proxy">“How to Run Convos Behind Your Favourite Server”</a>. A reverse proxy is a particular application that acts as an intermediary, in this case, between the client (the user) and the Convos daemon. It is useful if you want to have features such as SSL management, load balancing, compression, and …</p></div></div>

      <div><p>Please send corrections or suggestions for additional questions to</p><p>&lt;solderpunk@posteo.net&gt;</p><p>Gemini is a new application-level internet protocol for the distribution of arbitrary files, with some special consideration for serving a lightweight hypertext format which facilitates linking between files.  You may think of Gemini as "the web, stripped right back to its essence" or as "Gopher, souped up and modernised a little", depending upon your perspective.  Gemini may be of interest to people who are:</p><div><ul><li>Opposed to the web's ubiquitous user tracking</li><li>Tired of obnoxious adverts, autoplaying videos and other misfeatures</li><li>Interested in low-power computing and/or low-speed networks</li></ul></div><p>Gemini is intended to be simple, but not necessarily as simple as possible.  Instead, the design strives to maximise its "power to weight ratio", while keeping its weight within acceptable limits.  Gemini is also intended to be very privacy conscious, to be difficult to extend in the future (so that it will *stay* simple and privacy conscious), and to be compatible with a "do it yourself" computing ethos.  For this last reason, Gemini is technically very familiar and conservative: it's a protocol in the traditional client-server request-response paradigm, and is built on mature, standardised technology like URIs, MIME media types, and TLS.</p><div><p><span>###</span></p><h3>1.2 Whose fault is Gemini?</h3></div><p>Project Gemini was started by Solderpunk &lt;solderpunk@posteo.net&gt;, who remains Benevolent Dictator For Now.  However, the protocol has been designed in collaboration with a loose and informal community of interested parties via emails, phlog and Fediverse posts.  Many people have shaped significant parts of the protocol, so Gemini should not be thought of as the work of one person.</p><div><p><span>###</span></p><h3>1.3 Where can I learn more?</h3></div><p>The official home of Project Gemini is the gemini.circumlunar.space server.  It serves the latest version of this FAQ document, as well the protocol specification and recommended best practices via Gemini, Gopher and HTTPS, on IPv4 and IPv6.</p><p>Official discussion regarding Gemini happens on a mailing list.  You can subscribe to the list and view archives at https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/listinfo/gemini.  Archives can also be viewed over Gemini at gemini://rawtext.club:1965/~sloum/geminilist/.</p><p>Anybody who is running a Gemini server or implementing a Gemini client or server software is strongly encouraged to subscribe to the list.</p><p>Casual discussion regarding Gemini also happens in the #gemini channel on the tilde.chat IRC server.  IRC logs can be viewed over Gemini at gemini://makeworld.gq/cgi-bin/gemini-irc.</p><div><p><span>###</span></p><h3>1.4 Do you really think you can replace the web?</h3></div><p>Not for a minute!  Nor does anybody involved with Gemini want to destroy Gopherspace.  Gemini is not intended to replace either Gopher or the web, but to co-exist peacefully alongside them as one more option which people can freely choose to use if it suits them.  In the same way that many people currently serve the same content via gopher and the web, people will be able to "bihost" or "trihost" content on whichever combination of protocols they think offer the best match to their technical, philosophical and aesthetic requirements and those of their intended audience.</p><div><p><span>###</span></p><h3>1.5 What's with the name?</h3></div><p>It's a reference to the pre-shuttle era of US manned spaceflight, which consisted of three projects.  The first was Project Mercury, which was a fairly minimalist "proof of concept" and part of the race to put a human in space soonest (which the Soviet Union won with their Vostok project).  Mercury was a one-man capsule with no ability to adjust to its own orbit after launch and only one Mercury flight lasted longer than a single day.  The last was Project Apollo, which was large, heavy, complicated and expensive but could, of course, fly three men to the moon and back.</p><p>Less well known to the modern public, Project Gemini was the "middle child": a two person capsule which could rendezvous and dock with other craft in orbit, could be depressurised and repressurised in orbit to facilitate spacewalks, and whose longest flight was almost two weeks - longer than any Apollo mission!  In terms of size, weight and cost Gemini was much closer to Mercury than to Apollo, but in terms of capabilities it was the other way around - there were even plans (which never eventuated) to do circumlunar Gemini flights!</p><p>Hopefully the analogy is obvious: Gopher is akin to Mercury, and the web is akin to Apollo.  Gemini hopes to sit between the two, doing more with less.</p><p>Gemini very deliberately didn't receive a name which had *anything* to do with gophers, or other rodents, or even other animals.  During the earliest phlog-based discussions which eventually grew into Project Gemini, a lack of careful writing meant it was sometimes unclear whether people were talking about replacing Gopher outright, or adding unofficial, compatibility-breaking upgrades into existing Gopher clients and servers.  When idle discussion turned into an actual project, it seemed wise to send a clearer message.</p><div><p><span> ##</span></p><h2>2.1 What are the design criteria for Gemini?</h2></div><p>The following criteria were informally put in place at the beginning of the project.  It's debatable how closely some of these goals have been met, but in general Gemini is still quite close to this target.</p><p>In particular, Gemini strives for simplicity of client implementation.  Modern web browsers are so complicated that they can only be developed by very large and expensive projects.  This naturally leads to a very small number of near-monopoly browsers, which stifles innovation and diversity and allows the developers of these browsers to dictate the direction in which the web evolves.</p><p>Gemini aims to be simple, but not *too* simple.  Gopher is simpler at a protocol level, but as a consequence the client is eternally uncertain: what character encoding is this text in?  Is this text the intended content or an error message from the server?  What kind of file is this binary data?  Because of this, a robust Gopher client is made *less* simple by needing to infer or guess missing information.  Early Gemini discussion included three clear goals with regard to simplicity:</p><div><ul><li>It should be possible for somebody who had no part in designing the protocol to accurately hold the entire protocol spec in their head after reading a well-written description of it once or twice.</li><li>A basic but usable (not ultra-spartan) client should fit comfortably within 50 or so lines of code in a modern high-level language.  Certainly not more than 100.</li><li>A client comfortable for daily use which implements every single protocol feature should be a feasible weekend programming project for a single developer.</li></ul></div><p>It's debatable to what extent these goals have been met.  Experiments suggest that a very basic interactive client takes more like a minimum of 100 lines of code, and a comfortable fit and moderate feature completeness need more like 200 lines.  But Gemini still seems to be in the ballpark of these goals.</p><p>Gemini is designed with an acute awareness that the modern web is a privacy disaster, and that the internet is not a safe place for plaintext.  Things like browser fingerprinting and Etag-based "supercookies" are an important cautionary tale: user tracking can and will be snuck in via the backdoor using protocol features which were not designed to facilitate it.  Thus, protocol designers must not only avoid designing in tracking features (which is easy), but also assume active malicious intent and avoid designing anything which could be subverted to provide effective tracking.  This concern manifests as a deliberate non-extensibility in many parts of the Gemini protocol.</p><p>The "first class" application of Gemini is human consumption of predominantly written material - to facilitate something like gopherspace, or like "reasonable webspace" (e.g. something which is comfortably usable in Lynx or Dillo).  But, just like HTTP can be, and is, used for much, much more than serving HTML, Gemini should be able to be used for as many other purposes as possible without compromising the simplicity and privacy criteria above.  This means taking into account possible applications built around non-text files and non-human clients.</p><div><p><span> ##</span></p><h2>2.2 Which shortcomings of Gopher does Gemini overcome?</h2></div><p>Gemini allows for:</p><div><ul><li>Unambiguous use of arbitrary non-ASCII character sets.</li><li>Identifying binary content using MIME types instead of a small set of badly outdated item types.</li><li>Clearly distinguishing successful transactions from failed ones.</li><li>Linking to non-gopher resources via URLs without ugly hacks.</li><li>Redirects to prevent broken links when content moves or is rearranged.</li><li>Domain-based virtual hosting.</li></ul></div><p>Text in Gemini documents is wrapped by the client to fit the device's viewport, rather than being "hard wrapped" at ~80 characters with newline characters.  This means content displays equally well on phones, tablets, laptops and desktops.</p><p>Gemini does away with Gopher's strict directory / text dichotomy and lets you insert links in prose.</p><p>Gemini mandates the use of TLS encryption.</p><div><p><span> ##</span></p><h2>2.3 Is Gopher's directory / text dichotomy *really* a shortcoming?</h2></div><p>Modern usage habits in the phlogosphere would seem to suggest that many people think it is.  An increasing number of users are serving content which is almost entirely text as item type 1, so that they can insert a relatively small number of "in line" links to other gopher content, providing some semblance of HTML's hyperlinking - a perfectly reasonable and inoffensive thing to want to do.  Without taking this approach, the best Gopher content authors can do is to paste a list of URLs at the bottom of their document, for their readers to manually copy and paste into their client.  This is not exactly a pleasant user experience.  But forcing hyperlinks into Gopher this way isn't just an abuse of the semantics of the Gopher protocol, it's also a surprisingly inefficient way to serve text, because every single line has to have an item type of i and a phony selector, hostname and port …</p></div></div></div>

						<p>The holiday season is still not done delivering bad news. With ICUs at 0% capacity in some parts of the United States, Public health officials wonder if the seasonal change alone will affect the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. A recent research study has studied the influence of temperature and humidity on the properties of individual virus-likes.</p><blockquote>When it comes to fighting the spread of this virus, you kind of have to fight every particle individually. And so you need to understand what makes each individual particle degrade. People are also working on vaccines and are trying to understand how the virus is recognized? All of these questions are single particle questions. And if you understand that, then that enables you to fight a hoard of them.</blockquote><p>The results indicate cold weather could have a preserving effect on the virus. The first study to evaluate the mechanics of the virus at a single particle stage, found that other coronaviruses tend to infect more people during the winter months.</p><figure><img src="https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/Picture1.png" alt="" srcset="https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Picture1.png 600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Picture1.png 1000w, https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/Picture1.png 1302w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-us-maps-and-cases/">CNN; Johns Hopkins University</a></figcaption></figure><p>"You would expect that temperature makes a huge difference, and that's what we saw.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>by Marc Scholten, 20.12.2020</em></p>
<p>The quality of GHC's error messages is making it harder for newcomers to adopt Haskell. A good error message should be clear, actionable, and practical. In this aspect GHC could be a lot more user-friendly.</p>

<p>Here's an example related to type-level-list syntax that often comes up in the IHP community:</p>

<pre>action CreateUserAction = do
        let user = newRecord @User
        let password = param @Text "password"
        user
            |&gt; set #passwordHash password
            |&gt; fill @["email"]
            |&gt; validateField #email isEmail
            |&gt; validateField #passwordHash nonEmpty
            |&gt; debug
            |&gt; ifValid \case
            Left user -&gt;
                render NewView {..}
            Right user -&gt; do
                hashed &lt;- hashPassword (get #passwordHash user)
                user
                    |&gt; set #passwordHash hashed
                    |&gt; createRecord

                setSuccessMessage "You have successfully registered"
</pre>

<p>This code snippet errors with:</p>

<pre>Web/Controller/Users.hs:16:23
    * Expected a type, but `"email"' has kind `Symbol'
    * In the type `["email"]'
      In the second argument of `(|&gt;)', namely `fill @["email"]'
      In the first argument of `(|&gt;)', namely
        `user |&gt; set #passwordHash password |&gt; fill @["email"]'
   |
16 |             |&gt; fill @["email"]
   |                       ^^^^^^^
</pre>

<p>Unless you know about the type-level-list syntax issue with <code>'</code> you will most likely get stuck.</p>

<p>A better error message could offer a solution that will most likely help:</p>

<pre>Web/Controller/Users.hs:16:23
    * Type level lists with only a single element need a ' in front of the list. Prepend a ' like `'["email]' to get it working.
    * In the type `["email"]'
      In the second argument of `(|&gt;)', namely `fill @["email"]'
      In the first argument of `(|&gt;)', namely
        `user |&gt; set #passwordHash password |&gt; fill @["email"]'
   |
16 |             |&gt; fill @["email"]
   |                       ^^^^^^^
</pre>

<p><a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/issues/587" target="_blank">We've collected a couple more real-world issues on GitHub with possible better alternatives.</a></p>

<p><strong>I'd like to start a discussion in the larger haskell community on this so we can find a process on how we can improve this longterm.</strong> E.g. maybe we could have a central repository where haskell users could report bad and unclear error messages.
</p>

<p>There's <a href="https://github.com/haskell/rfcs">haskell/rfcs</a> for new GHC features, so why don't we have a repository like <code>haskell/ux</code> where we can collect ideas to improve existing features?</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Hi! I'm Marcel, web developer at <a href="https://www.q42.com/">Q42</a> and creator of the <a href="https://micr.io/">Micrio storytelling platform</a>.</p>
<p>In 2015, I started developing a JavaScript viewer for ultra high resolution 2D and 360° images with added markers, tours, audio, and more. Since then, I've been pushing to find the best balance between hardware performance, minimal CPU and bandwidth use, and compatibility for older browsers to deliver a sharp and high quality viewing experience.</p>
<p>For Micrio, it is vital that the performance on the client's browser is as good as possible. The reason for this is very simple: when you are being told a story, or watching a movie, even <em>a single frameskip</em> immediately takes you out of your experience.</p>
<p>Since Micrio is being used for an <a href="https://micr.io/showcases">ever growing list</a> of awesome projects, the most important thing is that for whoever visits a Micrio project, it must work, and <em>work well</em>: delivering fast load times, and a butter smooth interactive experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> (Wasm) is the ability for your browser to run <em>compiled</em> code at (near-) native speeds. It is now recognised by the W3C as the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/12/pressrelease-wasm-rec.html.en">4th official web programming language</a>, after HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
<p>With it, you can run compiled code written in a variety of programming languages (C/C++, Rust, Go, AssemblyScript, <a href="https://github.com/appcypher/awesome-wasm-langs">and many more</a>) in your browser, without any need for plugins.</p>
<p>Finding out about Wasm in late 2019 really made me want to try it out. Could I use this tech to make the Micrio client run smoother than the current version does? Would I need to rewrite everything in C++, and if so, how would that work? Would the effort be worth the gains it would give me? And not in the least.. <em>how does it work!?</em></p>
<p>This article describes my journey from upgrading the Micrio <strong>JavaScript-only client to use WebAssembly</strong>, with the hopes of improving performance, and taking my code to the next level.</p>
<h3 id="thecurrentversion">The current version</h3>
<p>To give a rough idea about the tech stack of the current latest JS-only revision of Micrio (<a href="https://b.micr.io/micrio-2.9.min.js">version 2.9</a>): This library as a single JS file works on all semi-modern browsers, including even Internet Explorer 10 for 2D, and IE 11 for 360° images.</p>
<p>It uses Canvas2D for the rendering of 2D images, and <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a>/WebGL rendering for 360° images. Written in <a href="https://caniuse.com/#search=es6">ES6 JavaScript</a> (or ECMAScript 6, the latest version of JavaScript), it still <a href="https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler">compiles</a> to ES5 to support Internet Explorer 11.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, displaying a <a href="https://micr.io/i/xCSYV/">231.250 x 193.750 pixel image</a> in your browser in a matter of milliseconds, allowing the user to freely zoom in and navigate, requires a little bit of processing power.</p>
<p>Now, Micrio 2.9 <em>isn't bad</em>. It runs pretty smoothly on all devices. But with WebAssembly around the corner, allowing all calculations to be done at native CPU speeds, this could potentially make a big difference in making Micrio's performance even better, and could improve the code architecture a lot.</p>
<p>And, perhaps, this could also mark the setup for a new major version, where I will draw a clear line and drop all compatibility and polyfills for older browsers: <strong>Micrio 3.0</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="firstrewritecandemscripten">First Rewrite: C++ and emscripten</h2>
<p>As a first step into the world of WebAssembly, getting to know the ecosystem, I started to play around with <a href="https://emscripten.org/">emscripten</a>. With it, you can take almost any project made in C or C++, and compile it to a binary <code>.wasm</code> file that your browser can natively run.</p>
<p>At this point, I didn't really have a clear image of where WebAssembly starts and ends, and how autonomously it could run inside your browser. So I started a new project from scratch to see if I could make a C++-implementation of the basic Micrio logic: a virtual <em>zoomable</em> and <em>pannable</em> image consisting of a lot of separate tiles, using a virtual camera for displaying only the tiles necessary for what the user is viewing inside your screen.</p>
<p>It turns out, emscripten already had great compatibility for <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/">libsdl</a>: a low-level audio, keyboard/mouse input, and OpenGL library. Which is awesome, because I could write my code using this very well documented library, even including mouse and key inputs and WebGL rendering. Since I was also working with downloading images, I also used the <a href="https://github.com/nothings/stb">stb_image.h</a> image library.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelduin/Micrio.Blogpost.wasm-v3/master/img/cpp.png" alt="Setting up SDL and OpenGL" title="C++ in the 21st century"></p>
<p>The largest struggle of this was picking up C++ again, never having used it outside of hobby scope many years ago. But after a few days of cursing and second guessing myself, I had a working first version with all of the most important features written with help of the SDL library:</p>
<ul>
<li>A virtual camera and all necessary viewing logic;</li>
<li>Image tiles downloading;</li>
<li>Rendering using WebGL(/OpenGL) using a simple shader;</li>
<li>Mouse event handling for panning and zooming the image;</li>
<li>Resize event handling to fit Micrio to the desired <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> HTML element</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see this version running here: <a href="https://b.micr.io/_test/wasm/index.html">https://b.micr.io/_test/wasm/index.html</a> :</p>

<h3 id="firstresults">First Results</h3>
<p>As incredibly awesome it was to see Micrio in C++ running smoothly in my browser, and even handing all the user's input, there were a few reservations, which left me with an unsatisfied feeling.</p>
<h4 id="1codingcfeltoldfashioned">1. Coding C++ felt old-fashioned</h4>
<p>Writing C++ felt like going back in time. Incredibly powerful and fully proven, but also archaic, especially for me as a web developer. I spent more time fiddling with making an optimized <code>Makefile</code> than I care to admit.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelduin/Micrio.Blogpost.wasm-v3/master/img/makefile.png" alt="The emscripten C++ Makefile" title="( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"></p>
<h4 id="2thecompiledwasmbinarywasverylarge">2. The compiled <code>.wasm</code> binary was very large</h4>
<p>As great as the help of <code>libsdl</code> and <code>stb_image.h</code> were to let me use OpenGL and JPG image functions, as much did they add to the final compiled binary file. Even with all <code>emcc</code> compiler optimizations (which can even use the awesome <code>closure</code> JS compiler), the resulting WebAssembly binary file was 760KB. Compared to the JavaScript version of Micrio being around 240KB, this was a major setback. These libraries packed a lot of functionalities that were not necessary for Micrio, but were still included in the compiled version.</p>
<h4 id="3tilagluefile">3. TIL: A <em>glue</em> file</h4>
<p>This is the part where I learnt where the limits of WebAssembly start and finish. <strong>WebAssembly is not a magical self-contained binary that lets you run full applications out of the box</strong>. It actually needs to be <em>bound</em> to the browser using JavaScript.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelduin/Micrio.Blogpost.wasm-v3/master/img/glued.png" alt="glue clipart"><br>
<small><a href="http://www.clker.com/clipart-13445.html">Image source</a></small></p>
<p>Where I thought that all the SDL OpenGL code in C++ would automagically be recognised by the browser: <em>wrong</em>. What <code>emscripten</code> does, is to take all OpenGL operations from C++, and <em>convert them</em> to WebGL operations your browser can understand.</p>
<p>Same with the <code>libsdl</code> mouse and keyboard-inputs: these were <strong>glued</strong> to the browser using an extra JavaScript file that would set event listeners for the specific cases, and send them to the WebAssembly binary. This separate JavaScript file was generated by the emscripten compiler, and had to be included in the HTML alongside the compiled binary <code>.wasm</code> file.</p>
<p>Everything added together, the new total of the <em>base engine</em> of Micrio was a whopping <strong>791KB</strong>; a bit too much for my liking.</p>
<h2 id="secondrewriteassemblyscript">Second Rewrite: AssemblyScript</h2>
<p>Fast forward a few months, to just after having attended the awesome <a href="https://webassembly-summit.org/">WebAssembly Summit</a> in Mountain View in February 2020. With a bundle of fresh energy and inspiration, I decided to see if I could use WebAssembly to improve the Micrio JavaScript client a second time.</p>
<p>During the WebAssembly conference, I was very impressed by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8j_ieOm4vE">synth demo</a> written in <strong><a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/">AssemblyScript</a></strong>, a language created specifically for WebAssembly, using the TypeScript syntax. Basically you can write (near) TypeScript, which compiles to a <code>.wasm</code>-binary. So anyone familiar with either TypeScript or JavaScript ES6 will not have a lot of difficulties using it.</p>
<p>And the great thing-- it's all installed using <code>npm</code>, so <a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/quick-start.html">getting it up and running</a> and compiling your program is super easy!</p>
<p>There are a few basic <a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/types.html"><code>types</code> added in AssemblyScript</a>, which are required for compile-time optimizations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>f64</code> / <code>f32</code> : For 64 or 32-bit floats;</li>
<li><code>i8</code> / <code>i16</code> / <code>i32</code> / <code>i64</code> : For signed <code>int</code>s, ranging in precision</li>
<li><code>u8</code> .. <code>u64</code> : For unsigned <code>int</code>s</li>
<li><a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/types.html">And a few more</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="goingatomic">Going atomic</h3>
<p>This time, I wanted to see if it was possible to only let a small part of Micrio run inside WebAssembly, and still use most of the JavaScript that was already inside the client. <em>How small can we get it?</em> I decided to focus on a subset of camera functions, such as translating screen coordinates to image coordinates and vice versa. So this time no rendering, event handling, or writing shaders.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelduin/Micrio.Blogpost.wasm-v3/master/img/assemblyscript.png" alt="Simple camera functions in AssemblyScript" title="My First AssemblyScript"><br>
<small><em>Simple camera functions in AssemblyScript</em></small></p>
<p>The result: a 3KB binary containing some basic math functions, that take an input and return an output. AssemblyScript offers some <em>glue-tooling</em> by providing its own <a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/loader.html">Loader</a>, which will deal with importing the binary file and being able to call these functions.</p>
<p>However, this is optional and I ended up using the JavaScript <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Using_the_JavaScript_API">WebAssembly API</a>, <em>neat</em>. And it turns out, this is super easy: simply use the <code>fetch</code> API to load your compiled <code>.wasm</code> file, cast it as an <code>ArrayBuffer</code>, and use the <code>WebAssembly.instantiate()</code> function to get it up and running.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelduin/Micrio.Blogpost.wasm-v3/master/img/instantiate.png" alt="Loading a wasm file" title="Gluing it yourself"></p>
<p>The compiled binary will then offer an <code>exports</code> object, containing the functions that you have exported in the AssemblyScript file, which you can immediately call from JavaScript as if they were normal functions.</p>
<p>Wait.. "<em>which you can immediately call from JavaScript as if they were normal functions</em>"...</p>
<p><strong>WebAssembly is running synchronously to JavaScript!</strong> 🤯</p>
<p>Having worked with WebWorkers before, I honestly thought that WebAssembly would run inside its own CPU thread, and that any function calls would be <code>async</code>. Nope, the Wasm-functions you call will return immediately!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/exports-and-imports.html#exports"><em>This is, like, powerful stuff</em>!</a></p>
<h3 id="bundlingthecompiledwasminsidethejsfile">Bundling the compiled Wasm inside the JS file</h3>
<p>Since I now had some extra performing hands on deck for Micrio that was very easy to integrate, I decided to include this minimal WebAssembly binary in the then-stable release of Micrio (2.9).</p>
<p>However, I didn't want an extra HTTP request for the Wasm binary every time someone loaded the Micrio JS. So I included a <code>base64</code> encoded version of the Wasm-file <em>inside</em> the Micrio JS, and for browsers that support it, auto-loaded that. As a …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p>Sunday, December 20, 2020</p>
<p>I just finished the implementation of an important feature of Pijul: clones, pushes and pulls on partial repositories. In this post, I explain why this matters.</p>
<h2 id="change-commutation">Change commutation</h2>
<p>Pijul is based on <em>changes</em>, also called <em>patches</em> or <em>diffs</em>.
This doesn’t mean that its only internal datastructure is patches, quite to the contrary: it was only by departing from a patch-only internal representation that we were able to solve the algorithmic challenges inherent to patch-based systems.</p>
<p>However, being change-based does mean that the core operations of Pijul are defined on changes, and that Pijul is designed in such a way that changes satisfy basic intuitive properties, similar to algebraic operations. One basic thing is that applying a change is an <em>associative</em> operation, like matrix multiplication: applying $A$ and $B$ at once, and then later $C$, is the same as applying $A$, and then $B$ and $C$ at once. In matrix multiplication, $(AB)C = A(BC)$. Moreover, in Pijul, all changes are invertible (whereas only some matrices are): for any change $A$, there is an “inverse change” $A^{-1}$ such that applying $A^{-1}$ after $A$ is the same as applying neither. Of course, both $A$ and $A^{-1}$ will appear in the log, but the contents of the repository will be the same as applying neither $A$ nor $A^{-1}$.</p>
<p>There is another property that users want from version control systems, and that is <strong>commutation</strong>.
Matrix multiplication rarely commutes<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.
In Git, commutation is usually <em>simulated</em> using branches and rebase: indeed, rebasing a branch A on top of another branch B really means commuting the commits of A since the divergence between A and B, and the commits of B since the divergence. However, that commutation isn’t perfect, since the commits must change their hash when rebased.</p>
<p>Things are simpler in Pijul, because any two changes that <em>could have been written independently</em> always commute, meaning that if the two changes could be written without knowledge of each other, they can be applied in any order.</p>
<p>This of course raises a potential concern:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I can apply $A$ and $B$ in any order, how do I know which order is the <strong>right</strong> one?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Pijul, this question <strong>does not matter</strong>: both orders will yield <strong>the exact same result</strong>, the only difference is that the log will list the changes in the order in which they were applied. And I’m not saying that it doesn’t matter because I’m careless, but because it truly is the same thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I disagree: it does matter, I still prefer to have a “<em>linear</em>” order for my changes/commits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, everybody wants to see the order of operations in a repository, for many reasons. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>We want to keep a record of the operations performed on our repository.</li>
<li>We want to go back in time.</li>
</ul>
<p>And in fact, Pijul allows you to do exactly that, but in a more rigorous way than Git. Indeed, take the scenario where Alice and Bob work together, Alice makes a change $A$ while Bob makes $B$. When they put their work together, Alice applies Bob’s change, resulting in the log $AB$, while Bob applies Alice’s change, resulting in the log $BA$. In this case, there is no “true” linear history, since they worked on different things, and took different steps at different times. However, both of them want to be able to go back in time, step-by-step, and not just “<em>step-by-step-according-to-Bob’s-order</em>”.</p>
<h2 id="commutation-and-massive-repositories">Commutation and massive repositories</h2>
<p>One of the biggest challenge for Pijul up to the recent releases was scalability: even modestly-sized repositories like Pijul’s source code would use a lot of disk space. This was even more disappointing since, as I’m about to explain, commutation was suposed to allow it to scale to gigantic repository sizes… in theory. The same problem also made massive tests impossible, meaning that getting past the “0.x releases” seemed more and more impossible as time passed.</p>
<p>Now that this phase is mostly behind us, the cool bits of the theory finally become practical.</p>
<p>In particular, in Pijul, each change contains a reference to the files it modifies. Note that, because we want operations on repositories (such as renaming files) to commute with edits inside files, we don’t identify files and directories by name, but by a unique identifier made from the hash of the change that introduced that file or directory.</p>
<p>For repositories with multiple projects, this makes it possible to clone and pull just parts of a repository, and work on that part as if we had the entire thing. Indeed, imagine we have a repository with the following log:</p>
<ol>
<li>A, adding file <em>x</em></li>
<li>B, editing <em>x</em></li>
<li>C, adding file <em>y</em></li>
<li>D, adding file <em>z</em></li>
<li>E, renaming <em>x</em> to <em>w</em></li>
<li>F, editing <em>y</em> and <em>z</em></li>
</ol>
<p>All these changes do not necessarily commute; however, since B and C touch completely different files (namely, <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>), they could be produced in parallel, and hence they commute. This means that we can pull only the changes related to a specific file, say <em>x</em>, and make the following history: A, B, E<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Moreover, any change made on top of that sequence will commute with C, D and F: indeed, if we edit file <em>x</em> again, producing a change G, then since G can be made in parallel to C, D and F, we can push G after any patch that comes after B in that history, for example getting history “ABCDEFG”.</p>
<p>Note that this is done without changing the changes nor their hash.</p>
<h2 id="another-trick-for-large-files">Another trick for large files</h2>
<p>As explained in previous posts on this blog, Pijul changes have a bit more information than diffs, and operate on graphs rather than files. This means that changes can be split into two parts, a short-ish one with a binary specification of the graph operations, and then the new content inserted by the change.</p>
<p>The change format is designed to be downloadable in two stages: one can download the operations without downloading the contents. One issue with this is security: if we don’t download the contents, how can we make sure that the hash is right? This is done by including a hash of the change in the “operations” section of the change, and letting the hash of a change be the hash of the “operations” section.</p>
<p>This makes it possible for someone to make five versions of a large binary file in a day, where each change deletes the entire file, and adds it again, the operation sections only contain the length of the different versions, not the actual bytes. In order to get the latest version of the file, a client will therefore only have to download the latest change completely, and only the operations section of the previous ones.</p>
<p>Note that this makes the following “attack” possible: a server might trick a client into believing that the server has a change with hash $A$, which inserts $n$ bytes into a file, and then another change with hash $B$, deleting all these bytes. When the client downloads $A$ and $B$, it doesn’t need to download the contents. However, if the client later decides to unrecord $B$, the contents of $A$ will have to be downloaded, and the client will be able to tell that the hash of $A$ was incorrect. This should make it impossible to unrecord $B$ without also unrecording $A$. However, if $A$ made other edits, and other changes depend on $A$, this could be problematic.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is next?</h2>
<p>There is one remaining painpoint for very large repositories, and this is the fact that in order to clone a repository with a very large history, one must download and apply all the changes, one by one. Even though our apply function is quite fast<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, this can still be problematic for dozens or hundreds of thousands of changes.</p>
<p>In my next post, I will talk about a solution to this problem, which I have started to implement.</p>
<section role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Matrices that are simultaneously diagonalizable do, for example, but for two arbitrary matrices $A$ and $B$, $AB$ is often different from $BA$. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Note that in this case, we could also pull A, E, B, since renaming a file commutes with editing it. However, we must start with A, since adding a file could not be possibly done in parallel to editing or renaming it. <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
<p>The complexity of apply is in $O(|p| |c| \log |H|)$, where $|p|$ is the size of the change, $|c|$ is the size of the largest conflict in which $p$ is involved, and $|H|$ is the number of edits made since the start of the repository. <a href="#fnref:3" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
</ol>

    <p>Where should you put your server? If it is a web server probably in a public subnet. Wrong!</p>

<p><em>This article was originally <a href="https://medium.com/the-passionate-craftsman-blog/where-to-put-your-server-in-a-private-or-public-subnet-ab1fa971269c#.xzvzycv5c">posted on Medium</a></em></p>

<h2 id="what-a-developer-would-do">What a developer would do</h2>

<p>Usually web developers run a server in a provider like Linode, they install the stack they need, and they deploy the code. This has serious implications regarding security: that server is exposed to the Internet and it is vulnerable. If you have a small budget and you have a small web app, probably it is the only way to go, although you should, at least, harden the server and set up the firewall (iptables if you are using Linux).</p>

<p>However, if you need HA, security, and scalability, you cannot just use one server. In this case, you will have at least a private and a public subnet. Even better, you should have a public subnet, a private subnet for your webservers and another private subnet for your DBMS, which would be a multi-tiered architecture. So which server goes where? You should put as many servers as you can in the private subnet unless you are really forced to put it in the public subnet.</p>

<h2 id="a-short-list-of-rules-to-help-you">A short list of rules to help you</h2>

<p>Here is a short list of rules you should use when deciding where to put a server:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is the server needed to manage other servers? If yes, then it should go in the public subnet, because you will need to connect to that server first, via the Internet, then connect to the server you want to manage. A bastion server is a good example (OpenSHH server).</li>
  <li>Does the server provide a network service? If it is a load balancer, a NAT server, a Proxy, a VPN server, they should be in the public subnet, they all need access to the Internet, a direct access.</li>
  <li>Does the server need to replicate data in another DC? It should go in the private subnet and it should replicate via a VPN, a site-to-site connection. You want to send your data via an encrypted tunnel, and you want to make sure that only certain data will be allowed in your tunnel, by using AWS NACLs or a firewall.</li>
  <li>Does your server need to connect to external servers? If yes, you can put your server in the private subnet and route requests to the Internet (CIDR 0.0.0.0/0) to a NAT server, or NAT Gateway if you are using AWS.</li>
  <li>Do you have a load balancer which has to balance traffic coming from Internet and redirect the traffic to web servers in the public subnets? It should stay in the public subnet.</li>
  <li>Do you have a WAF, Web Application Firewall? Put it in the public subnet like the load balancer.</li>
  <li>Do you have a load balancer that is receiving traffic not from the Internet? It is an internal load balancer and it should stay in a private subnet.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="an-example">An example</h2>

<p>In the following diagram you can see how you could replicate the database state to a corporate network. Web servers are in the public subnet, but it would be netter to move then in the private subnet and receive web traffic via an ELB (Elastic Load Balancer).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>I recently had the opportunity to encrypt/decrypt stuff using AES, but I didn’t know it inside out well. I couldn’t help but be curious about how it is working, and I realized my mind could only be satisfied by digging deeper into its implementation.
This post walks you through how AES encryption works by reading core implementation written in Go.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-aes-encryption">What is AES encryption?</h2>
<p>The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetric block cipher, an alternative to the DES. Cryptographers from around the world proposed algorithms, from which the Rijndael algorithm was selected in 2000. Hence we’ll take a look the implementation of this Rijndael.</p>
<h2 id="rijndael">Rijndael</h2>
<p>Rijndael is a block cipher algorithm. A block cipher is a cryptographic algorithm that processes a specific number of bits at a time.
The number of bits (called block length) to be processed at a time depends on the algorithm, AES is 128-bits (16-bytes). Most plaintext we encrypt is longer than this block length, so we typically use this block cipher algorithm repeatedly.
Keep in mind this post goes into some details on only on one block’s process to focus more on the core algorithm.</p>
<h2 id="digging-deeper-into-the-implementation">Digging deeper into the implementation</h2>
<p>The Go language officially provides the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/aes/">crypto/aes</a> package, which makes use of Go Assembly to leverage Intel’s hardware support for AES if it’s built for amd64.
It otherwise uses the implementation written in pure Go. Let’s take a look at the pure Go implementation that the human mind relatively can work in.</p>
<p>The public method <code>aesCipher.Encrypt</code> defined in <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/55b58018f41e6de63bdaa8f3d9a284077d4e88c1/src/crypto/aes/cipher.go#L54-L65">aes/cipher.go</a> looks to implement a block cipher:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>// The AES block size in bytes.

	}

	}

</code></pre></div><p>Rijndael encrypts a block by repeating a process called a round.
In a round, there are four processes: SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, and AddRoundKey. As commented out in the snippet, the number of rounds depends on the key length.</p>
<h3 id="subbytes">SubBytes</h3>
<p>The conversion is done 1-byte at a time based on a conversion table called S-box which has 256 values.
Below illustrates to perform <code>sbox[s0[1]]</code> well:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://nakabonne.dev/img/aes-sbox.jpg" width="100%" height="auto"> 
</figure>

<p>Unlike DES, we can see that all bytes have been converted at this point.
This post doesn’t cover AES’s S-Box as it is mentioned in many places and much better than I could do.</p>
<h3 id="shiftrows">ShiftRows</h3>
<p>The next step is to process the rows that are grouped into 4-byte units and shifted regularly to the left.
The number of bytes to be shifted depends on the line, as shown below:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://nakabonne.dev/img/aes-shift-rows.jpg" width="100%" height="auto"> 
</figure>

<h3 id="mixcolumns">MixColumns</h3>
<p>In the previous step, it dealt with rows, but the next is to process the bytes in columns.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://nakabonne.dev/img/aes-mix-columns.jpg" width="100%" height="auto"> 
</figure>

<p>It involves multiplication operations in a finite field, hence this step is a bit tough to describe. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijndael_MixColumns">Wikipedia</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="addroundkey">AddRoundKey</h3>
<p>Finally, it XORs the output of MixColumns with the round key. The following figure shows the execution of <code>s0[1] ^ xk[4]</code> (the <code>^</code> denotes an XOR operation in Go).</p>

<p>While this post has only shown you the encryption process, these processes are fully reversible with an Inverse MixColumns, ShiftRows, SubBytes. How beautiful!
I’ll keep reading the implementation to deepen my understanding of cryptography.</p>

            <h2>2009 - Communication</h2>
            <p>
              Far back in 2009, while following Digital Communication, Advertising and Art Direction at NABA (New Academy of Fine Arts of Milan), I became interested in Professor Massimo Banzi's classes and managed to get an Arduino Diecimila. In just one day my vision of the world had changed and I slowly started to better understand computers and electronics while sharing results with the Arduino community both on my website and on Arduino's forum. I started to build robots and after few years of experiments I launched my first start­up: a webshop of arduino-compatible, CNC machined robot kits, boards and sensors.

            <h2>2010 - Let's transmit data</h2>
            <p>
              At the time in my projects I had to connect many microcontrollers on a common bus and I found myself not satisfied by the solutions available, for this reason I started to develop my own data link. I perfectly remember that night back in 2010 when I started bit-banging bits using an Arduino and trying to sample them with another. The first problem I hit were bugs in the implementation that were quickly resolved. Then I unsterstood I did not have any synchronization, depending on when the receiver was powered on bits were shifted. That night, with no experience in electronics or engineering I instinctively defined the synchronization pulse that is still present as the core of <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/blob/13.0/src/strategies/SoftwareBitBang/specification/PJDL-specification-v5.0.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PJDL (Padded Jittering Data Link) v5.0</a>. To make sure to synchronize with the start of each byte I have added a 1 longer than data bits followed by a 0 and instructed the receiver to find it and only then start sampling 8 bits. Data was coming in perfectly. That was <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/blob/master/src/strategies/SoftwareBitBang/specification/obsolete/padded-jittering-protocol-specification-v0.1.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PJDL (Padded jittering data link) v0.1</a> which was basic and working by mere chance. Then, after debugging it further, experiments proved it was working well not only through wires and the human body, but also wirelessly through radio and infrared light, yet it showed to be robust operating bidirectionally in spite of interference. After I noticed that it was possible to connect more than 2 devices to the same wire, I started to experiment with an initial collision avoidance phase, an 8 bits device id and a synchronous acknowledgement at the end of the packet. It was shocking to see that many devices were able to send and receive data through the same wire. Soon after I released <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/blob/master/specification/obsolete/PJON-protocol-specification-v0.1.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PJON v0.1</a> on the Arduino forum, receiving plenty of "don't ­reinvent ­the ­wheel" and few active contributors.

            <h2>2014 - Let's network</h2>
            <p>
              In those days I became aware of how quickly the cloud was eating the world and how difficult was to connect stuff directly without relying on a third-party. It seemed like noone could connect computers together anymore without an ever present observing big brother. To be honest, I did not like it: that was the point when I understood how <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PJON</a> could have changed the game and what I personally could have done to influence the outcome. I decided to double my efforts on the protocol and try my best to provide humanity with a free and more efficient way to make networks. With a working protocol layer and support from the community, I went further in the address space development adding an optional 32 bits bus id used to identify a group of up to 255 devices, supporting up to 4.294.967.295 buses and a total of 1.090.921.692.930 devices. This addition released in <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/blob/master/specification/obsolete/PJON-protocol-specification-v0.2.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PJON v0.2</a> enabled coexistence and networking for groups of devices. Thanks to Micheal Teeuw's post on his blog, PJON received contributions, testing, debugging and feature requests. Then many talented contributors added support for devices like ESP8266, Teensy 3.2 and Node MCU.

            <h2>2015 - Abstracting the data link</h2>
            <p>
              The community wanted to use PJON over different existing protocols and physical layers, to obtain that without making the implementation complex and more difficult to use I have defined the <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/strategies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strategy</a> abstraction. The curiously recurring template pattern or CRTP was adopted to abstract the physical layer in separate classes called strategies. Thanks to this change from then it was possible to instantiate a PJON object passing the selected data link. Initially, I developed three strategies, a bit-banged implementation of <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/blob/13.0/src/strategies/SoftwareBitBang/specification/PJDL-specification-v5.0.md">PJDL</a> called <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/strategies/SoftwareBitBang">SoftwareBitBang</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/strategies/OverSampling">OverSampling</a> for radio communication and <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/strategies/AnalogSampling">AnalogSampling</a> able to communicate wirelessly or with optical fiber using off-the-shelf LEDs. Later on, I developed together with Fred Larsen <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/strategies/ThroughSerial">ThroughSerial</a> able to operate through a serial port.

The initial response, especially in the Hackaday's comments, was quite negative - trolls were raging. Only when I joined the discussion and answered openly and sincerely to all the complaints and questions asked, the tone changed dramatically. Well, so dramatically, that in the next comments I got the most praiseworthy compliments I have ever received, those people for sure helped me not to desist. Since then, the PJON protocol specification has been used in academic researches and PhDs in different parts of the world, and the official PJON implementation has already been applied globally in a wide range of different systems.

            <h2>2016 - Let's add a header</h2>
            <p>
              The release of the <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/blob/master/specification/obsolete/PJON-protocol-specification-v0.3.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PJON v0.3</a> was the result of the most interesting proposal I have received so far, by Fred Larsen, who is a great friend already even if we never met personally. He proposed the addition of a 8 bits header containing a map of the fields contained in the packet and the configuration requested by the sender. At this point we left a fixed configuration scenario, where interoperability was impossible, heading towards a dynamic network architecture. An entire new set of possibilities opened up and users started to make use of this new field.

It became possible to create a PJON network of devices using also an Internet connection. Our constantly growing community has already provided PJON implementations in other programming languages like <a href="https://github.com/Girgitt/PJON-python">PJON-python</a> by Zbigniew Zasieczny and <a href="https://github.com/Matheus-Garbelini/PJON-C">PJON-c</a> by Matheus Garbelini. Thanks to their work, it was for the first time possible to run PJON on a wider range of devices. At the same time the protocol reached its first stable version with the release of the <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/blob/master/specification/obsolete/PJON-protocol-specification-v1.0.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PJON v1.0</a> which added a lot of new features.

            <h2>2017 - Let's make it universal</h2>
            <p>
              New features brought new objectives: the community wanted to have <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON">PJON</a> working on many different MCUs and real time operative systems although I wanted to avoid code duplication and maintain only one unified implementation. For this reason I defined the <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/interfaces">interface</a> abstraction. With interfaces it was for the first time possible to run and cross-compile the same implementation on all supported targets. I developed the <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/interfaces/RPI">RPI</a> interface to support Raspberry Pi, after few weeks Zbigniew Zasieczny developed the <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/interfaces/WINX86">WINX86</a> interface enabling PJON communication on Windows computers, and soon after, Fred Larsen developed the <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/interfaces/LINUX">LINUX</a> interface. In late 2017 I discovered that frame inizialization was missing from both the specification and the implementation and that arbitrary data could have been mistaken for a valid frame. I vividly remember how shocked I was, that was a serious hole, so I quickly found a way to safely identify frames in each strategy. After that was fixed and all seemed perfect I discovered the <a href="https://betterembsw.blogspot.com/2012/02/can-protocol-vulnerabilities.html">length corruption vulnerability</a> that affected PJON and still affects CAN (Controlled Area Network). To close that hole I added an additional CRC8 to protect the header and soon after I released <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/blob/9.0/specification/PJON-protocol-specification-v2.0.md">PJON v2.0</a>.

            <h2>2018 - Distributed field test</h2>
            <p>
              Although PJON is licensed "AS IS", the more it was applied in the real world, the more I was feeling the responsibility for possible failures. When in 2018 Fred Larsen used PJON and <a href="https://github.com/fredilarsen/ModuleInterface">ModuleInterface</a> to handle the life support systems of his hens' house in Norway I started to be preoccupied for those animals and be finally aware of the potential consequencies and the risks involved in PJON real world applications, specially if dealing with living beings. If for whatever reason the temperature value transmitted was corrupted by interference or because of a bug, the hens could have ended up frozen or roasted. The conception of this possibility pushed me to study deeper the implementation and make better software.

<p>Hey guys, today I am going to talk about some features of the <code>print()</code> function in python. You will probably have come across some of these functions while others could seem new.</p>
<p>Let's start by understanding the basics of the print function. 
In python, the built-in print function is used to print all kinds of stuff - text, numbers, objects, dictionaries etc.
But how does this function handle that ?! You might think; it just can do it, it was made for that. But in reality, the print function in python can only handle strings.</p>
<p>Under the hood, anything you pass to the <code>print()</code> function gets converted to a string before being printed to your screen. That mean it will make use of the <code>str()</code> type casting and convert all other data types to strings before displaying them to your console/terminal.
Now that you know how the <code>print()</code> work, let's dive into its features.</p>
<p>Furthermore, print doesn't know how to print text to the screen. I won't go detail into that for now. Later in this post, you will know what happens under it.</p>
<p>Basically, you can print whatever you want . The simplest example you have come across is <code>print("Hello World!")</code>
It take a string enclosed in double quotes or single quotes and prints it.
You can also print multiple stuff by simply separating them with comas as such :</p>
<pre><code>name = <span>"Mike"</span>
age = <span>24</span>
print(<span>"Hello"</span>, name, <span>"Your age is"</span>, age)

</code></pre>
<p>You can as well print text that takes more than a line. In this case, you will be using the newline escape character <code>\n</code>
Example :</p>
<pre><code>print(<span>"Hello \nWorld"</span>)



</code></pre>
<p>You can also format text with it. Making use of <code>f-strings</code></p>
<pre><code>name = <span>"Samson"</span>
print(<span>f"Hello <span>{name}</span>"</span>)

</code></pre>
<p>The example above showcase the basics of the print function. It can take a variable number of values to print. Other than that, there are also some keyword arguments.
Let's dive into them</p>
<h2 id="1-separator">1. Separator</h2>
<p><code>print()</code> allows you to decide what separates text we print with it. By default, all the values you pass to it are separated by empty strings. But we change that. It suffices to include <code>sep=</code> followed by whatever you want to separate your text.
Let's make use of the previous example.</p>
<pre><code>name = <span>"Mike"</span>
age = <span>24</span>
print(<span>"Hello"</span>, name, <span>"Your age is"</span>, age, sep=<span>"-"</span>)

</code></pre>
<p>You notice that all what we passed into it separately are separated by a <code>-</code>. You can modify that however you want. You just need to make sure the separator is a valid string.</p>
<h2 id="2-ending">2. Ending</h2>
<p>You can specify by whatever you want your output to end with. By default, what you print end with a newline escape character <code>\n</code>. Let's change that and see what happens</p>
<pre><code>
print(<span>"Hello James"</span>)
print(<span>"How are you doing"</span>)





print(<span>"Hello James"</span>, end=<span>""</span>)
print(<span>"How are you doing"</span>, end=<span>""</span>)


</code></pre>
<p>If we execute that, we notice the text is no more separated by a new line. Let's try that again! But this time, we want it to end by <code>y</code> and move to a new line.</p>
<pre><code>print(<span>"Hello James"</span>, end=<span>"y\n"</span>)
print(<span>"How are you doing"</span>, end=<span>"\n"</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>We get the following output</p>
<pre><code><span>Hello</span> Jamesy
How are you doingy
</code></pre><p>Yay it worked !</p>
<h2 id="3-writing-to-a-file">3. Writing to a file</h2>
<p>At the beginning of this post, I said python doesn't know how to print stuff to the screen by itself. It rather uses <code>sys.stdout</code> and writes your text to that file. 
Wait what ! Print will write text to a file object which I sent to your screen via <code>sys.stdout</code>. Therefore, you can modify this behaviour too in order to have this printed elsewhere.
Let's give it a try.
Write the following code:</p>
<pre><code><span>with</span> open(<span>"hello.txt"</span>, <span>"w"</span>) <span>as</span> file_object:
        print(<span>"This message is for you"</span>, file=file_object)
</code></pre>
<p>Executing the above will end in a file name <code>hello.text</code> in the same directory with the text <em>This message is for you</em> in it. 
Therefore, we can direct where we want our text to be printed. In this case, we created a file name <code>hello.txt</code> and use the <code>file</code> keyword argument to direct the result to be written to that file rather than our terminal. You can use this to direct any result to wherever you want, even through a socket connection.</p>
<h2 id="4-flushing">4. Flushing</h2>
<p>This one requires an example. Let's have one!</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> time

names = [<span>"John"</span>, <span>"Sylvia"</span>, <span>"Smith"</span>]

<span>for</span> name <span>in</span> names:
    print(name, end=<span>" "</span>)
    time.sleep(<span>1</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>What this code should do is; print a name after a second. Try and run it and see what happens. 
You notice it unexpectedly waits and print all at once.  This is because since it's on a single line, it is all buffered (packed) before we get it. 
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_buffer#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20a%20data,from%20one%20place%20to%20another.&amp;text=However%2C%20a%20buffer%20may%20be,comparable%20to%20buffers%20in%20telecommunication.">Read more about buffers here</a>
But we could go around that by simply adding the <code>flush=</code> keyword argument to the print function. By default it it set to <code>False</code>. Setting it to true will ensure every print statement is executed and freed from buffer before the next one.
The following code will make it :</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> time

names = [<span>"John"</span>, <span>"Sylvia"</span>, <span>"Smith"</span>]

<span>for</span> name <span>in</span> names:
    print(name, end=<span>", "</span>, flush=<span>True</span>)
    time.sleep(<span>1</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>If you run it. It will print a name, sleep for a second and print another, all on the same line. 
Yay we did it !</p>
<p>You have reached the end of this post.

            <p>
            In this post we will tackle Artificial Intelligence with baby steps and try to build a very simple neural net in Java.
            </p>

            <h5 id="what-is-a-neural-net">What is a Neural net?</h5>

            <p>
            A neural net is a software representation of how the brain works. Unfortunately, we do not know as of yet how exactly does the brain really work but we do know a little bit of the biology behind this process: the human brain consists of 100 billion cells called neurons, connected together by synapses. If sufficient synapses connected to a neuron fire, then that neuron will also fire. This process is known as "thinking".
            </p>

            <p>
            We thus try and model the above process using a very simple example that has 3 inputs (synapses) and results in a single output (1 neuron firing).

            <img alt="Neural net example" src="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/nn-1-simple-problem.png" width="400">
            </p>



            <h5 id="a-simple-problem">A simple problem</h5>

            <p>
            We will train our above neural net to solve the following problem. Can you figure out the pattern and guess what the value of the new input should be? 0 or 1?
            </p>

            <div>
              <table>
              <tbody><tr>
                <th>Examples</th>
                <th colspan="3">Input</th>
                <th>Output</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Example 1</td>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>0</td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td>Example 2</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>1</td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td>Example 3</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>1</td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td>Example 4</td>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>0</td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td colspan="5">&nbsp;</td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td>New situation</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>?</td>
              </tr>

              </tbody></table>
            </div>

            <p>
            The answer is actually very simply the value of the left-most column, i.e. 1!
            </p>


            <h5 id="training-process">The training process</h5>

            <p>
            So now that we have the model of a human brain, we will try and get our neural net to learn what the pattern is given the training set. We will first assign each input a random number to produce an output.
            </p>

            <p><img alt="Neural net example" src="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/nn-1-simple-problem-neuron-weights.png" width="400"></p><p>
            The formula for calculating the output is given as follows:
            $$\sum weight_i . input_i = weight1 . input1 + weight2 . input2 + weight3 . input3$$
            </p>

            <p>
            As it turns out we would like to normalize this output value to something between 0 and 1 so that the prediction makes sense. After normalization we compare the output with the expected output of our inputs. This gives us the error, or how far off is our prediction. We can then use this error to slightly adjust the weights of our neural net and try our luck on the same input again. This can be summarized in the following image:
            </p>

            <!--
            <div>
                <a class="image-popup-no-margins" href="/img/blog/nn-1-training-process.png">
                    <img class="img-responsive centered img-border" alt="Neural net training process" src="/img/blog/nn-1-training-process.png" />
                </a>
                <div class="img-desc">
                </div>
            </div>
            -->

            <p><img alt="Neural net training process" src="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/nn-1-training-process.png" width="450"></p><p>
            We repeat this training process for all the inputs <i><b>10,000 times</b></i> to reach a satisfactorily trained neural net. We can then use this neural net to make predictions on new inputs!
            </p>

            <p>
            Before we jump into the implementation however, we still need to clarify how we achieved the normalization and the weight adjustment based on the error (also known as back-propagation).
            </p>

            <h5 id="normalization">Normalization</h5>

            <p>
            In a biologically inspired neural network, the output of a neuron is usually an abstraction representing the rate of action potential firing in the cell. In its simplest form, this is binary value, i.e., either the neuron is firing or not. Hence, the need for normalization of this output value.
            </p>

            <p>
            To achieve this normalization we apply what is known as an activation function to the output of the neuron. If we take the example of a really simple Heaviside step function which assigns a 0 to any negative value and a 1 to any positive value, then a large number of neurons would be required to achieve the required granularity of slowly adjusting the weights to reach an acceptable consensus of the training set.
            </p>

            <p>
            As we will see in the next section on back-propagation, this concept of slowly adjusting the weights can be represented mathematically as the slope of the activation function. In biological terms, it can be thought of as the increase in firing rate that occurs as input current increases. If we were to use a linear function instead of the Heaviside function, then we would find that the resulting network would have an unstable convergence because neuron inputs along favored paths would tend to increase without bound, as a linear function is not normalizable.
            </p>

            <p>
            All problems mentioned above can be handled by using a normalizable sigmoid activation function. One realistic model stays at zero until input current is received, at which point the firing frequency increases quickly at first, but gradually approaches an asymptote at 100% firing rate. Mathematically, this looks like:
            $$ \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} $$
            </p>

            <p>
            If plotted on a graph, the Sigmoid function draws an S shaped curve:
            </p>

            <p><img alt="sigmoid plot" src="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/nn-1-sigmoid-plot.png" width="450"></p><p>
            Thus, the final formula for the output of a neuron now becomes
            $$ Output = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\sum weight_i . input_i)}} $$
            </p>

            <p>
            There are other normalization functions that we can use but the sigmoid has the advantage of being fairly simple and also having a simple derivative which will be useful when we look at the back propagation below.
            </p>

            <h5 id="back-propagation">Back-propagation</h5>

            <p>
            During the training cycle, we adjusted the weights depending on the error. To do this, we can use the "Error weighted derivative" formula
            $$ Adjustment = error . input . SigmoidCurveGradient(output) $$
            </p>

            <p>
            The reason we use this formula is that firstly, we want to make the adjustment proportional to the size of the error. Secondly, we multiply by the input, which is either a 0 or a 1. If the input is 0, the weight isn’t adjusted. Finally, we multiply by the gradient of the Sigmoid curve (or the derivative).
            </p>

            <p>
            The reason that we use the gradient is because we are trying to minimize the loss. Specifically, we do this by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent">gradient descent method</a>. It basically means that from our current point in the parameter space (determined by the complete set of current weights), we want to go in a direction which will decrease the loss function. Visualize standing on a hillside and walking down the direction where the slope is steepest. The gradient descent method as applied to our neural net is illustrated as follows:
            </p><ol>
                <li>If the output of the neuron is a large positive or negative number, it signifies the neuron was quite confident one way or another.</li>
                <li>From the sigmoid plot, we can see that at large numbers the Sigmoid curve has a shallow gradient.</li>
                <li>Thus, if the neuron is confident that the existing weight is correct, it doesn’t want to adjust it very much and multiplying by the gradient of the sigmoid curve achieves this.</li>
            </ol>
            

            <p>
            The derivative of the sigmoid function is given by the following formula
            $$ SigmoidCurveGradient(output) = output . (1 - output) $$
            Substituting this back into the adjustment formula gives us
            $$ Adjustment = error . input . output . (1 - output) $$
            </p>

            <h5 id="code">Code</h5>

            <p>
            An important but subtle point that was missed out when explaining the mathematics above was that for each training iteration, the mathematical operations are done on the entire training set at the same time. Thus, we will make use of matrices to store the set of input vectors, the weights and the expected outputs.
            </p>

            <p>
            You can grab the entire project source here: <a href="https://github.com/wheresvic/neuralnet">https://github.com/wheresvic/neuralnet</a>. For the sake of learning, we implemented all the math ourselves using only the standard java Math functions :)
            </p>

            <p>
            We will begin with the <code>NeuronLayer</code> class which is just a placeholder for the weights in our neural net implementation. We provide it with the number of inputs per neuron and the number of neurons which it can use to build a table of the weights. In our current example, this is very simply the last output neuron which has the 3 input neurons.
            </p>

<pre>public class NeuronLayer {

    public final Function<double, double=""> activationFunction, activationFunctionDerivative;

    double[][] weights;

    public NeuronLayer(int numberOfNeurons, int numberOfInputsPerNeuron) {
        weights = new double[numberOfInputsPerNeuron][numberOfNeurons];

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; numberOfInputsPerNeuron; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j &lt; numberOfNeurons; ++j) {
                weights[i][j] = (2 * Math.random()) - 1; // shift the range from 0-1 to -1 to 1
            }
        }

        activationFunction = NNMath::sigmoid;
        activationFunctionDerivative = NNMath::sigmoidDerivative;
    }

    public void adjustWeights(double[][] adjustment) {
        this.weights = NNMath.matrixAdd(weights, adjustment);
    }
}
</double,></pre>

            <p>
            Our neural net class is where all the action happens. It takes as a constructor the <code>NeuronLayer</code> and has 2 main functions:
            </p><ul>
                <li><code>think</code>: calculates the outputs of a given input set</li>
                <li><code>train</code>: runs the training loop <code>numberOfTrainingIterations</code> times (usually a high number like 10,000). Note that the training itself involves calculating the output and then adjusting the weights accordingly</li>
            </ul>
            

<pre>public class NeuralNetSimple {

    private final NeuronLayer layer1;
    private double[][] outputLayer1;

    public NeuralNetSimple(NeuronLayer layer1) {
        this.layer1 = layer1;
    }

    public void think(double[][] inputs) {
        outputLayer1 = apply(matrixMultiply(inputs, layer1.weights), layer1.activationFunction);
    }

    public void train(double[][] inputs, double[][] outputs, int numberOfTrainingIterations) {
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; numberOfTrainingIterations; ++i) {

            // pass the training set through the network
            think(inputs);

            // adjust weights by error * input * output * (1 - output)

<p>When your father suffers a heart attack and needs emergency surgery, who would you rather have operating on him?</p>



<p>An inspiring doctor who lost an arm in a tragic car accident, and still heroically manages to attain an average level of success as a surgeon?<br>Or the son of a multimillionaire who has breezed through life with minimal setbacks, and boasts one of the best surgical track records?</p>



<hr>



<p>There is a common perception that a meritocracy is the most fair way to run society. That because we are avoiding bias and favoritism and picking candidates purely based on their capabilities and achievements, a meritocratic system is the most fair of all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such a belief is hogwash. There’s nothing “fair” about not selecting the surgeon who lost his arm in a car accident, and is now trying desperately to hold on to his career. There’s nothing fair about the fact that some people are born into good circumstances which confer a tremendous headstart in life. There’s nothing fair about the fact that so many of society’s most accomplished individuals grew up in upper-middle-class families that nurtured them, raised them well, and gave them access to highly regarded schools and teachers.</p>



<p>A meritocracy never was, and never will be, “fair”. <strong>And that’s the whole point.</strong></p>



<p>The reason meritocracies work so well, is not because they are fair, but because they produce peak performance.</p>



<p>NFL teams draft the “best” players they can find, because they know that’s how they can win the most games. Universities grant tenure to the most productive professors, because that will best enhance the University’s reputation, and further the frontiers of knowledge. Hospitals hire the best doctors, because they can save the most lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hiring people who are “good enough” is simply not good enough. There has never been, and never will be, a team that won the world cup by selecting players who are “good enough.” And what’s true for a kid’s game, is doubly true for our society. A society should delegate its jobs to those who are smartest, most capable, and most accomplished in that field. Because they are the ones who can best lead society through the worldly challenges we face everyday. Corrupting this process by discriminating on the basis of family ties, personal friendships, wealth, race, or gender, is simply cutting your nose to spite your face.</p>



<p>Which is not to say that “fairness” and Social Justice isn’t important. It is vital. But you don’t get to it by hiring less qualified candidates. By turning down the best possible candidate in favor of someone who is more sympathetic and “good enough”. A meritocracy excels at producing wealth and economic prosperity. Universal basic income, universal healthcare, unemployment insurance, better public schooling and free job trainings… these are the kind of Social Justice programs that can share the resulting prosperity among everyone.</p>



<p>Social justice teaches us how to distribute the pie fairly, so that no one is left behind. This is absolutely essential, and something we should always keep in mind. But social justice doesn’t have all the answers on how to grow the pie in the first place. And unless we harness the power of a meritocracy to keep the pie growing, we will all soon be fighting over scraps.</p>



<hr>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25485766" target="_blank"><em>Discussion thread on HackerNews</em></a></p>



<p><em><strong>Addendum</strong>: This article’s thesis is that we should select/hire candidates who will perform best in the role, regardless of their personal circumstances. Many have mentioned that traditional methods of assessment may be flawed, incomplete, or biased. In accordance with the thesis, we should certainly strive to refine our assessment methods, and continually make them more accurate. This article is certainly not stating that current methods of assessment are perfect.</em></p>



<p><em>Many have also brought up the point that personal circumstances often do impact job performance. For example, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/diversity-work-group-performance" target="_blank">some studies have suggested that diverse teams perform better than homogenous teams</a>, especially in certain job roles. If you are an ardent believer in improving team performance, this would mean taking into account any demographic info that would help the organization perform better. This is also a double-edged sword for a couple reasons:<br>1. By legalizing the use of race or gender as a factor in hiring decisions, you would also be enabling prejudiced employers who discriminate against women or minorities, for purely bigoted reasons<br>2. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://archive.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/08/05/the_downside_of_diversity/" target="_blank">Studies have also found that communities operate better in some ways, when they are more homogenous</a>. If more such studies are unearthed in future, the same reasoning above could be used to justify discriminating against all women and people of color. Something most of us, including myself, would consider to be dystopian.</em></p>

		<p>I thought I will write down how am I doing with reaching financial independence, to track progress and see if it is doable, or I need to do major changes. So I’ll be updating this page yearly with recent passive income that is covering my living costs. And I’ll add a short paragraph to each year, might be nice to read in retrospective 🙂</p>



<h2>TLDR table</h2>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Year</td><td>Costs increase (compared to the previous year)</td><td>passive income covering costs</td></tr><tr><td>2020</td><td>-26%</td><td>11.49%</td></tr><tr><td>2019</td><td>+24%</td><td>6,14% (10% without car)</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>+29%</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>+20%</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>base</td><td>–</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p><strong>Goal? Get passive income to 100%</strong>. And then just slowly grow it and diversify to make it safer. Looking forward to seeing how will it look like in 10/20 years!</p>



<h2>2021</h2>



<p>Let’s set a goal. <strong>15% costs coverage</strong> in 2021 seems a reachable value! It all depends on how I will keep my costs down.</p>



<h2>2020</h2>



<p>Corona year. As for investing, it was a great year. I have saved a lot by not having as many abroad holidays as I used to have in previous years. Stock prices in March were extremely cheap, I bought triple the amount in March that I used to buy monthly before. I expected this sell-off will last the whole year, but unfortunately for me, it rebounded within a few months. Still, this was probably the best year I will experience in the following decade. <strong>11.49% is an important number</strong> for 2020 – the percentage of costs covered by my passive income. After 5 years of investing, it’s not much.</p>



<p>But I am optimistic for a few reasons:</p>



<ol><li>If corona crisis does not bankrupt p2p lending platforms, I will probably invest more there. It seems to be 11% stable XIRR, which is much higher compared to dividends from stocks (3-4%). </li><li>Some companies cut or suspended their dividends -&gt; hopefully, they will put them back in the following years -&gt; increasing my passive income.</li><li>On top of my monthly deposits, reinvestments of passive impact have a greater impact than ever before. Compound interested, let’s keep it rolling!</li></ol>



<p>We will see, maybe I would find real estate in 2021 and it will trim my stock investments significantly. Also in capital gains (crypto and stocks), I have made probably 150% of all my costs in 2020 -&gt; which is great, but I am not taking profit, and it may go back down.</p>



<h2>2019</h2>



<p>This year was hopefully the year when my massive increases in costs stop. I have bought a car in 2019 – it is 10 years old Honda Accord, so not that expensive, but still had a huge impact on my costs (car itself, insurance, gas, repairs, …). Overall I ended up with passive income covering 6.14%, which is horrible after over 4 years of investing. If it grew 6% every 4 years, I <strong>would get 100% of my costs covered in 62 years</strong>. And that is assuming, I will have same costs in 62 years – looking at yearly increases and inflation, unrealistic.</p>



<h2>History</h2>



<p>For P2P lending, I started with 1000 euros on <a href="https://www.lucas03.com/link/bondora">bondora</a>, which did not prove to be that profitable. I then only slowly increased my deposit, that is why it does not have that big of an impact on my passive income.</p>



<p>For investing, I have started with small payments in December 2015, still being a student and doing only 1 small stock purchase per month. Luckily it stuck with me and I believe after 5 years, I build up a good habit of monthly investing.</p>

<![CDATA[Efficient Navigation in Vim]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>When editing a file, it is quite crucial that you can navigate your cursor around rather quickly. <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> and <a href="https://neovim.io/">NeoVim</a> allow for many different ways of doing so which, depending on the situation, can be more or less efficient and useful. This article examines the different ways of moving the cursor and compares them. Here, the term “efficiency” refers to navigating the cursor with as little time and effort (i.e. the number of keystrokes) as possible.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-mouse">Using the Mouse</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Not recommended</strong></p>
<p>Using the mouse pointer to navigate Vim may seem like an obvious choice for users coming from a GUI editor like <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> or similar. However, in Vim, the goal is to keep your fingers on the “home row” of the keyboard (the row where the <code>F</code> and the <code>J</code> keys reside) and not having to move them greatly towards the touchpad or even the mouse. This should reduce the strain on your hands and wrists and make editing more efficient. Therefore, navigating with the mouse should be highly discouraged in most situations and is even disabled by default.</p>
<p>It can be helpful to enable it for users transitioning from one of the aforementioned editors who would like to have a smooth transition by allowing themselves to use the mouse initially and switching it back off again later in their learning journey. To turn on mouse navigation, add the following to your configuration file (either <code>~/.vimrc</code> or <code>~/.config/nvim/init.vim</code>):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>" Temporarily enable mouse support</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>set</span> <span>mouse</span>=<span>a</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>This will allow you to point and click to move the cursor and to scroll through the current buffer.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-arrow-keys">Using the Arrow Keys</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Not recommended</strong></p>
<p>Again, for users used to other text editors or even word processing software like <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/writer/">LibreOffice Writer</a>, it may be tempting to use what they know. In these programs, you mostly use the arrow keys for keyboard-based navigation. This is not recommended because… you guessed it: They require the user to move their fingers away from the home row.</p>
<p>The alternative is, as described in the next section, to use the <code>h</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>k</code> and <code>l</code> keys on the keyboard which are conveniently placed at the center and where you most likely have your fingers most of the time.</p>
<h2 id="using-hjkl">Using h,j,k,l</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Use for small navigations. Use in combination with relative line numbers.</strong></p>
<p><code>h</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>k</code> and <code>l</code> are the basic movement keys in Vim. They should be used instead of the usual arrow keys on the keyboard to, as discussed above, keep your fingers on the home row as much as possible. It takes a little practice but will pay off in the long run.</p>
<p>One hugely important thing to do with these keys is to not press them multiple times in sequence or even hold them down to move several columns or rows. As with many commands in Vim, they can be prefixed with numbers to move multiple times. For example, <code>12j</code> can be used rather than pressing the <code>j</code> key twelve times which is, obviously, much more efficient (3 vs. 12 keystrokes). However, it is recommendable to only use these keys for small movements and mostly to move lines up or down because there are more efficient ways of moving longer vertical distances or horizontal distances in general.</p>
<p>It can be very useful to enable relative line numbers to see at a glance what number to prefix <code>j</code> or <code>k</code> with to move to a certain line. They can be enabled by adding the following two lines to your configuration file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>" Enable relative line numbers</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>set</span> <span>relativenumber</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>set</span> <span>number</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>This will always show the absolute number of the line the cursor is currently on and relative numbers for all others.</p>
<h2 id="navigation-within-a-line">Navigation Within a Line</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Mostly use <code>f</code>. Also consider <code>w</code>,<code>b</code>,<code>e</code>,<code>^</code> and <code>$</code>.</strong></p>
<p>So far, we’ve mostly looked at navigating from one line to another. The next step is to navigate within a line. In many cases, the straight forward thing to do is to use <code>w</code> or <code>W</code> to move to the next word, <code>b</code> or <code>B</code> to move to the previous word or even <code>e</code> or <code>E</code> to move directly to the end of the next word. For all of them, the lowercase variant considers a “word” to be what we intuitively see as one using delimiters like <code>-</code>, <code>/</code> or <code>.</code> to separate one word from another. The uppercase variant considers anything a word that is delimited by whitespace. Obviously, any of these commands can be prefixed with a number to jump multiple words in one go (e.g. <code>7w</code>). Other useful commands are <code>^</code> which moves to the first non-whitespace character of the line and <code>$</code> to move to the last character of a line. Considering the following line</p>
<p>with the cursor currently on the <code>g</code> character, pressing the following commands is the most efficient way to get to a specific target character:</p>
<table>

<p>When moving multiple words back and forth or to a specific place within a word, <code>t</code> and <code>f</code> are incredibly helpful. Especially <code>f</code> moves to the next occurrence of a specific character which lets you make big jumps within a line. The difference is that <code>f</code> moves to a character and <code>t</code> moves to right before a character. So <code>t</code> is mostly useful for deleting everything to a character. These commands' uppercase variants <code>F</code> and <code>T</code> do the same thing but backwards. All of these commands can be “repeated” with the <code>;</code> command which jumps to the next occurrence of the targeted character while <code>,</code> jumps to the previous one.</p>
<p>Another command worth mentioning at this point is <code>%</code> which you can use when a character which is part of a pair (e.g. <code>[</code> or <code>}</code>) is currently under your cursor. The <code>%</code> command will take the cursor to the corresponding “partner” of that character in the pair. So placing the cursor on a <code>(</code> and then executing this command will take you to its closing <code>)</code>.</p>
<h2 id="changelist-and-jumplist">Changelist and Jumplist</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Use <code>ctrl+o</code> and <code>ctrl+i</code> to jump “back” and “forward”. Use <code>g;</code> to jump to last edit.</strong></p>
<p>The jumplist contains all the points in any buffer you recently jumped to (e.g. with <code>12j</code>). It can be accessed with <code>:jumps</code>. The commands to jump back and forth in the jumplist are <code>ctrl+o</code> and <code>ctrl+i</code> respectively. They can be very useful because they act like the “back” and “forward” buttons in a web browser.</p>
<p>The changelist on the other hand contains all the points in the current buffer where you have recently changed something. It can be accessed with the <code>:changes</code> command. A very useful command here is <code>g;</code> which jumps to the last place where you have changed something (i.e. jumps back in the changelist). <code>g,</code> on the other hand takes you back to where you were before (i.e. jumps forward in the changelist). This allows you to easily switch back and forth between a point of reference (e.g. some documentation) and the place where you are currently editing.</p>
<h2 id="search">Search</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Great for moving larger distances vertically and horizontally</strong></p>
<p>By far one of the most efficient ways of moving longer distances horizontally and vertically in a buffer is to use the search. The <code>/</code> key lets you search for a term and conveniently jump to its location. Pressing the <code>n</code> and <code>N</code> keys jumps to the next and previous occurrence of the search term respectively. The <code>?</code> key searches backwards from the current cursor position (which inverts <code>n</code> and <code>N</code>). Even though, the main purpose of the search command is obviously to search, it is an incredibly powerful tool to navigate quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>The user experience of the search command can be vastly improved by adding the following settings to your configuration file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>" Incrementally search while typing</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>set</span> <span>incsearch</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>" Use smart case for searching</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>set</span> <span>ignorecase</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>set</span> <span>smartcase</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>" Highlight searches</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>set</span> <span>hlsearch</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>" Use &lt;C-L&gt; to clear the highlighting of :set hlsearch.</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>if</span> <span>maparg</span>(<span>'&lt;C-L&gt;'</span>, <span>'n'</span>) ==# <span>''</span><span>
</span><span></span>  <span>nnoremap</span> &lt;<span>silent</span>&gt; &lt;<span>C</span>-<span>L</span>&gt; :<span>nohlsearch</span>&lt;<span>C</span>-<span>R</span>&gt;=<span>has</span>(<span>'diff'</span>)?<span>'&lt;Bar&gt;diffupdate'</span>:<span>''</span>&lt;<span>CR</span>&gt;&lt;<span>CR</span>&gt;&lt;<span>C</span>-<span>L</span>&gt;<span>
</span><span></span><span>endif</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p><code>incsearch</code> will make sure that the search pattern is applied incrementally while typing instead of only after pressing the enter key. The combination of <code>ignorecase</code> and <code>smartcase</code> ignores the case of the search term when not using any uppercase letters and doesn’t ignore it when using at least one uppercase letter which is quite convenient and surprisingly intuitive. <code>hlsearch</code> highlights any matches for the search term allowing to easily jump between them using <code>n</code> and <code>N</code>. The last statement lets you clear the highlighted search results by pressing <code>ctrl+l</code> to unclutter your view once done searching and jumping.</p>
<p>All in all, search is one of the most powerful tools for intuitive and efficient navigation. It covers the common use case of knowing the word or part of a word to navigate to but not having your eyes directly pointed there yet. Furthermore, it’s simply the fastest way of jumping somewhere in many cases and beats other methods of navigation quite often in that regard.</p>
<h2 id="clunky-movements">Clunky Movements</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Use for very specific use cases only. Consider <code>gg</code> and <code>G</code> for getting to know a file.</strong></p>
<p>In this section we’ll discuss what can be referred to as “clunky movements”. They let the user navigate larger distances in the buffer while sacrificing precision. These commands are less useful for exactly that reason. Vim can be a very efficient text editor by letting the user think about what they want to change, jumping precisely there with very few keystrokes, entering insert mode, performing a change with scalpel-like precision and finally exiting insert mode as soon as it’s done. The movement commands in this section however, get the cursor around the document as a whole while it’s hard for the user to predict at a glance, which line and column exactly they will land on.</p>
<p>A good example are the <code>H</code>, <code>M</code> and <code>L</code> keys which take the cursor to the top, the middle or the bottom of the current view port respectively. While this is a very big movement with just one keystroke, it’s highly likely that they won’t exactly get the cursor to the line needed but rather will have to be accompanied by pressing <code>j</code> or <code>k</code> multiple times which will result in much more thinking and many more keystrokes than what can be achieved with other methods. Similar are the <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> keys which take the cursor to the next paragraph (a block of text delimited by blank lines).</p>
<p>A useful exception to that are the <code>gg</code> and <code>G</code> commands which take the cursor to …</p></div></div>

</center><p>1. Einstein said, â€˜Compounding is the eighth wonder of the world.â€™</p><p>2.Â&nbsp;Youâ€™ve been bamboozled
for too long. There is no magic bullet, secret formula, or quick fix.</p><p>3.Â&nbsp;Earning success is
hard. The process is laborious, tedious, sometimes even boring.
Becoming wealthy, influential, and world-class in your field is
slow and arduous.</p><p>4. Iâ€™ll win
because of the positive habits Iâ€™ve developed, and because of
the consistency I use in applying those habits. Iâ€™m the worldâ€™s
biggest believer in consistency. Iâ€™m living proof that itâ€™s the
ultimate key to success, yet itâ€™s one of the biggest pitfalls
for people struggling to achieve.</p><p>5.Â&nbsp;One of Dadâ€™s core philosophies was, â€œIt doesnâ€™t matter how
smart you are or arenâ€™t, you need to make up in hard work what
you lack in experience, skill, intelligence, or innate ability. If your
competitor is smarter, more talented, or experienced, you just
need to work three or four times as hard. You can still beat them!â€�</p><p>6. Small, seemingly
insignificant steps completed consistently over time will create a
radical difference. Let me give you a few detailed examples.Â&nbsp;</p><p>7. Small, Smart Choices + Consistency + Time = RADICAL DIFFERENCE</p><p>8.Â&nbsp;By the end of this book, or even before, I want you to know in
your bones that your only path to success is through a continuum
of mundane, unsexy, unexciting, and sometimes difficult daily
disciplines compounded over time.</p><p>9.Â&nbsp;You alone are responsible for what you do, donâ€™t do, or how
you respond to whatâ€™s done to you. This empowering mindset
revolutionized my life. Luck, circumstances, or the right situation
wasnâ€™t what mattered. If it was to be, it was up to me.</p><p>10. The (Complete) Formula for Getting Lucky:
<br>Â&nbsp;Preparation (personal growth) +
Attitude (belief/mindset) +
Opportunity (a good thing coming your way) +
Action (doing something about it) =
LuckÂ&nbsp;</p><p>11. My mentor Jim Rohn said, â€œThe
day you graduate from childhood to adulthood is the day you
take full responsibility for your life.â€� </p><p>12.Â&nbsp;To help you become aware of your choices, I want you to track
every action that relates to the area of your life you want to improve.</p><p>13.Â&nbsp; Simply carry
around a small notebook, something youâ€™ll keep in your pocket or
purse at all times, and a writing instrument. Youâ€™re going to write it
all down. Every day. Without fail. No excuses, no exceptions.</p><p>14.Â&nbsp; But tracking my progress and missteps is the
one of the reasons Iâ€™ve accumulated the success I have. The process
forces you to be conscious of your decisions.</p><p>15.Â&nbsp;This is where Iâ€™m going to become a hard-ass and
insist you track your behaviors for at least one whole week. This
book isnâ€™t designed to entertain you; it is designed to help you
get results. To get results, you have to take some action.</p><p>16.Â&nbsp;All winners are trackers. Right now I want you to track your life
with the same intention: to bring your goals within sight.</p><p>17. Once you begin
reaping the rewards of the Compound Effect, youâ€™ll naturally
want to introduce this practice into other areas of your life. In
other words, youâ€™ll choose to choose tracking.</p><p>18.Â&nbsp;Psychological studies reveal that 95 percent of everything we
feel, think, do, and achieve is a result of a learned habit!</p><p>19.Â&nbsp;Your
choices are only meaningful when you connect them to your
desires and dreams. The wisest and most motivating choices
are the ones aligned with that which you identify as your
purpose, your core self, and your highest values. Youâ€™ve got
to want something, and know why you want it, or youâ€™ll end
up giving up too easily. </p><p>20.Â&nbsp;The access point to your why-power is through your core
values, which define both who you are and what you stand
for. Your core values are your internal compass, your guiding
beacon, your personal GPS.</p><p>21. Getting your core values defined and properly calibrated is one
of the most important steps in redirecting your life toward your
grandest vision. </p><p>22.Â&nbsp;When your actions conflict with
your values, youâ€™ll end up unhappy, frustrated, and despondent.
In fact, psychologists tell us that nothing creates more stress
than when our actions and behaviors arenâ€™t congruent with
our values. </p><p>23.Â&nbsp;People are either motivated by something they want or
something they donâ€™t want. Love is a powerfully motivating
force. But so is hate. Contrary to social correctness, it can be
good to hate. Hate disease, hate injustice, hate ignorance, hate
complacency, and so on. Sometimes identifying an enemy
lights your fire. </p><p>24.Â&nbsp;In one of my interviews with Brian Tracy, he put it this way:
â€œTop people have very clear goals. They know who they are
and they know what they want. They write it down and they
make plans for its accomplishment. Unsuccessful people carry
their goals around in their head like marbles rattling around in a
can, and we say a goal that is not in writing is merely a fantasy.
And everybody has fantasies, but those fantasies are like bullets
with no powder in the cartridge. People go through life shooting
blanks without written goalsâ€”and thatâ€™s the starting point.â€� </p><p>25.Â&nbsp;Okay, now itâ€™s your turn. Get out your little notebook and write
out your top three goals. Now make a list of the bad habits that might
be sabotaging your progress in each area. Write down every one. I suggest that you take some time today to make a list of your
most important goals.Â&nbsp;</p><p>26.Â&nbsp; One thing Jim Rohn taught me is: â€œIf you want to have more,
you have to become more. Success is not something you pursue. What
you pursue will elude you; it can be like trying to chase butterflies.
Success is something you attract by the person you become.â€� </p><p>27.Â&nbsp;Habits and behaviors never lie. If thereâ€™s a discrepancy between
what you say and what you do, Iâ€™m going to believe what you do
every time. If you tell me you want to be healthy, but youâ€™ve got
Doritos dust on your fingers, Iâ€™m believing the Doritos. If you say
self-improvement is a priority, but you spend more time with your
Xbox than at the library, Iâ€™m believing the Xbox. If you say youâ€™re
a dedicated professional, but you show up late and unprepared,
your behavior rats you out every time.</p><p>28.Next, add to that list all the habits you need to adopt that,
practiced and compounded over time, will result in you
gloriously achieving your goals.</p><p>29. Triggers - Look at your list of bad habits. For each one youâ€™ve written
down, identify what triggers it. Figure out what I call â€œThe Big
4â€™sâ€�â€”the â€œwho,â€� the â€œwhat,â€� the â€œwhere,â€� and the â€œwhenâ€�
underlying each bad behavior.</p><p>30.Â&nbsp;For example:
â€¢ Are you more likely to drink too much when youâ€™re with
certain people?
â€¢ Is there a particular time of day when you just have to have
something sweet?
â€¢ What emotions tend to provoke your worst habitsâ€”stress,
fatigue, anger, nervousness, boredom?
â€¢ When do you experience those emotions? Who are you
with, where are you, or what are you doing? 
</p><p>31. Clean House - Get to scrubbinâ€™. And I mean this literally and figuratively. If you
want to stop drinking alcohol, remove every drop of it from your
house (and your vacation house, if you have one). Get rid of the
glasses, any fancy utensils or doo-dads you use when you drink,
and those decorative olives, too.</p><p>32.Â&nbsp;Look again at your list of bad habits. How can you alter
them so that theyâ€™re not as harmful? Can you replace them
with healthier habits or drop-kick them altogether? As in,
for good. </p><p>33.Â&nbsp;For some of your
long-standing and deep-rooted habits, it may be more effective
to take small steps to ease into unwinding them. You may have
spent decades repeating, cementing, and fortifying those habits,
so it can be wise to give yourself some time to unravel them, one
step at a time. </p><p>34.Â&nbsp;Not everyone is wired the same way. Some researchers have
found that it can be paradoxically easier for people to make
lifestyle changes if they change a great many bad habits at once. </p><p>35.Â&nbsp;According to research, it takes three hundred instances of
positive reinforcement to turn a new habit into an unconscious
practiceâ€”thatâ€™s almost a year of daily practice!</p><p>36.Â&nbsp;The key is staying aware. If you really want to maintain a
good habit, make sure you pay attention to it at least once a day,
and youâ€™re far more likely to succeed. </p><p>37.Â&nbsp;Any new habit has to work inside your life and lifestyle. If you join
a gym thatâ€™s thirty miles away, you wonâ€™t go. If youâ€™re a night owl
but the gym closes at 6 p.m., it wonâ€™t work for you. Your gym must
be close and convenient, and fit into your schedule. </p><p>38. Instead of thinking what you can remove from your life, think instead of what you can add. The good will displace the bad.</p><p>40.Â&nbsp;Want to cement that new habit? Get Big Brother to watch
you. Itâ€™s never been easier with all the social media available.Â&nbsp;Tell your family. Tell your friends. Tell Facebook and Twitter.
Get the word out that thereâ€™s a new sheriff in town, and youâ€™re
in charge</p><p>41.Â&nbsp;To up your chances
of success, get a success buddy, someone whoâ€™ll keep you
accountable as you cement your new habit while you returnÂ&nbsp;the favor. I, for example, have what I call a â€œPeak-Performance
Partner.â€� </p><p>42.Â&nbsp;Thereâ€™s nothing like a friendly contest to whet your
competitive spirit and immerse yourself in a new habit with
a bang. </p><p>43.Â&nbsp;All work and no play make Jack a dull boy, and itâ€™s a recipe for
backsliding. There should be a time to celebrate, to enjoy some of
the fruits of your victories along the way. You canâ€™t go through this
thing sacrificing yourself with no benefit.</p><p>44.Â&nbsp;For bigger milestones, book a massage
or have dinner at your favorite restaurant. And promise yourself a
nice big pot of gold when you reach the end of the rainbow. </p><p>45.Â&nbsp;The key to becoming world-class in your endeavors is to build
your performance around world-class routines. It can be diffi cult,
even futile, to predict or control what will show up in the middle
of your workday. But …</p></div></div></div>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I said in my <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/blog/2020/10/25/canframe_py_tool/">previous blog post</a> that
“My next goal is to create a
GTKWave filter so that an arbitrary waveform can be decoded” and in an early
Christmas present to those who are into the CAN protocol, I’ve done that!
But I’ve done even better and I therefore present to you <strong>the new CAN
protocol decoder</strong> for the Sigrok project.</p>

<p>First, a quick summary of <a href="https://sigrok.org/">Sigrok</a>:
it’s a set of drivers and tools that
provide a desktop oscilloscope / logic analyzer UI for many, many different
instruments (from Siglent, Rigol and others). The UI runs on
Mac, Windows and Linux (and others) and the GUI is called PulseView (there’s
also a command-line tool for batch decoding, useful for an automated test
environment). 
PulseView has an API for protocol decoders, and I’ve wrtten one for CAN: it’s called <code>can2</code>.</p>

<p>A couple of quick bear trap warnings for using PulseView before I
talk about <code>can2</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t use the Sigrok package that comes with your Linux distro: it’s very
likely to be too old and there have been lots of changed; download binaries directly.</li>
  <li>If importing a VCD file make sure the Downsampling factor is set so that the logic analyzer sample period is no more than about 1ns. If you don’t and you feed it a VCD that came from a simulator that used 1ps steps then your PC is going to spinning up its fans for a long time!</li>
</ul>

<p>OK, back to the protocol decoder it can be installed by
copying the directory <code>can2</code> (containing two Python files) into
the directory (on Linux) <code>~/.local/share/libsigrokdecode/decoders</code>.</p>

<p>The decoder appears in the decoders list as “CAN 2.0” and it requires just one
input: the CAN RX line (from the RX pin of a CAN transceiver).
The options include the sampling point (default 75%) and the bit rate
(default 500kbit/sec).</p>

<p>When the decoder is applied to a CAN signal on it 
then then the output is like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://kentindell.github.io/assets/pulseview1.png" alt="PulseView screenshot"></p>

<p>The top row of the decoder output (“CAN 2.0: Bits”) shows the CAN bits
(regular and stuff bits). A tooltip will
appear giving the bit value if the mouse pointer is hovered over the bit
(PulseView automatically displays the information it can in the space available
at a given zoom level).</p>

<p>The next row shows the CAN fields: the first bit is SOF (Start of Frame),
the next is the 11-bit ID, and so on. A frame ends with the IFS field.
Two other states are not shown: Bus Integration (where the decoder is syncing
to the CAN signal from a reset state) and Idle (where nothing is happening).</p>

<p>The third row shows the full CAN ID (if the frame is an extended frame -
i.e. IDE=1 - then there is a second 18-bit field, and the ID is then
29 bits long). The row also shows the payload decoded into individual bytes.</p>

<p>The fourth row is the really interesting one: it shows information about
the CAN frame. In the screenshot, it displays an “E” to indicate an
error flag. The tooltip says “Form error”, which means that the field
contains the wrong value: it is read as a dominant (0) bit and it should
be recessive (1). This is an indication of an error, and the decoder
shows that the subsequent bits are an Error Flag followed by an Error
Delimiter, and then IFS again.</p>

<p>The info row also shows other interesting events, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When the frame has been received OK (i.e. second to last bit of EOF)</li>
  <li>When the frame has been transmitted OK (i.e. last bit of EOF)</li>
  <li>If there is an ACK error (i.e. the ACK bit is not 0)</li>
  <li>If the received CRC doesn’t match the calculated CRC (the protocol decoder
keeps track of the expected CRC value)</li>
  <li>If there is a ‘double receive’ (i.e. there is an error after the frame
has been received OK but before the frame has been transmitted OK)</li>
  <li>If there is an overload rather than an error. Modern CAN controllers should
never generate overload frames so to see one means that something odd is
going on. To see two in a row means something <em>very</em> odd is going on.</li>
</ul>

<p>The last two are symptoms of protocol attacks: the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/2020/01/20/new-can-hacks/">Double Receive Attack</a>
and the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/2020/01/20/new-can-hacks/">Freeze Doom Loop Attack</a>. 
The <a href="https://github.com/kentindell/canhack">CANHack toolkit</a> can actually
generate these attacks (and a whole bunch of other attacks)
and so the <code>can2</code> protocol decoder is a good starting
point if an attack on the CAN bus is suspected.</p>

<p>The CAN Double Receive problem isn’t just a symptom of an attack: it can 
happen for real, and is a consequence of CAN’s
amazingly useful <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/2020/07/11/can-atomic-multicast/">atomic broadcast</a> property (very few
communications protocols provide this and it’s an essential building block
for robust mission-critical applications). So my top
tip for anyone building a CAN-based application: for any frame that includes
event-based data (like a command) then include a sequence number (it can
be just one bit) so that duplicates can be detected and discarded. Doing
this doesn’t just fix a wrinkle in the protocol, it also defends against
the Double Receive Attack.</p>

<p>Finally, a couple of things about the decoder. It doesn’t implement the
CAN time quanta bit sampling scheme (where sync is limited by the SJW
parameter) but it does implement the sync rules (in particular, glitches after
a bit is sampled as 0 are ignored). Also, <code>can2</code> goes into
Bus Integration if it samples the CAN r0 bit as recessive, which means that
CAN FD frames are ignored and skipped over rather than causing the decoder
to get scrambled (incidentally, this is why CAN FD can’t share a bus with
classic CAN 2.0 controllers).</p>

<p>Oh, one last thing: anyone wanting a GTKWave filter for CAN could use this
<a href="https://gist.github.com/smunaut/4239a17ea116d5ddfdaecad381f712e9#file-gtkwave-sigrok-filter-py">neat little tool</a> to turn the <code>can2</code> Sigrok decoder into exactly that.</p>

<p>Raspberry Pi Rack Server Mark I и Mark II have been working pretty nice for 6 month already. Both of them are based on a model which I found on <a href="https://thingiverse.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://thingiverse.com">thingiverse.com</a> and inherited the basic design idea.</p>



<p>With Mark III, I completely rethought the design, which allowed to:</p>



<ul><li>increase the number of raspberries in 2 rack units</li><li>significantly reduce printing time and plastic consumption</li><li>significantly reduce the time required for assembling and disassembling the server</li><li>reduce the number of parts</li><li>implement a modular design, which means that MARK III will be available in various modifications</li></ul>



<p>I’m glad to present the first basic model, designed for 14x of Raspberry Pi and 14x of a standard 2.5″ SSD.</p>



<p>BTW I will be glad if you subscribe to my instagram <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/uptime.lab/" target="_blank">instagram.com/uptime.lab</a> your feedback and likes are very important for me!</p>

      <div><p>&gt; 1194 words, 32 paragraphs, about 4 minutes to read (300 wpm).</p><p>&gt; First published on 2020-11-16.</p><p>&gt; This article has been loaded 2285 times.</p><p>This post will require a lot of in-knowledge to understand. It's okay if you have no idea what I'm talking about.</p><div><p><span> ##</span></p><h2>The supposed differences of the fediverse</h2></div><p>When someone tries to explain the fediverse to someone who doesn't know what it is, chances are they'll be saying that it's like traditional corporate social media, but with these differences:</p><div><ul><li>open source</li><li>federated (and what that means)</li><li>lots of LGBT people on it</li></ul></div><div><p><span> ##</span></p><h2>The real similarities of the fediverse</h2></div><p>Those things are true. But I don't believe they make a difference to how people interact with the site on a fundamental level.</p><p>What do you do on Twitter Dot Com? You scroll down and look at other people's shitty posts. Sometimes you even press the buttons on them. What do you do on the fediverse? You scroll down and look at other people's shitty posts. Sometimes you even press the buttons on them.</p><p>It's the same feedback loop and it creates a very similar feel and environment. After all, that loop is exactly what Mastodon and Pleroma were designed to replicate.</p><p>Federation is touted as a good thing which splits users into separate communities organised by topics. Communities then have to try a little harder to reach across to each other. It's never stated, but the implication is that there's a whole spectrum and variety of communities, and that they're somehow equal in some kind of democratic society.</p><p>In reality, what happens is that 5 very different, distinct, and clearly identifiable varieties of communities emerge. Please see my diagram:</p><p>(Despite the assumptions one might make from the "political compass" format, these are distinct quadrants with solid borders, not sliding scales across the lines.)</p><p>(That chart does not include the 5th segment on it. The 5th segment is the centrists. My commentary about them wouldn't fit in the space.)</p><p>The centrists just use the social media as a social media. They talk about themselves, and others, and what they saw on the news. They don't get involved with the drama between the quadrants. They're likely blissfully unaware of it. They just want to grill for god's sake.</p><p>It's a simple life, and in my opinion, one to be envied.</p><p>In the red zone, we have the likes of hellsite.site, who post more about the network itself and engaging in blocking warfare against the latest suspicious user and the latest suspicious site, than actually making posts and using the social media for a reason.</p><p>Let me try to put this another way. They're trying to create a safe space online, which is a laudable goal. I can appreciate a safe space. But the problem is that they're so focused on trying to curate the perfect social media that they haven't thought about what they're going to do once they actually manage to create that space. They're too caught up in the inter-site hellscape. And if the only thing that they post about is commentary on drama from the spaces they're excluding... is it really a safe space, if the war is the only thing visible?</p><p>Of course, the social media utopia that they aim for will never exist. Blocking sites doesn't work: there will always be something more to block. Instance allowlists get closer, but they'll still never be perfect. There will always be that one user on that one site that did something bad and now everyone hates them. But they're part of an allowed site. Can't get rid of them entirely. What to do? Ah yes, aggressively subpost about them on your timeline. _That'll_ solve the problem! Finally: a safe space!</p><p>While this war continues, there will never be anything but the war to post about. They are fighting for nothing. If they win, which won't happen, it would just be over. The reason they exist would have ended. They are fighting because they exist to fight.</p><p>The red zone is a very tiring existence, and I'm pleased to be rid of it.</p><p>In the purple zone, the only fucking thing they know is technology and "freedom". Christ. How awful.</p><p>Obviously the blue zone is abhorrent.</p><p>The left quadrant is where I find myself nowadays.</p><p>If you run a fediverse site that other people can join as members, then there are exactly two reasons to blanket block another site for all your members.</p><div><ul><li>At least 2 users on the other site are harassing at least 2 of your own members, and the moderators on the other site are not helping.</li><li>Or, the site is dedicated to hosting hate speech.</li></ul></div><p>Otherwise... what's the point?</p><p>The thing is that many things make up a fediverse site.</p><div><ul><li>The site's rules</li><li>The moderators</li><li>The people on it</li></ul></div><p>The people and their behaviour is the most important aspect of any site. If you as a moderator are considering blocking a site, what you are doing is depriving your members of the choice of who to interact with. Mastodon has powerful controls in the hands of the users. Users can block people, users can block entire sites. They can do this themselves. They don't need you to do it for them - unless there's a bigger problem of uncontrolled harassment.</p><p>Uncontrolled harassment is the only use case for a domain block. Did you see one specific person on another site who is being annoying or has really terrible takes? Of course, we've all seen that one person. But WHO THE FUCK CARES. If they aren't specifically being annoying at your members, just live and let live. They can exist in their own world. You don't need to care about them. If they're being specifically annoying at one of your members, then choosing how to interact - or not - should be in the hands of the member, not you.</p><p>You don't need to play god with what your members see. It's the internet. It's a scary place. We all know about that, and we can deal with it ourselves. The only way to make a truly safe space is to close federation and have approved _membership_, and vet individual _people_ before inviting them. In other words, a classic forum, or if you prefer real-time communication, a chatroom. Is this what you want? Then make it, instead of trying to make the fediverse fit your whims.</p><p>It's all so tiring and I'm sick of it.</p><p>Hopefully you can now understand why I block people on sight who post meta drama or block commentary. My life has been much improved for it.</p><p>I'll still recommend the fediverse to other people looking for a new social media to join, but I'll try to direct them into "centrist" spaces rather than the spaces I ended up in, because the discourse and effort of the red zone is not fucking worth the zero upsides it brings.</p><p>If I ever get the desire to create my own social media platform, I'm making a fucking medieval castle social media, which will probably be called Castledon.</p><p>---</p><p>&gt; No replies yet.</p><p>---</p><p>Looking for more?</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Quite a while ago, Santa got a feature request for a web application called <a href="https://www.agrammon.ch/en">AGRAMMON</a>, developed by the elves of one of his sub-contractors <a href="https://www.oetiker.ch/">Oetiker+Partner AG</a> in what then was called Perl 5. When Santa asked the <a href="https://www.oetiker.ch/en/company/team/fz">elf responsible</a> for this application to get to work, the elf suggested that some refactoring was in order, as the application dated back almost 10 years and had been extended regularly.</p>



<p>As the previous year had seen a real Christmas wonder, namely the <a href="https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2015/12/">release of Perl 6c</a>, the elf suggested, that instead of bolting yet another feature onto the web application’s Perl backend, a rewrite in Perl 6 would be a bold but also appropriate move. The reason being that the application used a specially developed format for describing it’s functionality by none-programmers. What better choice for rewriting the parser than Perl 6’s grammars, the elf reasoned. Fittingly, the new AGRAMMON was going to be version 6.</p>



<p>When Santa asked when the rewrite would be finished, the elf’s obivous answer was “by Christmas”. And as things went in Perl 6 land, by the time the rewrite is finally going into production, the backend is now implemented in Raku.</p>



<h2><a href="https://github.com/zaucker/agrammon/blob/Advent/Advent2020/raku-in-the-wild.md#agrammon"></a>AGRAMMON</h2>



<p>Most people nowadays know about the negative side-effects of agriculture on climate, namely emissions of methane and nitrous oxide (strong greenhouse gases) and deforestation. A lesser known, but also significant environmental problem, are ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) and nitrous oxide (NO<sub>x</sub>) emissions. For the agricultural production, NH<sub>3</sub> is a major gaseous pollutant while NO<sub>x</sub> is of minor importance.</p>



<p>The main source of these emissions are excretions of farm animals, mainly from cattle, pigs, and poultry. Both liquid and solid manure contain nitrogen compounds such as urea. These compounds are decomposing when the excretions are deposited onto the farm surfaces, subsequently stored in manure stores, and when applied to the field as fertilizer.</p>



<p>In addition to induce negative environmental impacts, these emissions entail a substantial loss of nitrogen (N) from manure and either result in diminished productivity of farms or the loss must be compensated by mineral fertilizers at additional costs to the farmers. In Switzerland alone, about 40,000 tonnes of nitrogen are lost every year, amounting to about 30% of the N load in manure.</p>



<p>In order to address these problems, the processes of ammonia volatilisation are studied, emission mitigation options developed, and the effects measured where possible under controlled conditions. However, as controlled conditions are difficult to implement at farm-scale, the effects of the reduction measures as well as the total amount of emissions can be simulated by model calculations. AGRAMMON is a tool that facilitates such simulations at the scale of a single farm. Such calculations can also be done at regional scale by means of simulating “typical farm types” using average process types and cumulated numbers of animals, storage facilities, and fertilizer application. The following picture shows the processes simulated by the model:</p>



<figure><a href="https://github.com/zaucker/agrammon/blob/Advent/Advent2020/N-model.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://github.com/zaucker/agrammon/raw/Advent/Advent2020/N-model.jpg" alt=""></a><figcaption>The model Agrammon calculates ammonia loss on the basis of the N-flux (mass-flow model). For the stages housing/yard, manure store, manure application, and other sources the loss is calculated by using emission rates as a proportion of the total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN) in the system. For slurry stores, an emission rate per m2 of surface area of the slurry store is used. Important production variables such as feed, housing system, covering of slurry store or emission-mitigating application systems are taken into account in emission rates as correction factors.</figcaption></figure>







<h2>The Application</h2>



<p>AGRAMMON is a typical web application, with data stored in a PostgreSQL database, a web frontend implemented in JavaScript using the <a href="https://qooxdoo.org/">Qooxdoo framework</a> , and a Raku backend. The physical and chemical processes are not directly implemented in the backend, but as already mentioned in a none-programmer-friendly custom “language”, describing (user) inputs, model parameters, calculations, and outputs (results).</p>



<p>Each process is broken down into smaller sub-processes and each is described in its own file, including documentation and references to appropriate scientific sources. Here is a small example for such a file:</p>


<pre title="">*** general ***

author   = Agrammon Group
date     = 2008-03-30
taxonomy = Livestock::DairyCow::Excretion

+short

Computes the annual N excretion of a number of dairy cows as a function of the
milk yield and the feed ration.

+description

This process calculates the annual N excretion (total N and Nsol (urea plus
measured total ammoniacal nitrogen)) of a number of dairy cows as a
function of the milk yield and the supplied feed ration. Nitrogen
surpluses from increased nitrogen uptake are primarily excreted as
Nsol in the urine. Eighty percent of the increased N excretion is
therefore added to the Nsol fraction.

<p>In the current version of the AGRAMMON model there are 133 such model files with 31,014 lines. From those, the backend can generate</p>

<p>A special instance of AGRAMMON is used by a <a href="https://lawa.lu.ch/">regional government agency</a> in the evaluation process of the environmental impact of modifications to local farms and the approval of the respective building applications. For this, the ammonia emissions before and after the planned modifications must be simulated by the applicant and can be directly submitted to the agency’s AGRAMMON account, including a notification of the agency by eMail with the PDF report attached.</p>



<h2><a href="https://github.com/zaucker/agrammon/blob/Advent/Advent2020/raku-in-the-wild.md#the-raku-backend"></a>The Raku backend</h2>



<p>The refactored backend as of today consists of 59 <code>.pm6</code> <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/modules">modules/packages</a> with 6,942 lines and is covered by tests in 38 <code>.t</code> files with 5,854 lines. It uses the 13 Raku modules shown in the following excerpt of the <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/modules#index-entry-META6.json-META6.json">META6.json</a> file:</p>


<pre title="">  "depends": [
    "Cro::HTTP",
    "Cro::HTTP::Session::Pg",
    "Cro::OpenAPI::RoutesFromDefinition",
    "Cro::WebApp::Template",
    "DB::Pg",
    "Digest::SHA1::Native",
    "Email::MIME",
    "LibXML:ver&lt;0.5.10&gt;",
    "Net::SMTP::Client::Async",
    "OO::Monitors",
    "Spreadsheet::XLSX:ver&lt;0.2.1+&gt;",
    "Text::CSV",
    "YAMLish"
  ],
  "build-depends": [],
  "test-depends": [
    "App::Prove6",
    "Cro::HTTP::Test",
    "Test::Mock",
    "Test::NoTabs"
  ],

</pre>


<p>Those modules can be found on the <a href="https://modules.raku.org/">Raku Modules Directory</a>. Note that <a href="https://github.com/jnthn/spreadsheet-xlsx"><code>Spreadsheet::XLSX</code></a> was specifically implemented for this project. As a side-effect, just yesterday our expert elf (see below) submitted a&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/libxml-raku/LibXML-raku/pull/49">pull request</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/libxml-raku/LibXML-raku">LibXML</a>&nbsp;used in Spreadsheet::XLSX leading to a factor of 2 performance improvement.</p>



<p>Speaking of the actual implementation, although our brave elf didn’t have much experience with either grammars, parsers, or even Perl 6 / Raku, he was smart enough to engage a real <a href="https://www.edument.se/en/page/jonathan-worthington-eng">expert elf</a> for that. This elf did most of the heavy lifting of the backend implementation and helped our elf with advice and code review for the parts he implemented himself.</p>



<p>Please note that the goal of this rewrite was to leave most of the syntax of the model implementation and also the frontend as is, so the blame for all the sub-optimal design decisions are solely on our primary elf as well as the responsibility for imperfect implementation details passing under the review radar.</p>



<h2>Some Raku features used in AGRAMMON</h2>



<p>In this section we’ll present a few Raku features used in AGRAMMON. This is not meant as a hardcore technical explanation for experts, but rather as a means to give a taste to people interested in Raku.</p>



<p>Most code examples are taken straight from the current implementation, sometimes the examples are slightly shortened by leaving of code that is irrelevant to the concept presented. There are many links to the original modules on GitHub. As AGRAMMON is still being worked on, those links might point at a more recent version of the module.</p>



<h3><a href="https://github.com/oposs/agrammon/blob/master/bin/agrammon.pl6">bin/agrammon.pl6</a></h3>



<p>The actual AGRAMMON “executable” is just a three-liner (of which only two are Raku):</p>


<pre title="">#!/usr/bin/env raku
use lib "lib"
use Agrammon::UI::CommandLine;

</pre>


<p>This exploits the fact that Rakudo (the Raku implementation used here) has a pretty nice <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/faq#index-entry-Precompile_(FAQ)">pre-compilation</a> feature which is useful for minimizing (the still not neglegible) startup time after the first run of the program.<a href="https://github.com/zaucker/agrammon/blob/Advent/Advent2020/raku-in-the-wild.md#agrammonuicommandline"></a></p>



<h3><a href="https://github.com/oposs/agrammon/blob/master/lib/Agrammon/UI/CommandLine.pm6">Agrammon::UI::CommandLine</a></h3>



<p>This module contains the main functions of the AGRAMMON application available from the command line.</p>



<h4><a href="https://github.com/zaucker/agrammon/blob/Advent/Advent2020/raku-in-the-wild.md#usage"></a>Usage</h4>



<p>Running <code>./bin/agrammon.pl6</code> gives the following output:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>Hey there,</p>
<p>many folks in the eink community are also very passionate about the cryptocurrency sector. It guess it’s in the nature of our values. Both eink users as well as crypto users are in their nature early adopters. There are many angles where you could combine the both. Especially I could see crypto as a lever to boost the eink R&amp;D and development. Let’s start with a few ideas:</p>
<p><strong><span>#1</span> Display Digital Art on an Eink Display</strong></p>
<p>There is an emerging community in the crypto currency space around the crypto collectibles and NFT community. The market <a href="https://beincrypto.com/nft-market-takes-off-with-115-month-over-month-growth/">has seen exponential growth</a> in the past months. There has even been one art collection <a href="https://beincrypto.com/nft-digital-art-collection-sells-for-almost-800000/">sold for 800k USD</a>. So if you are digital art owner, you eventually want to “show off” your art. I think there will be need for a product such as an eink frame where you can display your digital art collection and some sort of qr code or some other proof (e.g. eth name address) that you own that piece of art. Imagine what great conversation starter this would be, if you have such a picture frame hanging in your flat or office.</p>
<p><strong><span>#2</span> Funding Eink Hardware Development with Crypto Currencies</strong></p>
<p>There has been some attempts to fund open source hardware with cryptocurrencies. There was an <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/blockchain-pocket-phone-behind-sirins-157-million-ico">158mln USD Initial Coin Offering</a> to fund the development of an open source blockchain based smartphone the Sirin phone. They where issuing their own digital currency. While this attempt mostly failed, therey could be another try maybe along the lines of eink hardware. However the token economics (if you want to issue an token) need to be engineered carefully and in such a way that it can accrue value.</p>
<p><strong><span>#3</span> Creating an ecoystem around focussed and healthy hardware/software based on eink technologies</strong></p>
<p>There has been a lot of hype around “distraction free phones” as well as discussions around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Dilemma#:~:text=The%20Social%20Dilemma%20is%20a,Davis%20Coombe%2C%20and%20Vickie%20Curtis.">social dilemma</a> where big tech spys on us. I think this angle around health, privacy and focus could start a totally new device category. We have seen first attempts:</p>
<p><a href="https://mudita.com/products/pure/">* Mudita Pure</a></p>
<p><a href="https://getfreewrite.com/">* FreeWrite</a></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Hal_clockwork/status/1329737173638135809?s=20">* DevTerm - An Open Source Portable Terminal</a></p>
<p>The question now is, how do you jumpstart this new sort of ecoystem? And how do you integrate cryptocurrencies? Maybe you could have an open-source hardware device (e.g. notebook, phone) on which you build lots of “eink-friendly” software. It could jumpstart a new open source community. Eventually this would be owned and governed by everyone through a cryptocurrency. Software will cost some money in that specific currency. If you are using the system, you earn that currency as early adopter. There will be an alternative app store, if you want to list there you need to pay in that currency. I don’t know how this could exactly look like, but that’s something we need to figure out as an community.</p>
<p>However there will be a first transition phase where we would need to “translate” regular services such as Facebook, Gmail, Maps, etc. and make them friendly for our hardware/software at the first place to “convert” regular users. And make everything usable for them at the beginning. And then they start liking the new system so much that they don’t want to go back. The “iPhone-Moment” for eink so to speak.</p>
<p><strong><span>#4</span> Smaller attempts</strong></p>
<p>There has been other “smaller” attempts to combine the both with an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/k1makb/simple_btc_price_ticker_with_e_ink_display/">Bitcoin price ticker</a> on an eink display or a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/c5u09g/a_cryptocurrency_wallet_card_with_eink_display_to/">crypto wallet with an eink display</a>. But let’s think big here.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts/ideas around merging the cryptocurrency sector with eink technology?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure id="w-node-8ad322b2e409-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5fdef365db8935cbdaab25b0_pexels-fauxels-3184422.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>In the past 3 months of working on <a href="http://delightchat.io/" target="_blank">delightchat.io</a>, this week was the only week where we managed to hit our deadlines exactly as planned. So I decided to dissect this further and tried to understand what we did right this time that we kept missing in the past few weeks.<br></p><p>On Dwelling deeper I found a few things that seemed to have really helped. The include</p><ul role="list"><li>Breaking up a week into simple and complex tasks.</li><li>Breaking up your day into time slots.<br></li></ul><h3><strong>Breaking up a week into simple and complex tasks.</strong><br></h3><p>After speaking to <a href="https://akash.substack.com/" target="_blank">our founding engineer Akash</a>, I realised something which should have been very obvious but somehow slipped past me. In the past few weeks we have been trying to knock off as many difficult tasks as possible, and by difficult I mean the tasks that had many unknowns and the quantum of work required to finish them was not really predictable. The idea behind this was that if we finished these types of tasks first, we could do the easy and predictable tasks at any point of time.<br></p><p>Turns out that this was not the correct way to approach things. In order to boost the morale of the team, there needed to be a few tasks which did not have any unknowns and therefore an ETA can be accurately established. As a result of this, finishing these tasks early in the week gives a feeling of achievement and fuels the desire to get more done in the remaining days of the week.<br></p><p>After this initial boost in morale, a complex task which requires a lot of research and deeper thinking can be undertaken more easily and confidently. This seemed to be the key to meeting our deadline for the week. We had two easy and predictable tasks this week that got done in two days. Post that Akash took up one complex task which took the remainder of the week.<br></p><h3><strong>Breaking up your day into time slots.</strong><br></h3><p>As Co-founders, Preetam and I have many things to do including development, meetings, writing content and many miscellaneous ad hoc tasks which come up. If we plan to be productive we would have to apply the above concept not only to the week but to every single day. Preetam suggested to me to divide the day into these 4 parts.<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Distraction free time to undertake complex and high priority tasks.</li><li>Time to complete a few easy tasks which might not be entirely distraction free.</li><li>A buffer time for any ad hoc tasks or meetings that might come up.</li><li>Time to relax<br></li></ul><p>So the full week must be divided into a few easy and a few difficult tasks, but each day within the week must be divided into the above 4 time frames. <br></p><h4><strong>Distraction free time</strong><br></h4><p>If you want to be be devoid of any distractions, you and your team can agree upon a certain period of time during the day where nobody is supposed to message each other on slack or call each other. We tried doing this in the initial stages but it was hard to pull this off because there could be pressing issues that cannot wait till the specified time window is over.<br></p><p>So I decided to change my strategy a little bit and do this during a period where our team is not working or at least is not expected to work. This only left me with 2 options - late night or early morning. I choose early morning because it feels healthier and it really helps to accomplish something early in the day because that will determine your mood for the rest of the day. <br></p><p>A while back I read this article about how the military mandates you to make your bed as soon as you get up and the idea behind it was for you to feel like you finished the first task of your day successfully and the result can be seen in the form of a clean made up bed which sets the tone for your mindset for the rest of the day. The other advantage of this is that if the rest of your day turns out to be bad, at least you can look forward to sleeping on an already clean and made up bed.<br></p><h4><strong>Time to complete easy tasks</strong><br></h4><p>After the early morning period has passed, the team is fully awake and active on slack, so you can no longer expect to be fully distraction free. Which means that the next few tasks that you do must be planned in a way that they do not require too much concentration and are mostly labour intensive. <br></p><p>An example of this is UI development work that involves minimal business logic and mostly assembling of components. This way even if you get distracted, you can context switch and get back into development quite easily. Obviously this is not always possible but one can prioritise their tasks in a way that whatever tasks require the least amount of brain power can be planned during this time frame. <br></p><h4><strong>Buffer time for ad hoc tasks</strong><br></h4><p>There are many such occurrences where a previously defined and agreed upon task can no longer be done in the way that was discussed because some new information has come to light. This may lead to more development or changing of the feature set to accommodate this new information. Either ways this requires your full attention to get through. <br></p><p>There could also be occurrences where a teammate wants to discuss or clarify something with you without which he/she is not able to proceed and therefore his/her time is blocked. This is not something that can be avoided because for the smooth functioning of any team, there must be no blockers or dependencies. <br></p><p>It is therefore important to dedicate some time during the day where you can schedule all of such ad hoc requests. Even if you receive these requests while the other time slots are in progress, you can schedule them for this time slot. <br></p><p>During this time slot you cannot expect to get much work done of your own, but at the same time you can’t just sit and wait for a teammate to message you about something, so you could use this time to browse the internet for some articles/resources that you always planned to look at for various purposes but never found the time. You could also use this time to work on some backlog tasks that have been pending for a while but lower in the priority list.<br></p><h4><strong>Time to relax</strong><br></h4><p>In my experience, out of all the above time slots, the time spent on ad hoc tasks is the most exhausting due to the amount of context switching needed and the lack of predictability. Therefore it is natural for one to transition from the ad hoc tasks time into relaxing time.<br></p><p>Unfortunately I do not have the luxury of always being able to have some time to relax. There are some days where this particular time slot gets skipped due to the workload but I try to clock in at least 45 minutes a day for a workout which for me counts as time to relax. I also have a hot bath right after my workout which really elevates the experience.<br></p><h3><strong>Closing notes</strong><br></h3><p>It has only been 3 months since Preetam and I started running a team and we are very much still learning. So it is entirely possible that we change our strategy in the coming days to accommodate the workload, the personalities of the new folks who join our team and our product roadmap.<br></p><p>But I feel like regardless of what happens, I can totally see the early morning distraction free time as something that I will continue to adapt for the foreseeable future. The benefits of doing this are too many to ignore. </p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some time ago I <a href="https://twitter.com/Dominus_Kelvin/status/1306158387340681217?s=20" rel="nofollow,noopener,noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> on Twitter I am working on Sailscasts - a platform to teach the Sails framework to help more people build out their ideas on JavaScript/Node.js</p>
<p>The journey to delivering Sailscasts has been(and it's still) interesting; I quit my job to focus fully on this project as I think I got something here. Sails is the most efficient way of building web service/application I know on Node.js. Companies like Postman and Paystack also share this sentiment(I believe) as they use Sails in production with a lot of success to it.</p>
<p>Speaking about the successes, Paystack has been <a href="https://paystack.com/blog/company-news/paystack-joining-stripe" rel="nofollow,noopener,noreferrer" target="_blank">acquired</a> by Stripe for a whooping $200M and Paystack runs on Sails!</p>
<p>I imagine a nearest future where anyone with a viable idea can build out an MVP with one language - JavaScript through the help of Sails.</p>
<p>In order to drive this vision to actualization, allow me to introduce <strong>The Sailscasts Company</strong></p>
<p>The Sailscasts Company is set to pioneer mass adoption of the Sails framework. We think Sails can help build businesses for anyone with a viable idea! Here is what we will be doing at The Sailscasts Company</p>
<h2 id="building-and-nurturing-sailscasts">Building and nurturing Sailscasts</h2>
<p>We believe educational resources and community is important for the adoption of any technology so we will have full-throttle on delivering Sailscasts and putting out quality educational resources and growing the <a href="https://discord.gg/gbJZuNm" rel="nofollow,noopener,noreferrer" target="_blank">Sails community</a> at large</p>

<p>We want to make it easier than it already is to develop using Sails by creating open-source tools for developers to employ in their day-to-day Sails journey</p>
<h2 id="serving-as-a-workforce-to-help-businesses-build-faster">Serving as a workforce to help businesses build faster</h2>
<p>We get that most times Companies won't have the engineering power to build their idea. In that light and to meet that need we will be offering custom platform/application development services to these companies. Our team will help build MVPs, provide consultation services, and even internal training for the engineering team of these services if they want.</p>
<h2 id="building-of-products-on-sails">Building of products on Sails</h2>
<p>We want to walk our talk. Since we are asking you to build on Sails, we also will be building our products on the Sails platform (Sailscasts is just the beginning)</p>
<p>The above and more are the motivation behind The Sailscasts Company and we are excited to deliver our first vision - Making Sailscasts a reality and giving it to you the developers to have a place to learn how to build your ideas using a language that can be likened to be the Ugly Duckling but now the language of our future - <strong>JavaScript</strong></p>
<p>I am pretty pumped about this. You can let me know what you think on <a href="https://twitter.com/Dominus_Kelvin" rel="nofollow,noopener,noreferrer" target="_blank">Twitter</a></p></div></div>]]>

<!-- internalpointers responsive -->
<p>An iterator is an object that points to an element inside a container. Like a pointer, an iterator can be used to access the element it points to and can be moved through the content of the container. Each container in the C++ Standard Library provides its own iterator, as well as some methods to retrieve it. Using iterators is quite easy: obtain an instance from a container, move it around where needed and then get the pointed element.</p>
<p>Concretely, an iterator is a simple class that provides a bunch of operators: increment <code>++</code>, dereference <code>*</code> and few others which make it very similar to a pointer and the arithmetic operations you can perform on it. In fact, iterators are a generalization of pointers, which are often used as a foundation when writing the iterator itself.</p>
<p>Iterators are one of the building blocks of the Standard Library containers, but they are also useful when you want to provide the ability to iterate over elements of a custom container that you wrote yourself: this is what I want to investigate in the present article. Adding iterators to your containers will make them compatible with the <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/range-for">range-based for loops</a> and the <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm">C++ Algorithms library</a>: a collection of functions for searching, sorting, counting and manipulating containers, based on iterators.</p>
<h2>A dummy container for our experiments</h2>
<p>Before digging deeper, let's define a silly custom container that we want to spice up with iterators:</p>
<pre><code>class Integers
{
private:
    int m_data[200];
};
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Integers</code> class is a wrapper around a raw array of <code>int</code>s: we want to be able to access elements of that private array through an iterator, as well as to loop over it or pass it to any of the Standard Library algorithms. Let's start by making some design decisions.</p>
<h2>Choose the nature of our iterator</h2>
<p>The first step is to choose the type of iterator we want to implement. Modern C++ defines six types:</p>
<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>#</th>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td><strong><a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/InputIterator">Input Iterator</a></strong></td>
<td>Can scan the container forward only once, can't change the value it points to (read-only);</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td><strong><a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/OutputIterator">Output Iterator</a></strong></td>
<td>Can scan the container forward only once, can't read the value it points to (write-only);</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td><strong><a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/ForwardIterator">Forward Iterator</a></strong></td>
<td>Can scan the container forward multiple times, can read and write the value it points to;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td><strong><a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/BidirectionalIterator">Bidirectional Iterator</a></strong></td>
<td>Same as previous one but can scan the container back and forth;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td><strong><a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/RandomAccessIterator">Random Access Iterator</a></strong></td>
<td>Same as previous one but can access the container also non-sequentially (i.e. by jumping around);</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td><strong><a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/ContiguousIterator">Contiguous Iterator</a></strong></td>
<td>Same as previous one, with the addition that logically adjacent elements are also physically adjacent in memory.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The six categories are hierarchical: a Bidirectional Iterator is also a Forward Iterator and a Random Access Iterator is both a Bidirectional and a Forward Iterator and so on. Normally, all iterators are Input Iterators (1) which makes them read-only, also known as <strong>constant iterators</strong>. Iterators that both support read and write operations are also Output Iterators (2) and are called <strong>mutable iterators</strong>.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/monocasual/internalpointers-files/master/2020/12/iterators/iterator-hierarchy.png" alt="Iterators hierarchy"></p><p>1. Iterators hierarchy in C++. All iterators are Input Iterators, Output Iterators or both.</p>
</div><p>Input and Output iterators are often used for low-level components such as input and output streams (the so-called <strong>single-pass algorithms</strong>) and thus have limitations. We want to do more with our custom container, so we will skip those two and jump straight to the mutable Forward Iterator.</p>
<h2>Prepare the custom iterator</h2>
<p>An iterator is usually declared inside the class it belongs to, for example:</p>
<pre><code>class Integers
{
public:
    struct Iterator { /* ... */ };

    // ...
};
</code></pre>
<p>The first thing to do is to assign the iterator some properties. Until C++17 this is done by <em>tagging</em> it with the <a href="https://www.fluentcpp.com/2018/04/27/tag-dispatching/"><strong>tag dispatch</strong></a> mechanism, while C++20 uses <strong>concepts</strong>: in this article I will follow the traditional approach.</p>
<p>C++ expects some properties from an iterator:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>iterator_category</code> — one of the six iterator categories we have seen above. The full list is available <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/iterator_tags">here</a>. The <code>std::forward_iterator_tag</code> tag is what we need;</li>
<li><code>difference_type</code> — a signed integer type that can be used to identify distance between iterator steps. Our iterator is basically a wrapper around a pointer and leverages pointer arithmetic, so the default <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/ptrdiff_t"><code>std::ptrdiff_t</code></a> is a good choice;</li>
<li><code>value_type</code> — the type the iterator iterates over. <code>int</code> in our case;</li>
<li><code>pointer</code> — defines a pointer to the type iterated over. <code>int*</code> in our case;</li>
<li><code>reference</code> — defines a reference to the type iterated over. <code>int&amp;</code> in our case;</li>
</ul>
<p>Translated into code:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;iterator&gt; // For std::forward_iterator_tag
#include &lt;cstddef&gt;  // For std::ptrdiff_t

struct Iterator 
{
    using iterator_category = std::forward_iterator_tag;
    using difference_type   = std::ptrdiff_t;
    using value_type        = int;
    using pointer           = int*;  // or also value_type*
    using reference         = int&amp;;  // or also value_type&amp;
};
</code></pre>
<h3>Why are tags useful?</h3>
<p>Some of the tags above might seem useless at first. In fact, you will notice how they will never get mentioned during the definition of our iterator. Tags are used to select the most efficient algorithm if your container is passed to one of the Standard Library functions from the <code>&lt;algorithm&gt;</code> library. Wrong tags mean sub-optimal performance! The iterator category is also used to set algorithm requirements, for example: <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/fill"><code>std::fill</code></a> wants a Forward Iterator, while <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/reverse"><code>std::reverse</code></a> wants a Bidirectional Iterator. Passing the wrong iterator will result in a compilation error.</p>
<h2>Define the iterator constructors</h2>
<p>All iterators must be <em>constructible</em>, <em>copy-constructible</em>, <em>copy-assignable</em>, <em>destructible</em> and <em>swappable</em>. Let's translate those requirements into code for our iterator:</p>
<pre><code>struct Iterator 
{
    // Iterator tags here...

    Iterator(pointer ptr) : m_ptr(ptr) {}

private:

    pointer m_ptr;
};
</code></pre>
<p>Easy! We just need a custom constructor to initialize the private member variable <code>m_ptr</code>, which points to an element of the <code>Integers</code> container. The custom constructor satisfies the <em>constructible</em> requirement, while all others are covered by the implicitly-declared constructors and operators kindly provided by the compiler.</p>
<h2>Implement operators</h2>
<p>We are building a mutable Forward Iterator, which inherits properties from both Input and Output Iterators. The resulting iterator must support the following operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>*iterator</code> and <code>iterator-&gt;x</code> — dereferenceable, to get the value it points to;</li>
<li><code>++iterator</code> and <code>iterator++</code> — incrementable, to move it one step forward, both prefix and postfix versions. The latter must return something dereferenceable;</li>
<li><code>iterator_a == iterator_b</code> and <code>iterator_a != iterator_b</code> — comparable with another iterator;</li>
</ul>
<p>This is done by implementing some custom operators in the <code>Iterator</code> class, like this:</p>
<pre><code>struct Iterator 
{
    // Iterator tags here...

    // Iterator constructors here...

    reference operator*() const { return *m_ptr; }
    pointer operator-&gt;() { return m_ptr; }

    // Prefix increment
    Iterator&amp; operator++() { m_ptr++; return *this; }  

    // Postfix increment
    Iterator operator++(int) { Iterator tmp = *this; ++(*this); return tmp; }

    friend bool operator== (const Iterator&amp; a, const Iterator&amp; b) { return a.m_ptr == b.m_ptr; };
    friend bool operator!= (const Iterator&amp; a, const Iterator&amp; b) { return a.m_ptr != b.m_ptr; };     

private:

    pointer m_ptr;
};
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see every operator involves the usage of the private pointer <code>m_ptr</code>. Also, notice the <code>friend</code> declaration for the two comparison operators: this is handy way to define the operators as non-member functions, yet being able to access private parts of the <code>Iterator</code> class (rationale  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4421706/what-are-the-basic-rules-and-idioms-for-operator-overloading/4421729#4421729">here</a>).</p>
<h2>Prepare the container</h2>
<p>Our iterator is good to go. The last step is to give our custom container the ability to create <code>Iterator</code> objects. This is done by adding two public methods <code>begin()</code> and <code>end()</code> that return instances of the <code>Iterator</code> class, representing the first and the last element respectively:</p>
<pre><code>class Integers
{
public:

    // Iterator definition here ...

    Iterator begin() { return Iterator(&amp;m_data[0]); }
    Iterator end()   { return Iterator(&amp;m_data[200]); } // 200 is out of bounds
};
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>end()</code> method returns an iterator that refers to an <em>invalid</em> memory address, past the end of our raw array. Such iterator is just a placeholder used to determine when the boundary has been reached: it should never be accessed directly.</p>

<!-- internalpointers responsive -->
<h2>Time to test our iterator</h2>
<p>Both the custom container and its iterator are now ready. Let's test them with the range-based for loop:</p>
<pre><code>Integers integers;
for (auto i : integers)
    std::cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; "\n";
</code></pre>
<p>This code will magically print the value of each integer in the container. It works because the range-based for loop is just syntactic sugar created by the compiler for the following:</p>
<pre><code>for (auto it = integers.begin(), end = integers.end(); it != end; ++it) { 
    const auto i = *it; 
    std::cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; "\n";
}
</code></pre>
<p>In words: two iterators <code>it</code> and <code>end</code> are created. The first one points to the beginning of the container, the other one points to the end. Then, on each loop, the <code>it</code> iterator is incremented until it's equal to <code>end</code>, that is until the end of the container has been reached. The actual value is obtained by dereferencing <code>it</code> in a local variable before being printed.</p>
<p>Notice how the compiler makes use of all the operators and functions we have previously implemented: the <code>begin()</code> and <code>end()</code> methods in the custom container, the ability to compare the two iterators with the <code>!=</code> operator, the ability to increment <code>it</code> with the prefix syntax and finally the ability to dereference it to grab the actual value it points to.</p>
<p>Let's now try a function from the Algorithm library, <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/fill"><code>std::fill</code></a> for example:</p>
<pre><code>Integers integers;

std::fill(integers.begin(), integers.end(), 3);
</code></pre>
<p>The function assigns all elements in the container the value <code>3</code>. It works because <code>std::fill</code> is usually implemented like this:</p>
<pre><code>template &lt;typename ForwardIterator, …</code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bharat Mediratta was a Distinguished Engineer at Google, CTO at Altschool, and CTO at Dropbox. At Google, he worked on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Web_Server">GWS</a> (Google Web Server), a system that I’ve always been curious about, especially since its Wikipedia entry calls it “one of the most guarded components of Google's infrastructure”.</p><p>In this podcast, we discuss GWS, bootstrapping a culture of testing at Google, breaking up services to be more manageable, monorepos, build systems, the ethics of software at scale, and more. We spent almost an hour and a half, and didn’t even manage to cover his experiences at Altschool or Dropbox (which hopefully will be covered in a follow up).</p><p>Listen on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/software-at-scale/id1543617436">Apple Podcasts</a> or <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7eGnnZnfb3mOGTqWR4gTjK?si=DMsJIWg3QjiiJS65A1nEbQ">Spotify</a>.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;mailto:reliability@substack.com&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Send feedback&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a href="https://www.softwareatscale.dev/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#addfc8c1c4cccfc4c1c4d9d4edded8cfded9cccec683cec2c0"><span>Send feedback</span></a></p><h2>Highlights</h2><p>Notes are <em>italicized.</em></p><p>0:20 - Background - Childhood interests in technology. His dad was a director at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeronautical_Development_Establishment">ADE, India</a>. <em><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Kalams-stellar-career-took-off-in-Bengaluru/articleshow/48245618.cms">His dad recruited APJ Abdul Kalam, arguably one of India’s most popular Presidents, and kick-started his career</a>.</em></p><p>6:10 - Studying tech in university. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Meditation#:~:text=The%20Guru%20Meditation%20is%20an,such%20as%20Varnish%20and%20VirtualBox.">Guru Meditation errors</a>.</p><p>10:50 - Working at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems">Sun Microsystems</a> as a first job.</p><p>12:30 - Transitioning from being a programmer to a leader, and thinking about project plans and deadlines.</p><p>14:15 - Working on side projects for the company (a potential inspiration for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/21/jobs/21pre.html">20% projects at Google?</a>)</p><p>15:30 - Moving from Sun to a few startups to Google. How did 20% projects start?</p><p>16:50 - Google News as a 20% project. <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20%25_Project#Google_News">Apparently 20% projects has its own wikipedia page.</a></em></p><p>18:24 - Did 20% time require management approval?</p><p>19:30 - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Kurian">TK</a> at Google Cloud, and how the management model compares to early Google</p><p>21:00 - Declining an offer from Google at 2002, and going to <a href="https://itsfoss.com/story-of-va-linux/">VA Linux</a> instead.</p><p>22:28 - Growth at Google from 2004 onwards.</p><p>24:28 - Hiring at Google at that time. “A players hire A players, B players hire C players”.</p><p>24:55 - Culture Fit (indoctrination)? Two weeks of “fairly intense education”, a Noogler project, and a general investment of time and money to help explain the Google way of doing things. It wasn’t accidental. <em>I went through this in 2016 and definitely learnt a bunch, especially from an intriguing talk called “Life of a Query”.</em></p><p>27:22 - Culturally integrating acquisitions successfully. YouTube as an example.</p><p>28:40 - Differences between Google and YouTube, and other acquisitions like Motorola Mobility.</p><p>30:20 - Search/Google Web Server (GWS) only had 3 nines of availability? The difference between a forager and a refiner (in terms of programming)</p><p>31:15 - What was GWS? Server responsible for Google Home and Google Search. </p><p>32:20 - There was only one infrastructure engineer on GWS at the time (who wanted to switch), but about a hundred engineers made changes to it every week. </p><p>33:10 - Starting with writing unit tests for this system.</p><p>33:40 - “They” used to call GWS “the neck of Google”. Extremely critical, but also extremely fragile. Search results and 98% of revenue came through this system. One second of downtime implied revenue loss. Rewriting was infeasible.</p><p>34:50 - How to use unit tests to create a culture of shared understanding. Bharat released a manifesto that basically said “all changes to GWS required unit tests”. This caused massive consternation at the time.</p><p>36:10 - A quick example on how to enforce unit tests on new code. If an engineer didn’t add a new unit test, Bharat would write the test for them, which often would be failing due to a bug in engineer’s code. This led to a culture where engineers realized the value of writing these tests (and implicitly </p><p>39:23 - New Googlers were taught to write unit tests, so that new engineers would spread a culture of writing tests. “Oh, everyone writes unit tests at Google”.</p><p>41:50 - “What kind of features were those hundreds of engineers adding to GWS?”. An example - adding UPS tracking numbers automatically showed you UPS tracking results. These were all quiet launches.</p><p>Some of the software design around experimentation towards Google search might have influenced Optimizely’s design.</p><p>45:00 - Google’s search page in 2007 was pure HTML. In 2009, it was completely AJAX based. This was a massive shift that happened transparently for users.</p><p>46:00 - “We wanted Search to be a utility. We wanted it to be the air you breath. You don’t turn on the faucet and worry that water doesn’t come out.” </p><p>47:40 - The evolution of GWS’s architecture. Initially, very monolithic. GWS would talk to indices, get results, rank results, and send back HTML. This eventually was broken into layers. Each layer had responsibility, and the plan was to stick to that.</p><p>49:00 - “You could find one line of code in GWS that had C code, C++ code, HTML, Javascript, and CSS output”. <em>Wow.</em></p><p>The number one query at Google at the time was “Yahoo” - a navigational search query.</p><p>50:00 - Google Instant was rolled out in 2010. Internally, this was called “Google Psychic”, cause it was pretty good at predicting what users wanted to search.</p><p>51:50 - “A rewrite would have been a disaster”. GWS was essentially refactored from inside out every 18 months for 11 years. The first one - was breaking out ranking from GWS to another service.</p><p>57:00 - YouTube knew that if it convinced enough people to get better internet, Google would make more revenue.</p><p>59:00 - Search grew from 500-1000 people in 2004, to 3000 people in 2010. </p><p>59:30 - How exactly did search ranking work, technically and organizationally? <em><a href="https://moz.com/blog/long-click-and-the-quality-of-search-success">The Long Click</a>. </em></p><p>61:40 - Google ran 20+ experiments to figure out the best shade of blue on the Search page. This might seem silly, but it helps at scale, since it could potentially find the shade that would help the most colorblind individuals.</p><p>67:50 - Hate speech from Google search, and the ethical quandaries around building a humanity scale system.</p><p>70:30 - Improving iteration speed and developer productivity for these systems</p><p>71:50 - Google had an ML model for search results back in 2004 that was competitive with the hand-built systems, but didn’t end up using it, due to the lack of understandability. This has definitely changed now. <em>I had read that document during my internship, but was surprised to learn that Google had a working ML model for ranking since 2004.</em></p><p>73:30 - Service Oriented Architecture at Google. Enabled GWS from C to C++ and divest itself from some responsibilities. But Google stuck with a monorepo, compared to Amazon.</p><p>76:40 - Components in the Monorepo + Blaze (<a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a>) helped Google scale build times and reduce iteration speed. <em>Components is the most interesting piece, since to my understanding, it hasn’t been written about much externally.</em></p><p>78:00 - The scale and complexity of the monorepo.</p><p>79:40 - The 400,000 line Makefile, and the start of Blaze.</p><p>82:00 - What were the benefits of “Components”?</p><p>84:00 - The project to multi-thread GWS, when it was serving 5 - 10 billion search queries a day. It started off as a practical joke.</p><p>91:00 - It’s rarely only about the technology. It’s about culture and team cohesion.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>It's been a decade since danah boy introduced me to the idea of "email sabbaticals." That's when you go away and turn off your email.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2010/12/08/i-am-offline-on-email-sabbatical-from-december-9-january-12.html">http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2010/12/08/i-am-offline-on-email-sabbatical-from-december-9-january-12.html</a></p>
<p>Not just setting an out-of-office message, but rather deleting all inbound mail and asking correspondents to try again after the break. In her message, boyd explains to those correspondents who know how to reach her mother that this is the only way to reach her.</p>
<p>Here's the rationale: if you allow email to pile up while you're trying to unwind, it'll take months to catch up on when you get back, and you'll immediately burn out, incinerating all the value you got out of your break.</p>
<p>What's more, you'll still fail to clear the backlog – you'll have to declare "email bankruptcy" and fail everyone who'd contacted you anyway. It's a bad deal for you <em>and</em> for the people who email you during your break.</p>
<p>Here's how boyd's email sabbaticals work: six months prior, she informs her collaborators that she'll be taking some protracted downtime; a month before she confirms her commitments to collaborators and composes a checklist to ensure that she meets them prior to departure.</p>
<p>A week in advance, she warns everyone again that she's going offline and shuttering her inboxes. Close family members and her network administrator are given instructions for reaching her while on break, but no one else is.</p>
<p>She leaves, and shuts down her email. She knows she's going to miss new, time-sensitive stuff, but makes peace with it. In return, she gets the peace of mind that comes from knowing that she's going to come home to an empty in-box.</p>
<p>At the close of business today, I'm going on email (and work) sabbatical until Jan 4, 2021. Apart from one live event (the remote Chaos Communications Congress on Dec 27) I won't be accepting emails and I won't be replying to DMs or other messages.</p>
<p><a href="https://rc3.world/">https://rc3.world/</a></p>
<p>I really, really need it.</p>
<p>Over the years, many people have expressed their admiration at my "productivity" – but the dirty secret of that productivity is that work is how I cope with stress.</p>
<p>It's not the worst problem to have: I wrote a whole novel since the crisis, while also launching four books and keeping up with my day-job at EFF.</p>
<p>But working to cope with stress has its limits. It's a good temporary fix, but it's no long-term solution.</p>
<p>For one thing, I've got a serious, untreatable, degenerating chronic pain condition, and working is how I hope with the pain, too – distraction works far better than any prescription meds for me.</p>
<p>But ignoring your body's pain signals is a dangerous tactic. It's why I'm now experiencing the worst continuous pain of my adult life (it's been a stressful year). Last week it was so bad I was walking with a cane.</p>
<p>I say all of this not to humblebrag about my commitment to my work, but rather in the interests of transparency. I'm keenly aware that we live our own blooper reels and everyone else's highlight reels.</p>
<p>I'm grateful for my work habits, truly – but they come at a really high cost, and balancing work-as-distraction and work-as-pathology is really, really hard. If you're wondering how to do what I do, have a little peek into the blooper reel, first.</p>
<p>It's been a high-stress, crazy year. We nearly went broke, then had a spectacular recovery (thank you, Kickstarter backers!), have tried our best to be good parents (with varying degrees of success). We've gone through blazing rows and many sleepless nights.</p>
<p>I've spent most of the year with sores at the corners of my mouth, which I only get under in the most extreme times of stress.</p>
<p>And we've had it <em>good</em>. We're solvent, safe, and healthy. Thinking about what this would be like if any of those changed is terrifying.</p>
<p>Hanging out with my digital community is a huge net benefit to me, but unplugging from that community is something I increasingly value as I head towards my 50th birthday next July.</p>
<p>My first digital community experience was sending IMs to other users of the timeshare mainframe we plugged into when I was six years old, in 1977, when my dad brought home an acoustic coupler and my mom found 1,000' of brown paper towel to feed into the teletype.</p>
<p>Some (most) of my life's most important relationships, friendships, and discussions have taken place over this medium, and an enormous amount of that good stuff started with a conversation with a stranger.</p>
<p>I never felt the outrage that attended the introduction of the telephone into Edwardian England: "Anyone — any wild fool off the street — could simply barge bellowing into one's office or home, preceded only by the ringing of a telephone bell."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mit.edu/hacker/part1.html">https://www.mit.edu/hacker/part1.html</a></p>
<p>For me, finding my people (and being found by them) has been the highlight of my half-century. Touring and speaking turned these digital relationships into personal ones.</p>
<p>But: moderation in all things. I'm writing four of these threads this morning, doing a couple interviews and meetings, and then putting my lid down until 2021 (save for a brief dial-in to CCC on the 27th).</p>
<p>I'm going to swim in our lovely outdoor public pool, which, thankfully, has figured out how to remain open during the pandemic. I'm going read in the backyard hammock and hike in Griffith Park.</p>
<p>I'm not going to answer – or accept – email while I'm gone.</p>
<p>And I say all of this because it's taken a decade for me to really understand what danah was getting at (she's a very smart person and I often benefit from reflecting on our conversations).</p>
<p>And also, to show you a bit of the blooper reel. Coping strategies are great and necessary, but they're no substitute for addressing the underlying problems. I'm proud of the work I do, but I'm also still learning how to do it right.</p>

<p>I'm about to go offline until 2021 and I had planned to do <em>absolutely no work of any sort</em> while on break, but I made an exception, for an exceptional opportunity: the 32nd Chaos Communications Congress, which is remote this year.</p>
<p><a href="https://rc3.world/">https://rc3.world/</a></p>
<p>CCC is – notoriously – held during Christmas week, which means that the attendees are limited to people who either care about tech policy and security more than their families, or people who can talk their families into coming along.</p>
<p>It's one of the best events I've ever attended (I brought my family along). My talk at that event, "The Coming War on General Purpose Computing," has had a long afterlife, in large part because of the kind and thoughtful reactions of the attendees.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUEvRyemKSg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUEvRyemKSg</a></p>
<p>I've been trying to get back ever since but haven't managed it – until this year. RC3 (the first all-remote CCC) has invited me to speak on Dec 27.</p>
<p>I'm doing two back-to-back events: a talk called "What the cyberoptimists got wrong – and what to do about it" then a "fireside chat" (a reading from my book ATTACK SURFACE followed by a Q&amp;A;).</p>
<p>They're back-to-back, starting at 10AM Pacific (7PM CET) and running to 12/9PM.</p>
<p>The tickets are currently sold out, but they've mooted releasing another block. If you're attending, I hope you'll consider tuning into my talk (and of course, as with all CCC talks, these will be online shortly thereafter for public viewing).</p>

<p>The Panama Papers, the Paradise Papers, Swissleaks, Luxembourg Leaks, the Fincen Files – the past decade has been filled with financial secrecy scandals wherein we learned how the world's worst people hide the world's dirtiest money.</p>
<p>Governments have fallen as a result of these leaks. Journalists have been murdered for reporting them, whistleblowers have been imprisoned for telling the truth. These are a high-stakes window on the corruption, self-dealing and viciousness of the 1% and their criminal pals.</p>
<p>One critical revelation is the role that "onshort-offshore" plays in money-laundering: rich countries with a reputation for a strong rule of law and good governance are the lynchpin of global financial secrecy, thanks to lax corporate enforcement.</p>
<p>Money laundering, tax-evasion, bribery and other finance crimes were only possible because places like New Zealand, the City of London, Scotland, and US tax-havens like Delaware, Nevada and Wyoming knowingly abetted them.</p>
<p>Anti-financial-secrecy campaigners have made major progress in shutting down onshore-offshore havens, and now they've scored a massive victory in the USA, with the inclusion of an anti-money-laundering amendment to the defense bill.</p>

<p>It's a must-pass bill, and there's always intense jockeying to attach other legislation to it, virtually guaranteeing its passage (this is not always a good thing: Trump wants terrible, dangerous changes to internet law included in the bill):</p>

<p>The Corporate Transparency Act requires that all US companies report their true owners to the US Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (Fincen). This will make Fincen investigations vastly cheaper…and more effective.</p>
<p>It's got strong bipartisan support, and is the culmination of a decade of debate, consultation and coalition-building. It passed the House and Senate with a nominally …</p></div></article></div>

						<p>According to <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-12/uarl-asf121720.php">an announcement in EurekAlert</a>!, The U.S. Army has been researching with Duke University a technological approach that uses robotics and "biohybrid" muscle elements.</p><p>Army researchers claim that robotic systems filled with muscle tissue will deliver a new level of agility and flexibility. In order to maximize efficiency, biohybrid robotics incorporates living organisms into mechanical systems. The team's first applications are legged platforms similar to the LLAMA and Marine Corps Legged Squad Support System (LS3), the legged locomotive and movement adaptation device of the Army.</p><p>"Though impressive in their own right, today's robots are deployed to serve a limited purpose then are retrieved some minutes later," said research scientist Dr. Dean Culver, "ARL wants robots to be versatile teammates capable of going anywhere soldiers can and more, adapting to the needs of any given situation." Culver added, "Organisms outperform engineered robots in so many ways. Why not use biological components to achieve those remarkable capabilities?"</p><figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580835239846-5bb9ce03c8c3?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDl8fHJvYm90fGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" alt="Humanoid robot Robotis Bioloid with the hands in the air, cheering." srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580835239846-5bb9ce03c8c3?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDl8fHJvYm90fGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580835239846-5bb9ce03c8c3?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDl8fHJvYm90fGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580835239846-5bb9ce03c8c3?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDl8fHJvYm90fGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580835239846-5bb9ce03c8c3?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDl8fHJvYm90fGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@anilinverse?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Adam Lukomski</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>In addition, a separate team from Duke University will focus on the characteristics of macroscopic performance of muscles, tendons and ligaments in skiping animals using legged robots.</p><p>The muscle tissue is excellent for generating a certain mechanical strength, and its flexibility is unrivaled in today's robotic service. The research could show the bio-hybrid engineering community how to grow strong muscular tissue instead of extracting it from a trained organism in addition to providing insight into the mesomechanics that control motor protein movement.</p><p>"Muscle tissue is outstanding at producing a specific amount of mechanical power at a given moment," says Culver, "and its versatility is unrivaled in robotic actuation today."</p>

Instead it supposedly prioritized senior administrators who are working from home. I’m sure there’s some truth to the algorithm biasing allocation to those who are older but whenever I see someone blame an algorithm my spidey-sense goes off. The algorithm in this case was likely some extremely simple calculation in Excel that could have been easily verified by a human - both before it was run as well as a quick analysis of the results.</p>

<p>When writing software we write unit tests to test the functionality of our code and that could have easily been applied here. Similarly, when we deploy code we ask what do we expect to see and then confirm the results. This didn’t happen here and it required residents actually raising the issue to the administration.</p>

<p>The cynical view is that this was intentionally done by the administration to prioritize the vaccines for themselves. If no one complained they’d get the vaccine. If there were complaints they’d just blame the algorithm. I wouldn’t be surprised if that’s what happened here. In any case, as the entire world moves to software we really need to stop blaming the algorithm and instead blame the authors and approvers.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">

<!-- google_ad_section_start --> <!-- Hey, it can't hurt! -->
<h2><a name="2020-12-19" href="http://boston.conman.org/2020/12/19">Saturday, Debtember 19, 2020</a></h2>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" name="2020-12-19.2" href="http://boston.conman.org/2020/12/19.2">LPEG vs. PEG—they both have their strengths and weaknesses</a></h3>

<!-- LPEG, PEG, parsing expression grammar, programming, tradeoffs -->

<p>While the <a href="https://www.piumarta.com/software/peg/">C <abbr title="Parsing Expression Grammar">PEG</abbr> library</a> is <a href="http://boston.conman.org/2020/12/19.1">faster and uses less memory</a> than <a href="http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg/"><abbr title="Lua Parsing Expression Grammar">LPEG</abbr></a>,
I still prefer using <abbr title="Lua Parsing Expression Grammar">LPEG</abbr>,
because it's so much <em>easier</em> to use than the C <abbr title="Parsing Expression Grammar">PEG</abbr> library.
Yes,
there's a learning curve to using <abbr title="Lua Parsing Expression Grammar">LPEG</abbr>,
but its <a href="http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg/re.html">re module</a> uses a similar syntax to the C <abbr title="Parsing Expression Grammar">PEG</abbr> library,
and it's easier to read and write when starting out.
Another difference is that <abbr title="Lua Parsing Expression Grammar">LPEG</abbr> practically requires all the input to parse as a single string,
whereas the C <abbr title="Parsing Expression Grammar">PEG</abbr> can do that,
it can also read data from a file
(you <em>can</em> stream data to <abbr title="Lua Parsing Expression Grammar">LPEG</abbr>,
but it involves more work—check out the difference between 
<a href="https://github.com/spc476/LPeg-Parsers/blob/master/json.lua">a <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr> parser that takes the entire input as a string</a> versus 
<a href="https://github.com/spc476/LPeg-Parsers/blob/master/jsons.lua">a <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr> parser that can stream data</a>;
the later is nearly twice the size of the former).</p>

<p>The code isn't <em>that</em> much different.
Here's a simple <abbr title="Lua Parsing Expression Grammar">LPEG</abbr> parser that will parse text like “34.12.1.444”
(a silly but simple example):</p>

<pre title="Lua">local re   = require "re"

return re.compile(
  [[
    tumbler &lt;- number ( '.' number)*
    number  &lt;- [0-9]+ -&gt; pnum
  ]],
  {
    pnum = function(c) print("&gt;&gt;&gt; " .. c) end,
  }
)
</pre>


<p>Not bad.
And here's the C <abbr title="Parsing Expression Grammar">PEG</abbr> version:</p>

<pre title="PEG">tumbler &lt;- number ('.' number)*
number	&lt;- &lt; [0-9]+ &gt; { printf("&gt;&gt;&gt; %*s\n",yyleng,yytext); }
</pre>


<p>Again,
not terrible and similar to the <abbr title="Lua Parsing Expression Grammar">LPEG</abbr> version.</p>

<p>The major difference between the two,
however,
is in their use.
In the <abbr title="Lua Parsing Expression Grammar">LPEG</abbr> version, <code>tumbler</code> can be used in <em>other</em> <abbr title="Lua Parsing Expression Grammar">LPEG</abbr> expressions.
If I needed to parse something like “34.12.1.444:text/plain; charset=utf-8”,
I can do that:</p>

<pre title="Lua">local re = require "re"

return re.compile(
  [[
    example &lt;- %tumbler SP* ':' SP* %mimetype
    SP      &lt;- ' ' / '\t'
  ]],
  {
    tumbler  = require "tumbler",
    mimetype = require "org.conman.parsers.mimetype",
  }
)
</pre>


<p>The same <em>cannot</em> be said for the C <abbr title="Parsing Expression Grammar">PEG</abbr> version.
It's just not written to support such use.
If I need to parse text like “32.12.1.444” and mimetypes,
then I have to modify the parser to support it all—there's no easy way to combine different parsers.</p>

<p>That said,
I would still use the C <abbr title="Parsing Expression Grammar">PEG</abbr> library,
but only when memory <em>or</em> performance is an issue.
It certainly won't be because of convenience.</p>

<p>While exploring D recently, I remembered a game I played while at university 15 years ago. For a long time, I couldn’t remember the name at all, only that it was from a Japanese developer.

<p>What better project than try to compile a <strong>D v0.110</strong> project in a modern version of D and possibly porting the game to WebAssembly+WebGL! So here we are…</p>
<h2 id="switching-from-ant-to-dub">Switching from Ant to DUB</h2>
<p>The game used Ant and its <code>build.xml</code> file to generate the executable, resources, etc. Since then, D added DUB as a build system / package manager so let’s use that!</p>

However, <a href="https://forum.dlang.org/post/rec3d1$toc$1@digitalmars.com">thanks to Walter Bright</a>, I got a link to the <a href="https://www.digitalmars.com/ctg/ctgNumerics.html#comparisons">original documentation from Digital Mars</a>.

                <p>I am proud to present my latest project - the Astropanel.</p>

<p>This program will help you decide when you should bring out your telescope.</p>

<p>Feature list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Weather forecast for the next 9 days with coloring (red/yellow/green) based
on your limits for cloud cover, humidity, temperature and wind</li>
  <li>Easy graphic representation of when the Sun, Moon and planets are visible
with the Moon’s phase showing in how light the representing bar is</li>
  <li>Extra information for each day: Fog, wind gust speed, dew point temperature,
air pressure, UV Index, Sun and Moon precise rise and set and Moon phase.
The Moon phase is expressed as a number between 0 and 100 where 50 is the
full moon.</li>
  <li>Astronomical events for each of the 9 days, with option to list them in one
view</li>
  <li>Starchart showing in the terminal for the selected day and time of day</li>
  <li>A table showing RA, Dec, distance, rise, set and transit for the planets</li>

    <article>
  <p>
    I planned to rewrite <a href="https://css-doodle.com/">css-doodle</a> from scratch a long time ago, but there's barely any progress.
    One reason is that I wanted to make it too perfect but was stuck at the part of parsing all the time.
    Another reason is creating new things was more attractive to me than tools building whenever
    I got some time or inspiration.
  </p>
  <!--more-->

  <p>
    I then changed my mind recently, instead of rewriting from scratch, making improvement little by little seems to be more promising.
    There have been many updates for the past month to give css-doodle a new look. I'd like to share those exciting new features.
  </p>

  <h2>.export()</h2>
  <p>
    Screenshot at client side has always been a hard problem if it's not SVG or canvas.
    Unfortunately, the most commonly used <a href="https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas">html2canvas</a> does not work well for Web Components.
    For a long time I thought using a command line tool with <a href="https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer">Puppeteer</a> was the best solution
    I could find.
  </p>

  <p>
    Until I learned about the SVG <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/foreignObject">&lt;foreignObject&gt;</a>
    the other day, which can embed HTML inside it to make the whole thing a valid SVG. So I put everything of Shadow DOM
    generated by css-doodle into &lt;foreignObject&gt;, and then using canvas to get the SVG image data. Problem sovled!
  </p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;svg</span> <span>xmlns=</span><span>"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;foreignObject</span> <span>width=</span><span>"100%"</span> <span>height=</span><span>"100%"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;!-- css-doodle code --&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/foreignObject&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/svg&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

  <p>
    Thanks to SVG, keep <code>viewBox</code> to the actual element size, increase the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>
    will get large dimensions of the image. That's extremely useful for print purpose.
  </p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;svg</span> <span>viewBox=</span><span>"0 0 600 600"</span> <span>width=</span><span>"8000px"</span> <span>height=</span><span>"8000px"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

  <p>
    The <code>.export()</code> API uses this technique and wraps everything up, it will export css-doodle as an image right in the browser.
    See example and all the options <a href="https://css-doodle.com/#js-api-export">here</a>.
  </p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>let</span> <span>doodle</span> <span>=</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>css-doodle</span><span>'</span><span>)</span>

<span>doodle</span><span>.</span><span>export</span><span>({</span>
  <span>scale</span><span>:</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span>
  <span>download</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span>
<span>})</span></code></pre></figure>

  <h2>@doodle()</h2>
  <p>
    Since css-doodle can be exported as an image now, why not to generate image from code on the fly inside itself?
    Properties like <code>background</code>, <code>border-image</code> and <code>mask</code> all accepts image data as value.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's just an idea at first but soon proved to be the right direction to open up a new dimension.
  </p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>backgrund</span><span>:</span> <span>@doodle</span><span>(</span>
  <span>@</span><span>grid</span><span>:</span> <span>5</span> <span>/</span> <span>100%</span><span>;</span>
  <span>background</span><span>:</span> <span>@p</span><span>(</span><span>#000</span><span>,</span> <span>#fff</span><span>);</span>
<span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

  <h3>Issues with background patterns before</h3>

  <p>
    To fill as many space of background as possible, creating more DOM elements might be an option.
    The max number of elements css-doodle can make is 1024. Even if there's enough of them,
    the performance gets worse as the number of elements increases.
  </p>

  <p>
    There also lacks a way to transform background in CSS like <code>patternTransform</code> does in SVG,
    which makes it difficult to create some classic patterns by tiling, like <a href="https://twitter.com/yuanchuan23/status/1182614601319403521">this one</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>How @doodle() solves the issues</h3>

  <p>
    We build the tiling fragment with css-doodle as background image. Together with <code>background-size</code> and <code>background-repeat</code>,
    only one element is needed to fill up the entire screen no mater how big it is. So it performs farely well.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <code>@doodle()</code> function can also be nested.
    It's possible to do any kinds of transformations with <code>transform</code> property,
    or applying any other styles to the image itself. Because everything inside <code>@doodle()</code> is image.
  </p>
  <p>
    No need to wait for the browser to support something like <code>background-transform</code> anymore.
  </p>

  <p>
    <css-doodle>
      @grid: 1 / 100% 180px;
      background: @doodle(
        :doodle {
          @grid: 1 / 2000px;
          transform: rotate(-135deg) scale(2);
        }
        background: @doodle(
          @grid: 6x1 / calc(100% + 1px);
          @size: calc(100% - 100% / @I * (@i - 1));
          position: absolute;
          border: 1px solid black;
          background: @pn(
            crimson, darkorange, gold,
            forestgreen, royalblue, rebeccapurple,
          );
        ) 0 / 18px 18px;
      );
    </css-doodle>
  </p>

  <p>
    Another quick example using <code>@doodle()</code>:
  </p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>@grid</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span> <span>/</span> <span>100%</span> <span>180px</span><span>;</span>
<span>background</span><span>:</span> <span>@doodle</span><span>(</span>

    <span>border-radius</span><span>:</span> <span>2</span><span>px</span><span>;</span>
    <span>background</span><span>:</span> <span>@pn</span><span>(</span>
      <span>crimson</span><span>,</span> <span>darkorange</span><span>,</span> <span>gold</span><span>,</span> <span>royalblue</span>
    <span>);</span>
  <span>);</span>
<span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

  <p>
    <css-doodle>
      @grid: 1 / 100% 180px;
      background: @doodle(
        :doodle {
          @grid: 1 / 2000px;
          transform: rotate(45deg) scale(1.5);
        }
        background-size: 20px 20px;
        background-image: @doodle(
          @grid: 2 / 100%;
          transform: scale(.84, .6) skewY(@pn(±37deg));
          border-radius: 2px;
          background: @pn(
           crimson, darkorange, gold, royalblue
          );
        );
      );
    </css-doodle>
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm quite excited about this function. Can't wait to build tons of background patterns using css-doodle!
  </p>

  <h2>@shape()</h2>
  <p>
    This is another exciting function! It will generate a <code>polygon()</code> in string used by <code>clip-path</code>.
    For example, to make a hexagon:
  </p>

  <div>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>clip-path</span><span>:</span> <span>@shape</span><span>(</span>
  <span>split</span><span>:</span> <span>6</span><span>;</span>
<span>);</span></code></pre></figure>
    <css-doodle>
      @grid: 1 / 80px;
      background: #000;
      clip-path: @shape(
        split: 6;
      );
    </css-doodle>
  </div>


  <p>
    Rotate it by <code>30</code> degree and scale it down:
  </p>

  <div>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>clip-path</span><span>:</span> <span>@shape</span><span>(</span>
  <span>split</span><span>:</span> <span>6</span><span>;</span>
  <span>rotate</span><span>:</span> <span>30</span><span>;</span>
  <span>scale</span><span>:</span> <span>.</span><span>5</span><span>;</span>
<span>);</span></code></pre></figure>
    <css-doodle>
      @grid: 1 / 80px;
      background: #000;
      clip-path: @shape(
        split: 6;
        rotate: 30;
        scale: .5;
      );
    </css-doodle>
  </div>

  <p> If the <code>split</code> value is big enough it approximately to be a circle.</p>

  <div>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>clip-path</span><span>:</span> <span>@shape</span><span>(</span>
  <span>split</span><span>:</span> <span>100</span><span>;</span>
<span>);</span></code></pre></figure>
    <css-doodle>
      @grid: 1 / 80px;
      background: #000;
      clip-path: @shape(
        split: 100;
      );
    </css-doodle>
  </div>

  <p>
    The <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are defined with trigonometric functions.
    The <code>t</code> stands for <code>Theta</code>, each of them equals <code>360 / split</code> degree.
  </p>

  <div>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>clip-path</span><span>:</span> <span>@shape</span><span>(</span>
  <span>split</span><span>:</span> <span>800</span><span>;</span>
  <span>rotate</span><span>:</span> <span>90</span><span>;</span>
  <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>sin</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>sin</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>cos</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>t</span><span>);</span>
  <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>cos</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>cos</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>sin</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>);</span>
<span>);</span></code></pre></figure>
    <css-doodle>
      @grid: 1 / 80px;
      background: #000;
      clip-path: @shape(
        split: 800;
        rotate: 90;
        scale: .9;
        x: sin(2t) * sin(2t) * cos(5t);
        y: cos(5t) * cos(5t) * sin(t);
      );
    </css-doodle>
  </div>

  <p>
    As you may have noticed, <code>2t</code> means <code>2 * t</code>,
    it's much shorter this way to follow common notation in mathematics.
    All the Math functions including the symbol <code>π</code> can be used
    directly.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can also define variables if the expressions are too long.
  </p>

  <div>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>clip-path</span><span>:</span> <span>@shape</span><span>(</span>
  <span>split</span><span>:</span> <span>800</span><span>;</span>
  <span>scale</span><span>:</span> <span>.</span><span>5</span><span>;</span>
  <span>k</span><span>:</span> <span>π</span> <span>-</span> <span>7</span><span>t</span><span>;</span>
  <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>cos</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>cos</span><span>(</span><span>k</span><span>);</span>
  <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>sin</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>sin</span><span>(</span><span>k</span><span>);</span>
<span>);</span></code></pre></figure>
     <css-doodle>
      @grid: 1 / 80px;
      background: #000;
      clip-path: @shape(
        split: 800;
        scale: .5;
        k: π - 7t;
        x: cos(2t) + cos(k);
        y: sin(2t) + sin(k);
      );
    </css-doodle>
  </div>

  <p>
    I hope the above examples explain well to the <code>@shape()</code> function.
    There are countless shapes waiting for you to explore!
  </p>

  <h2>Other updates</h2>

  <p>The <code>@m</code> function behaves like the normal <code>for</code> loop but much readable, now it accepts two nested iterations.
  See the <a href="https://codepen.io/yuanchuan/pen/qBadmyR">demo</a>.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>box-shadow</span><span>:</span> <span>@m9x8</span><span>(</span>

<span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

  <p>
    By default the output values are separated with commas.
    An uppercase <code>@M</code> alias is added to make the values seperated with spaces.
  </p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>filter</span><span>:</span> <span>@M5</span><span>(</span>
  <span>drop-shadow</span><span>(</span><span>/*... */</span><span>)</span>
<span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

  <h2>What's next</h2>

  <p>
    There remains a lot work to be done,
    such as documentation, the new paser, tests and performance improvement.
    And I still have several new ideas that haven't been implemented yet.
    Only wish I had more time.
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s easy to make your mind rigid and ignore other things when you stick to one thing for too long.
    Maybe it's time to try something else other than CSS.
    So while waiting for CSS to evolve, I'll put part of my energy to new things.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thanks to everyone who supports css-doodle via <a href="https://opencollective.com/css-doodle#backers">open collective</a> and who sent me the encouraging words.

    <p>To understand the role of harmonics, microtones and consonance in Indian Classical music, it is necessary to understand its underlying tuning systems. In this article, we reconstruct two significant tuning systems used in Indian Classical music:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>The first is a 22 note scale whose earliest reference is due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharata_Muni">Bharat</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natya_Shastra">Natya Shastra</a> and which was later documented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9A%C4%81r%E1%B9%85gadeva">Sarang Dev</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangita_Ratnakara">Sangeet Ratnakar</a>. Note that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dattilam">Dattilam</a> by <strong>Dattila</strong>, a contemporary or possibly earlier work compared to Natya Shastra, also refers to a division of an octave into 22 notes.</li>
        <li>The second is a 12 note scale first devised by <strong>Ramamatya</strong> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svaramelakalanidhi">Svaramelakalanidhi</a> and which was later documented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venkatamakhin">Venkatamakhin</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaturdandiprakashika">Chaturdanda Prakasika</a>.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>In a couple of related articles, we cover how tuning systems influence <a href="https://puretones.sadharani.com/musicalscales/">musical scales</a> and how this affects the <a href="https://puretones.sadharani.com/tanpuraworking/">tuning of a Tanpura</a> to play these scales.</p>
    
    <h2>Basic Intervals and Ratios</h2>
    <p>Before we begin reconstructing any tuning system, it is useful to familiarize ourselves with the four basic intervals of <em>Dviguna</em> (octave), <em>Pancham</em> (fifth), <em>Madhyam</em> (fourth) and <em>Gandhar</em> (major third). You can play and check these intervals using the keyboard below (just click or tap a key to play). Here <strong>Sa</strong> denotes the fundamental and <strong>Ga, ma, Pa</strong> and <strong>SA</strong> denote the Gandhar, Madhyam, Pancham and Dviguna respectively. Note that <strong>Sa</strong> is taken to be the pitch <strong>C</strong>, but the other notes do not match up with today's standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_equal_temperament">12 tone equally tempered scale</a>.</p>

    <center><em>Demo 1. Basic Intervals</em></center>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> This article features several audio samples which are an integral part of the narrative. For ease of understanding, these samples have been presented in the form of a musical keyboard which many would recognize. Simply click or tap a key to play. Please try and use a pair of headphones or good quality speakers to listen to the samples with maximum clarity.</p>

    <p>As you can hear from Demo 1, Pancham, Madhyam and Gandhar are pleasant sounding intervals. For the musically inclined, they may be easy to recognise by ear. It is also possible to determine their frequency ratios in relation to the fundamental.</p>
        
    <p>One way in which this can be done is by comparing lengths. Firstly, we can observe that the pitch of a string is inversely proportional to its vibrating length. Secondly, taking a certain string length to represent the fundamental, we can observe that if we touch the string at a third of its length from one end and pluck the remaining two-thirds, it results in the string sounding the fifth. Similarly, touching it at a fourth of its length from one end results in the remaining three-fourths to sound the fourth, touching it at a fifth of its length results in the major third, and touching it at the midpoint results in either half to sound the octave.</p>
    
    <p>So by inverting these string lengths, we can infer that with <strong>Sa = 1</strong>, we have <strong>SA = 2, Pa = 3/2, ma = 4/3</strong> and <strong>Ga = 5/4</strong>. Try and remember these frequency ratios, as we will use them repeatedly.</p>

    <h2>Sama Gana Scale</h2>

    <p>The first scale we will examine is the <em>Sama Gana</em> scale which was used to sing passages from the <em>Sama Veda</em>. Folk music or informal music was always around in India. But Indian music started to get formalized as the chants of <em>Rig Veda</em> evolved into a more sing-song way of rendering passages from Sama Veda. Rig Vedic chants already used three notes called <em>Svarita</em> (neutral drone), <em>Udaatta</em> (higher note) and <em>Anudaatta</em> (lower note). This evolved further in Sama Gana.</p>
        
    <p>Sama Gana is the act of singing the Sama Veda. According to Ustad Zia Fariduddin Dagar, a typical arrangement employed three groups of singers with one group singing at the pitch <strong>Sa</strong>, the second at <strong>ma</strong> and the third at <strong>Pa</strong>. Each group in turn used three notes, a center note, a low note and a high note, similar to those used in Rig Vedic chants. The center note was whichever pitch they were singing, <em>i.e.,</em> Sa, ma or Pa. The high note was higher than the center note by a specific tone and the low note was lower than the center note by the same tone. Refer to Demo 2 below.</p>

          <h3>A traditional rendition of Sama Gana</h3>
          <p>Observe how the different groups stop and start chanting at appropriate points during the rendition, so that overall it creates an impression of a musical scale. Also, please note that this rendition is roughly in the scale of G.</p>

    <p>Knowing the Pa and ma intervals, it is possible to derive the <strong>ma-Pa</strong> interval. For the musically inclined, you may be able to recognise it by ear. The size of the ma-Pa interval can be calculated as <strong>3/2 ÷ 4/3 = 9/8</strong>. This ma-Pa interval was used as the tone to derive the high and low notes from the center note. Note that the ma-Pa interval is different from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_second">whole tone</a> used in today's standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_equal_temperament">12 tone equally tempered scale</a>. The whole tone is 200 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cent_(music)">cents</a> wide, while the ma-Pa interval is a bit wider at 203.9 cents.</p>

    <p>Using this, the Sama Gana scale as depicted in Table 1 can be derived. The method of derivation is given in the remarks column. The Sama Gana scale is discussed and documented in a number of references (for example, see <em>Lakshanagrandhas in Music</em> by Dr. Bhagyalekshmy).</p>

    <center><em>Demo 3. Sama Gana Scale</em></center>

    

    <p>In this scale, the intervals Re-ga and Dha-ni were regarded as <em>Vivadi</em> (dissonant). The concept of Vivadi notes is mentioned in Dattilam and Sangeet Ratnakar (see Chapter Sangita Ratnakara in Lakshanagrandhas in Music or Chapter Nada, Sruti and Svara in Sangeet Ratnakar, Part 1). The size of these intervals can be calculated to be <strong>32/27 ÷ 9/8 = 256/243 = 1.053497942</strong>. This interval \(\frac{256}{243}\) was recognized and known as <strong>Purna Shruti</strong>. Note that the Purna Shruti is roughly comparable to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone">semi-tone</a> used in today's standard 12 tone equally tempered scale. The standard semi-tone is 100 cents wide, while the Re-ga interval is a bit narrower at 90.2 cents. This scale may have been appropriate for chanting, but as a musical scale, it was not considered appropriate. In order to make it musical, the musical scholars of the day felt that the Re-ga and Dha-ni intervals needed to be slightly increased.</p>

    <h2>Shadaj Gram (from Sama Gana Scale)</h2>

    <p>The Shadaj Gram scale is cited as a 7 note scale and also as a 22 note scale (which includes the original 7 notes). Let us reconstruct the 7 note scale first.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Like the Shadaj Gram scale, an equally important scale called <strong>Madhyam Gram</strong> is also described by Bharat and by Sarang Dev. Later, we will note specifically how it differs from Shadaj Gram.</p>

    <p>There are two ways in which Shadaj Gram can be understood. The first is to understand it as a derivative of the Sama Gana scale, to make it more musical by adjusting the Vivadi intervals of Re-ga and Dha-ni. The second is to understand it in terms of <strong>Shruti Intervals</strong> as specified by Bharat and Sarang Dev. Let us look at both explanations and see how they are mutually consistent.</p>

    <p>First, we have to re-trace the line of reasoning that might have been employed by the musical scholars of the day to derive the Shadaj Gram scale from the Sama Gana scale. There are two options to fix the dissonant Re-ga and Dha-ni intervals:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Increase the pitch of ga and ni slightly.</li>
        <li>Decrease the pitch of Re and Dha slightly.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The first option would result in losing the consonance between ma and ni (ni is the fourth of ma in Sama Gana scale), while the second option would result in losing the consonance between Re and Pa (Pa is the fourth of Re). We know that they chose the second option since Bharat and Sarang Dev have pointed out that Re and Pa are not consonant in Shadaj Gram.</p>

    <p>Let us try and determine specifically by how much Re and Dha were reduced in pitch. Look at the notes from ma to SA in Sama Gana scale (Demo 3). Look at the relationship between ma and Dha and note that the interval ma-Dha is a bit wider than the Gandhar (major third) interval (Demo 1). The ma-Dha interval consists of the ma-Pa interval applied twice. You can try to hear Demo 1 and Demo 3 and see how two ma-Pa intervals combined (407.8 cents) are bigger than a Gandhar interval (386.3 cents). In contrast, in today's standard 12 tone equally tempered scale, two whole tones (i.e 2 x 200 cents) is exactly equal to a major third (400 cents).</p>
        
    <p>In Shadaj Gram, the note Dha from Sama Gana scale was reduced in pitch to Dha<strong>♭</strong> to maintain the Gandhar interval with respect to ma. The note Re from Sama Gana scale was reduced by a similar amount in pitch to Re<strong>♭</strong> so that the Re<strong>♭</strong>-Dha<strong>♭</strong> interval was maintained to be the Pancham.</p>
    
    <p>Before we analyse this any further, hear for yourself what this scale sounds like using Demo 4 below. The keyboard may look a bit unusual, particularly the keys for Re<strong>♭</strong> and Dha<strong>♭</strong>. But it has been depicted this way to …</p></section></div>

	<div>
		
<p>Aside from always having a verb at the end, Japanese does not depend on sequence.  Japanese is a grammar defined by <em>grammar particles</em>, functional “words” that glue on to nouns to indicate what purpose the noun serves.</p>



<p>Here we highlight some common Japanese particles in a slice of the ひらがな [hiragana] syllabary.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1069" height="834" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/japanese-particles.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>You can practice your 🎵 listening comprehension👂 of the ひらがな 🎎 <a href="http://japanesecomplete.com/hiragana">here</a>.  But we digress, Japanese relies on <em>grammatical particles</em> to indicate the <strong>who, what, when,  where, and how</strong> of a sentence.</p>



<h2><strong>Who, what, when, where, and how</strong>.</h2>



<h2>で  (de) <strong>where and how</strong></h2>



<p>For example, で [“deh”] implies <em>manner of accomplishment</em> or <em>setting-locality where something takes place.</em> Mapping to English, we cover the <strong>where</strong> [setting] and <strong>how</strong> [means] with で。</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="246" height="142" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-4.34.24-PM.png" alt=""></figure>



<hr>



<h2>に (ni) where and when</h2>



<p>For destinations, or specific times, or precise physical points of existence (being), Japanese relies on the use of the <em>grammatical particle</em> に [“ni” as in, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIV4poUZAQo">“we are the knights who say…”</a>].  に [“knee!”] therefore covers <strong>where</strong> [destination] and <strong>when</strong> [moment].</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="648" height="446" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-4.36.55-PM.png" alt=""></figure>



<hr>



<h2>が  (ga) who and what</h2>



<p>The <em>grammatical particle</em> が [“ga”] is used to explain <strong>who</strong> and <strong>what</strong> when used as the <strong>grammatical subjects</strong> of a sentence.  </p>



<p>For example: Vegetables are delicious.  Candy is sweet.<br>  (Veggies are <strong>what</strong> is delicious)<br>  (The candy is <strong>what</strong> is sweet)</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="366" height="295" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-4.38.46-PM.png" alt=""></figure>



<hr>



<p>Finally, in this brief primer, we want to show the concept of <strong>bunsetsu jar</strong> which we have featured on our <a href="http://japanesecomplete.com/reverse-engineer/">“Reverse Engineer Some Japanese”</a> page.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="737" height="138" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-4.41.05-PM.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>Within a <strong>bunsetsu jar</strong>, we place a noun and cap off the <strong>jar</strong> with a <strong>lid</strong> containing a <em>grammatical particle</em> such as が、に、で or one of the many others.  </p>



<p>In total, there is an estimated 233 + particles (some are multi-mora, that is, multiple letters) and we teach them in a gradual and comprehensible way in <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/?p=83">Japanese Complete</a>.</p>



<p>Finally, a sentence-final verb is placed at the end of a sentence.  In English, this would be akin to moving the “is/are” or “be/exists” verb to the end of every sentence.  Japanese fun is.  Grammar easy is.  Japanese-about thinking = interesting is.</p>



<p>So that’s it. You pick your nouns, you pick the <em>grammatical particles</em> to match based on the meaning of <strong>who, what, when, where, and how</strong>, and you figure out the sentence-final verb element.  Now you’re thinking in Japanese.</p>



<p>Of course, developing the reflex and intuition around this takes some practice, which is why we devised quizzes for Japanese Complete that help train your intuition on the particles, one-by-one.  You can watch a brief video showing some of the quizzes in action on our <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/guide">free guide page</a>.</p>

<h2>Kanji in English Context</h2>



<p>In order to accelerate Kanji comprehension into English context, as you can see in a sonnet by Shakespeare on <a href="http://japanesecomplete.com/learning-to-read">this page</a>.  This pattern follows a similar pattern of adoption that native Japanese took: grab kanji from mainland Asia for their ideographic value and smash them together with your native syllabary to add helpful meaning, nuance, and context.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="496" height="177" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-4.46.27-PM.png" alt=""></figure>



<p><strong>Temple NI arrive.</strong> [unstated subjects arrive to the temple]</p>



<p><strong>Enter-before NI, hands OH let’s wash, NE.</strong> [before entering, let’s wash our hands, right?]</p>



<p>We’ve created a substack newsletter to share <em>Kanji in English Context </em>once or twice a month, you can <a href="https://japanesecomplete.substack.com/p/coming-soon">sign up for it here</a> if you’re interested in getting interesting <em>Kanji in English Context</em> lessons to your inbox.</p>



<hr>



<p>One great thing about Japanese grammar is that the <strong>bunsetsu jars</strong> can be arranged in any sequence before the final verb, provided each noun has its appropriately matching <em>grammar particle</em> glued on and intact.  This leads to great fun with parsing, as one can create a <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/?p=811">rudimentary Japanese grammar parser</a> from a 5-line EBNF grammar.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1080" height="1349" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/osaka-castle.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>Hopefully this post made the inner mechanics of Japanese more clear.  Developing intuition and unlocking the language takes study, practice, and determination!  If you’re looking for a program to break the language down logically <strong>and</strong> provide practice and training to help your newfound understanding become intuitive and fast, might we humbly suggest <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/">Japanese Complete</a>.</p>
