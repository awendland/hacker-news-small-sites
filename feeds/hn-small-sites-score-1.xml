Meanwhile, SIGMA Corporation, a&nbsp;Japanese family company, combined in a&nbsp;remarkable way modern technologies with a&nbsp;traditional approach to doing business. This management model has perfectly proven its worth during the current crisis.</p><div><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__6"><mark>POLSKOJĘZYCZNA WERSJA TEGO ARTYKUŁU » » »</mark></p><div><div><p><span><span>Tomasz Kulas <span>PL</span></span>, <span>Kazuto Yamaki </span></span></p><p>W ostatnich latach najpopularniejszą receptą na pojawiające się niespodziewane wyzwania stało się zwinne zarządzanie, wzorowane na nowoczesnych firmach ery cyfrowej. Tymczasem japońska firma rodzinna SIGMA Corporation w&nbsp;niezwykły sposób połączyła zaawansowane technologie z&nbsp;tradycyjnym podejściem do prowadzenia biznesu. Ten model zarządzania doskonale sprawdził się podczas obecnego kryzysu.</p></div><a href="https://www.ican.pl/a/DTqxlEZNz"><picture><img src="https://cdn.ican.pl/minimized/v2/360xAxA/reader-files/book/PQqjAvKR9/DTqxlEZNz/39/cover.jpg"></picture></a></div></div><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__9">Even before I&nbsp;took over management from my father, SIGMA faced an enormous challenge of rising manufacturing costs. When we were launching our operations, manufacturing in Japan was relatively cheap compared to other countries, thus we could produce everything we wanted at home – and export our products at competitive prices abroad. However, along with the rise of standard of living in Japan, production costs have also been rising. This is why in the 90s almost all Japanese manufacturers of photography equipment decided to relocate manufacturing abroad.</p><figure data-resource-id="RXrRoI5RCAwtB" data-id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__A"><div href="https://cdn.ican.pl/f/res-minimized/RXrRoI5RCAwtB/1607959888/qgMd47upElbJX4rfHXLSKtVq6jIrXdpY.jpg" data-lightbox="5ffebfe19ebf5" data-title="<div class=&quot;figcaption_content&quot;></div>"><picture><img src="https://cdn.ican.pl/f/res-minimized/RXrRoI5RCAwtB/1607959888/qgMd47upElbJX4rfHXLSKtVq6jIrXdpY.jpg" title="" alt="The Path of the Little Samurai"></picture></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__B"><em><span>Indeks górny <strong>Kazuto Yamaki</strong>, CEO, SIGMA Corporation. Indeks górny koniec</span></em></p><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__F">At that time, SIGMA owned one factory only, located in Japan, in Fukushima Prefecture. We made a&nbsp;key decision then that production should stay at home. This is why we began to look for a&nbsp;solution that would still make it profitable. One of possible solutions would be to try to further lower radically the production costs, while another one would be to markedly raise the quality of our products, which would allow us to sell them at higher prices.&nbsp; We chose the second option, and I&nbsp;made all the employees aware that it’s the only way for SIGMA to survive.</p><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__H"><em>In fact, I&nbsp;believe I&nbsp;have been lucky, as essentially we had no choice and there was nothing to think about. The thing was simple – product quality improvement was a&nbsp;must, if SIGMA was to survive.</em>&nbsp;<em>There was no other option.</em></p><h2 id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__2Y">Culture of engagement </h2><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__L">The one wonderful thing handed over to me by my father was the culture of collaboration within the company. All, really all of the employees understood what changes needed to be introduced and worked with high commitment to execute this new, quality‑based course of company development. I&nbsp;believe that also now, when many of our competitors can afford to offer their products at lower prices, as they have lower production costs, what distinguishes us is the level of commitment of our employees. They identify incredibly strongly with the company, while being at the same time really passionate about photography and about what they are doing.</p><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__M">This difference may not be obvious to everybody, but it is key for us and determines our competitive advantage. If you are passionate about photography and manufacture photography equipment, at the same time to a&nbsp;highest possible degree you know what your customers need – as they are passionate about the same thing. This is the foundation on which we build customers’ trust for our company. To our advantage, it is impossible to launch production of highest class lenses overnight, as it requires not only the best technologies, but also many years of experience. This experience and commitment constitute our advantages and I&nbsp;believe, although of course I&nbsp;cannot be sure of that, that in spite of radical external changes that have taken place recently, they will allow us to continue operating under the current business model.</p><h2 id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__2Z">Resilience in the times of crisis </h2><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__O">Many company CEOs are currently facing the challenge of falling employee commitment. These CEOs are treated by these employees as “outside people” – professional managers whose task is about efficient management, no matter whom they manage and what&nbsp;the company does. However, my path was different, as I&nbsp;didn’t just take over the company from my father and didn’t just begin managing it.</p><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__Q"><em>Right after graduation, I&nbsp;began to work at&nbsp; SIGMA&nbsp;at various different positions and in different departments – and it took almost twenty years.</em></p><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__S">At that time, I&nbsp;met most of the people in various operational areas – designers, engineers, factory workers, business development, marketing and sales people. Of key importance was the fact that when I&nbsp;became the CEO, I&nbsp;already knew the people who worked there – and they knew me. Many of them, for that matter, have worked in a&nbsp;company for a&nbsp;dozen or a&nbsp;few dozen years.</p><div><h3 id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__U">What does SIGMA Corporation do </h3><div><figure data-resource-id="R3WDWqaCWgAk3" data-id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__V"><div href="https://cdn.ican.pl/f/res-minimized/R3WDWqaCWgAk3/1607959888/LtSolsFPkutnuWbxILvU3dM57NyPlZQd.jpg" data-lightbox="5ffebfe1a03d4" data-title="<div class=&quot;figcaption_content&quot;></div>"><picture><img src="https://cdn.ican.pl/f/res-minimized/R3WDWqaCWgAk3/1607959888/LtSolsFPkutnuWbxILvU3dM57NyPlZQd.jpg" title="" alt="The Path of the Little Samurai"></picture></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__W">SIGMA Corporation is a&nbsp;Japanese family company, known first of all as one of the major global camera lens manufacturers. It also makes digital cameras, flash lamps and other photography accessories, but it’s the lenses for the photo and video interchangeable‑lens cameras constitute its core business. It&nbsp;was founded in 1961 by Michihiro Yamaki, and since 2012 its CEO and owner has been his son, Kazuto Yamaki.</p><figure data-resource-id="R2vuVZQ7kFZ9d" data-id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__X"><div href="https://cdn.ican.pl/f/res-minimized/R2vuVZQ7kFZ9d/1607959889/1dU52bYZ0v03IquPigz4WvYdvEb1pv6o.jpg" data-lightbox="5ffebfe1a153f" data-title="<div class=&quot;figcaption_content&quot;></div>"><picture><img src="https://cdn.ican.pl/f/res-minimized/R2vuVZQ7kFZ9d/1607959889/1dU52bYZ0v03IquPigz4WvYdvEb1pv6o.jpg" title="" alt="The Path of the Little Samurai"></picture></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__Y">Currently, the company employs 1,725 persons, with annual turnover (as of August 2019) at ca. PLN 1.4 billion. Company headquarters is located in the suburbs of Tokyo. The entire manufacturing is also located in Japan – in SIGMA‑owned Aizu factory, located in a&nbsp;small town of Bandai. Outside Japan, the company owns subsidiaries operating in North America, China, France, Hong Kong, Benelux countries, Germany and the UK. SIGMA Corporation products are officially sold and distributed in over 70 countries.</p></div><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__Z">I&nbsp;believe that, for that matter, this is where the advantage of family companies is. Since being a&nbsp;kid I&nbsp;had been learning and growing into the organization, as our apartment was located on the last floor of the headquarters building of our company. <strong>Since being six‑seven years old, I&nbsp;had been meeting in a&nbsp;natural way many people who had worked at SIGMA</strong>, and my life was developing along with the growth of the company. This is why it was something natural that when I&nbsp;took over the management, employees tried as hard as they could to help me in performing the new role and in further growing the company.</p><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__11">This traditional, family‑based managerial model turned out, in recent months, very resilient against the challenges the pandemic brought. In spite of SIGMA being a&nbsp;global operation, we are a&nbsp;relatively small company, thus it has been easier for individual people to understand the threats we are being faced with – and commit even more to helping the company and other co‑workers.</p><figure data-resource-id="RCQjHUyFdLfkh" data-id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__12"><div href="https://cdn.ican.pl/f/res-minimized/RCQjHUyFdLfkh/1607959889/2LT1u5yj0xYhOujlip44SUH9weZKigkU.jpg" data-lightbox="5ffebfe1a28a0" data-title="<div class=&quot;figcaption_content&quot;></div>"><picture><img src="https://cdn.ican.pl/f/res-minimized/RCQjHUyFdLfkh/1607959889/2LT1u5yj0xYhOujlip44SUH9weZKigkU.jpg" title="" alt="The Path of the Little Samurai"></picture></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__13">In April 2020, we asked most of the employees (except, of course, those who worked in the factory) to begin working remotely – and almost 80% began working from home. Thus, our company, just like others, was challenged with maintaining good levels of internal communication. <strong>This is when I&nbsp;began to send messages to all the employees</strong> – about the present condition of the company, the situation on the market, how advanced individual projects are. In October, we began to admit a&nbsp;possibility of returning to the office, as many teams – the engineering ones in particular – wanted to go back to working this way. In spite of this, daily messages that I&nbsp;send via the internal blog of the company, are being continued – and I&nbsp;still try to provide as much information about the state of the company as possible.</p><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__16"><em>I&nbsp;believe that&nbsp;good organizational culture is an underlying foundation of innovation, this is why I&nbsp;attach great importance to it.</em></p><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__18">Fortunately, exceptional cases aside, I&nbsp;do not notice any fall in engagement among employees. This might also be caused by the fact that each new product we launched this year on the market has been very well received. Such positive feedback from the market undoubtedly also helps sustain motivation in the entire team in a&nbsp;situation when I&nbsp;am unable – during remote work – to fully commit to all the co‑workers.</p><h2 id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__30">Global company, involved locally </h2><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__1A">Another element which undoubtedly has an impact on a&nbsp;high&nbsp; level of engagement is our care about the local community. First of all, naturally, it’s about SIGMA employees, who simultaneously belong to the local community. We are a&nbsp;small company and we cannot afford big actions aimed at improving the situation globally, but we still do all our might for a&nbsp;company of that size. First, we care about our customers, our employees and our local community. If we can take care of them, take care of their happiness, it spreads through them all around the world. I&nbsp;believe that if we won’t be able to take care about the local community, we won’t be able to do this for people in other regions of the world.</p><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__1B">It is particularly important in current times – the only thing that will help us survive the difficult situation related with the pandemic is efficient teamwork of content, happy, loyal and engaged employees. This is also the second reason – except betting on the quality of equipment we manufacture – for which we are not planning to move production abroad. We want, as long as&nbsp; possible, to take care of our employees, as opening a&nbsp;factory somewhere with lower production costs would probably mean not only higher profits for the company, but also a&nbsp;necessity to lay off many people from the home factory. We don’t want to allow for that to happen, we feel responsible for those people.</p><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__1D"><em>For that matter, when speaking of “Japanese quality”, I&nbsp;do not mean any singular, unique traits of our nation. I&nbsp;mean individual people, who have experience in lens manufacturing – as it is still partly an “analog” production process.</em></p><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__1F">We can quite easily transfer the technology behind manufacturing of our equipment, experience, however, is a&nbsp;quality that you cannot transfer so simply and easily – in spite of very advanced automation and digitization of our manufacturing processes. They still contain many stages where it is the “human factor” that counts the most. …</p></div></div></div></div>

                <div>
                    <p>I started using Signal 5 years ago as I became increasingly conscious of my data footprint. Around the same time, I closed my Facebook and Instagram accounts, and later, my Google Account.</p><h2 id="the-problem-with-signal">The problem with Signal</h2><p>Signal makes it very difficult, and in most cases, impossible, for one to back up, export, or migrate message data. The Signal team insists these restrictions are meant to protect users’ privacy. However, backup and migration policies differ for each official Signal client and sometimes contradict each other.</p><p>For example, while iOS offers no official backups process, Android backups are built into the app. At the same time, iOS users can migrate their data to a new device (as long as their phone number hasn’t changed), but this is impossible on Android. Meanwhile, decrypting messages from the desktop client is trivial, but linking one’s phone and desktop client only syncs messages forward in time.</p><h2 id="why-export-signal-s-message-history">Why export Signal's message history</h2><p>Because it’s my fucking data.</p><p>The road to exporting my data was long, frustrating and filled with dead ends – it took over a year to get here. What's paradoxical is that someone else's phone turned out to be the key to my data. </p><p>In recent years, I moved most of my conversations to Signal, including those with family and close friends. Shortly after we started dating, I asked my partner to switch to Signal, and we’ve used it exclusively ever since. At some point, I thought it would be nice to export our conversation history – a sort of time capsule of our relationship. “Easy,” I thought. I was wrong.</p><p>Since we started dating, I had switched from a OnePlus 2 to an iPhone XS Max. And since migrating from Android to iOS isn’t possible, part of our conversation history was locked on my old phone. Jailbreaking the iPhone was out of the question since my version of iOS had not been jailbreaken. The Signal Desktop client could have offered an easy avenue to decrypt our chat history, but there was a period of several months during which I had not linked my iPhone to the Signal desktop client.</p><p>I opened a <a href="https://community.signalusers.org/t/ios-backups-through-the-desktop-client/8123">thread about this in the Signal Community Forum</a> in June of 2019. It quickly became apparent that backing up my Signal data would be an uphill battle. </p><p>Luckily, my partner had an iPhone 7, which she recently replaced with a company phone. Her old iPhone contained our entire message history in one place and was easy to jailbreak. Jackpot.</p><p>One important lesson I learned during this process:<strong> to ensure access to your conversation history, install the Desktop client and link it to your mobile device as soon as you start using Signal. </strong>The Signal database and encryption key are both accessible on your computer, allowing for easy decryption. Linking the desktop client later will only sync messages forward in time from the moment the devices are linked.</p><h2 id="tips-to-increase-your-chances-of-exporting-your-signal-database">Tips to increase your chances of exporting your Signal database</h2><p>If you haven’t linked the desktop client and extracting the iOS database is your only option, this guide is for you. If you've decided to embark upon this journey, here's some advice. </p><h3 id="stop-updating-ios">Stop updating iOS</h3><p>Your best chance of jailbreaking iOS is on older firmware versions. Turn off automatic updates and decline prompts to update iOS.</p><h3 id="backup-shsh-blobs-with-every-new-ios-update">Backup SHSH blobs with every new iOS update</h3><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHSH_blob">SHSH blobs</a> are the digital signatures that Apple generates and uses to personalize iOS firmware files for each iOS device. Apple only signs firmware updates for a limited time after release. Having these signatures handy allows one to install versions of iOS after Apple stops signing them – like when a jailbreak becomes available for that version. In some cases, you may be able to downgrade iOS to a previous version.</p><p>Backup SHSH blobs every time Apple releases a new version of iOS (e.g., 14.0, 14.1, 14.1.1). I personally use the <a href="https://github.com/airsquared/blobsaver">blobsaver</a> app, but <a href="https://tsssaver.1conan.com/v2/">TSS Saver</a> is a popular alternative.</p><h3 id="learn-about-jailbreaking-and-stay-up-to-date-on-developments">Learn about jailbreaking and stay up to date on developments</h3><p>Developers and hackers are constantly working to break the security of iOS, and new methods to jailbreak iPhones are frequently made public. Stay informed on jailbreak releases by following the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/">/r/jailbreak subreddit</a>.</p><p>This <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11DABHIIqwYQKj1L83AK9ywk_hYMjEkcaxpIg6phbTf0/edit#gid=1014970938">exhaustive list of jailbreak compatibility</a> by device and iOS version is also a great resource.</p><p>It's also useful to understand the difference between <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Untethered_jailbreak">untethered</a>, <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Semi-untethered_jailbreak">semi-untethered</a>, <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Semi-tethered_jailbreak">semi-tethered</a>, and <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Tethered_jailbreak">tethered</a> jailbreaks.</p><h3 id="recognize-that-this-may-not-work">Recognize that this may not work</h3><p>Depending on your iPhone, you might never be able to jailbreak it or extract Signals decryption key from the iOS Keychain. Apple is making it increasingly difficult to jailbreak iOS devices – improvements to hardware and software are leaving fewer cracks for hackers to exploit.</p><p>Ok, let's get our hands dirty. </p><h2 id="how-to-maybe-backup-signal-for-iphone">How to (maybe) backup Signal for iPhone </h2><p>This guide explains how I was able to backup and extract data from Signal's encrypted SQLite database on an iPhone 7 with iOS 13.6.1. </p><h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites </h3><ul><li>Physical access to the iPhone with Signal still installed</li><li>An original iPhone cable</li><li>A Mac or Linux computer</li><li>Patience and a bit of luck</li></ul><p>Shell environments will be differentiated as such. </p><pre><code>// Host machine

// iPhone 
root# &lt;command&gt;</code></pre><h3 id="step-1-jailbreak-ios">Step 1: Jailbreak iOS</h3><p>For iOS 13.6.1 on an iPhone 7, I used <strong>checkra1n</strong> which offers a straight forward semi-tethered jailbreak. Depending on the iPhone device and version of iOS, a jailbreak may or may not be available. </p><p>See this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11DABHIIqwYQKj1L83AK9ywk_hYMjEkcaxpIg6phbTf0/edit#gid=1014970938">updated list of iOS jailbreaks</a> for device compatibility and instructions. </p><h3 id="step-2-ssh-into-the-iphone">Step 2: SSH into the iPhone </h3><p>Cydia usually comes with OpenSSH installed and enabled, allowing shell access over IP or USB. If SSH access isn't activated, launch Cydia and install OpenSSH. </p><p><strong>As always, the root password on iOS is <code>alpine</code>.</strong></p><p>If the iPhone and the host machine are on the same network, SSH into the phone using its IP address. It may be found in the phone's WiFi settings. </p><pre><code>$ ssh root@[iphone ip] -p 22</code></pre><p>If SSH over the air isn't possible, USB may be an alternative. However, this involves enabling a proxy service on the host machine.</p><p>First, install <em><em>libimobiledevice</em></em> on the host machine. </p><pre><code>$ brew install libimobiledevice</code></pre><p>Then, edit <em><em>com.usbmux.iproxy.plist</em></em> and append the following XML to the file. </p><pre><code>$ nano ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.usbmux.iproxy.plist</code></pre><pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt;
&lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;dict&gt;
&lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;com.usbmux.iproxy&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;array&gt;
&lt;string&gt;/usr/local/bin/iproxy&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string&gt;2222&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string&gt;22&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/array&gt;
&lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;true/&gt;
&lt;key&gt;KeepAlive&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;true/&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;</code></pre><p>And finally, launch the proxy on the host machine. </p><pre><code>$ launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.usbmux.iproxy.plist</code></pre><p>It should now be possible to SSH into the iPhone over USB on port <code>2222</code>.</p><pre><code>$ ssh root@localhost -p 2222</code></pre><h3 id="step-3-install-required-packages">Step 3: Install required packages </h3><p>Once logged into to the iPhone's shell, install the following packages as they will come in handy. </p><pre><code>root# apt install zip unzip nano wget</code></pre><h3 id="step-4-backup-the-signal-data-directory">Step 4: Backup the Signal data directory</h3><p><strong>Locate Signal's data directory</strong></p><p>Much like macOS, iOS stores application data in a <em>Library</em>-like directory. In iOS&nbsp;13, its located here <code>/private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/</code>. </p><p>Signal's data directory contains the encrypted SQLite database file in <code>./grdb/signal.sqilte</code> and attachments, such as images and videos in <code>./Attachments</code>.</p><p>The data directory may be found by searching the filesystem for Signal's encrypted database file, <code>signal.sqlite</code>.</p><pre><code>root# find / -type f -iname "signal.sqlite"</code></pre><p>That should return something which looks like this:<br><code>/private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/01484069-3446-4CC0-8BE7-7464E7D08FDF/grdb/signal.sqlite</code> </p><p>The Signal directory is: <code>/private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/01484069-3446-4CC0-8BE7-7464E7D08FDF/</code></p><p><strong>Zip the Signal directory</strong></p><p>It is recommended to zip the entire directory, not only the database file, as it also contains images and other message attachments.

<section id="content" role="main">



<p>It is January 13th, 2021 as I finish writing these initial words. Major updates may get
a date stamp next to them.</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Someone</em> is sending the directory authorities (and fallback dirs) lots of
traffic.</li>
<li>This causes the dirauths to no longer be able to reliably communicate.</li>
<li>This means consensuses are no longer reliably produced every hour.</li>
<li>No new consensus three hours in a row means new connections to v3 onion
services stop working because of <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/issues/40237">a bug</a>.  Existing connections survive,
and no other part of Tor breaks at the three hour mark.</li>
<li>There is an <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/node/1969">alpha release</a> for <strong>experts who know what they are
doing</strong>.  It is making its way into all supported stable Tor versions.</li>
</ul>


<p>Please keep these facts in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>It is unknown if the traffic hitting the dirauths is maliciously
motivated</strong>. People keep calling it an <em>attack</em>. I don't think we have the
evidence to back that up at this time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>There is no evidence that the traffic overload is actively trying to hurt
v3 onions</strong>.  A <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/issues/33018">similar situation existed last year</a> and onions
didn't go down then. Claims that it is "the" government or rival drug markets
are not backed up with any evidence that I've seen.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>If you have evidence of who is behind this traffic, please let someone know.
<a href="https://support.torproject.org/get-in-touch/">Tor Project</a> or me
(blog comment, an email <small>(listed on <a href="https://matt.traudt.xyz/posts/about-me-6eKe2i5v/">About
Me</a>)</small>, or IRC message)</p>

<p><small>While I currently work on Tor-related stuff for my job, nothing contained in this
post has anything to do with my work. Everything contained in this post is public unclassified
knowledge. Opinions expressed, if any, are my own.</small></p>



<p>Roger points out on January 6th that
<a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2021-January/019201.html">"the overload is back"</a>.</p>

<p>It's not OMGWTFBBQ levels of traffic. It's not from one IP nor is it from IPs
all over the Internet. One dirauth says it <em>seems</em> to be a poorly written
custom Tor client requesting directory information too often.</p>



<p>On January 9th, 10th, and 11th, there are repeated instances of 3 or more
consensuses in a row that are not generated.</p>

<p>This is the trigger for v3 onions no longer working. Consensuses are generated
every hour and are valid for 3 hours. Most parts of Tor (v2 onions, general
circuit building, etc.) do not require a <em>live</em> (currently valid) consensus,
but can get by just fine with a recently valid consensus (expired less than 24
hours ago).</p>

<p>January 12th saw a few missed consensuses, but never 3 in a row. No consensus has been missed so far on the 13th.</p>



<p>The v3 onion service code was written to require a live consensus, and it didn't need to be (devs
are verifying this). The <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2021-January/045681.html">fix</a> for this <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/issues/40237">bug</a>
changes the requirement to just a recently valid consensus. It's getting tested
as I write these words on January 11th. The fix, or something very similar to
it, will be merged and backported in the coming days, at which point it's up to
the packagers for your OS or your tor-derived software (e.g. Tor Browser) to
notice the update and distribute it to you. I would expect Tor Browser to be updated very quickly.
Debian will probably take a day or two. Other distros, I have no idea.</p>

<p>If you're watching tor's logs, the current date includes "January" and "2021",
and you see the following message, then you have most likely hit the bug.</p>

<pre><code>Tried for 120 seconds to get a connection to [scrubbed]:6697. Giving up. (waiting for rendezvous desc)
</code></pre>

<p>The 6697 is <em>not</em> important. The "waiting for rendezvous desc" <em>is important</em>.</p>

<h2><a name="index1h2"></a>Status of the fix making it into Tor</h2>

<p>Primary sources for this section: <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/issues/40237">bug #40237</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Jan 12th: the fix is merged into 0.4.5.3-rc [<a href="https://blog.torproject.org/node/1969">blog post</a>]</li>
</ul>


<p>Upcoming events:</p>

<ul>
<li>backports to other supported versions of Tor</li>
<li>packaging</li>
</ul>




<p>On the 11th we
<a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-consensus-health/2021-January/011815.html">notice</a>
the fallback dirs are also failing.
This is major evidence in my opinion that this is not a purposeful attack on the dirauths. I, and at least two dirauths, think it is most likely a bad custom Tor client implementation that requests directory information too often.</p>

<p>We see the same failing of fallback dirs <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-consensus-health/2021-January/011840.html">on the 12th</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/dirbytes.html?start=2020-12-01&amp;end=2021-02-01">This graph</a> shows how the entire network is fielding more directory requests these days. <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/dirbytes.html?start=2019-10-01&amp;end=2021-02-01">This graph</a> shows more context for where load usually is. The 1.5 Gbit/s the dirauths saw for ~half of 2020 is talked about in <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/issues/33018">this ticket</a>.</p>

<p>An actual attack could disguise itself like this, but if this were an attack, I would expect it to be more consistently effective at preventing consensus generation.</p>



<p><em>(Last updated 15 Jan 2021)</em></p>

<p>The 14th saw no missing consensuses. If you had trouble reaching v3 onion services on the 14th, your issue is unrelated to the topic of this blog post.</p>

<p>The 15th so far has seen no missing consensuses.</p>



<h2><a name="index2h2"></a>What Tor relays/clients need to be updated?</h2>

<p>No relays need to be updated. Tor clients hosting v3 onion services and Tor clients wishing to visit v3 onion services will need to be updated when the fix is released.</p>

<h2><a name="index3h2"></a>How do I update my Tor?</h2>

<p><em>(Last updated 13 Jan 2021)</em></p>

<p>You don't yet, unless you're willing to compile and use a version of Tor that isn't considered stable yet.
If you're willing, then see <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/node/1969">https://blog.torproject.org/node/1969</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="index4h2"></a>Should we temporarily downgrade to v2 while waiting for a fix?</h2>

<p>If absolutely necessary, sure. Please keep in mind v2's issues (briefly described below in the glossary) and be aware that "temporary" probably means ~1 week (<em>crossing my fingers</em>). I personally will just suffer and wait for the fix to be released.</p>

<h2><a name="index5h2"></a>Are v3 onion services fundamentally broken?</h2>

<p>No.</p>

<h2><a name="index6h2"></a>Is this really major?</h2>

<p>Eh ... yes because of the impact, but no because the fix is easy and will be out quickly.</p>



<h2><a name="index7h2"></a>Directory authorities / dirauths</h2>

<p>There are 9 relays operated by highly trusted individuals that decide the state
of the network. They decide what relays are a part of the network and what
certain network parameters should be set to.</p>

<p>In a way they are a "single" point of failure and make the Tor network
"centralized." Decentralizing their role to 100s, 1000s, or every relay would:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>require massive fundamental changes to how Tor works. By itself this
probably is not a convincing reason to not do it.</p></li>
<li><p>open Tor up to new attacks it currently isn't vulnerable to. This should be
a bit more convincing. The keyword to Google for most of them is "Sybil".</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Having a "single" high quality root of trust is a valuable property that
"decentralize all the things!" people do not generally appreciate enough, in my
opinion.</p>

<p>You: <em>This v3 onion fix doesn't actually address the root problem: the dirauths weren't
able to communicate and create consensuses.</em></p>

<p>Yes! You are absolutely right that <em>something</em> about how the dirauths work should
change such that they can continue communicating with each other even in the
presence of malicious (purposefully malicious or not) traffic!
<a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/issues/40239">This ticket</a> is one idea and a good place to start your research
if I say nothing more and you want to research what is being done yourself.
They might also update <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/issues/33018">this ticket</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="index8h2"></a>V3 onion service</h2>

<p>The new type of onion service. Names are 56 characters long, like
tv54samlti22655ohq3oaswm64cwf7ulp6wzkjcvdla2hagqcu7uokid.onion. V2 onions are
16 characters long, like 3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion.</p>

<p>V2 onion services use old crypto and old protocols that are obsolete and
dangerous <em>now</em> or will be soon. The code for v2 is messy and the protocol is
not extensible. V2 onions are vulnerable to harvesting by malicious HSDirs, and these malicious HSDirs exist today (and are removed as soon as they are detected).
Support for v2 onion services will be removed from Tor soon. V3 onions are the
future despite the current events.</p>

<h2><a name="index9h2"></a>Fallback directory mirror / fallback dir</h2>

<p>Tor clients don't usually <em>directly</em> fetch consensus information from a dirauth
anymore. There's too many people using Tor and only 9 dirauths. Instead, a
large number of relays that are high quality have opted in to also be hardcoded
into Tor source code so clients can usually fetch consensus data from them on
first run. After first run and successful connection to Tor, clients get this
stuff from their guard instead.</p>

<h2><a name="index10h2"></a>Consensus</h2>

<p>The dirauths vote on what relays are currently in the network and what certain network
parameters should be set to. The "average" of their votes become the consensus.
They make a consensus every hour and each is valid for three hours. Clients typically
fetch a new consensus every two hours.</p>

<p>You can see information from the current consensus <a href="https://consensus-health.torproject.org/">here</a>. Recent consensuses
are archived <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/collector/recent/relay-descriptors/consensuses/">here</a>
and older ones archived <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/collector/archive/relay-descriptors/consensuses/">here</a>.</p>

<p>When the Zig project started, its audience was almost exclusively people with a lot of relevant experience, since those would be the only ones able to evaluate the promise and limits of the newborn language.</p>
<p>Today we’re at a point where Zig is becoming increasingly compelling for people coming from all layers of the stack. People have written <a href="https://github.com/Hejsil/mecha" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">parser combinators</a>, <a href="https://github.com/prime31/zig-gamekit" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">2d game rendering libraries</a>, <a href="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/futureproof/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a live editor for GPU shaders</a>, and much more. </p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong: all these projects have been developed by early adopters who wanted to try <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/buggy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a new and exciting</a> ecosystem. Zig is not yet stable, and won’t be for a while, but we’re getting there, and in the meantime Zig is already delivering big time on at least one promise: <strong>making it possible to learn more about programming without having to first buy into vast amounts of accidental complexity</strong>.</p>
<p>This redesign had two main goals and, as always, a few practical constraints. When it comes to constraints, it’s mostly my web design and project management skills, and the scope that can be addressed in no more than a couple of months, since we needed a new website <em>now</em> and not one year from now. Let’s now take a look at the goals.</p>
<h2 id="a-friendlier-first-impression"><a href="#a-friendlier-first-impression" aria-label="a friendlier first impression permalink"></a>A friendlier first impression</h2>
<p>The first goal addressed stems directly from the introduction of this blog post: we wanted to make the website more appealing to people that are looking at Zig as an opportunity to learn more about programming. For this reason, the lengthy breakdown has been moved to the Learn section and, in its place, we now have three short paragraphs that highlight some of Zig’s major features, followed by a code sample that gives you a first taste of the syntax. </p>
<p>Above the main introduction we still have the same slogan as before:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zig is a general-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining <strong>robust</strong>, <strong>optimal</strong>, and <strong>reusable</strong> software.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andrew did an outstanding job at formulating it and I believe it’s the one bit of the entire website that should probably never change.</p>
<p>Next to the slogan there’s a new cluster of buttons. This is where I wanted to come up with an interesting compromise: we follow the popular trend of putting a big call to action for new users, but we also use that block of space to create a single hotspot where regulars can get access to critical information. </p>

<p>My hope is for the big button to make new visitors become aware of that block and that, over time, checking there for docs and new releases just becomes muscle memory. That said, I know we’ll have to tweak the design once the auto-generated docs for the standard library become good enough for the front page.</p>
<p>Below everything I just described, we introduce the community and the Zig Software Foundation. The Zig project has grown to a point where governance matters and we want to show we’re doing everything the right way, up to the point of having formed a <a href="https://ziglang.org/zsf/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">nonprofit organization with a clear scope and mission statement</a>.</p>
<h2 id="internationalization"><a href="#internationalization" aria-label="internationalization permalink"></a>Internationalization</h2>
<p>The second goal of this redesign was to open the door to hosting multiple translations of the website. Having an i18n-enabled website is beneficial for multiple reasons: it helps with the first goal (i.e. help a wider range of programmers get started with Zig), it’s a good way of getting more use out of the informative materials we’ll progressively add to the website, and it’s also well aligned with the mission of the Zig Software Foundation. Lastly, I’m personally invested in the idea that we must ensure we don’t leave it to third parties to be the sole owners of all content available in a given language, as we’ve already seen bad actors exploit their position to implement a form of cultural arbitrage.</p>
<p>We’re well aware that keeping up with translations to multiple languages can quickly become an effort black hole. For this reason, I’ve tried to make sure the tooling would help in making the process as smooth as possible (more on that later), and I’ve also made sure to clarify in the design how translations are community-provided and thus best-effort.</p>

<p>At the moment of publication, the website can only offer <a href="https://ziglang.org/translations/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">an Italian translation</a> written by me. Italian was chosen out of necessity (i.e. it’s the only other language I speak), but it served the purpose of making me try out the ergonomics of producing a translation, and it can also act as documentation for others.</p>
<p>Finally, I should point out that there are some parts of the website we don’t plan to translate, like the News section, for example. This is another choice made out of necessity: we want to restrict translations to content with a long shelf life to reduce the amount of effort, but I don’t exclude that one day we might have enough resources to get rid of this compromise.</p>
<h2 id="implementation-details"><a href="#implementation-details" aria-label="implementation details permalink"></a>Implementation details</h2>
<p>The new website is statically generated by <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Hugo</a>. I also considered <a href="https://www.getzola.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Zola</a>, but its i18n support is not complete yet. The website lists a number of Zig code snippets, with relative output. Andrew originally implemented a program to produce release notes and language reference. That program takes in code samples, applies syntax highlighting, runs the code, and reports the output as HTML (it even retains colors from the terminal). I took the original code and packaged it as a tool with a more general interface. I called it <a href="https://github.com/kristoff-it/zig-doctest" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">zig-doctest</a> and it can be easily integrated with all kinds of static content generation tools.</p>
<p>Now a successful CI build of the <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ziglang/zig</a> repository triggers a build of the website, allowing us to catch outdated code examples much more easily. This addresses concerns raised in the past by people that would occasionally stumble upon a broken code sample.</p>
<p>Testing all code snippets is not instant as some tests include running the executable and capturing its output, so I made sure to integrate with Hugo’s caching system. I also noticed that Hugo processes tags sequentially within the same page, so I also <a href="https://github.com/kristoff-it/hugo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">added to it</a> a warmup routine that makes sure to parallelize the testing when loading the development server the first time.</p>
<p>The result is a very enjoyable development experience that only depends on Zig and two additional executables (Hugo and doctest) to be able to develop the Zig website locally, resulting in an acceptable experience for potential contributors. </p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="conclusion permalink"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope this post explains adequately the intent of this work and the practical limits of its execution. There’s still more work to do, but this seems a reasonable milestone for a first release, so I’m looking forward to working alongside the community to improve and add translations to the website.</p>
<p>For the next iteration I’ll work on improving accessibility, but first I have to focus on <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/track/zig_programming_language/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">FOSDEM, since we have a Zig dev room</a> and I have a bunch of duties to attend to. </p>
<p>When I first discovered Zig, I saw it as a way for me to learn more about all the aspects of programming I missed when working with interpreted and/or garbage-collected languages. Turns out I got to learn that <a href="https://ziglang.org/news/announcing-zig-software-foundation/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">and much more</a>, and I can’t tell you how excited I am about what’s to come. Despite everything, 2020 was a great year for Zig, and I fully expect 2021 to be even better.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Jubilee line used to run from Stanmore to Charing Cross, and was opened in May 1979. However Charing Cross was always supposed to be a temporary terminus, with the final destination of &nbsp;Cannon St Station. At the time it was called the Fleet Line, as it would pass under the Fleet River (now a <a href="http://www.guerrillaexploring.com/gesite/public_html/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=53:ges092-river-f-cso&amp;catid=53:draining&amp;Itemid=68">sewer</a>). There wasn't any money during the tough times of the late 1970's, only after the prosperous years under Thatcherism did money become available for the extension, and it was decided to take a different route, rather than to&nbsp; Ludgate Circus. The present Jubilee Line extension runs to Stratford. This meant that the line would run from Green Park to Westminster, bypassing Charing Cross. When the Jubilee Line Extension opened in November 1999, Charing Cross Jubilee Line Platforms became redundant. Many plans have been floated around, including a Jubilee Line Spur to Cannon St Station, as well as an extension of the Docklands Light Railway from Bank via also redundant Aldwych and into Charing Cross.</p>
<p>Of all the bits and pieces on the underground, here was always considered one of the toughest, along with <a href="http://www.guerrillaexploring.com/gesite/public_html/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=226:ges154-brtsh-museum-tube&amp;catid=52:metro&amp;Itemid=67">Museum station</a>. One access point tried by a number of people, would see a squad of cops arrive within seconds of breathing near it. Other options would have involved running down the tracks after service. And because this bit of the station is on a non-regular service branch line, it would be a 1000m run into what could be anything, a heritage train, service train, reversed train. All of which would leave the adventurous explorer smeared down the tunnel walls. Not a pretty site or way to go. GE077 loves his research, and had banded about a few possibilities. We'd looked at some of them, and they didn't seem possible. Eventually we happened to find a lid in a street not far away, that lead into a maze of cramped tunnels, carrying thick high voltage cables. A small gap existed that could get us into the vent shaft. It was so tight, that after GE077 managed to get through, I had to practically get naked to squeeze my longer body through. It's a scary moment when you are half way through and can't move back or forwards. I calmed down, and managed to twist up and down etc to get through.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.guerrillaexploring.com/gesite/public_html/images/guerrilla/GDS214/ges214-19.jpg" width="842" height="575"></p>
<p>Eventually we were in the huge shaft that lead into the heavens</p>
<p><img src="http://www.guerrillaexploring.com/gesite/public_html/images/guerrilla/DEV220/GES220-01.jpg"></p>
<p>One ladder down from the vent, there was a another steel ringed tunnel leading off to the Northern Line platforms ventilation grills. This was taken looking in from the shaft above.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.guerrillaexploring.com/gesite/public_html/images/guerrilla/DEV220/GES220-03.jpg"></p>
<p>Walking a bit further, the tunnel went up a slope. The light opposite the white brick stump, is where the shot above was taken. It's also the point where the tunnel changes from the bit with large pipes leading out of the main vent shaft, changes to the open one in the pic below.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.guerrillaexploring.com/gesite/public_html/images/guerrilla/DEV220/GES220-05.jpg"></p>
<p>Turning around from the pic above, there were a couple of floor grates and some electrical cabinets. This is looking down on to the Northern Line Platforms.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.guerrillaexploring.com/gesite/public_html/images/guerrilla/DEV220/GES220-04.jpg"></p>
<p>We walked back to the main vent shaft, and headed further down the shaft. The landing we walked from can just be seen at the top of the picture.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.guerrillaexploring.com/gesite/public_html/images/guerrilla/DEV220/GES220-06.jpg"></p>
<p>Turning around from the pic above, one sees the short ventilation tunnel, similar to many other stations. The lit up portals lead to grill openings above the disused Jubilee platforms.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.guerrillaexploring.com/gesite/public_html/images/guerrilla/DEV220/GES220-07.jpg"></p>
<p>Looking through one of the portals into a ventilation grill and the prize beyond. We had one stumbling block left, how to get down to the platforms. The only way would be to squeeze through the tiny opening on the side. That would leave the problem of getting down to the platform. Also the fact that the grill dropped onto the tracks, not the platform. We had with us a rope ladder to complete the job. We had to attach it to the grill and check it didn't touch the live rail. &nbsp;We also shook hands, if we were caught, the repercussions would be that we wouldn't be allowed to talk to each other. We'd had a pretty good ride, so it wasn't a sad moment.&nbsp; &nbsp;Going down the ladder first, I tried to go as quickly but stable as possible. Without risking hitting the rope tails of the ladder on the live rail. When down, I held the ladder over the platform for GE077. The remaining small problem was that the station is rigged with cctv cameras, including dome cameras, which would have been installed after the station closed. We gave each other 5-10mins to grab our shots and get the hell out.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.guerrillaexploring.com/gesite/public_html/images/guerrilla/DEV220/GES220-08.jpg"></p>
<p>I quickly ran up the steps to Trafalgar Square and Bakerloo line access, which would have been at the end of the this tunnel, instead one can see the white wall at the end. The Embankment sticker on the wall is a recent addition since closing.</p>

<p>Looking at the bottom of the steps/escalators above.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.guerrillaexploring.com/gesite/public_html/images/guerrilla/DEV220/GES220-11.jpg"></p>
<p>From the circulation area to the platforms. The Circulation area wasn't that long, certainly shorter than the platforms. Note the dome camera above the poster beneath the last strip light on the left.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.guerrillaexploring.com/gesite/public_html/images/guerrilla/DEV220/GES220-12.jpg"></p>
<p>A platform with the original station guide on the far wall, the Jubilee line extension runs from Green Park to Westminster now. Running up the tunnel at the top of the platforms would lead to Green Park.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.guerrillaexploring.com/gesite/public_html/images/guerrilla/DEV220/GES220-13.jpg"></p>

<p><img src="http://www.guerrillaexploring.com/gesite/public_html/images/guerrilla/DEV220/GES220-14.jpg"></p>
<p>Looking the other way up Platform 3, the tunnel at the top with the lights on is the overrun tunnel.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.guerrillaexploring.com/gesite/public_html/images/guerrilla/DEV220/GES220-15.jpg"></p>
<p>A shot inside the overrun tunnel, it bends round to the right after 20 odd metres. Sadly I figured it to risky to go have a look around the corner. It's said the tunnel runs to within a short distance of Aldwych (originally Strand station), however never linked up. Two full tube trains can be stabled here. (Trip 2 will cover this area more).</p>
<p><img src="http://www.guerrillaexploring.com/gesite/public_html/images/guerrilla/DEV220/GES220-16.jpg"></p>
<p>Looking back into the station from the overrun tunnel.</p>

<p>Looking down the escalators (of which there are 3 on this side, rather than 2 and a central set of steps on the Bakerloo side) from the above shot.</p>

<p>Having watched the latest James Bond flick a few months before coming here, I couldn't help but add a little nod to one of the scenes from Skyfall, which was filmed here.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.guerrillaexploring.com/gesite/public_html/images/guerrilla/DEV220/GES220-21.jpg"></p>
<p>And after this shot, I raced back to the platform. As I looked left and right, I couldn't see the rope ladder that GE077 had already left a few minutes earlier by. I thought briefly he'd done the dirty on me and left me stranded to await my fate. However after a few puzzling moments, realised I was on the wrong platform! It's confusing down here when everything is so symmetrical. &nbsp;I went to the correct platform, climbed back up and eventually got back to the street. Meeting up with GE077 some streets away. We were both wild that we'd pulled it off, and quickly left the area.</p>

		<p>How I removed google analytics and still have good data to analyze. It was just recently, that I opened my google analytics account and added it to this website. I wanted to get some insights, about my website’s visitors. But compared to the google search console, there was not much information interesting to me. </p>
<p>And actually I worried a little. Is it legal to just add analytics? analytics was easy to add, just adding a script tag into my page. In EU it is needed to inform the user about non essential cookies. Before setting one, it is needed to ask the users consent. However, analytics got added using a static html tag and there is no way to control what cookies are set immediately.</p>
<p>I was not sure if I should create that script tag dynamically after asking the user, using some client side javascript. and would analytics still work?</p>
<p>On the internet when searching for analytics without cookies there are many websites advising to use <code>motomo</code>. It is a very good solution made with php and mysql. But for my little blog setting up this server seem a little to much. Also because I would have to look that I keep it up do date and do some more security measures. For real production application, google analytics and <a href="https://matomo.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">motomo</a>, both will be a better choice recording lots of data you don’t know now you want to have in the future.</p>
<p>I added a little script into my website. Instead of cookies it uses local storage. local storage can not be used to track users across other websites. So I think this should comply with the law. Also in the storage there is nothing stored to identify the user.</p>

<p>On the server I just dump this information into a jsonl file, meaning one json log entry each line. It can easily be converted to csv for analyses via <code>excel</code>. Draw some charts or count per interval weekly and monthly interval. </p>

<p>Do you see, that I do not check if the browser supports the <code>fetch</code> API and modern arrow functions? I was thinking about it, and decided that I don’t need to care about old browser compatibility for this optional feature.</p>
<p>You see all the fields that are getting stored. These are what I came up with. That I think are interesting. To be honest, the API shown is not exactly the one running at tnickel.de, but the concept is this. On my running implementation I validate the received data, store urls and user agent string into a separate <a href="http://tnickel.de/2020/11/20/2020-11-rapid-prototyping-with-json-file-database/">json file database</a> and write the id into the log file. But with this example you can understand how you can implement the server side yourself.</p>
<p>As by chance: The dev.to community, was just asked about analytics tools. And I described my little solution. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dev.to/madza/what-web-analytics-tools-do-you-use-458o">comment</a> received a reply by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://charanj.it/">Charanjit Chana</a>, saying he is using a similar solution, here is what I found on his websites source code (it was minified, so I formatted it a little):</p>

<p>Seems as head of development he is interested in finding new developer talents for his team. I like the <code>allowToTrack</code> function used before the analytics request is made. This request then set a cookie, so multiple page views can be related to the same user and session. I don’t know about the rules in England after it left the EU, but I believe in Germany, an additional popup banner would be needed. Other than me, Charanjit is interested in the users screen resolution to know what to optimize the page for.</p>
<p>You now have seen two valid approaches to building the client side for collecting analytics information. With this article, I hope you find how how this website does analytics, without tracing the users all over the internet and even into their darkest dreams.</p>

January 14, 2021 | https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/inline-caching/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/inline-caching/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Inline caching is a popular technique for runtime optimization. It was first
introduced in 1984 in Deutsch &amp; Schiffman’s paper <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~palsberg/course/cs232/papers/DeutschSchiffman-popl84.pdf">Efficient implementation
of the smalltalk-80 system [PDF]</a> but has had a long-lasting legacy in
today’s dynamic language implementations. Runtimes like the Hotspot JVM, V8,
and SpiderMonkey use it to improve the performance of code written for those
virtual machines.</p>

<p>In this blog post, I will attempt to distill the essence of inline caching
using a small and relatively useless bytecode interpreter built solely for this
blog post. The caching strategy in this demo is a technique similar to the
ideas from <a href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/kps09/pdfs/brunthaler.pdf">Inline Caching meets Quickening [PDF]</a> in that it
caches function pointers instead of making use of a JIT compiler.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>In many compiled programming languages like C and C++, types and attribute
locations are known at compile time. This makes code like the following fast:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include "foo.h"
</span>
<span>Foo</span> <span>do_add</span><span>(</span><span>Foo</span> <span>left</span><span>,</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>right</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>left</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>right</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The compiler knows precisely what type <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> are (it’s <code>Foo</code>) and
also where the method <code>add</code> is in the executable. If the implementation is in
the header file, it may even be inlined and <code>do_add</code> may be optimized to a
single instruction. Check out the assembly from <code>objdump</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>0000000000401160 &lt;_Z6do_add3FooS_&gt;:
  401160:	48 83 ec 18          	sub    $0x18,%rsp
  401164:	89 7c 24 0c          	mov    %edi,0xc(%rsp)
  401168:	48 8d 7c 24 0c       	lea    0xc(%rsp),%rdi
  40116d:	e8 0e 00 00 00       	callq  401180 &lt;_ZN3Foo3addES_&gt;
  401172:	48 83 c4 18          	add    $0x18,%rsp
  401176:	c3                   	retq   
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>All it does is save the parameters to the stack, call <code>Foo::add</code>, and then
restore the stack.</p>

<p>In more dynamic programming languages, it is often impossible to determine at
runtime startup what type any given variable binding has. We’ll use Python as an
example to illustrate how dynamism makes this tricky, but this constraint is
broadly applicable to Ruby, JavaScript, etc.</p>

<p>Consider the following Python snippet:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>do_add</span><span>(</span><span>left</span><span>,</span> <span>right</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>left</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>right</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Due to Python’s various dynamic features, the compiler cannot in general know
what type <code>value</code> is and therefore what code to run when reading <code>left.add</code>.
This program will be compiled down to a couple Python bytecode instructions
that do a very generic <code>LOAD_METHOD</code>/<code>CALL_METHOD</code> operation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import dis
&gt;&gt;&gt; dis.dis("""
... def do_add(left, right):
...     return left.add(right)
... """)
[snip]
Disassembly of &lt;code object do_add at 0x7f0b40cf49d0, file "&lt;dis&gt;", line 2&gt;:
  3           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (left)
              2 LOAD_METHOD              0 (add)
              4 LOAD_FAST                1 (right)
              6 CALL_METHOD              1
              8 RETURN_VALUE

&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This <code>LOAD_METHOD</code> Python bytecode instruction is unlike the x86 <code>mov</code>
instruction in that <code>LOAD_METHOD</code> is not given an offset into <code>left</code>, but
instead is given the name <code>"add"</code>. It has to go and figure out how to read
<code>add</code> from <code>left</code>’s type — which could change from call to call.</p>

<p>In fact, even if the parameters were typed (which is a new feature in Python
3), the same code would be generated. Writing <code>left: Foo</code> means that <code>left</code> is a
<code>Foo</code> <em>or</em> a subclass.</p>

<p>This is not a simple process like “fetch the attribute at the given offset
specified by the type”. The runtime has to find out what kind of object <code>add</code>
is. Maybe it’s just a function, or maybe it’s a <code>property</code>, or maybe it’s some
custom descriptor protocol thing. There’s no way to just turn this into a
<code>mov</code>!</p>

<p>… or is there?</p>

<h2 id="runtime-type-information">Runtime type information</h2>

<p>Though dynamic runtimes do not know ahead of time what types variables have at
any given opcode, they do eventually find out <em>when the code is run</em>. The first
time someone calls <code>do_add</code>, <code>LOAD_METHOD</code> will go and look up the type of
<code>left</code>. It will use it to look up the attribute <code>add</code> and then throw the type
information away. But the second time someone calls <code>do_add</code>, the same thing
will happen. Why don’t runtimes store this information about the type and the
method and save the lookup work?</p>

<p>The thinking is “well, <code>left</code> could be any type of object — best not make any
assumptions about it.” While this is <em>technically</em> true, Deutsch &amp;
Schiffman find that “at a given point in code, the receiver is often the same
class as the receiver at the same point when the code was last executed”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> By <em>receiver</em>, they mean the thing from which the attribute is
being loaded. This is some Object-Oriented Programming terminology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is huge. This means that, even in this sea of dynamic behavior, humans
actually are not all that creative and tend to write functions that see only a
handful of types at a given location.</p>

<p>The Smalltalk-80 paper describes a runtime that takes advantage of this by
adding “inline caches” to functions. These inline caches keep track of variable
types seen at each point in the code, so that the runtime can make optimization
decisions with that information.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at how this could work in practice.</p>

<h2 id="a-small-example">A small example</h2>

<p>I put together a <a href="https://github.com/tekknolagi/icdemo">small stack machine</a> with only a few operations. There
are very minimal features to avoid distracting from the main focus: inline
caching. Extending this example would be an excellent exercise.</p>

<h3 id="objects-and-types">Objects and types</h3>

<p>The design of this runtime involves two types of objects (<code>int</code>s and <code>str</code>s).
Objects are implemented as a tagged union, but for the purposes of this blog
post the representation does not matter very much.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>enum</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>kInt</span><span>,</span>
  <span>kStr</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span> <span>ObjectType</span><span>;</span>

<span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>ObjectType</span> <span>type</span><span>;</span>
  <span>union</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>str_value</span><span>;</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>int_value</span><span>;</span>
  <span>};</span>
<span>}</span> <span>Object</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These types have methods on them, such as <code>add</code> and <code>print</code>. Method names are
represented with an enum (<code>Symbol</code>) though strings would work just as well.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>enum</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>kAdd</span><span>,</span>
  <span>kPrint</span><span>,</span>

  <span>kUnknownSymbol</span> <span>=</span> <span>kPrint</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span> <span>Symbol</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The representation of type information isn’t super important. Just know that
there is a function called <code>lookup_method</code> and that it is very slow. Eventually
we’ll want to cache its result.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Method</span> <span>lookup_method</span><span>(</span><span>ObjectType</span> <span>type</span><span>,</span> <span>Symbol</span> <span>name</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s see how we use these <code>lookup_method</code> in the interpreter.</p>

<h3 id="interpreter">Interpreter</h3>

<p>There’s no way to call these methods directly. For the purposes of this demo,
the only way to call these methods is through purpose-built opcodes. For
example, the opcode <code>ADD</code> takes two arguments. It looks up <code>kAdd</code> on the left
hand side and calls it. <code>PRINT</code> is similar.</p>

<p>There are only two other opcodes, <code>ARG</code> and <code>HALT</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>enum</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Load a value from the arguments array at index `arg'.</span>
  <span>ARG</span><span>,</span>
  <span>// Add stack[-2] + stack[-1].</span>
  <span>ADD</span><span>,</span>
  <span>// Pop the top of the stack and print it.</span>
  <span>PRINT</span><span>,</span>
  <span>// Halt the machine.</span>
  <span>HALT</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span> <span>Opcode</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Bytecode is represented by a series of opcode/argument pairs, each taking up
one byte. Only <code>ARG</code> needs an argument; the other instructions ignore theirs.</p>

<p>Let’s look at a sample program.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>byte</span> <span>bytecode</span><span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>/*0:*/</span> <span>ARG</span><span>,</span>   <span>0</span><span>,</span>
                   <span>/*2:*/</span> <span>ARG</span><span>,</span>   <span>1</span><span>,</span>
                   <span>/*4:*/</span> <span>ADD</span><span>,</span>   <span>0</span><span>,</span>
                   <span>/*6:*/</span> <span>PRINT</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>
                   <span>/*8:*/</span> <span>HALT</span><span>,</span>  <span>0</span><span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This program takes its two arguments, adds them together, prints the result,
and then halts the interpreter.</p>

<p>You may wonder, “how is it that there is an instruction for loading arguments
but no call instruction?” Well, the interpreter does not support calls. There
is only a top-level function, <code>eval_code</code>. It takes an object, evaluates its
bytecode with the given arguments, and returns. Extending the interpreter to
support function calls would be another good exercise.</p>

<p>The interpreter implementation is a fairly straightforward <code>switch</code> statement.
Notice that it takes a representation of a function-like thing (<code>Code</code>) and an
array of arguments. <code>nargs</code> is only used for bounds checking.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>char</span> <span>byte</span><span>;</span>

<p>Both <code>ADD</code> and <code>PRINT</code> make use of <code>lookup_method</code> to find out what function
pointer corresponds to the given <code>(type, symbol)</code> pair. Both opcodes throw away
the result. How sad. Let’s figure out how to save some of that data. Maybe we
can use the <code>caches</code> slot in <code>Code</code>.</p>

<h3 id="inline-caching-strategy">Inline caching strategy</h3>

<p>Since the Smalltalk-80 paper tells us that the receiver type is unlikely to
change from call to call at a given point in the bytecode, let’s cache <em>one</em>
method address per opcode. As with any cache, we’ll have to store both a key
(the object type) and a value (the method address).</p>

<p>There are several states that the cache could be in when entering the an
opcode:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>If it is empty</strong>, look up the method and store it in the cache using the
current type as a cache key. Use the cached value.</li>
  <li><strong>If it has an entry and the entry is for the current type</strong>, use the cached
value.</li>
  <li>Last, <strong>if it has an entry and the entry is for a different …</strong></li></ol></div></div>

							<p>Amazon puts obstacles in the way of consumers who wish to unsubscribe from its Amazon Prime service. Today the Norwegian Consumer Council filed a legal complaint against the company for breaches of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive.</p><p>In the process of unsubscribing from Amazon Prime, the company manipulates consumers to continue using the service in what seems like a deliberate attempt to confuse and frustrate customers.</p>
<p>The Norwegian Consumer Council`s <a href="https://fil.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/complaint-against-amazon-prime.pdf">legal complaint</a>&nbsp;to the Consumer Protection Authority highlights what we believe to be Amazon´s unfair commercial practices and breaches of marketing law.</p>
<p>– It should be as easy to end a subscription as it was to subscribe in the first place. Amazon should facilitate a good user experience instead of hindering customers and tricking them into continuing paid services they do not need or want, said Director of Digital Policy at the Norwegian Consumer Council, Finn Lützow-Holm Myrstad.</p>
<p>– In our view, this practice not only betrays the expectations and trust of consumers but breaches European law.</p>
<h2><strong>One out of four consumers struggle to unsubscribe </strong></h2>
<p>The Norwegian Consumer Council <a href="https://fil.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/population-survey-digital-content.pdf">surveyed 1,000 Norwegian consumers</a> and analysed their experience. One out of four Norwegian consumers reported difficulties unsubscribing from digital content services. Twenty-five percent of consumers surveyed reported that they pay for one or more subscriptions that they use with such infrequency that they might as well end the subscription.</p>
<p>– Most of us use digital content services to watch movies, listen to music or audiobooks, play video games, or read the news. At the same time, many consumers experience issues with subscriptions being very easy to sign up for, but difficult to get out of, said Finn Myrstad.</p>
<p>– Companies such as Amazon seem to speculate that they can discourage customers from cancelling their subscriptions either by heavily emphasizing the benefits that will be lost upon cancellation or by making the process so complicated that its users simply give up.</p>
<h2><strong>Amazon manipulates users into staying by using dark patterns</strong></h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GpEQ4OWNO4Y" width="650" height="433" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://fil.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-14-you-can-log-out-but-you-can-never-leave-final.pdf">The Norwegian Consumer Council’s study</a> analysed the cancellation process for Amazon Prime. The analysis shows that consumers who want to leave the service are faced with a large number of hurdles, including complicated navigation menus, skewed wording, confusing choices, and repeated nudging. Throughout the process, Amazon manipulates users through wording and graphic design, making the process needlessly difficult and frustrating to understand.</p>
<p>– Unfortunately, using <em>dark patterns</em>, or manipulative design, is a common practice online. Consumers are constantly bombarded by a variety of subtle and less subtle attempts to push us into making choices that favour the companies at the cost of our own time, attention, and money, said Myrstad.</p>
<h2><strong>A global problem requires global solutions</strong></h2>
<p>16 different consumer organizations in Europe and the United States are now taking action against Amazon based on the report by the Norwegian Consumer Council. They will each ask their respective consumer authorities to investigate the use of dark patterns in their countries.</p>
<p>This international campaign builds upon the Norwegian Consumer Council’s joint 2018 campaign with seven other European consumer organizations against Google’s use of dark patterns. The complaint, which the Irish Data Protection Commissioner’s office is still investigating, uncovered how Google manipulates users into turning on comprehensive location tracking.</p>
<p>– The Consumer Protection Authority can set an important precedent by issuing a decision against Amazon. A decision in favour of the complaint would mark that the use of dark patterns is not in accordance with European law and would elevate the rights of consumers.</p>

			<hr><p><strong>Amazon Prime</strong></p>
<p>A subscription to Amazon Prime provides discounts, shipping benefits, and access to other Amazon services. The Amazon Prime service has more than 150 million subscribers worldwide. Amazon’s European headquarters is in Luxembourg.</p>
<p><strong>Dark patterns</strong></p>
<p>Dark patterns, or manipulative design, are features of user interface design that nudge or push consumers into making choices that are in the best interest of the service provider, rather than in the interest of the consumer. This may include that certain options are easier to choose than others, that consumers are tricked into giving consent to sharing personal data, and many other practices.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-content">
    <p>
        This is an edition of the <a href="https://sirupsen.com/napkin/">Napkin Math newsletter</a>,
        a newsletter about using napkin math and first-principle thinking to
        estimate the performance of systems.
        You can <a href="https://sirupsen.com/napkin">subscribe through email.</a>
    </p>

    <p>A common problem you’ve almost certainly faced is to sync two datastores. This problem comes up in numerous shapes and forms: Receiving webhooks and writing them into your datastore, maintaining a materialized view, making sure a cache reflects reality, ensure documents make it from your source of truth to a search index, or your data from your transactional store to your data lake or column store.</p>
<p><img src="https://buttondown.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/8b99afab-9ae3-47cf-8703-f465aaec1473.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If you’ve built such a system, you’ve almost certainly seen B drift out of sync. Building a completely reliable syncing mechanism is difficult, but perhaps we can build a checksumming mechanism to check if the two datastores are equal in a few seconds?</p>
<p>In this issue of napkin math, we look at implementing a solution to <strong>check whether A and B are in sync for 100M records in a few seconds</strong>. The key idea is to checksum an indexed <code>updated_at</code> column and use a binary search to drill down to the mismatching records. All of this will be explained in great detail, read on!</p>
<h2 id="why-are-syncing-mechanisms-unreliable">Why are syncing mechanisms unreliable?</h2>
<p>If you are firing the events for your syncing mechanism after a transaction occurs, such as enqueuing a job, sending a webhook, or emit a Kafka event, you can’t guarantee that it <em>actually</em> gets sent after the transaction is committed. Almost certainly part of pipeline into database B is leaky due to bugs: perhaps there’s an exception you don’t handle, you drop events on the floor above a certain size, some early return, or deploys lose an event in a rare edge case.</p>
<p>But <em>even</em> if you’re doing something that’s theoretically bullet-proof, like using the database replication logs through <a href="https://debezium.io/">Debezium</a>, there’s still a good chance a bug somewhere in your syncing pipeline is causing you to lose occasional events. If theoretical guarantees were adequate, <a href="https://jepsen.io/">Jepsen</a> wouldn’t uncover much, would it? A team I worked with even wrote a TLA+ proof, but still found bugs with a solution like the one I describe here! In my experience, a checksumming system should be part of <em>any</em> syncing system.</p>
<p>It would seem to me that building reliable syncing mechanisms would be easier if databases had a standard, fast mechanism to answer the question: <em>“Does database A and B have all the same data? If not, what’s different?"</em> Over time, as you fix your bugs, it will of course happen more rarely, but being able to guarantee that they are in sync is a huge step forward.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this doesn’t exist as a user API in modern databases, but perhaps we can design such a mechanism <em>without</em> modifying the database?</p>
<p>This exploration will be fairly long. If you just want to see the final solution, scroll down to the end. This issue shows how to use napkin math to incrementally justify increasing complexity. While I’ve been thinking about this problem for a while, this is a fairly accurate representation of how I thought about the problem a few months ago when I started working on it. It’s also worth noting that when doing napkin math usually, I don’t write prototypes like this if I’m fairly confident in my understanding of the system underneath. I’m doing it here to make it more entertaining to read!</p>
<h2 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h2>
<p>Let’s start with some assumptions to plan out our ‘syncing checksum process’:</p>
<ul>
<li>100M records</li>
<li>1KiB per record (~100 GiB total)</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll assume both ends are SQL-flavoured relational databases, but will address other datastores later, e.g. ElasticSearch.</p>
<h2 id="iteration-1-check-in-batches">Iteration 1: Check in Batches</h2>
<p>As usual, we will start by considering the simplest possible solution for checking whether two databases are in sync: a script that iterates through all records in batches to check if they’re the same. It’ll execute the SQL query below in a loop, iterating through the whole collection on both sides and report mismatches:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>`</span><span>table</span><span>`</span>
<span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> id <span>ASC</span>
<span>LIMIT</span> <span>@</span><span>limit</span> <span>OFFSET</span> <span>@</span><span>offset</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Let’s try to figure out how long this would take: Let’s assume each loop is querying the two databases in parallel and our batches are 10,000 records (10 MiB total) large:</p>
<ul>
<li>In MySQL, reading 10 MiB off SSD at <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/napkin-math#numbers">200 us/MiB</a> will take ~2ms. We assume   this to be sequential-ish, <a href="http://yoshinorimatsunobu.blogspot.com/2013/10/making-full-table-scan-10x-faster-in.html">but this is not entirely true</a>.</li>
<li>Serializing and deserializing the MySQL protocol at <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/napkin-math#numbers">5 ms/MiB</a>, for a total   of ~2* 50ms = 100ms.</li>
<li>Network transfer at <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/napkin-math#numbers">10 ms/MiB</a>, for a total of ~100ms.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’d then expect each batch to take roughly ~200ms.  This would bring our theoretical grand total for this approach to <code>200 ms/batch * (100M / 10_000) batches ~= 30min</code>.</p>
<p>To test our hypothesis against reality, I implemented this to <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/napkin-math/blob/master/newsletter/14-syncing/check.rb">run locally for the first 100 of the 10,000 batches</a>. In this local implementation, we won’t incur the network transfer overhead (we could’ve done this with <a href="https://github.com/shopify/toxiproxy">Toxiproxy</a>). Without the network overhead, we expect a query time in the 100ms ballpark. Running <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/napkin-math/blob/master/newsletter/14-syncing/check.rb">the script</a>, I get the following plot:</p>
<p><img src="https://buttondown.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/dfef5830-f658-4268-b655-ec23e64ce90c.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Ugh. The real performance is pretty far from our napkin math lower bound estimate. What’s going on here?</p>
<p>There’s a fundamental problem with our napkin math. Only the <em>very</em> first batch will read only <code>~10 MB</code> off of the SSD in MySQL. <code>OFFSET</code> queries will read through the data <em>before</em> the offset, even if it only returns the data after the offset! Each batch takes 3-5ms more than the last, which lines up well with reading another 10 MiB per batch from the increasing offset.</p>
<p>This is the reason why OFFSET-based pagination causes so much trouble in production systems. If we take the area under the graph here and extend to the 10,000 batches we’d need for our 100M records, we get a <strong>~3 day runtime</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="iteration-2-outsmarting-the-optimizer">Iteration 2: Outsmarting the optimizer</h2>
<p>As <code>OFFSET</code> will scan through all these 1 KiB records, what if we scanned an index instead? It’ll be much smaller to skip 100,000s of records on an index where each record only occupies perhaps 64 bit. It’ll still grow linearly with the offset, but passing the previous batch’s 10,000 records is only 10 KiB which would only take a few hundred microseconds to read.</p>
<p>You’d think the optimizer would make this optimization itself, but it doesn’t. So we have to do it ourselves:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>`</span><span>table</span><span>`</span>
<span>WHERE</span> id <span>&gt;</span> (<span>SELECT</span> id <span>FROM</span> <span>table</span> <span>LIMIT</span> <span>1</span> <span>OFFSET</span> <span>@</span><span>offset</span>)
<span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> id <span>ASC</span> 
<span>LIMIT</span> <span>10000</span>;
</code></pre></div><p><img src="https://buttondown.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/47a71e04-2c3d-48e6-a7de-c2240d1ac26f.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It’s better, but just not by enough. It just delays the inevitable scanning of lots of data to find these limits. If we interpolate how long this’d take for 10,000 batches to process our 100M records, we’re still talking on the <strong>order of 14 hours</strong>. The 128x speedup doesn’t carry through, because it only applies to the MySQL part. Network transfer is still a large portion of the total time!</p>
<p>Either way, if you have some OFFSET queries lying around in your codebase, you might want to consider this optimization.</p>
<h2 id="iteration-3-parallelization">Iteration 3: Parallelization</h2>
<p>This seems like an embarrassingly parallel problem: Can’t we just run 100 batches of 10,000 records in parallel? Can the database support that? Since we can pre-compute <em>all</em> the LIMITs and OFFSETs up front, let’s abuse that?</p>
<p>This seems kind of difficult to do the napkin math on. Typically when that’s the case, I try to solve the problem backwards: Fundamentally, the machine can <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/napkin-math#numbers">read sequential SSD at 4 GiB/s</a>, which would be an absolute lower bound for how fast the database can work. The dataset is 100 GiB, as we established in the beginning.</p>
<p>If we’re using our optimization from iteration 2, then our queries are on average processing <code>50M * 64 bit</code> for the sub-query, and the <code>10 MiB</code> of returned data on top. That’s a total of ~400 MiB. So for our 10,000 batches, that’s 4.2 TB of data we will need to munch through with this query. We can read 1 GiB from SSD in 200ms, so that’s 14 minutes in total. That would be the <em>absolute</em> lowest bound, assuming essentially zero overhead from MySQL and not taking into consideration serialization, network, etc.</p>
<p>This also assumes the MySQL instance is doing <em>nothing</em> but serving our query, which is unrealistic. In reality, we’d dedicate <em>maybe</em> 10% of capacity to these queries, which puts us at 2 hours. Still faster, but a far cry from our hope of seconds or minutes. Buuh.</p>
<h2 id="iteration-4-dropping-offset">Iteration 4: Dropping OFFSET</h2>
<p>It’s starting to seem like trouble to use these OFFSET queries, even as sub-queries. We held on to it for a while, because it’s nice and easy to reason about, and means the queries can be fired off in parallel. We also held on to it for a while to truly show how awful these types of queries are, so hopefully you think twice about using it in a production query again!</p>
<p>If we change our approach to maintain <code>max(id)</code> from the last batch, we can simply change our loop’s query to:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>`</span><span>table</span><span>`</span>
<span>WHERE</span> id <span>&gt;</span> <span>@</span>max_id_from_last_batch
<span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> id <span>ASC</span>
<span>LIMIT</span> <span>10000</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>This curbed the linear growth!</p>
<p><img src="https://buttondown.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/6b0263d5-c59f-4127-a573-6b06d615c195.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now MySQL can use its efficient primary key index to do <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=log%28100*10%5E6%29%2Flog%281024%2F3*2%2F%288%2B4%29%29+%2B+1++*https%3A%2F%2Fdev.mysql.com%2Fdoc%2Frefman%2F8.0%2Fen%2Festimating-performance.html*">~6 SSD seeks</a> on <code>id</code> and then scan forward. This means we only process and serialize 10 MiB, putting our napkin math consistently around 100ms per batch as in the original estimate in iteration 1. That means this solution should <strong>finish in about half an hour!</strong> However, we learned in the previous iteration that we are constrained by only taking 10% of the database’s capacity, so as calculated from iteration 3, we’re back at 2 hours..</p>
<p>We fundamentally need an approach that handles less data, as the serialization and network time is the primary reason why the integrity checking is now slow.</p>
<h2 id="iteration-5-checksumming">Iteration 5: Checksumming</h2>
<p>If we want to handle less data, we need to have some way to fingerprint or checksum each record. We could change our query to something along the lines of:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> MD5(<span>*</span>) <span>FROM</span> <span>table</span>
<span>WHERE</span> id <span>&gt;</span> <span>@</span>max_id_from_last_batch
<span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> id <span>ASC</span>
<span>LIMIT</span> <span>10000</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>If there’s a mismatch, we simply revert to iteration 4 and find the rows that mismatch, but we have to scan far less data as we can assume the majority of it lines up.</p>
<p>Before moving on, let’s see whether the napkin math works out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading 10 MiB off SSD at <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/napkin-math#numbers">200 us/MiB</a> will take ~2ms.</li>
<li>Has…</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m not a “systems” person.</p>
<p>It’s not like I never tried - making schedules, using a Pomodoro timer,&lt;insert productivity “hack”&gt; - they didn’t work because I was trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/104540572-bb4c3d00-5645-11eb-86f9-de27e6b8d07d.jpg" alt="square_peg.jpg"> <small> <a href="https://baddadcartoons101.wordpress.com/2017/09/04/square-peg-and-a-round-hole/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <i> Source: BadDadCartoons </i> </a> </small> </p>
<p>What I ended up doing was instead of focusing on optimising the time I spent productively - i.e. the “deep work” part (which happened rather spontaneously independent of whether I’m on a productivity hack or not) - I decided to focus on the time that was not “deep work” i.e. time spent on ‘distractions’ or entertainment.</p>
<p>I used to spend an unhealthy amount of time in a day on Instagram where the feed was mostly filled with memes. I also used Quora/Twitter a lot.</p>
<p>Consuming content is easy. Like junk food. It's almost embedded in our reflexes.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing - you can easily turn your distractions to things that can benefit you.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Start with cutting off distractions that have too much noise i.e. do not give you a good return of investment on your time in any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specific knowledge/skills</li>
<li>Specific insight</li>
<li>Accessing and leveraging a network</li>
</ul>
<p>For the ones that remain, optimise the shit out of them.</p>
<p>For me, that meant Instagram was instantly off the list. Twitter and Quora were okay, but I had a long way to go.</p>
<br>
<h3> Optimising your feed </h3>
<p>Social media “feed”.
What comes to your mind when you think of the word - “feed”?</p>
<p>This comes to my mind when I think “feed”</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/104541024-c0f65280-5646-11eb-92f6-de5227d4b8a1.png" alt="sheep.jpg"> <i> <small> Sheep, “feed”ing </small>
</i> </p>
<p>Our minds are literally “fed” content.</p>
<p>“We are what we eat” - this doesn’t just stand for physical, tangible food - it applies to the digital content we feed our mind with.</p>
<p>I want you to take this literally because we take our attention for granted. In a digital economy run by monetising attention - it will naturally be full of noise.</p>
<p>Most of the content we read or watch is optimised solely for capturing our attention and clicks. More times than not, you don’t need something that is being shown to you. You will be perfectly fine without knowing it existed. Yep, sounds crazy but it is true.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to say social media is bad. Social media is an amplifier of all there is - of both the good stuff and the bad. It is an amplifier of your primal instincts so if you don’t proactively weed out the bad stuff from your feed regularly, you are going to get sick. Really sick.</p>
<p>What that means is, with some conscious effort you can filter out your feed to keep only the things that benefit you. Here’s how:</p>
<p><strong>Tip #1</strong></p>
<p>Don’t follow brands. Follow people.</p>
<p>I’ll bring the sheep here, again.</p>
<p>When I imagine a brand account, I imagine the shepherd.</p>
<p>And all of the 100-200-500k followers as the sheep.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/104541200-1599cd80-5647-11eb-8d7f-f89ae517eb81.png" alt="shepherd.jpg"></p><p>The only reason brand accounts exist is to convince you - in obvious or non-obvious ways - that you need their product in some way or the other. 99-100% of brand accounts posts are pure marketing. You do not need them.
It’s like bombarding your own feed with their ads - full time - <em>with your full consent</em>. Especially so if you are already consuming a brand’s product. Why?!</p>
<p>Who should you follow then?</p>
<p>Follow people. Now, you might argue that people themselves can be brands and you are absolutely right - avoid them too. This goes for popular celebrities, sportspeople, singers etc.
Around half the time, you are probably going to see marketing stuff from them as well. Not all are like that of course, apply your judgement. I respect a lot of celebrities but I don’t follow them because I simply don’t need their opinion in my feed - I couldn’t care any less - they are artists, I liked their art, I liked how they performed but that doesn’t mean I like their opinion nor do I need to listen to them on every single issue there is. At the end of the day, including every celebrity or band or anything in your feed just increases the “distraction” score in your feed.</p>
<p>Okay. Brands are out. Brand people are out. What next?</p>
<p>Follow thinkers. Follow do-ers. Follow people who are creating something.</p>
<p>Some follows I would recommend in no particular order:
<a href="https://twitter.com/naval/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> @naval </a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/nntaleb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> @nntaleb </a>,

<a href="https://twitter.com/david_perell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> @David_Perell </a>,</p>
<p>This is a subjective list, of course, but the idea remains the same: when you scroll - scroll to think, not to react. The posts/tweets in your feed should stop and make you think. If they enable <em>only</em> a reaction like rage or anxiety - remove it.</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>A simple heuristic to clean your social media feed:</p><p>Scroll to think, not to react</p><p>Reduce content that enables only a reaction. <br>Increase content that stops and makes you think.</p></div>— Akhil (@akhlkg) <a href="https://twitter.com/akhlkg/status/1346891698861862913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2021</a></blockquote> 

<p><strong>Tip #2</strong></p>
<p>When something is trending and it doesn’t really matter to you much, mute all the words/hashtags/etc related to it. The “Explore” section in Twitter is a black hole of distractions. Twitter will try to shove you up with random stuff all the time in your feed - but mute/block/ignore them all - this takes conscious effort but is well worth it.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/104541285-5691e200-5647-11eb-93d6-ed60a6cfa293.png" alt="twet.jpg"></p><p>If it's a trending event you do genuinely care about and you must “react” to it - here’s my two step strategy:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Ignore ‘the first wave’</strong></p>
<p>The first wave is the most emotional one. The purpose of the first wave, knowingly or unknowingly, is to polarise. There is no place for rationality in the first wave of posts, trends, articles, etc. You are likely going to see the same type/flavour of content - over and over from all sorts of people which essentially just convey the same thing in different shades of rage. There is nothing against the stream, yet. Mute ‘em all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assess the aftermath</strong></p>
<p>Once the first wave is gone and the hashtags die, start looking around. This can be anywhere from 1 week to several months depending on the issue. You are searching for truth, so don’t look at the news - if you’re reading articles online, don’t just look at one publisher, read on the same article by different publishers. Remember, each publishing house has a “flavour” of twisting things. An easy way to cancel the bias out is to read from many publishers and see what remains common. Now analyse the common facts - those are the fundamental facts that supposedly happened and anything above that, is just an opinion.</p>
<p>You can also look if the “thinkers” are reacting. If so, see what they are saying.
It takes effort to get to the truth and navigate through the noise, so I don’t end up doing this a lot of times because I simply didn't care about the event as much as I thought. And it looks like I end up doing okay.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>

<p>That’s about it. In theory, you can apply these principles to any social media platform. I tested and developed these on Twitter but the fundamental idea remains the same: <strong>scroll to think, not to react.</strong></p>
<p>And this fundamental idea helped me a lot. Twitter taught me a lot of things that form a core part of who I am now - staying healthy, strength training, mental models, entrepreneurship, making money online, writing.</p>
<p>You can use your distractions to literally change your life - and I really hope you do!</p></div></div>]]>

    <p>A hands on guide for individual developers, small teams without dedicated SRE or oncall teams to using Cloud services safely.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>About a month ago, I published two blog posts on our company blog sharing one of our stories that form our journey: <a href="https://blog.tomilkieway.com/72k-1/" target="_blank">We burnt $72K and almost went bankrupt</a>. The post was fairly well circulated in the tech community, and inspired me to write a post dedicated to the hacks that help me sleep better at night without having an oncall team to manage all the cloud services.</p>

<p>This post outlines practices I learnt and now practise for keeping a check on Cloud usage, and an attempt to eliminate possibilities of surprises.</p>

<h2 id="disclaimers-">Disclaimers (!)</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>1. If you're capable of hosting everything on your own server(s) ...
  </dt>
  <dd>Congratulations, you're one of the very few who have this knowledge and experience. You know what you're doing and keep it up. Depending on whether you have interest in Cloud platforms, this post may or may not add any value to you.</dd>

  <dt>2. Examples are centric to GCP but fundamentals should apply to all platforms</dt>
  <dd>Although examples in this post are on GCP, I've tried to structure around some fundamental vs. platform features. All cloud services have similar features, but they have different names, prices and usage policies.</dd>

  <dt>3. This is not an exhaustive list</dt>
  <dd>Like everyone, I'm still learning and growing. Below is what I learnt from several mistakes, figuring out solutions on my own and going through every piece of literature online from great kind minds. If you have more tips, feel free to share with me, and I'll be happy to add it to this list.</dd>

  <dt>4. This is a long post</dt>
  <dd>Sorry about it, but there's no way around it. If you find it useful and can't finish in one go, you can always come back to this post.</dd>

<h2 id="lets-jump-into-it">Let’s jump into it!</h2>
<hr>
<h3 id="1-use-multiple-forms-of-payments-fop-preferably-with-spend-caps">1. Use multiple forms of payments (FOP), preferably with spend caps</h3>
<p>Let’s begin with the simplest yet the most effective fixes.</p>

<center>
<img src="https://sudcha.com/assets/images/use-cloud/credit-card.jpg"><br>
</center>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Have spending limits/caps on the forms of payments (FOPs) you use.</strong> 
Most cloud services have a monthly billing except if a threshold spend is reached. If the threshold is reached, the Cloud platforms charge the given account right away. If for some reason, one of your services faulter, the cloud service would directly charge the form of payment (like credit cards) on file, and on non payment, stop the service.</p>

    <p>Ideally the spending limit could be anywhere between 120-150% of the cost you expect to incur given the usage of your platform.</p>

    <p>From what I’ve read, it’s relatively easier to get bill waived off than get a refund. While the suggestions in this post will make sure such situations don’t arise, it’s better to have it set up anyways.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Don’t use your $25,000 no limit credit card while setting up billing for a fresh account.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Use different FOPs for development and production.</strong><br>
After we messed up in one of our projects, our credit card was declined, and this had several unexpected ripple effects.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>First GCP suspended all our billing accounts tied to the same credit card for a suspect of fraud.</li>
      <li>Second, our bank started suspending all future transaction requests from GCP suspecting fraud.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Sorting this took several days, and it halted our development cycle. Thankfully we didn’t have a production service back then.</p>

    <p>In an ideal setup, I recommend using one FOP for production account, and another one for dev/test accounts. Never mix these two.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <br>
If you’re a solo developer, I highly recommend setting up an LLC or some umbrella that gives your personal assets protection. Doesn’t matter where you live, in recent years this process has become quite standard everywhere in the world, thanks to the entrepreneurial boom.</p>

<p>Some wise people online have suggested setting up a shell company (!). I personally don’t recommend spending time doing this. If you’re building something meaningful, spend all your time making it better in a legit way.</p>

<h3 id="2-setup-service-quotas">2. Setup Service Quotas</h3>
<p>In GCP users can define <a href="https://cloud.google.com/docs/quota">“Quotas”</a> for most services. AWS has similar feature called <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/intro.html" target="_blank">“Service Quotas”</a>, and I’m sure other providers have this as well.</p>

<p>Depending on type of Quota, some of them can be set for usage per day, per minute or even <em>per user</em> per minute. I don’t really trust the <em>per user</em> quota because who defines “a user”? The others quotas for the most part are fairly reliable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While GCP doesn’t allow auto cut off on billing, it does allow auto cut off based on usage, well at least for most services.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For any account with billing, when I enable a new service, I first check if there’s a quota, and if there’s one, I set it to really low while getting familiar with the service. A lot of the services are charged per use and setting up this quota also helps in validating the costs that will be incurred on use.</p>

<p>As an example, if I’m testing GCP Adult Image Classifier service, as soon as I enable the service, I would first set the Quota to <strong>100 per day</strong> and then try the codelab provided.</p>

<center>
<img src="https://sudcha.com/assets/images/use-cloud/vision-quota.png"><br>
</center>

<p>If the cloud provider you use neither has auto billing shutoff nor budgets, it should be a big red flag for you to use the service.</p>

<h4 id="some-caveats">Some Caveats</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Default Values are counter intuitive!</strong><br>
Most services have a preset default quota of unlimited or some absurd value like 1,000,000. Why? God knows. Maybe GCP engineers never paid attention to it, or they assume each of their users, considerable population of which is students, build apps with million dollar budgets.
Setting quotas is also multi click arduous process probably because they are optimized for large organizations. Don’t fret the extra clicks, it’s worth it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Not all services have Quota limits</strong><br>
For example Firestore Read/Write ops. From engineering standpoint, this is understandable because if the service has to check for quota, how can it be real time?
Don’t assume that every service has a quota.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Not all quotas work as advertised</strong><br>
Test each of the quotas before fully relying on them. I found several that <strong>don’t work</strong> and my consults led to bugs with Google. The bugs are not fixed yet, and so if something were to go wrong with those services, they would act as a fall back because it’s an issue on GCP’s side.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-cloud-monitoring">3. Cloud Monitoring</h3>
<p>While billing is delayed by about a day, most metrics provided by Cloud platforms are delayed by only a few minutes. For GCP this is called Cloud Monitoring, for AWS it’s called CloudWatch and in Microsoft - Azure Monitor.</p>

<p>These monitoring services are either free for the project services (standard metrics), or available at very, very cheap prices.</p>

<p>Setting up Monitoring wasn’t really in the face when I started using Cloud Services, nor is it generally advertised, but it’s a great feature that everyone should use.</p>

<p><strong>What it allows:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Creating beautiful custom dashboards with usage graphs for the services you care about</li>
  <li>Creating alerts that fire if usage goes beyond a user defined limit. The alerts can be SMS, email and app notifications.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="how-to-use-monitoring-service">How to use Monitoring service</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Set up Alerts</strong><br>
You can also set up alerts that’ll fire emails, text messages and mobile app notifications, all for free. While they may not be of much use while you’re sleeping, they do provide a lot of support while you’re awake.</p>

    <p>Case study from our development cycle:
During development of our first product Announce, one of the engineers on my team developing locally (live build on localhost) accidentally created an infinite loop that led to infinite Firebase read ops for a few minutes. We had a free limited project for development so nothing could go wrong, but the monitoring alerted me and I reached out to the team to see what was up.</p>

    <p>The only down side in this was that we had a very limited quota remaining for the day and the team waited until next day to resume development.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Look for spikes</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<center>
<img src="https://sudcha.com/assets/images/use-cloud/spike.png"><br>
<em>Always take the time to explain spikes in usage.</em>
</center>

<p>Most of the graphs may look daunting and it’s probably not worth understanding each and every metric and figure. To simplify your job, just look into anomalies.</p>

<p>After few steady days, your job should be to watch out for spikes in usage as compared to the usage in longer period of time. Set the usage to 6 weeks and see if there is a spike. If there is a spike, it should be explained, say too much local testing, surge in usage, expected triggers etc.</p>

<p>Looking for spikes only takes 2-3 minutes for the dashboard to load, and your job is done. This should be part of daily working routine if you have any service deployed on cloud.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Anticipate and Reduce Costs</strong><br>
As the graphs are only a few minutes late, after doing something you can wait for a few minutes to see what resources you consumed. You can also predict costs of something before it shows up in billing.</p>

    <p>Another big advantage is aide in reducing costs! For example, looking at Storage, I understood that GCP was continuously storing build artifacts from <em>each</em> build which took a development project storage that shouldn’t be using anymore than 100MB to 25GB. There are ways to fix this, but as a developer, one must know that this problem exists.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<center>
<img src="https://sudcha.com/assets/images/use-cloud/spike3.png"><br>
<em>High execution time could mean under allocation of resources, leading to more cost.
</em>
</center>

<p>Another example is memory or CPU consumption from the deployed services. Some graphs can easily tell if you have <strong>over/under allocation</strong> of resources to the services.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Write better Code</strong><br>
These graphs easily show low hanging fruits to optimize code. Maybe your cloud function is going into background processes, or perhaps its timing out due to some other service being called serially (instead of asynchronously).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-use-free-projects">4. Use Free Projects</h3>
<p>Cloud Platforms today provide a lot of free services per project, and there are a <strong>lot of projects that a user can create</strong>. There’s a reason why the systems are set up in such a way. Primary reason, as far as I can think of, is to give enough room for testing and learning about the service.</p>

<p>Firebase and GCP allow more than 10 …</p></div></div>

Many universities agree on the answer: “Absolutely nothing.”</p><p>Although anthropologists and archeologists still wonder why human beings have for so long organized themselves to fight, the study of war in history and political science departments is fading. Senior scholars are retiring and not being replaced, or their posts are allocated to other fields of history. Each year, fewer courses are offered on great conflicts such as the Napoleonic wars, the total wars of the 20th century, and the Cold War. The Second World War, you may hear on campus, “has been done.”</p><p>Yet war remains one of the events—along with revolution, famine, financial collapse and, as we are learning again, pandemics—that change the course of history. In privileged countries, we forget the importance of military conflicts because we have enjoyed the “Long Peace” that followed the Second World War. Other places have not been so fortunate, with wars around the world almost every year since 1945, bringing millions of deaths and creating millions more refugees. Meanwhile, the world’s great powers maintain large military establishments, and still prepare for battle. </p><p>It is as important as ever to understand war—its causes, nature and consequences—and the many ways that conflicts have shaped our societies. The conquering armies that came from the Arabian Peninsula in the 7th century after the Prophet Mohammad’s death created new empires and spread the new religion of Islam across the Middle East, North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula. The Seven Years’ War (1756-1763), a global conflict, laid the foundations for the dominance of the British Empire and the bankruptcy of France, which helped to fuel the French Revolution.&nbsp; </p><p>War can also speed up advances in science and technology that have benefits in peacetime. Think of the development of penicillin, blood transfusions, radar, or the transistor. And war can bring about significant social change, often for the better. The need for mass armies in the 19th and 20th centuries meant that governments had to treat the lower classes better, whether by educating them or by improving public health. In many countries that fought in the two world wars, ruling classes recognized the contributions of women and the working classes, granting them the franchise and introducing social benefits. </p><p>So why do history faculties, which accept the need to study other great forces in history, such as changes in the means of production or systems of belief, shy from war? I suspect that horror at the phenomenon itself has affected universities’ willingness to treat it as a subject for scholarship. Years ago, when I proposed a new course on war and society, an education consultant asked me, “Why don’t you call it peace studies?” </p><p>I have since met with incomprehension, even hostility, when I have pointed out that wars can bring unintended benefits. However much I say that we would not <em>choose</em> to make war in order to improve our societies, I am charged with loving war. Yet nobody would say that the study of imperialism, racism or famine means that we think those are good things.</p><p><strong>The history of war is neglected for other reasons, too. </strong>First, separate histories—of women, emotions, food and the environment, for example—have come along. Quite rightly, room has been made for them in the big and eclectic house that is the study of the past. However, part of the shift away from war studies owes to the quest for “social justice”—intended as a drive for radical change in society at large—that has taken root in many history faculties. </p><p>Here, for example, is how the chair of Historical and Cultural Studies at the Scarborough campus of the University of Toronto, Natalie Rothman, <a href="https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/hcs/">welcomed students</a> this autumn: “As a department, we have strengthened our resolve to confront racism, colonialism and Islamophobia throughout our curriculum and in our co-curricular initiatives.” The University of Berkeley in California <a href="https://history.berkeley.edu/graduate/prospective-students/admissions">asks prospective graduate students</a> to provide “evidence of how you have come to understand the barriers faced by others, evidence of your academic service to advance equitable access to higher education for women, racial minorities, and individuals from other groups that have been historically underrepresented in higher education, evidence of your research focusing on underserved populations or related issues of inequality, or evidence of your leadership among such groups.” It is hard to quarrel with such goals, but their impact on curriculum has been to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/29/opinion/why-did-we-stop-teaching-political-history.html?smid=em-share">downgrade subjects such as political and military history,</a> which are seen as too focused on elites and complicit with hierarchy and oppression. </p><p>Another factor is that history overall is worryingly in decline as an academic subject. While it remains popular among publishers and readers, enrollments in history majors are significantly down. They have <a href="https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/december-2018/the-history-ba-since-the-great-recession-the-2018-aha-majors-report">dropped more than any other major</a> in the humanities—perhaps by as much as <a href="http://www.chronicle.com/article/why-are-students-ditching-the-history-major">one-third</a> in <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/11/27/new-analysis-history-major-data-says-field-new-low-can-it-be-saved">American universities</a> in the past decade. At the University of Toronto, where I am a professor, colleagues fear that history enrollment may be down as much as 50% over the same period. Even in the United Kingdom, where history remains popular among undergraduates, the number of those majoring in history has dropped by about <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/07/18/the-study-of-history-is-in-decline-in-britain">one-tenth</a> in the past decade. </p><p>Part of the reason is that, given the lingering effects of the 2008 financial crisis and uncertainty over the economy, students and their parents want university courses to lead to jobs. The decline in history students in turn affects university hiring, and the fewer the tenured faculty, the fewer places for the doctoral students who are the future of the profession.&nbsp; </p><p>Faculties and administrators are not necessarily helping matters, reluctant to include popular courses on war in the curriculum, or to support well-established centers for the study of conflict, some of which are being remodeled, such as the Laurier Centre for Military, Strategic and Disarmament Studies, in Waterloo, Ontario, which will focus more on Canadian history; another at the University of Calgary is fading as those who retire are not replaced. This seems to be particularly true of elite universities. War studies remains in better health at military colleges or some second-tier public universities, while schools of public policy are also still teaching military history, strategic studies and diplomatic history. </p><p>But those in other fields stereotype war studies, characterizing it as too narrowly focused on tactics, battles, or “toys for boys,” meaning armaments. If that caricature were ever true, it has not been for decades. The great historian Sir Michael Howard, who pioneered the modern study of war and trained generations of historians, always insisted that what he was doing was to consider wars within their social and political contexts as a part of the great sweep of history, not somehow separate from it. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>My own evidence of the distaste for military and diplomatic history </strong>at North American universities comes from tales exchanged privately among fellow academics. One retired Canadian military historian recounted that his old faculty had asked him how to reverse the collapse in enrollment. He suggested a course in military history, but the response was a flat no. When a university in the Maritime provinces of eastern Canada was offered a fully funded post in naval history a few years ago—a good fit in a port town that had been deeply affected by conflict on the Atlantic—members of the department rejected it. </p><p>Yet, despite the overall downturn in university history programs, we know from course enrollments that students are interested in war, as indeed they are in international relations, when they get the chance to study them: At Yale, Paul Kennedy’s “Military History of the West” attracted large crowds; at Toronto’s Ryerson University, international relations courses are the most popular choices among students.</p><p>I would not suggest that student preference should determine what departments offer. But they should at least be listened to. Much more important is what we, as societies, want our future leaders to know. Political history, diplomatic history and the study of war—they all offer critical warnings and instructive analogies to our times. Social and cultural histories, and history from the bottom up, add to our understanding too. But we need balance, and a sense of how the micro- and macro-histories mesh with each other. </p><p>Do we really want citizens who have so little knowledge of how war helped to shape our values and societies and our world? Do we ever want another president asking, as Donald Trump <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-pearl-harbor-memorial-tour-john-kelly-stable-genius-2020-1?r=US&amp;IR=T">did</a> during a visit to the Pearl Harbor memorial: “What’s this all about? What’s this a tour of?” </p><p>If we aren’t aware of how wars happen, we may fail to recognize warning signs when the next conflict brews, as it will. </p><p><strong>Margaret MacMillan is a professor of history at the University of Toronto and emeritus professor at the University of Oxford. Her latest book, </strong><em><strong><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/609692/war-how-conflict-shaped-us-by-margaret-macmillan/">War: How Conflict Shaped Us</a></strong></em><strong>, was among the </strong><em><strong>New York Times</strong></em><strong> 10 Best Books of 2020. </strong></p></div></div>]]>

<h2><span id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h2>
<h3><span id="Trump_is_a_product_of_bad_schooling">Trump is a product of bad schooling</span></h3>
<p>Donald Trump is the most erratic president in the US history.
</p><p>If I told you I blame the education system for the emergence of Trump, you would probably first think about the president's own spotty world knowledge. His presidential credentials are not too strong in that department. However, his education is still well above the average. If I added that my claim is not about Trump but about society, your second bet might be placed on the dismal level of education provided by American schools. I would reply that it does not take a genius to differentiate between qualities of Trump, Hillary, Bush or Obama.
</p><p>Education systems around the world are under the assault of critics of all sorts. We keep complaining and the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Reform" title="Reform">change is coming</a>. However, there is still a last bastion of schooling that seems pretty resistant: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Socialization" title="Socialization">socialization</a>. There is an overwhelming belief that kids get their socialization at school. Even the best homeschoolers or unschoolers have to repeatedly answer the question: "<i>What about socialization?</i>". In this text, I show that <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Social_groups_in_socialization#Socialization:_Open_and_closed_systems" title="Social groups in socialization">open system socialization</a> would never let Trump emerge as the leader of the world. A tempered version of Trump might still be successful in real estate. He would be more ethical, less bombastic, more knowledgeable, less angry, more tame, etc. In open socialization, Trump would be better, Trump would be less prominent, and Trump would not care about his prominence.
</p><p>We socialize children for readiness in the idealized society. As a result, they are not ready to face dangers of reality. If Donald Trump sparked a nuclear war, I would blame the polished socialization based on polished rules in closed systems such as schools or daycare centers. 
</p>
<p>Instead of preparing children for an idealized society, we should let them adopt freely to real social environments</p>
<h3><span id="Why_should_I_speak_about_Trump.3F">Why should I speak about Trump?</span></h3>
<p>Using Trump's rich twitter feed, many a psychiatrist cannot patiently watch the show without a burning itch to violate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldwater_rule">Goldwater rule</a>. It is tempting to produce a distance diagnosis from the comfort of one's own keyboard.
</p><p>I am also mystified by Trump's brain and behavior. However, my diagnosis is pretty different from the consensus that seems to emerge in the media. My viewpoint is unique for two reasons. On one hand, my work on memory, learning, creativity, and intelligence provide a unique interpretation for Trump's thinking and his behavior. My knowledge exculpates the president on many counts. On the other hand, my own behavior and personality show some parallels that help me empathetically get into Trump's head. I need to hurry to add that I respect women, honor the truth, value the rich constellation of cultures, and worship science. However, my similarities with Trump go deep into how my brain works, and why it sets us both well apart from the social norm.
</p><p>In the end, I believe my conclusions are pretty important. If I am right, we will know how to handle Trump, and how to prevent future Trumps from becoming troublemakers.
</p>
<h3><span id="Diagnosis_by_media">Diagnosis by media</span></h3>
<p>Hundreds of armchair critics, haters, and homegrown scientists have hypothesized on the reasons for Donald Trump's weirdness. Serious scientists also took on the job of "remote diagnosis" with most of the conclusions drawn from news reports on Trump's behavior and decisions. I respect the Goldwater rule when it comes to serious diagnosis. Barry Goldwater was also "remotely" diagnosed as "unfit to be president". Psychiatrists tried to avoid making wild generalizations ever since. However, there should be no gag order on a free discussion. This is why I do not mind "virtual science at a distance". I like hypotheses and models, even if <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/What%27s_the_value_of_wrong_models%3F" title="What's the value of wrong models?">they are wrong</a>. Luckily, I am no psychiatrist, and I need not worry about my license and reputation.
</p><p>In wild hypothesizing, Trump is a particularly interesting case because he makes news daily, and so do critics who bring forward a whole array of mental diseases and cognitive impairments. My interest in Trump's brain comes from the fact that my job provides an entirely different perspective, and to the chagrin of all antagonists, I must say that I see no signs of serious pathology. Just the opposite, Trump's brain is pretty good a specimen that many should envy. A good brain does not prevent committing abhorrent acts such as "<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44518942">putting kids in cages</a>" (compare: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Would_you_have_a_heart_to_cage_a_puppy%3F" title="Would you have a heart to cage a puppy?">Putting puppies in cages</a>). The trick to a well-organized society is to find ways to employ good brains for a good cause. I see a couple of reasons why this is not the case for Trump.
</p>
<h3><span id="When_Goldwater_rule_does_not_apply">When Goldwater rule does not apply</span></h3>
<p>Sharon Begley argues the pros and cons of the Goldwater rule in her article "<a href="http://www.statnews.com/2017/12/06/goldwater-rule-psychiatry/">Experts challenge the science behind ban on psychiatrists discussing politicians’ mental health</a>".
</p><p>If psychiatry is an art, we can often arrive at major differences of opinion. Apparently, personality disorders are particularly affected. Most of all, if Trump's prime diagnosis is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder">narcisissm</a>, he is a particularly grateful subject for analysis. Here is an excerpt from Begley's argument (shortened):
</p>
<blockquote><div><p>The flaws of psychiatric exams and the usefulness of other data make the Goldwater rule "scientifically indefensible," said Dr. Leonard Glass, a psychiatrist at McLean Hospital and Harvard Medical School. "I sort of believed" that interviews offer the clearest window into someone’s mind, he said.</p><p>"Psychiatrists are taught that if a patient says he has three drinks a day, double that," said Dr Glass. "The psychiatric interview is flawed." His and other psychiatrists’ clinical experience is backed up by studies going back to the <a href="http://www.wpic.pitt.edu/research/biometrics/Publications/Biometrics%20Archives%20PDF/614Spitzer&amp;Fleiss1974.pdf">1970s</a> in which patients were examined by two psychiatrists <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2990547/">back-to-back</a>. The rate of agreement was so low that "the unreliability of psychiatric diagnosis has been and still is a major problem in psychiatry," researchers concluded. Later studies reported similar discrepancies, especially for <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cpsp.12088/abstract">personality disorders</a>, finding that examination-based conclusions by a psychiatrist often <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-39264-001">disagree with</a> assessments in a structured research setting.</p><p>Markers of pathological narcissism — grandiose self-importance, entitlement, exploitativeness, and lack of empathy — can be seen in someone’s public behavior, especially in the case of a public figure whose behavior and speech has been documented in hundreds of hours of TV interviews, speeches, offhand remarks, and tweets, plus the accounts of people who have lived or worked closely with him. This evidence can also be <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17629778">more accurate</a> than information from formal examinations.</p></div></blockquote>
<h3><span id="Is_virtual_psychiatric_diagnosis_valid.3F">Is virtual psychiatric diagnosis valid?</span></h3>
<p>I refuse to give up modelling, or speaking about brains, esp. in a situation where important conclusions can be drawn and inspire others. This is also my chance to transmit an important message about the school system. I claim that Trump is a child of modern schooling. In part, schooling might have damaged Trump. But more importantly, schooling damaged the electorate that Trump can now easily play with his social tricks.
</p><p>Secondly, we can't escape semi-professional psychiatric diagnosis and/or hypothesizing. Hillary 2016 was also a subject of wild hypotheses. At some point a strong meme started circulating the net: she suffered a serious brain trauma in a fall. Allegedly, she was no longer fit to be president.
</p><p>I was a subject of a pop diagnosis too. My own odd behavior was at times explained by my colleagues as a result of growing up without a father. I disagree: I had a dad and two moms (with my older siblings playing the roles). I was also a subject of a wild hypothesis that my <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Can_incremental_reading_cause_brain_damage%3F" title="Can incremental reading cause brain damage?">brain may have been injured</a> by decades of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading" title="Incremental reading">incremental reading</a>. That diagnosis makes me grin and giggle. The childish side of my personality makes me enjoy that kind of anxious theory. Most importantly, such a misdiagnosis is a fantastic ground for inspiration and further analysis.

<h3><span id="Trump.27s_brain_is_good">Trump's brain is good</span></h3>
<p>Opponents may hate to admit it, but Trump's brain is strong and his success is attributable to his brain properties.
</p><p>Most of the criticism of Trump's brain comes from the fact that we have set up a set of standards that we believe world leaders should live up to. They range from moral standards to <a href="https://www.theringer.com/tech/2017/8/30/16224184/president-trump-twitter-spelling">spelling</a>. In psychiatry, we should always divide abnormal behavior into two categories: (1) <b>deviant</b> and (2) <b>maladaptive</b>. In addition, we need to separate (1) cognitive <b>tradeoff</b> from (2) cognitive <b>pathology</b>.
</p><p>Trump meets all the criteria of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder">narcissistic personality disorder</a> except for one key factor: his narcissism does not lead to a significant impairment in functioning (in the light of his own goals). Just the opposite. Trump can use his bombast to his advantage. It might be a classic compensation via training. All healthy brains are capable of an excellent adaptation to the environment. Trump's brain has adapted to compensate for a great deal of bullets taken straight from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-5">DSM-5</a>.
</p><p>Trump is highly deviant, but his adaptation is excellent. He won the presidency. If an individual with a set of maladaptive traits could achieve that, we should fear for the future of democracy. Trump is also high on cognitive tradeoffs: he is strong at spotting patterns, and this characteristic always comes with a high disregard for detail. This is a typical cognitive tradeoff.
</p><p>In summary, Trump's brain is strong. A strong brain does not prevent one from being a freak.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>While developing the firmware for Winterbloom's <a href="https://github.com/theacodes/Winterbloom_Castor_and_Pollux">Castor &amp; Pollux</a>, I got very curious as to just what the Microchip/Atmel-provided linker script was doing.</p>
<p>If you've never heard of or seen a linker script before you're not alone. Most of us never even have to think about them, however, on memory constained embedded devices it's not uncommon to need to modify the default linker script.</p>
<p>The linker script controls how <code>ld</code> combines all of your <code>.o</code> files into a single <code>.elf</code> and how that resulting <code>.elf</code> file gets loaded by the target processor.</p>
<p>So I was staring at this script that made absolutely no sense to me. It's filled with incantations and mysterious symbols and there's no indication of what they're for or where they come from.</p>
<p>So I did a <strong>lot</strong> of research and now I can present to you <strong>the most thoroughly commented linker script</strong><sup id="fnref:probably"><a href="#fn:probably">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>You can see this script in its entirety, comments and all, on <a href="https://github.com/theacodes/Winterbloom_Castor_and_Pollux/blob/master/firmware/scripts/samd21g18a.ld">GitHub</a>. But if you'd like to read it here instead it's transcribed below.</p>
<h2 id="output-format">Output format</h2>
<p>Output format sets the ELF output format to use a specific BFD backend.</p>
<p>The first is the default BFD. The second and third arguments are used
when big (-EB) or little (-EL) endian is requested.</p>
<p>Since the SAM D series are configured with only little endian support,
"elf32-littlearm" is used across the board. This option seems to be
included by Atmel/Microchip out of an abundance of caution, as
arm-none-eabi-ld will do the right thing and use "elf32-littlearm" by
default.</p>
<p>The list of acceptable values can be obtained using <code>objdump -i</code>.</p>

<p>These variables are used by the following "MEMORY" command to define
the various memory spaces.</p>
<p>For the SAMD21G18A used by this project, the available Flash is
262kB and the available SRAM is 32kB.</p>
<p>This project also reserves 8kB for the bootloader and 1kB for
"non-volatile memory" (NVM) - which is used by the application
to store calibration and user settings.</p>

<p>ARM Cortex-M processors use a descending stack and generally
require stack space to be set aside in RAM.</p>
<p>The application's behavior determines just how much stack space
should be reserved. I generally start with 2kB (0x800) of
stack space for Cortex-M0+ projects programmed in C .</p>
<p>You can analyze stack usage in GCC using the <code>-fstack-usage</code>
flag and you can enable compiler warnings for stack usage
with <code>-Wstack-usage=STACK_SIZE</code>.</p>

<h2 id="memory-space-definition">Memory space definition</h2>
<p>This section declare blocks of memories for specific purposes. Since an
ARM's address space is generally split between Flash, SRAM, peripherals,
and other regions, it's necessary to tell the linker where different
types of data can go in the address space.</p>
<p>These blocks will be used in the <code>SECTIONS</code> command below.</p>

</pre>
<p>Start with the Flash memory region. On the SAMD21, Flash starts at
the beginning of the address space (<code>0x00000000</code>) and is contiguous
right up to the size of the Flash. Flash is marked a <code>rx</code> so
that the linker knows that this space is read-only (<code>r</code>) and
executable (<code>x</code>).</p>
<p>The "bootloader" section allows this firmware to work with the uf2
bootloader. The bootloader takes the first 0x2000 bytes of flash
memory.</p>

</pre>
<p>Following the bootloader is the flash memory used by the application,
called "rom" here - even though it's flash, the name is just a name
and doesn't carry special meaning.</p>
<p>The total length of the rom block is the MCU's flash size minus the
bootloader's size and any space reserved for "non-volatile memory"
by the application.</p>

</pre>
<p>The "nvm" block is space set aside for the application to store
user settings and calibration data in the MCU's flash.</p>
<p>The block is located right at the end of the flash space. This
is useful because it means that it says in a fixed location
regardless of how much flash space the application takes up
in "rom". Explicitly defining this section also lets the
linker ensure that application code doesn't overwrite the
data in this region.</p>
<p>This block is marked as read-only (<code>r</code>) because flash can not
be written in the same way as normal memory, however, the
application can use the SAMD's NVM peripheral to write data in
this region.</p>

<p>The "ram" block is mapped to the CPU's SRAM and it's where
the stack, heap, and all variables will go.</p>
<p>For the SAMD21, SRAM starts at 0x20000000 and is contiguous
for the size of the SRAM.</p>

<h2 id="sections">Sections</h2>
<p>The sections command tells the linker how to combine the
input files into an output ELF and where segments belong
in memory.</p>
<p>The linker takes a set of input files containing the "input
sections" and uses this to map them to "output sections"
which are placed in the output ELF file.</p>
<p>While the most important sections to think about here
are the ones that'll be placed into the memory (segments)
some sections are just placed in the output ELF for debugging.</p>

<p>The vector table defines the initial stack pointer and
interrupt/exception routines for the ARM CPU and device
peripherals. Every Cortex-M project needs this.</p>
<p>For the SAM D series the vector table is expected
to be at address 0x00000000 after reset. Since
flash memory starts at 0x00000000, the first values
in flash should be the vector table.</p>
<p>When defining the vector table in code you must use
<code>__attribute__ ((section(".vectors")))</code> to tell
GCC to place the vector table into the section
named ".vectors" in the input object file so that
the linker can find it.</p>
<p>Note that since this project uses the UF2 bootloader,
this actually gets placed at the beginning of the
program's flash area (0x2000). The Cortex-M allows
changing the vector table after initialization,
so the startup script sets the Vector Table Offset
Register (<code>SCB-&gt;VTOR</code>) to <code>_sfixed</code> during its
intialization. The <code>_efixed</code> symbol is unused but
included for completeness.</p>

<p>Include code and read-only data sections from all
input files.</p>
<p>By default, GCC places all program code into a section named
".text" and read-only data (such as const static variables) into
a section named ".rodata" in the input object files. This naming
convention is from the ELF ABI specification.</p>
<p>GCC generates three "flavors" of sections in object files:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.{section}</code>: the basic section.</li>
<li><code>.{section}.*</code>: sections generated by <code>-ffunction-sections</code> and
<code>-fdata-sections</code> so that each function/data has a unique
section.</li>
<li><code>.gnu.linkonce.{type}.*</code>: sections generated by GCC so the
linker can remove duplicates. Seems to be related to
Vague Linking.</li>

          <center><h2>Open Source Archetypes:<br>A Framework For Purposeful Open Source</h2></center>

          <p>“Open source” means many things to many people.  Many kinds
          of projects get grouped under the label "open source", and
          they may operate in very different ways.  Sometimes it helps to think
          through how an effort’s open source approach matches its
          goals, resources, and environment.  Our
          <a href="https://opentechstrategies.com/archetypes-files/open-source-archetypes-v2.pdf">field guide to Open Source Archetypes</a> is designed to help
          with that thinking, by providing a common vocabulary to
          discuss open source in ways that take account of important
          differences.</p>

          <p>The guide describes and compares a number of project
          archetypes we have observed.  We prepared it in partnership
          with <a href="https://mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>, and our
          organizations (as well
          as <a href="https://blog.jwf.io/2020/11/open-source-archetypes-unicef-open-source/">others</a>) have found it useful in deciding how to invest
          in open source endeavors.</p>

          <p>We hope it is useful to you as you design open source
          initiatives, weigh tradeoffs in strategy, and pick metrics to
          track success. The archetypes we list are useful comparison
          points for anybody trying to maximize the benefits of their
          open source investment.</p>

<section id=""><div><p>Anyone versed in the utopian strain of contemporary science fiction needs no introduction to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Stanley_Robinson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kim Stanley Robinson’s</a> work. No living author has spent as much of his oeuvre grappling with the idea, its implications, and its achievability.</p>
<p><em>Pacific Edge</em>, his third novel (published in 1990), predates the Mars series he’s best known for and introduces many of the themes that permeate his later work<em>.</em> A deceptively low-stakes story of infatuation and heartbreak set against the backdrop of small town civic life in Orange County circa 2065, it paints a quietly powerful portrait of a California recovering from the excesses of late capitalism, but (this being America) still negotiating a balance between commerce, community, and the land.</p>
<p>It has never been more relevant. Here are some choice excerpts. ☼</p>

<section id=""><div><p>“For now, all is calm. White flakes falling. I write in a kind of pocket utopia, a little island of calm in a maddened world. Perhaps it will help make my future seem more plausible to me—perhaps, remembering Switzerland, it will even seem possible. But there’s no such thing as a pocket utopia.”</p>
<p>✳︎ ✳︎ ✳︎</p>
<p>“I hated capitalism because it was a lie!” Tom would say, fording Harding Canyon stream with abandon. “It said that everyone exercising their self-interest would make a decent community! Such a lie!” Splash, splash! “It was government as protection agency, a belief system for the rich. Why, even when it seemed to work, where did it leave them? Holed up in mansions and crazy as loons.” “But some people like to be alone.” “Yeah, yeah. And self-interest exists, no one can say it doesn’t—the governments that tried got in deep trouble, because that’s a lie of a different kind. But to say self-interest is all that exists, or that it should be given free rein! My Lord. Believe that and nothing matters but money.” “But you changed that,” Kevin would say, watching his footwork. “Yes, we did. We gave self-interest some room to work in, but we limited it. Channeled it toward the common good. That’s the job of the law, as we saw it then.” He laughed. “Legislation is a revolutionary power, boy, though it’s seldom seen as such. We used it for all it was worth, and most liked the results, except for some of the rich, who fought like wolverines to hold on to what they had. In fact that’s a fight that’s still going on. I don’t think it will ever end.”</p>

<section id=""><p>“We are the aristocracy of the world. But this time the revolution will bring down more than the aristocracy. Could be everything. Crumpled newspaper, compartmentalized disaster. Catastrophe by percentage points. We can avoid it, I swear we can. Must concentrate on that to be able to continue.”</p>

<section id=""><div><p>“We can protest, I say. Pam shakes her head, mouth bitter. Picks up In’tl Herald Tribune. Southern Club defaulting on all debt. Prediction of twenty-five percent reduction in world population called optimistic by. Civil war in India, in Mexico, in. Deforestation in. World temperature up another degree Centigrade since. Species going extinct— I’ve already read it.”</p>
<p>✳︎ ✳︎ ✳︎</p>
<p>“My daily workload reminds me constantly that in fact it exists entangled in intricate webs of law. Their system is a mix, combining a communalism of the Santa Rosa model—land and public utilities owned in common, residents required to do ten hours a week of town work, a couple of town-owned businesses in operation to use all the labor available, that sort of thing—with aspects of the new federal model: residents are taxed more and more heavily as they approach the personal income cap, and they can direct 60 percent of their taxes to whatever services they support the most. Businesses based in town are subject to the same sort of graduated system. I am familiar with much of this from my years in Bishop, which has a similar system. As usual in these set-ups, the town is fairly wealthy, even if it is avoided by businesses looking for the best break possible. From all the income generated, a town share is distributed back out to the citizens, which comes to about twice the national income floor. But people still complain that it isn’t higher. Everyone wants to be a hundred. And here they believe that a properly run town could make everyone hit the cap as a matter of course. Thus there is the kind of intense involvement with town politics typical of these set-ups, government mixed with business mixed with life-styles, etc.”</p>
<p>✳︎ ✳︎ ✳︎</p>
<p>“What a cheat utopias are, no wonder people hate them. Engineer some fresh start, an island, a new continent, dispossess them, give them a new planet sure! So they don’t have to deal with our history. Ever since More they’ve been doing it: rupture, clean cut, fresh start. So the utopias in books are pocket utopias too. Ahistorical, static, why should we read them? They don’t speak to us trapped in this world as we are, we look at them in the same way we look at the pretty inside of a paperweight, snow drifting down, so what? It may be nice but we’re stuck here and no one’s going to give us a fresh start, we have to deal with history as it stands, no freer than a wedge in a crack.”</p>
</div>

<section id=""><p>“Must redefine utopia. It isn’t the perfect end-product of our wishes, define it so and it deserves the scorn of those who sneer when they hear the word. No. Utopia is the process of making a better world, the name for one path history can take, a dynamic, tumultuous, agonizing process, with no end. Struggle forever. Compare it to the present course of history. If you can.”</p>

<section id=""><div><p>“Kevin listened to the wind, and looked around at the dark peaks poking into the night sky. Suddenly it was clear to him that Sally had had a reason to bring them up here to have this talk; that this place itself was part of the discourse, part of what she wanted to say. The university of the wilderness. The spine of California, the hidden source of the south’s wealth. This hard wild place.”</p>
<p>✳︎ ✳︎ ✳︎</p>
<p>“She saw the doggie look on my face, smiled. “So how’d the book go?” “The same.” It’s not fair, really. I can’t understand a word she says when she talks of her work, while for me, on this project at least, she is a crucial sounding board. “I’m thinking of alternating chapters of fiction with essay chapters which discuss the political and economic problems we need to solve.” “My God.” Wrinkled nose, as if something gone bad in fridge. “Hey, H.G. Wells did it.” “Which book?” “Well—one of the major utopian novels.” “Still in print?” “No.” “Libraries have it?” “University libraries.” “So Wells’s science fiction adventures are still in every library and bookstore, while this major utopia with the essays is long gone, and you can’t even remember the title?” I changed the subject. Think I might pass on the essays.”</p>
<p>✳︎ ✳︎ ✳︎</p>
<p>“They stepped and balanced, hopped and teetered. Occasionally they bumped together, arm to arm. Their skin was warm in the sun. They talked about this and that, and Kevin felt certain boundaries disappearing. Ramona was willing to talk about anything, now, about things beyond the present moment. Childhoods in El Modena and at the beach. The boats offshore. Their work. The people they knew. The huge rocks jumbled under them: “Where did they come from, anyway?” They didn’t know. It didn’t matter. What do you talk about when you’re falling in love? It doesn’t matter. All the questions are, Who are you? How do you think? Are you like me? Will you love me? And all the answers are, I am like this, like this, like this. I am like you. I like you.”</p>

<section id=""><p>Strange, this life, isn’t it? We think, nothing could ever get more real than this! Then this becomes nothing more than a darting fragmentary complex of pure mentation, while a new reality, more real than ever! steps in to obscure all previous candidates. I never get used to it.</p>

<section id=""><div><p>“Been on plane four hours now. Liddy finally asleep. Tapping on lap keyboard. Might as well distract myself. Strategies for changing history. Invent the history leading out of this world (please) into the world of the book. Causes of utopian process gaining upper hand. Words scroll up and disappear forever, like days. Lincoln not assassinated, no, no, we know it didn’t happen that way, we know we can’t take that road. Not useful. Someone appears to lead us, no! No Great Man theory here. No individual can save us. Together or not at all. Together or nothing. Ah, Pamela— Some group. In power or out. Act together. Say lawyers, the law? Still can’t escape the feeling that there’s where a difference could be made, despite my own experience. Remake the law of the land. Say a whole class of Harvard Law School, class of ’12 goes out to fill posts of all kinds, government, World Bank, IMF, Pentagon. Save the twenty-first century. Plausible? No. A story. But at least it’s possible, I mean we could do it! Nothing stopping us but inertia, ideology. Lack of imagination! Teachers, religious leaders&nbsp;… but there are few politically active people in any group. And to agree on a whole program of action, all of them. How implausible can something be before it’s useless? It’s conspiracy theory, really. We don’t need that either. History changed by a popular book, a utopia, everyone reads it and it has ideas, or vague pokes in the direction of ideas, it changes their thinking, everyone starts working for a better world— Getting desperate. Marcuse: one of the worst signs of our danger is we can’t imagine the route from here to utopia. No way to get there. Take the first step and you’re there. Process, dynamism, the way is the life.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>In my quest for designing a universal representation of code across all programming languages, I've been trying to build a deeper understanding of advanced language features. One feature that stands out is TypeScript's advanced type system, which allows types to be computed from other types. First, let's go through a quick intro, then we'll see how it could be interpreted in a different way.</p>
<h2>Introduction to TypeScript</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">TypeScript</a> is a powerful type system for JavaScript. It lets you catch issues early in the development process, such as accessing the wrong property of an object or passing an invalid function argument:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>type</span> User <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  name<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span>
  login<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span>
  age<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>,</span>
  comments<span>:</span> Comment<span>[</span><span>]</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>

<span>function</span> <span>greet</span><span>(</span><span>user<span>:</span> User</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>alert</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Hi </span><span><span>${</span>user<span>.</span>firstName<span>}</span></span><span>!</span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  
<span>}</span>

<span>greet</span><span>(</span><span>"Bob"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>TypeScript offers advanced features such as string literal types and unions. Here is an example in action:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>type</span> Color <span>=</span> <span>'white'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'red'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'green'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'yellow'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'blue'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'black'</span><span>;</span>

<span>function</span> <span>fill</span><span>(</span><span>color<span>:</span> Color</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  
<span>}</span>

<span>fill</span><span>(</span><span>'green'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>


<span>fill</span><span>(</span><span>'rainbow'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Generic types in TypeScript</h2>
<p>What makes TypeScript particularly useful is its support for generic types, which let you manipulate and transform types.</p>
<p>Here is one example with the generic type <code>Pick</code> from the <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">official docs</a>. <code>Pick</code> allows you to define a type that has specific keys in common with another type. This can be useful when you want to make sure that two types stay consistent with each other:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>type</span> Pick<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>K</span> <span>extends</span> <span>keyof</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>[</span><span>P</span> <span>in</span> <span>K</span><span>]</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>[</span><span>P</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>

<span>type</span> User <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  name<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span>
  login<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span>
  age<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>,</span>
  comments<span>:</span> Comment<span>[</span><span>]</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>

<span>type</span> UserPreview <span>=</span> Pick<span>&lt;</span>User<span>,</span> <span>'name'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'age'</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>


<span>type</span> UserPreview <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  name<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span>
  age<span>:</span> <span>number</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Explaining the Pick generic type</h2>
<p>TypeScript's type manipulation syntax can be quite difficult to grasp. If you're struggling to understand what <code>Pick</code> does, you're not alone.</p>
<p>Let's decompose it to understand exactly what it does:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>Pick&lt;T, K&gt;</code> means that <code>Pick</code> expects two type parameters which we name <code>T</code> and <code>K</code>. We could just as well have named them <code>Foo</code> and <code>Bar</code> if we wanted to. Using single-letter type names is only a convention.</li>
<li><code>K extends keyof T</code> means that a type passed as <code>K</code> must be a subset of the type of keys of <code>T</code> (<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html#generic-constraints" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">see generic constraints</a>).</li>
<li><code>[P in K]: X</code> means that for each possible value <code>P</code> in <code>K</code>, we declare a property <code>P</code> of type <code>X</code> (<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#mapped-types" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">see mapped types</a>).</li>
<li><code>T[P]</code> means that we look up the type of the property <code>P</code> of type <code>T</code> (<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/indexed-access-types.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">see indexed access types</a>).</li>
</ol>
<p>In our example, we invoked <code>Pick&lt;User, 'name' | 'age'&gt;</code> which means:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>T</span> <span>=</span> User
<span>K</span> <span>=</span> <span>'name'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'age'</span>
<span>keyof</span> <span>T</span> <span>=</span> <span>'name'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'login'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'age'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'comments'</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>K</code> is indeed a subset of <code>keyof T</code>, so the condition specified in (2) is satisfied.</p>
<p>The possible values of <code>P</code> are <code>'name'</code> and <code>'age'</code> so:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>type</span> UserPreview <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>[</span><span>'name'</span><span>]</span><span>:</span> User<span>[</span><span>'name'</span><span>]</span><span>,</span>
  <span>[</span><span>'age'</span><span>]</span><span>:</span> User<span>[</span><span>'age'</span><span>]</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Since <code>User['name']</code> is <code>string</code> and <code>User['age']</code> is <code>number</code>, the resulting type is indeed:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>type</span> UserPreview <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>[</span><span>'name'</span><span>]</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span>
  <span>[</span><span>'age'</span><span>]</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is equivalent to what we had earlier:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>type</span> UserPreview <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  name<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span>
  age<span>:</span> <span>number</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>The Return generic type</h2>
<p>Here is another example. <code>Return&lt;T&gt;</code> lets you extract the return type of a function:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>type</span> Return<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>T</span> <span>extends</span> <span>(</span><span><span>...</span>args<span>:</span> <span>any</span><span>[</span><span>]</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> infer <span>R</span> <span>?</span> <span>R</span> <span>:</span> <span>never</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let's decompose this one:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Return&lt;T&gt;</code> means that it expects a single type parameter.</li>
<li><code>T extends X ? A : B</code> means that that if <code>T</code> "extends" <code>X</code>, the generic type will return <code>A</code>, otherwise <code>B</code> (<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-8.html#conditional-types" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">see conditional type</a>).</li>
<li><code>(...args: any[]) =&gt; infer R</code> represents any function (any number of arguments of any type). The <code>infer</code> keyword here allows us to refer to the function's return type as <code>R</code> (<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-8.html#type-inference-in-conditional-types" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">see inferred types</a>).</li>
<li><code>never</code> is a type of values that never occur. There are no possible values of type <code>never</code>, not even <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code> (<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html#never" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">see basic types</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>If we pass it a function type, we'll get its return type:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>123</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>type</span> Example <span>=</span> Return<span>&lt;</span><span>typeof</span> f<span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>


<span>type</span> Example <span>=</span> <span>number</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>On the other hand if we pass it a type that doesn't represent a function, we'll get <code>never</code>:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>type</span> Example <span>=</span> Return<span>&lt;</span><span>number</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>  </code></pre></div>
<p>The examples we've just seen are, perhaps surprisingly, fairly simple generic types. It can get complicated quite quickly, to the point where <a href="https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">TypeScript challenges have emerged</a>. In fact, TypeScript's type system is powerful enough to be <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/14833" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Turing Complete</a>.</p>
<h2>A different perspective</h2>
<p>As part of my research into <a href="https://fwouts.com/projects" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Graphene</a>, I started exploring the meaning of generic types a little deeper. One particular analogy I wanted to explore was the difference between functions and generic types. Can we see types as values, and generic types as type-level functions?</p>
<h3>Types as values</h3>
<p>First, it's worth noting that a type definition looks a lot like a value. Notice the similarity between:</p>
<p><em>A variable assignment in JavaScript</em></p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>let</span> user <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  name<span>:</span> <span>"Bob"</span><span>,</span>
  login<span>:</span> <span>"robert"</span><span>,</span>
  age<span>:</span> <span>30</span><span>,</span>
  comments<span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p><em>A corresponding type declaration in TypeScript</em></p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>type</span> User <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  name<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span>
  login<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span>
  age<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>,</span>
  comments<span>:</span> Comment<span>[</span><span>]</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can think of <code>User</code> as a value, which is composed of other values such as <code>string</code>, <code>number</code> and <code>Comment[]</code>. They all belong to the same "space of types". Unlike JavaScript values, which exist at runtime, type values exist at compile time.</p>
<h3>Generic types as functions</h3>
<p>Next, let's look at generic types. Could we think of them as functions?</p>
<h4>Pick&lt;T, K&gt; as a function</h4>
<p>Let's look at our <code>Pick</code> example from earlier:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>type</span> Pick<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>K</span> <span>extends</span> <span>keyof</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>[</span><span>P</span> <span>in</span> <span>K</span><span>]</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>[</span><span>P</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If we consider types to be values, we could actually represent <code>Pick</code> as a function. Here is what that could look like, inspired from JavaScript's function syntax:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>function</span> <span>Pick</span><span>(</span><span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>K</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>K</span><span>.</span><span>extends</span><span>(</span><span>keyof</span><span>(</span><span>T</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>"K does not extend keyof T"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span><span>K</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span><span>P</span></span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>property</span><span>(</span><span>P</span><span>,</span> <span>T</span><span>.</span><span>getPropertyType</span><span>(</span><span>P</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Even better, we could get rid of the clumsy <code>throw</code> statement and use type annotations to describe the types <code>T</code> and <code>K</code>:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>function</span> <span>Pick</span><span>(</span><span><span>T</span><span>:</span> AnyType<span>,</span> <span>K</span><span>:</span> <span>keyof</span> <span>T</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span><span>K</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span><span>P</span></span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>property</span><span>(</span><span>P</span><span>,</span> <span>T</span><span>.</span><span>getPropertyType</span><span>(</span><span>P</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let's look at an invocation of our <code>Pick</code> function:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>Pick</span><span>(</span>User<span>,</span> <span>'name'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'age'</span><span>)</span>



<span>{</span>
  <span>...</span><span>(</span><span>'name'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'age'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span><span>P</span></span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>property</span><span>(</span><span>P</span><span>,</span> User<span>.</span><span>getPropertyType</span><span>(</span><span>P</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>



<span>{</span>
  name<span>:</span> User<span>[</span><span>'name'</span><span>]</span><span>,</span>
  age<span>:</span> User<span>[</span><span>'age'</span><span>]</span>
<span>}</span>



<span>{</span>
  name<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span>
  age<span>:</span> <span>number</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This produces exactly the type we expected.</p>
<h4>Return&lt;T&gt; as a function</h4>
<p>Now let's look at our <code>Return</code> type:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>type</span> Return<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>T</span> <span>extends</span> <span>(</span><span><span>...</span>args<span>:</span> <span>any</span><span>[</span><span>]</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> infer <span>R</span> <span>?</span> <span>R</span> <span>:</span> <span>never</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Again, we can rewrite it as a function:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>function</span> <span>Return</span><span>(</span><span><span>T</span><span>:</span> AnyType</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>T</span><span>.</span><span>isFunctionType</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>T</span><span>.</span><span>getArgumentTypes</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>extends</span><span>(</span>AnyType<span>[</span><span>]</span><span>)</span>
    <span>?</span> <span>T</span><span>.</span><span>getReturnType</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
  	<span>:</span> <span>never</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In fact, since we don't care about argument types, we can write the more elegant:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>function</span> <span>Return</span><span>(</span><span><span>T</span><span>:</span> AnyType</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>T</span><span>.</span><span>isFunctionType</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>?</span> <span>T</span><span>.</span><span>getReturnType</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>never</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Recursion and types</h2>
<p>One potentially challenging aspect of types is that they can be recursive. Here is a <code>LinkedList</code> type:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>type</span> LinkedList <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  value<span>:</span> <span>any</span><span>,</span>
  next<span>:</span> LinkedList <span>|</span> <span>null</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The equivalent value would be illegal in JavaScript:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>const</span> LinkedList <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  value<span>:</span> <span>'any'</span><span>,</span>
  next<span>:</span> <span>or</span><span>(</span>LinkedList<span>,</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>However, the only reason why this is illegal is because JavaScript is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eager_evaluation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">eagerly evaluated</a>. That is, a value is evaluated as soon as it's expressed.</p>
<p>Types are different. It is perfectly fine for a type to be self-referential in TypeScript. You could say that types are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">lazily evaluated</a>. In fact, you'll find that our "type functions" have no mutable variables or side-effects, i.e. they are pure functions. We could think of the TypeScript type system as a purely functional, lazy-evaluated language!</p>
<h2>Final words</h2>
<p>Let's summarise our findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Types can be thought of as abstract values and generic types as pure functions on these values.</li>
<li>The TypeScript type system is its own lazily evaluated language.</li>
<li>We've come up with an alternative syntax for generic types, using <code>type function</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>TypeScript's generic types are well know for their <a href="https://github.com/ghoullier/awesome-template-literal-types" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">fairly unreadable syntax</a>. I wonder if we could leverage these insights to make TypeScript more readable, and perhaps unlock even more powerful generic types?</p>

"Roboto" will be re-downloaded for every site, regardless of it being cached.</p><p>When self-hosting, ensure you cache your font with the <code>Cache-Control</code> HTTP header. <code>immutable</code> tells the browser the file will never change. When a request is made within the <code>max-age</code> (1 year), it avoids the roundtrip to ensure it's the latest content.</p><pre><code>Cache-Control: public, immutable, max-age<span>=</span><span>31536000</span>
</code></pre><p>If you need Google Fonts, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://csswizardry.com/2020/05/the-fastest-google-fonts/">use these optimizations</a>. With the latest changes in the v2 API, you can tailor fonts to specific users and platforms (including variable fonts).</p><h2 id="preloading">Preloading</h2><p>The browser assigns <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://web.dev/prioritize-resources/">loading priorities</a> to different types of resources. By default, CSS will be loaded before scripts and images. You can influence the importance of resources by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://web.dev/preload-critical-assets/">preloading critical assets</a>.</p><p>Fonts are discovered late by the browser by default. By preloading, we fetch the font file as soon as possible. Then, the browser caches the font making it available immediately.</p><p>Preloading can improve performance metrics like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://web.dev/interactive">Time to Interactive</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://web.dev/first-contentful-paint">First Contentful Paint</a>. For example, Shopify saw a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/ShopifyEng/status/844245243948163072">50% (1.2 second) improvement</a> in First Contentful Paint, removing their Flash of Invisible Text (FOIT).</p><p>As of 2020, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/fonts">75% of web fonts use WOFF2</a>. You likely only need this. For example:</p><pre><code>&lt;link
    rel=<span>"preload"</span>
    href=<span>"/fonts/inter-var-latin.woff2"</span>
    as=<span>"font"</span>
    type=<span>"font/woff2"</span>

</code></pre><blockquote><p>Support: All modern browsers except Firefox.</p></blockquote><h2 id="font-display">Font Display</h2><p><code>font-display</code> allows you to modify the rendering behavior of web fonts with values such as <code>auto</code>, <code>swap</code>, <code>block</code>, <code>fallback</code> and <code>optional</code>. When loading web fonts, we want to prevent <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://web.dev/cls/">layout shift</a>. This occurs in two ways:</p><ul><li>Flash of Unstyled Text (FOUT) â€” The fallback font is swapped with a new font (e.g. <code>swap</code>).</li><li>Flash of Invisible Text (FOIT) â€” Invisible text is shown on the page until a new font is rendered (e.g. <code>block</code>).</li></ul><p>Browsers currently have a default strategy similar to <code>block</code>. The only option that eliminates layout shift is <code>optional</code>. Combined with the other performance optimizations in this article, <code>optional</code> is your best choice.</p><pre><code><span><span>@font-face</span></span> <span>{</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-179"><div><p>I took a deep dive on freemium pricing and decided to document it in this post. Why freemium? I think it’s how the little guys can win against market leaders.</p><p>Basically, it’s how you kill a unicorn.</p><p>Notion, Figma, Canva, Mailchimp, and Segment. What do all of these platforms have in common, besides being category leaders? Each one has unseated the previous category leaders with less money and smaller teams. Each has also opted for a product led growth strategy that is fueled by product virality and an innovative pricing strategy.</p><p>But let’s back up. How did we get here?</p><p>The year is 2012 and the preeminent name in design isn’t Sketch or Figma – it’s Adobe. 2012 era Adobe is a much different beast to where we are now. There was no real SaaS model and licenses were hundreds of dollars each, locked to a machine, and didn’t get upgrades. Still, Adobe is unequivocally the category leader. But in just a few years, that would all change due to an enterprising young entrepreneur and her new business model.</p><p>Canva launched in 2012 and spread like wildfire. In 3 years, the company was able to accumulate accumulated 10 million users, with almost 1 million coming in the first year alone. By the next year, they had 17 thousand videos about their product.</p><p>This kind of fervent user adoption is the stuff of legend. I started hearing about Canva around that time. My then-girlfriend (now wife) had put together a project and it looked much better than anything I could knock out in Photoshop or Illustrator. She mentioned it was not only really easy to use, but it was free! At the time I think I was still bouncing from Adobe license to Adobe license, each of which was half a month’s rent, so I was blown away.</p><p>Then I started seeing it everywhere. It was being used for school projects, large advertising campaigns, and was the first recommendation in online groups whenever someone needed a design tool.</p><p>That space used to be occupied by Adobe, but in a matter of a few years, they were being overtaken in the B2C and even a bit in the B2B space by a brand new company with a limited amount of funding.</p><figure><img width="1024" height="570" src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-1024x570.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-1024x570.png 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-300x167.png 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-768x427.png 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1.png 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-1024x570.png" data-srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-1024x570.png 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-300x167.png 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-768x427.png 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1.png 1215w"></figure><figure><img width="1024" height="572" src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-1024x572.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-1024x572.png 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-300x167.png 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-768x429.png 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2.png 1227w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-1024x572.png" data-srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-1024x572.png 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-300x167.png 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-768x429.png 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2.png 1227w"></figure><p>Meanwhile, another company, Sketch, was eating away at their market share by offering design-focused tools for modern internet companies. Adobe had Photoshop and Illustrator, neither of which was purpose-built for the internet and both of which were expensive af. Adobe XD wasn’t quite production-ready at that point, so Sketch was able to make inroads by offering a lower-priced license for its software.</p><p>Out of left-field comes the Canva of professional design tools: Figma.</p><figure><img width="1024" height="565" src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-1024x565.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-1024x565.png 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-300x165.png 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-768x423.png 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3.png 1255w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-1024x565.png" data-srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-1024x565.png 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-300x165.png 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-768x423.png 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3.png 1255w"></figure><p>Figma quickly overtakes Sketch by offering a few unique features and an unbeatable pricing model. Freemium, with a twist.</p><p>Figma, like Canva before it, quickly discovered the power that a free product with shareable outputs offers. Users create content with the tool, share the content and then inevitably get asked how it was made. Of course, the user is both happy to share and give a positive recommendation since the output content is being appreciated, and the platform gains another user.</p><p>A couple points to understand about the shiny world of marketing:</p><ul><li>Recommendations from trusted people always lead to higher conversion rates. It’s easy to recommend free things since the only exchange is time.</li><li>Backlinks are everything, still. Google hasn’t cracked how to build page authority without backlinks and having them everywhere, attached with positive recommendations and high user dwell time once a user clicks a link, is seen as a positive signal.</li><li>Creating content in the app means content can be shared outside the app. That’s a simple growth mechanism that can be leveraged mightily once a certain user volume has been hit.</li><li>Finally, email is the best marketing channel still. Freemium platforms exchange email addresses for access and make lead generation a snap.</li></ul><p>So Adobe now is taking fire from all sides and they eventually pivot to a cloud-based subscription model while also focusing all their efforts upmarket on the professional landscape, effectively ceding their B2C audience to Canva.</p><p><em>Quick note: There are many other factors that go into making a platform successful, from the founder to tech to the support. Pricing is just one of the pieces.</em></p><h2><strong>How Freemium really works</strong></h2><p>The common misconception with freemium is that it’s an easy way to not generate any revenue. How many stories have you heard about independent projects that have been worked on for years, only to launch with only a few dollars in revenue, followed by months of slogging before eventually shutting down. That’s very likely&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;a pricing problem, but a positioning problem. You need to position your product in front of the right audiences and the price becomes a natural fit for your expansion strategy.</p><p>In reality, there are a number of different ingredients in the recipe you need to nail before you can actually execute a freemium strategy effectively. You don’t need a team of hundreds of people, but it does help to lay out the strategy ahead of time.</p><p>Let’s break out the different factors involved in setting up a freemium plan.</p><ul><li>Pricing that scales with usage</li><li>Shareable content</li><li>In-app upsells</li><li>Massive market opportunity</li><li>Pricing innovation on the primary value</li></ul><p>First, if you are missing even one of these, it might not be the pricing strategy for you. Each part is key in building out a converting freemium funnel.</p><p><strong>Pricing that scales with usage</strong></p><p>If a user wants to dip a toe in and play around with your platform, they can do that at zero cost (outside of an email address). That’s the basic premise of a freemium plan, but what happens when a user is converted and wants to expand their usage?</p><p>Your pricing should accommodate that natural urge and your product should gracefully allow them to expand their usage with as few barriers as possible.</p><p><strong>In-app upsells aka feature gating</strong></p><p>You need to rope off some of your app so there’s a reason to pay! However, you should charge based on either&nbsp;<strong>secondary user value or</strong>&nbsp;expanding the primary user value, but ideally both.</p><p>Let me explain. Google Analytics made analytics free and accessible to everyone. They charge based on primary user value, but only if you want to expand to a much higher tier of usage. For 99% of people, it will always be free.</p><p>That’s great, but really they only offer expanding their primary user value (analytics) as an upsell. Profitwell, one of my favorite companies utilizing this technique, charges entirely on secondary user value. They offer Profitwell Retain, a dunning service, on top of their analytics. Analytics are totally free. After all, you already have all your financial information integrated into it and onboarded your team.</p><p>Canva however offers all that and more. They let users expand their primary usage through additional templates, but also access other tools like scheduling posts on social media once you upgrade. Why pay 12K a year for Hootsuite when you can just upgrade Canva?</p><figure><img width="1024" height="673" src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-1024x673.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-1024x673.jpg 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-300x197.jpg 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-768x505.jpg 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-1536x1009.jpg 1536w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-2048x1346.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-1024x673.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-1024x673.jpg 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-300x197.jpg 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-768x505.jpg 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-1536x1009.jpg 1536w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-2048x1346.jpg 2048w"></figure><p>With each of these product incentives, users are motioned into the next stage of the tool.</p><p><strong>Shareable content</strong></p><p>This could be considered a growth loop, since we’re building in some type of publishing into the platform so users can share links. Our goal with shareable content is to increase the k factor of a user, effectively turning a free user into a marketing machine. Every time they create content in the app and share it externally, you have another potential opportunity for user acquisition which helps balance out the slightly lower conversion rate you’ll see with a freemium plan.</p><p>You can do this with reports, tables, images, videos, etc. If it can be shared inside a team, you should enable it to be published from your platform.</p><p><strong>Massive Market Opportunity</strong></p><p>Freemium works best when you can boil the ocean. No really, let it rip. The ocean should be a massive existing user base or the early signs of a large user base. You will need the volume to make it work with freemium pricing. Here are the TAMs for a few of the examples.</p><ul><li>Canva: Anyone that needs to create images.</li><li>Profitwell: Anyone that wants to know their businesses metrics</li><li>Google Optimize: Anyone that wants to test anything on their site.</li><li>Microsoft Teams: Anyone that uses Slack. 😉</li></ul><p>Each of these audience segments is huge and represents uniquely large opportunities. Freemium pricing becomes much more difficult to pull off once you have to compete for a small audience with specific needs. You want to create a product that will work with 90% of users.</p><p><strong>Pricing Innovation on Primary Value</strong></p><p>What does this mean?</p><p>A competitive advantage that can’t be innovated against. This is the most important point. How does Slack compete with Teams when users have Teams included in their subscription? How does Baremetrics compete with Profitwell when most of what Baremetrics offered is free with Profitwell?</p><p>Well…they don’t. Baremetrics sold. Slack sold. You can’t compete against freemium when you’re able to offer the primary value for free. The existing market leaders can’t match your pricing without giving up millions in recurring revenue and they’re not going to do that.</p><p>That’s how you beat Adobe or fill-in-the-blank industry behemoth.</p><p>Create a great competitor (the hardest part), offer the primary value for free, then monetize on expanding that primary value or offer a secondary value.</p><h2><strong>I want to be free</strong></h2><p>So I’m putting my money where my mouth is. I’m switching over all my projects to freemium.</p><p>As of today:</p><ul><li><a href="http://snazzy.ai/">Snazzy.ai</a>, content marketing powered by GPT-3, now has a free tier</li><li><a href="http://ga-insights.com/">GA-Insights.com</a>, all your ad networks into Slack, has a free tier being built out</li><li><a href="http://weld.ai/">Weld.ai</a>, in beta as a Supermetrics alternative, will now be completely free at launch.</li></ul><p>The riskiest part of a freemium pricing tier as a bootstrapped founder is getting the volume you need to make up any initial drop in conversion rate.</p><h2><strong>Reference: The market leaders (and the victims)</strong></h2><ul><li>Profitwell: Baremetrics, Chartmogul</li><li>Canva: Photoshop, Illustrator, Word</li><li>Google Optimize: Optimizely, VWO</li><li>Microsoft Teams: Slack</li><li>Figma: Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketch Invision</li></ul><p>Early freemium …</p></div></article></div>

The hegemony of the U.S. dollar has been weakened and the actions taken in 2020 may only be the beginning.</p><p>Considering that a collapse may be imminent, now might be a good time to take a look at the popular store of value assets. Today we have two strong assets that may serve us in that regard: Gold and Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p><p>Both have served as a financial instrument that safeguards against inflation, but which one is more efficient in 2020? Gold may have a long history, but that does not mean that the disruptive technology found in Bitcoin cannot serve as a better option.&nbsp;</p><p>In the following sections, we will showcase bullish cases for both Bitcoin and gold. Moreover, we will also explain why one option may be better than the other for long term investors.&nbsp;</p><p>But before disclosing that information, let’s first see why we have a strong demand for SoV’s and why scarcity is so important in an age where paper currency lost its value.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610405110242_12502"><div>

History then switched into a timeline where global economies were based entirely on pure fiat money, with limited reliance on gold.</p><p>Across all ages of human history, gold was used as the primary form of currency. Even when civilizations deemed gold to be too burdensome for transferring value, paper money backed 100% by gold was still used.</p><p>As we have already mentioned gold is a popular SoV option due to its supply-demand ratio, formally known as stock to flow ratio. The ‘stock’ of mined gold is too small compared to the existing supply, hence why it is the perfect option for storing value with yearly inflation of around 1.5%.</p><p>But with the aforementioned changes that Central Banks have made in the previous century, entire economies were completely redefined. With heavy reliance on the U.S. dollar, instead of gold, banks have paid a high price.&nbsp;</p><p>For many, the current system is based on nothing at all - no economic game theory that can support the value of fiat currencies. Countries like the U.S. are <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/money/2020/05/12/coronavirushow-u-s-printing-dollars-save-economy-during-crisis-fed/3038117001/"><span>senselessly printing money</span></a> to keep their economies afloat, in spite of future consequences.&nbsp;</p><p>Currencies resume losing value against each other while the value of commodities and assets keep increasing in an environment where salaries stay the same. As such, the purchasing power of a nation decreases while inflation rises.</p><p>In 2020 alone, the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2"><span>U.S. M2 money stock supply</span></a> has increased by 24%. With incoming stimulus bills and further financial injections, it is easy to conclude that the supply of money will resume growing.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1609787077522_11228"><div>

As a result, many individuals are turning to SoV assets such as Bitcoin or gold. But why is Bitcoin a good SoV and is it better than gold?</p><p>Bitcoin is far more than just imaginary digital money. In fact, the coins are backed by real monetary value which is kept stable by the asset’s limited supply. Bitcoin is often referred to as digital gold and has been used as an SoV on numerous occasions, but why?</p><p>The anonymous creator <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"><span>Satoshi Nakamoto designed Bitcoin</span></a> in such a way that it can generate only 21 million coins. This is the first efficient tier that gives value to Bitcoin, but is there anything else?</p><p>On BTC’s blockchain network, miners keep the system alive by validating transactions. In return, they are rewarded with Bitcoin for every block of transaction that is verified. For a sensible price evolution, Nakamoto added a <a href="https://www.bitcoinblockhalf.com/"><span>4-year system</span></a> in which mining rewards are halved.</p><p>By doing so, Nakamoto made it possible for Bitcoin’s mineable coins to always remain drastically lower compared to the existing circulating supply. On that account, the leading cryptocurrency behaves exactly like gold as it keeps a stable stock-to-flow ratio.&nbsp;</p><p>With incredibly high scarcity, fungibility, portability, and divisibility, Bitcoin is a clear contender in the area of store-of-value assets.&nbsp;</p><p>As a matter of fact, three of these features are considered to be the properties of good money. But are the aforementioned features better in the case of Bitcoin compared to gold?</p><p>Those who believe that Bitcoin is ‘digital gold’ have three great reasons. BTC is not only great for its scarcity and limited supply but for its other characteristics which have historically been used to describe ‘good money.’</p><p>Scarcity and durability may result in a good asset, but these features alone are not enough for a currency.&nbsp;</p><p>If you wanted an SoV, a currency, and a speculative financial instrument all in one asset then Bitcoin is a perfect choice. Here are three reasons why Bitcoin is better than gold in this context.</p><h2>Portability</h2><p>Portability is obviously the first aspect that comes to one’s mind when comparing these two assets. Portability is the main feature of a currency as it allows individuals to seamlessly transfer value without any difficulty.&nbsp;</p><p>It may be easier to transfer $1 million worth of gold compared to $1 million worth of oil but can we do better? Bitcoin is naturally superior compared to precious and rare metals when it comes to portability as it only takes a few clicks to transfer value.</p><p>One million worth of gold weighs around 220 pounds. Besides the weight, we also need to account for the means of transportation, carry load, and security.&nbsp;</p><p>Depending on where you want to ship gold, it might take days if not weeks to do so. Administrative problems such as documenting the transfer and dealing with customs is yet another problem.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1609787077522_16211"><div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="mw-content-text" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p><small>This text is part of: "<i><a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Problem_of_Schooling" title="Problem of Schooling">I would never send my kids to school</a></i>" by <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr_Wozniak" title="Piotr Wozniak">Piotr Wozniak</a> (2017)</small>

<h2><span id="The_main_problem_in_education">The main problem in education</span></h2>
<p>The main problem with regards to education is the belief that learning may cause displeasure, and that this displeasure should be <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/The_grind_is_the_glory" title="The grind is the glory">endured</a> to achieve more learning.
</p><p>There are countless educators who believe that school should be like work: it is unpleasant but it just needs to be done. In this chapter, I will explain that the opposite is true: 
</p>
<p><b>Good learning is inherently pleasurable</b>, and without pleasure there is no good learning.</p>
<p>The displeasure myth is so prevalent that even good teachers with an extensive understanding of the pleasures of learning believe that a degree of unhappiness at school is unavoidable.
</p><p>In this chapter, I show that the pleasure of learning is wired into the brain, and how we systematically destroy this <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Education_counteracts_evolution" title="Education counteracts evolution">gift of evolution</a> at the cost of mankind's health, learning, creativity, and ultimately future.
</p><p>The main problem of education is also one of the main problems of society. By destroying the pleasure of learning we are contributing powerfully to the destruction of the pleasure of living. We have built an education system that sets millions of people up for a life of unhappiness.
</p><p>Chances are you are skeptical of my words, as the myth of unpleasant learning is a potent side effect of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Schooling" title="Schooling">schooling</a>. Therefore this chapter is an attempt to convince you. And all that is necessary to abolish this myth is an understanding of the simple mechanism by which new knowledge is encoded in the brain. 
</p>
<h2><span id="Learn_drive_and_entropy">Learn drive and entropy</span></h2>
<p>The concept of entropy is helpful in understanding why most kids do not learn much at school.
</p><p>You may recall from your physics class that entropy is a measure of disorder, and that the second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases. This is the type of sexy law of physics that we tend to remember for life. It is <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Applicability" title="Applicability">universally applicable</a>.
</p><p>There is a sister concept in information theory called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)">Shannon entropy</a>. It can be understood as the average value of information transmitted by a source. For example, take a channel that is continually transmitting a string of identical letters into infinity (e.g. a string of As: "AAAAAA..."). It is entirely predictable and carries an entropy of zero. We do not learn from such a channel.
</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon">Claude Shannon</a> proposed the concept of information entropy in 1948. Soon after, scientists were hypothesizing as to whether the entropy of an information channel may have a powerful impact on how the brain perceives the value of the channel. In 1957, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Music_and_entropy" title="Music and entropy">Meyer hypothesized</a> that the entropy of music determines the perception of its beauty. He concluded that a higher entropy may result in subjective tension, which correlates with more meaningful musical moments.
</p><p>Meyer's thinking was <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Impact_of_syncopation_on_the_pleasure_of_music" title="Impact of syncopation on the pleasure of music">later refined</a> to better understand the perception of music and information in general. There is more to music than just information. This is visible through the phenomena of a song being entertaining and fun for many playbacks. But this is rarely the case with books.
</p><p>Music is a universal message. If you were given a choice of a radio channel, you would quickly tune out from noisy static and you would also not be too excited about zero entropy silence. However, most people will respond positively to a regular beat of a drum. As long as it wasn't being drummed on broken glass, which we are wired to dislike, we would find a radio channel with a regular drumbeat more interesting than a silent one. This will naturally last only for a while until the drumbeat itself becomes boring and too predictable.
</p><p>Today, we can finally test the response of the brain to information entropy. Neuroimaging shows that the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15896570">anterior hippocampus responds to the entropy of a visual stream</a>, and similar findings have been confirmed for the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3403290/">ventral striatum</a>. Therefore we are now certain that the brain responds to information entropy. The entropy sensor is important in scanning the environment for learning opportunities. This is the prelude to the reward that underlies the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive" title="Learn drive">learn drive</a>.
</p>
<h2><span id="Prior_knowledge_in_information_seeking">Prior knowledge in information seeking</span></h2>
<p>We need to distinguish between information and meaning. Entropy is not a good measure of the latter. The measure of meaning must involve the brain itself in addition to the information channel metric. Prior knowledge is essential in learning. Imagine that in your search for an interesting channel on the radio you find a news service. If the service is delivered in Thai and you do not speak Thai, you will prefer a service delivered in English. In information sense, news channels may have the same entropy, yet your prior knowledge will make you opt for the English channel. While the Thai channel delivers a stream of sounds, the English channel delivers a stream of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">concepts</a>. Without understanding the knowledge of the recipient, information entropy tells us little. We cannot determine a signal-to-noise ratio.
</p><p>Every listener will have his or her own preferred level of information entropy. For most music lovers, the regular beat of a disco or techno will be somewhat more interesting than the isolated beat of a drum. This type of music carries a higher average level of information. For a more sophisticated listener a bit of syncopation will be welcome. However, syncopation requires a degree of prior learning. Those with lesser knowledge of music may get confused with increased rhythmic complexity. If there is too much information in the beat it <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Impact_of_syncopation_on_the_pleasure_of_music" title="Impact of syncopation on the pleasure of music">may no longer be possible to dance to the music</a>. To an average ear, the genius of Wynton Marsalis may be hard to perceive. Top shelf jazz music is reserved for only a small fraction of highly educated listeners, as for most of the population, as the complexity increases, the music slowly disintegrates into the direction of radio static.
</p>
<h2><span id="Entropy_detectors_in_the_brain">Entropy detectors in the brain</span></h2>
<p>The brain cannot effectively detect the entropy of the signal hitting the retina or the eardrum. Like pixels of a monitor, retinal cells are not aware of what they display. If the detector, such as the hippocampus, is to light up in response to entropy, it must operate on the inputs from the entorhinal cortex (i.e. the input to the hippocampus itself). Those inputs will present the signal after a high degree of processing. Instead of pixels, it may present a concept. A high entropy signal at the sensory inputs will lose most of its noise component early in the process of neural selection, completion, and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Generalization" title="Generalization">generalization</a>. The signal-to-noise ratio will determine how much information is lost. The bigger the noise, the bigger the loss. The smarter we are, the more selective this processing will be and the more information will be lost at that stage. That's good. We become blind to detail. Pattern recognition will act like a deterministic function, which by definition, results in a drop in entropy. Complex patterns may become simple concepts. Those concepts will provide the actual input to the detector, e.g. the hippocampus.
</p><p>Note that the visual stream produced in experiments that prove the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15896570">response of the hippocampus to signal entropy</a> has a highly <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">symbolic nature</a>. As such, the stream will lose far less information in processing. That highly simplified and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Generalization" title="Generalization">conceptualized</a> message will be scanned for surprisal and provide guidance to the entire <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive" title="Learn drive">learn drive</a> system. This is why, in this case, the hippocampus appears to be responding to input entropy.
</p><p>The above reasoning explains why both low and high entropy sensory signals can be uninteresting. After a degree of processing, a high entropy signal may lose all its noise and deliver a low entropy input to the hippocampus. We then observe the illusion of an "optimum entropy" level at sensory input. We need a new concept, <b><a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learntropy" title="Learntropy">learntropy</a></b>, that will help us accurately determine the attractiveness of the signal. Learntropy needs to take into account the high degree of processing of information before it can activate reward centers in the brain. Learntropy is discussed <a href="#Learntropy">later</a> in this text.
</p>
<h2><span id="Speed_of_information_processing">Speed of information processing</span></h2>
<p>An under-appreciated factor in sensory information scanning is the speed of information processing in the brain.
</p><p>For every piece of music, there is a tolerable playback range where the beauty of the music is appreciated. A high speed playback can be annoying and the music may become hard to decode, as the high speed goes beyond our processing power. The same piece of music slowed down can quickly lose its appeal. The same happens in speech delivery or in classroom lecturing. For the same information and the same entropy level, we may accomplish highly different levels of signal attractiveness. There is always an optimum speed of delivery and that speed depends on all other factors that power the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive" title="Learn drive">learn drive</a>, incl. prior knowledge. As such, speed of delivery is highly individual.
</p><p>I like to listen to lectures at 1.4x speed. I use 1.3x for more ambitious pieces. I never speed up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fareed_Zakaria_GPS">Fareed Zakaria</a> though, but rather relish every piece of information in this show. Students in a classroom lecture do not have a speed-up or slow-down button. Even the pause button, if available, is hard to hit as it may annoy other students.
</p><p>In schools, all too often, the speed of delivery surpasses student's processing capacity. This results in negligible learning and high stress. There is no time to <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Futility_of_schooling" title="Futility of schooling">enjoy the landscapes in the window of a high-speed train</a>. At MIT they call it <i>"drinking from a firehose"</i>.
</p>
<h2><span id="Probability_vs._knowledge">Probability vs. knowledge</span></h2>
<p>Low probability events carry more information. Average information determines entropy. Prior knowledge determines the perception of an information channel's entropy.
</p><p>If you happen to tune in to radio news and you hear that "<i>Janet Jackson has delivered a baby</i>", your degree of interest will depend on the probability of the event. If you have no idea who Janet Jackson is, this is a high probability event. If some <a href="http://www.theworldcounts.com/stories/How-Many-Babies-Are-Born-Each-Day">350,000 women deliver babies every single day</a>, this is no longer news and is not new or …</p></div></div>

<h2>Reverse Engineering The Great Escape</h2>

<p><dfn>The Great Escape</dfn> is a classic 1986 prison break game for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum">48K ZX Spectrum</a>. I've spent a considerable amount of time reverse engineering its routines and documenting its workings while simultaneously reimplementing it as portable C code. The following pages describe the process I went through.</p>

<p>This is an expanded-upon write-up of some of what I can dimly recall saying while presenting <a href="http://slides.com/dpt/the-great-escape/#/">these slides</a> to my team at INSIDE Secure (formerly Metaforic, now called <a href="https://www.verimatrix.com/">Verimatrix</a>) in Glasgow at a talk in January 2016.</p>

          <p>In case anybody still has problems with App Store rejection due to Corona references in the meta data, I just ran into that problem when submitting an update for Ice Trap that was rejected because:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your app contains Corona references in the info_plist and other files in your binary, to what purpose does your app reference said subjects?</li>
<li>What are the steps needed to locate those references within your binary?</li>

<p>I replied the following and Apple was ok with it, and the update is now ready for sale:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason for “Corona references” in the plist file is because the game itself is built using the Corona 2D game engine which has existed for probably at least 10 years. See <a href="https://coronalabs.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://coronalabs.com</a>.</p>
<p>Since the Corona pandemic started, a rebranding of the Corona game engine has taken place and it is now known as Solar2D, see <a href="https://solar2d.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://solar2d.com/</a>.</p>
<p>However, a lot of the internal libraries and plugins used by the engine still contain the Corona name and/or the <a href="http://coronalabs.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">coronalabs.com</a> domain name. This is nothing that is ever exposed to the end users and there are definitely no connections or references to the Covid-19 virus, just a very unfortunate name collision.</p>
<p>Hope you have understanding, as there is nothing I can do to change that.</p>

It feels a bit crazy to be writing that and it also feels like we’re at a point of transition. </p><p>In many ways it feels like we’ve graduated—from being a pimply faced, early stage start-up teenager to a young company that’s blossoming into its potential. We’re undoubtedly more excited heading into 2021 than we’ve been at any point in our start-up journey so far.</p><p>This post serves as our four year update. Each of our previous updates, starting with our launch announcement, can be found below.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://www.outseta.com/posts/meet-our-new-software-start-up-outseta">Meet Our New Software Start-up, Outseta</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.outseta.com/posts/outseta-two-year-update">Outseta Two Year Update</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.outseta.com/posts/outseta-three-year-update">Outseta Three Year Update</a><br></p></li></ul><p>Let’s get right into the good stuff.</p><h2>Equity Allocation</h2><p>We’ve continued to use a very simple formula to distribute equity amongst our team—we all value our time at $100 per hour and anyone on our team can contribute cash to the company as well. At the end of each year we look at the total number of hours we’ve all worked plus the cash contributions we’ve each made and we use that to calculate how much equity we each hold in the business.</p><p>At the end of 2020 our equity allocation breaks down as:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Dimitris 36% </p></li><li><p>Dave 34% </p></li><li><p>Geoff 27%</p></li><li><p>James 3%</p></li></ul></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610145428502_5099"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610145428502_9440"><div><p>For the most part, we’ve continued to work primarily for sweat equity in the business so we can reinvest our revenue into the company. James, who works in a much more part-time capacity than the rest of us, has earned a mix of equity salary since he started working on Outseta. On September 1st of this year, I (Geoff) started drawing some salary from Outseta for the first time. We’d reached the point where we definitely needed more help and beginning to take some salary afforded me the opportunity to spend more time on Outseta and less time consulting. </p><p>It’s also worth noting the $1,572,200 number your see at the top of the 2020 column. Over four years this is really the cost of bringing a software product of Outseta’s scale to market. But as you’ll see as we get into our expenses, the vast majority of that figure would go towards salary that we haven’t taken.</p><h2>Expenses</h2><p>We’ve been really disciplined about keeping our expenses as low as possible since we started building Outseta. This goes back to our <a href="https://www.outseta.com/posts/outseta-saas-operating-agreement">operating agreement</a>, our desire to stay intentionally small, and our focus on profitability.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610145428502_12917"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610145428502_13209"><div><p>We’ve now spent a total of $123,335.23 on Outseta over the last four years. Our expenses have scaled up from about $8,000 in 2017 to about $57,000 in 2020. The primary driver of that increase was starting to draw some salary from Outseta this past year.</p><p>On the marketing front, we’ve focused almost exclusively on “free” marketing tactics to date—partnerships, content marketing, and email marketing. Our biggest lines items this past year were:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>$2,500 to be a Gold Partner with Makerpad</p></li><li><p>$1,200 for a Pro subscription to Wistia</p></li></ul><p>The partnership with Makerpad was a critical step for us as we increased our focus on serving the no-code community. And while Wistia is a significant line item, we use video liberally for both marketing and customer support—and they’re a team I’m nothing but happy to support.</p><p>All things considered, I think our expenses are a strong data point that you can bootstrap an extremely ambitious software product into existence for a lot less money than you might think. While $123,000 isn’t a small amount of money by any means, that’s spending incurred over four years.</p><h2>Marketing Results</h2><p>One of my favorite aspects of being a marketing founder is that I’ve gotten to build every aspect of our customer acquisition process from the ground up. I’ve used this, quite purposely, to prove a point I’ve always advocated for—the metrics marketers are most often held accountable to are bullshit.</p><p>Website traffic? Vanity metric. Twitter followers? Nonsense. MQLs? There’s just no value in arbitrary lead quotas. None. They hurt more than they help.</p><p>All that matters in marketing is how many buyers actually show up with buying intent. That’s it. Jay Acunzo captures this approach beautifully:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610211733556_13122"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610211733556_13422"><div><p>Our numbers reflect this approach. We have quite modest website traffic and our number of account sign-ups each month isn’t eye popping, but the quality of our leads is exceptional.  We get remarkably few low quality leads—I’d say at least 80% of our account sign-ups are founders of SaaS products or membership sites that are a great fit for Outseta. And if you think about it, that makes sense—almost all of our website traffic comes directly from Stripe, Webflow, IndieHackers, Makerpad, or content that I’ve written about bootstrapping subscription businesses. </p><p>With no pressure to hit some arbitrarily set marketing metrics, I haven’t had to turn to more “top of the funnel content” or other channels that would drive less qualified traffic to our site. And perhaps most importantly, this approach fits our strategy—because we want to stay intentionally small, from a resourcing perspective we’re better off with a lower volume of highly qualified leads than a higher volume of less qualified leads. </p><p>Here are our top performing lead generation channels.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610145428502_21408"><div>

The lead quality that I referenced is one reason, but more than anything I’m proud that our team has resisted the urge to invest in growth prematurely.</p><p><a href="https://www.outseta.com/posts/customer-success-unit-economics-then-growth">Custom Success. Unit Economics. Then Growth. </a></p><p>This framework from Mark Roberge is by far the most important piece of start-up advice that I pass on to everyone who will listen, and we’ve truly held ourselves accountable to it. Our product and conversation rates simply didn’t warrant heavy investments in growth until recently. </p><p>Could we have grown a bit faster? Absolutely! But it would not have been efficient or healthy growth for a bootstrapped company. Our conversation rate from account sign-up to paid customer doubled in 2020, and more recently with <a href="https://www.outseta.com/posts/using-ux-changes-to-unlock-growth">changes like these</a> we’ve 3Xed our average monthly conversion rate. </p><p>Heading into 2021… watch out!</p><h2>Product</h2><p>On the product front, man-oh-man am I a nuisance. I’m the primary liaison between our customers and our product team, and both our customers and myself ask for a lot. With a product as feature rich as Outseta, there’s a never ending list of feature requests and improvements that our small team needs to navigate. </p><p>But in my eyes 2020 was the year where our product grew up. </p><p>We sell to markets of extremely knowledgeable and demanding buyers, and for the first three years we were in business, it was hard for me to shake that our feature set was very limited, the product was buggy, and when you’re competing against heavily VC backed companies it was just hard to feel proud of what we had out in the market. </p></div></div><div data-block-type="31" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610145428502_35484"><div>

    <p>Finding my ways to the firmware of a famous Harley tuner</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: All encryption keys and passwords are fake ones made up for writing this post.</strong></p>

</p>



<p>A tuner is a little device supposed to be plugged to a bike. It is meant to configure the on board computer in order to optimize fuel to air ratios and other parameters. It is known to be used to lift engine power restrictions, or optimize fuel consumption. Though I am pretty sure a real biker will have much better words to describe how it can be used.</p>

<p><img src="https://therealunicornsecurity.github.io/images/Dynojet/dynojet.jpg" alt="_config.yml"></p>

<p>The model studied here is a Power Vision for Harley Davidson, by Dynojet. The hardware is a Bobcat Revision D by Drew Technologies (there is a typo on the PCB, it is actually written Drew <em>Technoligies</em>).</p>

<p><img src="https://therealunicornsecurity.github.io/images/Dynojet/drewtech.jpg" alt="_config.yml"></p>




<p>The tuner is supposed to be configured while being connected to a computer. It has a mini-USB input next to the CAN Bus (this one should be connected to the bike’s on board computer). The tools used to configure it are free to download on Dynojet’s website.</p>

<p><img src="https://therealunicornsecurity.github.io/images/Dynojet/wintools.png" alt="_config.yml"></p>

<p>The installed Windows tools contain the following binaries:</p>
<ul>
  <li>WinPV.exe: the main software with the GUI</li>
  <li>PVUpdateClient.exe: updater, its job is to download in charge new firmwares and copying them through the USB link</li>
  <li>RecoveryTool.exe: called exclusively by the PVUpdateClient to flash the recovery part of the firmware</li>
  <li>PVLink.dll: in charge of the communication through the serial port, very important</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://therealunicornsecurity.github.io/images/Dynojet/pv_files.png" alt="_config.yml"></p>

<p>Now our goal is to get the firmware so we can start reversing. Checking on YouTube tutorials and TheWaybackMachine, we can see that firmwares used to be available directly on Dynojet’s website, under the <strong>firmware</strong> section, which is now empty. We find an interesting lead by running the PVUpdateCLient.exe, and Wireshark simultaneously.</p>

<p><img src="https://therealunicornsecurity.github.io/images/Dynojet/pvupdate.png" alt="_config.yml"></p>

<p>The Wireshark capture shows plaintext HTTP going to <em>dynojetpowervision.com</em> and checking for available firmware files. There is no real protection here, just the User-Agent you are supposed to be using is “PVUpdateClient”, otherwise the files remain hidden.<br>
Using <strong>curl</strong>, we get the filenames we are looking for:</p>

<p>The <strong>SYSTEM_RECOVERY</strong>, that we will call “PVR file” is a password protected archive, and the <strong>FIRMWARE</strong> file, named “PVU_FILE”, is actually encrypted using Openssl. Also, the PVU_CERT file indicates that there might be an integrity check performed on the PVU_FILE.</p>

<p>I’ll skip the details, but since the PVR file is written in plaintext on the device, it was obvious that one of the tools (in this case RecoveryTool.exe) had the password somewhere. A bit of reverse engineering later, we get a password “POWERVISION_RECOVER_3456789Z”. Though I won’t explain the whole thing here, this password is actually somewhat hidden. It is not hardcoded but instead, some loops go over integer values to generate the ending pattern of the password and then concatenate a capital letter to it. There is a clear intention to hide this from badly intentioned users, and that’s usually a sign we’re on the right track.</p>

<h3 id="recovery-file-contents">Recovery File Contents</h3>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The recovery file is a u-boot image with a Kernel image. The entropy of the files indicates that parts of them are encrypted. Also, the presence of <em>at91bootstrap</em> file indicates we are in presence of a SAM AT 91 board, which can use secure boot. Damned. We can though get one information from those files: the processor type is  <strong>SAM926X</strong><br>
Browsing the internet, we also can find the following forum post, where a Drew <em>Technoligies</em> employee asks information about this very same family of processors (specifically, the SAM9260-EK): https://lists.denx.de/pipermail/u-boot/2011-June/093651.html</p>

<h3 id="update-file">Update File</h3>

<p>Since the update file is encrypted, we can formulate two hypothesis:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The firmware is stored encrypted, and decrypted at runtime. That might be slow, but since the board supports secure boot, it is a viable hypothesis.</li>
  <li>The firmware is stored unencrypted, only the updates are encrypted. The update process decrypts the PVU_FILE, and replaces the running firmware. Would be nice, wouldn’t it?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="22-physical-setup">2.2: Physical setup</h2>

<p>A quick and dirty win is always to desolder the memory chip to get the firmware. But in that case, it is a bit more complicated. The entire PCB was molded in a plastic protection, probably for sealing against humidity.</p>

<p><img src="https://therealunicornsecurity.github.io/images/Dynojet/mold1.jpg" alt="_config.yml"></p>

<p><img src="https://therealunicornsecurity.github.io/images/Dynojet/mold2.jpg" alt="_config.yml"></p>

<p>I had to cut it open to see the actual PCB:</p>

<p><img src="https://therealunicornsecurity.github.io/images/Dynojet/open_pcb.jpg" alt="_config.yml"></p>

<p>The memory chip seems to be soldered on the other side of the PCB. It is pretty bad news because it is under the screen, and it would probably destroy the device to try to get this physically. Also, at this stage, we don’t know if getting the chip will help us. It could simply contain an Openssl encrypted file that is decrypted during the boot process. So we looked elsewhere.<br>
By looking closely, we can spot 4 pins with written <strong>DEBUG</strong> over it!</p>

<p><img src="https://therealunicornsecurity.github.io/images/Dynojet/ports.jpg" alt="_config.yml"></p>

<p>So we connect to it using an UART to USB adapter, and fire up minicom.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>ROMBoot
Welcome to bobcat

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Problem is the shell is password protected, and even after days of bruteforcing (using <a href="https://github.com/FireFart/UARTBruteForcer/blob/master/uart.py">this tool</a>), no password was found. Also, U-Boot is set as quiet and there is no way from this shell to interact with the boot sequence.<br>
One track remains unexplored: the <strong>RECOVERY MODE</strong></p>

<h3 id="recovery-mode">Recovery Mode</h3>

<p>Messing around with the RecoveryTool.exe we find that there is a recovery mode for the device. It is activated by pressing the power button while plugin in the USB link.</p>

<p><img src="https://therealunicornsecurity.github.io/images/Dynojet/recovery.jpg" alt="_config.yml"></p>

<p>Now what is interesting with this mode is that it switches the communication mode on the USB Link port. In fact, in nominal working mode, this port uses a proprietary protocol that restrains many actions (I will detail this in a dedicated part), whereas in recovery mode the port exposes a U-Boot shell!</p>

<p>We replace <em>quiet</em> with <em>single</em> in order to deactivate the authentication, add a delay so we have enough time to get to the UART shell, and set <em>silent</em> to “no” in order to make sure we have a boot trace on the UART shell.</p>

<p>To do this, we need to be connected <strong>simultaneously</strong> to the USB link where we configure the new parameters, and the internal UART debug port, where the shell should pop.</p>

    <p>I had planned building the kata for <code>Number.parseInt()</code> already a while ago.
Starting to work I discovered very quickly that this seemingly tiny kata is quite a 
rabbit hole that offers a lot of things one can learn.
Especially about how things evolve in the spec and how to read the spec, fortunately
this is a pretty easy to read part of the spec.</p>

<h2 is="more-h2" id="numberparseint-and-the-global-parseint"><code>Number.parseInt()</code> and the Global <code>parseInt()</code></h2>
<p>Actually ES6 makes the <code>Number.parseInt()</code> kata very simple. 
Because it just says it's the same as the global <code>parseInt</code>.
Reading the spec it seems this is a simple piece of JavaScript.
The kata should be easy to build. It builds on the existing global <code>parseInt</code>
function, so what is there left to learn for <code>Number.parseInt()</code>? Can I not just simply
link to the ES1 kata for <code>parseInt</code>?</p>
<figure>

    <figcaption>The Number.parseInt spec text.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the ES6 kata I currently just plan to have two tests (see image below). 
And I am thinking of adding a third one that just says "look into the ES1 kata for the global <code>parseInt</code>".
And this is where it gets a bit difficult.</p>
<figure>

    <figcaption>To begin with, two tests in this kata.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 is="more-h2" id="es1-parseint">ES1: <code>parseInt()</code></h2>
<p>I looked up <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262-arch.htm">the spec archive</a> 
and <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST-ARCH/ECMA-262,%201st%20edition,%20June%201997.pdf">in ES1 <code>parseInt</code> was already specified</a> 
(see image below). 
But the content in the ES6 spec is quite different (see 2nd image below).
The ES1 spec has a list of 26 items defining the global <code>parseInt()</code> function, ES6 only 16.</p>
<figure>

    <figcaption>The ES6 spec text for parseInt, different to ES1.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The change is interesting, since I was always under the assumption that JavaScript
only gets extended and never (or only very rarely) changed, so that it stays backwards 
compatible all the time.</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="diff-between-es1-and-es6">Diff Between ES1 and ES6</h2>
<p>Now, I have to decide how to continue for building the kata.
I had two choices:</p>
<ol>
<li>figure out when it changed, between ES1 and ES6, or</li>
<li>read the spec texts carefully and figure out if it matters for my kata.</li>
</ol>
<p>I went with 1), since I am too lazy for 2) and doubt I get it done this year.</p>
<p>The <code>parseInt</code> spec text changed significantly <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST-ARCH/ECMA-262,%203rd%20edition,%20December%201999.pdf">in ES3</a>. 
It is still not the same as <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-parseint-string-radix">in ES6</a> 
and also different to <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/index.html#sec-parseint-string-radix">ES10</a>.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://blog.jskatas.org/blog/2021/01/11-building-the-parseint-kata/5-1.jpg" alt="The ES3 spec of parseInt." width="100%">
    <figcaption>The ES3 spec of parseInt.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>The original question I wanted to answer was: In which category does the kata for <code>parseInt</code> belong? 
Into "ES1" or somewhere else?
I guess the answer is I put it into ES1 but will use the latest spec to write the kata, 
and assume the functionality has not changed (significantly).</p>
<p>In case I ever figure out that the functionality of <code>parseInt</code> has changed between ES1 and ES10, 
I would have to come back and split the <code>parseInt</code> kata and move the changes into the according ESx kata.</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="es5-introduced-one-change">ES5 Introduced one Change</h2>
<p>One thing <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt#ECMAScript_5_removes_octal_interpretation">changed with ES5 about how <code>parseInt</code> works</a>. 
"ECMAScript 5 removes octal interpretation" - I am glad this has changed, it did bite me hard once.
See below for the entire explanation from MDN. 
So good to read this, and also to read the hint <strong>"always specify a radix"</strong>.</p>
<figure>

    <figcaption>ECMAScript 5 removes octal interpretation</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 is="more-h2" id="katas-done">Katas Done</h2>
<p>So I finished two new katas for <code>parseInt</code>. 
One <a href="https://jskatas.org/#bundle-es6-katas">the ES6 version</a>, 
the other in <a href="https://jskatas.org/#bundle-es1-katas">ES1</a> 
and the in-depth one is just a draft. 
<a href="https://github.com/tddbin/katas/pull/80">PR is ready</a>. 
Input welcome.</p>
<p>Here is what it looks like currently, on my local system, and is probably already merged at the time you are reading this.</p>
<figure>

    <figcaption>The ES1 and ES6 katas.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It is live.
The ES1 <code>parseInt()</code> kata is live, now. The in-depth one will follow.
<a href="https://jskatas.org/">https://jskatas.org</a></p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I would sum up my learning like this: </p>
<ul>
<li>read the spec, </li>
<li>get your hands dirty, </li>
<li>investigate the roots, </li>
<li>you will always learn something along the way. </li>
</ul>
<p>The best part, is that you never know when the different dots of your knowledge connect.
Stay hungry, keep learning.</p>

January 13, 2021 | https://www.qawolf.com/blog/why-we-open-sourced-everything | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.qawolf.com/blog/why-we-open-sourced-everything">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>January 13, 2021</p><div><div><p><img alt="Wolf family" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div></div><p>A little over one year ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/jon_perl/status/1193726557988118530" target="\_blank">we open sourced</a> the first version of <a href="https://github.com/qawolf/qawolf" target="_blank">QA Wolf</a>, a tool to help developers create browser tests.</p><p>Our goal with QA Wolf was to help developers ship confidently and improve the quality of web-based software. Since then, we've shipped over a hundred releases based on feedback from our users. â�¤ï¸�</p><p>Despite these improvements, we learned that QA Wolf was still too difficult to use for many developers (including ourselves). They still needed to install a Node.js package, set up CI, and become a detective to understand why their test failed. ðŸ•µï¸�</p><p>These learnings inspired us to build <a href="https://www.qawolf.com/" target="_blank">QA Wolf 2.0</a>: an easy way to create, run, and debug tests directly from the browser. And we had an important decision to make...</p><h3>Should QA Wolf 2.0 be open source?</h3><p>We kicked around various ideas, including open sourcing parts of the codebase while keeping others closed source. Then we asked ourselves, "what if we just open source all of it?"</p><p>It sounded terrifying at first. Our minds dwelled on the possibility of someone ripping off our entire product.</p><p>After the initial wave of anxiety subsided, the arguments for open sourcing came clearer into focus. We talked it over with our investors, and they agreed: the pros vastly outweighed the cons.</p><p>So today we are <a href="https://github.com/qawolf/qawolf" target="_blank">open sourcing QA Wolf 2.0</a>. We are excited for you to check it out, and look forward to your feedback!</p><div><p><img alt="Confused dog" src="https://qawolf-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/finn-code-review.gif" width="100%"></p><p>Our code reviewer Finn</p></div><p>Here is why we open sourced everything:</p><h3>It helps build a community</h3><p>QA Wolf is built for developers who want an easy way to set up browser tests. Open sourcing allows us to meet our audience where they are, and invites the feedback we need to build a great experience.</p><p>Open sourcing helps gain developers' trust. They can use QA Wolf without worrying about vendor lock-in. They can peek at the source code, and edit it for their own use case.</p><p>Being open source also makes product improvements public, building confidence about the future of the project.</p><h3>We will move faster and build a better product</h3><p>Building in the open is scary. Someone might discover a security hole, or make fun of that gross code we wrote.</p><p>We've found this to be a powerful forcing function. Having open issues motivates us to fix them faster, and we feel embarrassed if we don't show consistent progress. We also write better code knowing that anyone can see it.</p><p>Finally, we will be grateful for any contributions we get from being open source. ðŸ™�</p><h3>Open core is a headache</h3><p>We considered adopting an "open core" model, where only some parts of the codebase would be publicly available. As we evaluated this option, we realized that it created more problems than it solved.</p><p>Open core software is harder to contribute to and maintain. We would have to manage separate packages for various parts of the codebase, and no one else could contribute to the closed source code.</p><p>On top of deployment headaches, we would need to constantly evaluate whether new code should be open or closed source. Having a single open source project relieves us and future developers from this burden. It also allows our community to have maximum visibility into our codebase.</p><h3>It just feels right</h3><p>"Be open" is one of our values, and open sourcing feels like the right thing to do.</p><p>When we reflect on the good things that have happened to us this year, all of them came from being an open source company. We got invaluable feedback from the very first iteration of QA Wolf. We were also able to raise a pre-seed round (more to come soon in an upcoming post!).</p><p>After committing to making our source code public, we had to answer one more question.</p><h3>What license do we use?</h3><p>We want to clarify one thing upfront: <b>we're still not sure we made the right decision</b>. We did what we thought was best at the time to keep moving forward. In the future, our license may change based on your feedback.</p><p>After studying open source licenses, we narrowed down our options:</p><ol><li>Use a permissive license like Apache-2.0. This license allows people to use your code however they want, including to directly compete with your service.</li><li>Use the Business Source License (BSL). This license allows people to use your code however they want, except to directly compete with your service without buying a license. Over the past few years, companies like <a href="https://blog.sentry.io/2019/11/06/relicensing-sentry" target="_blank">Sentry</a> and <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/oss-relicensing-cockroachdb/" target="_blank">CockroachDB</a> have adopted this license.</li></ol><p>We decided to pursue both options.</p><p>We've licensed <a href="https://github.com/qawolf/qawolf/blob/main/LICENSE.md" target="_blank">most folders</a> (CLI and helpers, code generation and test runner) under Apache-2.0. QA Wolf 2.0 would not be possible without similarly licensed open source projects like the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright" target="_blank">Playwright test framework</a>. It's important that we give back to the community that has given so much to us.</p><p>The remainder of our product is licensed under BSL. When evaluating this option, we found that <a href="https://blog.sentry.io/2019/11/06/relicensing-sentry#deciding-to-re-license" target="_blank">Sentry's goals for licensing</a> resonated with us:</p><ul><li>"Anyone should be able to run <!-- -->[the service]<!-- --> for themselves or their business"</li><li>"No difference between our cloud service and our open source product (no open core model)"</li><li>"Minimal limitations on usage of code, as free as possible"</li><li>"Protection from other companies selling our work"</li></ul><p>Our goal is to build a sustainable business around our product, and we need to have the resources to do that. BSL allows us to share our source code while giving us some protection over our work.</p><p>In the future, we may license the entirety of QA Wolf under Apache-2.0. We're starting here to ensure that we get more rather than less permissive over time.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Thanks for making it this far. We hope you'll try <a href="https://www.qawolf.com/" target="_blank">QA Wolf 2.0</a> and let us know how it goes. ðŸ�º</p><p>If you'd like to get in touch, we'd love to hear from you at <a href="mailto:hello@qawolf.com">hello@qawolf.com</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>I’ve got a new Apple laptop, so I thought I’d do an Emacs build benchmark.  Building Emacs is what people do on computers, right?  At least if I extrapolate from myself, which is the only natural thing to do.</p>
<p>It’s called proof by induction.  Look it up, nerds.</p>
<p>So here’s the benchmarks:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>My Main Build Machine</td>
<td>AMD Ryzen 7 3700X (8 Core/16 Threads)</td>
<td>2m14s</td>
<td>7m31</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>My Lenovo Carbon X1 Laptop</td>
<td>Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10610U CPU (4 Core/4 Threads)</td>
<td>6m22s</td>
<td>15m22</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>My Old Apple Laptop</td>
<td>Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7360U CPU (2 Core/4 Threads)</td>
<td>7m13s</td>
<td>12m33</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>My New M1 Apple Laptop</td>
<td>Apple M1 (4-to-8-ish Cores)</td>
<td>2m44s</td>
<td>6m37s</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The next-to-last column is with -jTO-THE-MAX, and the last column is with -j1.</p>
<p>I’m impressed!  The M1 is able to build Emacs almost as fast as my AMD machine…  which is a lot bigger.</p>
<p>Of course, on Debian I’m using gcc and on Macos I’m using clang, so it’s an apples-to-some-different-brand-of-apples comparison.</p>
<p>It’s even more impressive how much faster this laptop is compared to the Apple laptop from…  2019?  Yeah.  It’s more than twice as fast!  And doesn’t have a fan!  The old Apple laptop would sound like a VAX in a hurricane while building Emacs!</p>
<p>And it’s also twice as fast as the laptop I use daily here on the couch; last year’s Lenovo Carbon X1, which is just embarrassing.  Lenovo!  Get on it!  Make an ARM laptop that’s fast!</p>
<p>For the first time in my life, I have Apple envy.  That is, for the first time ever, they’ve made a laptop that’s clearly superior to what’s available for us Linux peeps.  My only comfort is that the Apple keyboard still sucks.  Yeah!  And it doesn’t have a TrackPoint!  Yeah!  My laptop is still the best!  Yeah!  Take that!</p>
<p><a href="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC02170.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC02170-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="558" srcset="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC02170-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC02170-300x199.jpg 300w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC02170-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC02170-768x511.jpg 768w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC02170-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC02170-2048x1362.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px"></a></p>
<p>Yeah!  I’m not the least envious!</p>
<p>*sniff*</p>
<p>Edit some hours later:</p>
<p>But one thing that would be interesting to look at is Emacs performance on M1 vs the other machines.  And a way to broadly look at that is to see how long it takes to byte-compile a bunch of Emacs Lisp files: This exercises much of Emacs, except display-related stuff.</p>
<p>So:  Benchmarking with</p>
<pre>rm `find lisp -name '*.elc'`; time make -jMAX</pre>
<p>I get:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>My Main Build Machine</td>
<td>AMD Ryzen 7 3700X (8 Core/16 Threads)</td>
<td>0m57s</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>My Lenovo Carbon X1 Laptop</td>
<td>Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10610U CPU (4 Core/4 Threads)</td>
<td>4m13s</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>My Old Apple Laptop</td>
<td>Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7360U CPU (2 Core/4 Threads)</td>
<td>5m33s</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>My New M1 Apple Laptop</td>
<td>Apple M1 (4-to-8-ish Cores)</td>
<td>1m33s</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Here the AMD clearly wins over the ARM, but per-core performance is in advantage of the ARM.  And, of course, the ARM soundly wins over both of the other two laptops.</p>

January 13, 2021 | https://reyt.net/blog/why-negotiating-is-just-like-doing-squats/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://reyt.net/blog/why-negotiating-is-just-like-doing-squats/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article id="post-1749"><div><p>Let me share a short story. I used to hate doing squats at the gym. I would make good progress in every strength-training exercise except for the squat. My posture felt wrong, I had a hard time coordinating my movements, and my numbers would never improve. It was embarrassing, really. I ended up thinking of doing squats as something complicated, frustrating, and potentially dangerous; something I was better off avoiding altogether.</p><p>How do I feel about doing squats now? It’s become my #1 favorite strength-training exercise. Who changed my mind? A great personal trainer I met a few years ago who still trains me to this day. He taught me the right technique, helped me strengthen my weak spots while keeping the entire process challenging and motivating. He completely changed my perspective on squats. Now, I think they’re fun!</p><p>I have met many students over the years who saw negotiation just like I used to see squats: something hard and risky, something to avoid. Most people&nbsp;<em>want</em>&nbsp;to negotiate because they know that it’s the only way to obtain desirable outcomes. Their issue is they haven’t acquired the knowledge and developed the right skills to negotiate well enough yet to obtain these outcomes.</p><p>My goal is to help you acquire these skills. My approach to negotiation training is based on three tenets.</p><h3><strong>You can’t get stronger unless you learn the proper technique</strong></h3><p>A lot of people who claim to be great negotiators often mean that they are great at haggling. When people haggle, all they do is make price concessions until the other party agrees. It’s not hard, and it’s something you can learn quickly by mimicking others. Negotiation is a complex process designed to increase value and resolve conflicts. There are many ways one can screw up a negotiation.</p><p>To be a good negotiator, you need to know how to make the right decisions. Nobody was born knowing how to prepare for a negotiation, how to craft a first offer, or how to deal with negotiators who lie; these are learnt behaviors. Sure, you could rely on your intuition and figure things out on your own, but why would you try to reinvent the wheel when we already have established methods available?</p><p>For this reason, my next few emails will focus on proven methods and techniques to help you approach the main steps of a negotiation.</p><h3><strong>You can’t excel at everything, but you can mitigate your risks</strong></h3><p>Negotiation mobilizes so many different cognitive and interpersonal skills that it would be unreasonable to expect excelling at all of them. Nobody is THAT good. Negotiating is a stress test on your entire system, which means that you are only as strong as your weakest element.</p><p>Maybe you are too focused on making your counterpart happy, and you often leave the negotiation table having regrets about your own outcome. Maybe you have the opposite problem and you only see a negotiation as successful if you completely crush the other party. Now, nobody wants to negotiate with you anymore. It could be many things, but there are usual suspects and there are ways to deal with them.</p><p>You can’t completely fix your weaknesses, but you can use strategies to work around them. This will be the second phase of our negotiation training.</p><h3><strong>Becoming a good negotiator is a long-term commitment</strong></h3><p>Just like everything in life that has to do with human performance, negotiation training strictly follows the law of diminishing returns. This comes with good news and bad news.</p><p>The good news is that if you apply yourself to improving your negotiation skills, you will make progress very quickly in the beginning. This is a phase that people often find exhilarating because they feel like they have finally unlocked their potential.</p><p>The bad news is that the further you go in your negotiation training, the harder it will be for you to make new gains. You won’t be able to get by just by following basic rules anymore; it will be time to refine your skills. You will need to be exposed to increasingly complex negotiation situations, with incentives to keep you engaged and motivated throughout the process.</p><p>For this reason, my plan is to maintain this newsletter in the long-term, with fresh perspectives and different opportunities to engage.</p><h2>Do You Want to Improve Your Negotiation Skills?</h2><p>Sign-up using the form below.

                <section>                
                    <time datetime="January 13, 2021">January 13, 2021</time>
                    
                </section>
            </p>
        

        <section>
            <p>Do you like your team standups? What about your team, do they like their standups?
Are they useful? You might think they are, but you might also be missing the point.</p>

<h2 id="whats-wrong">What’s wrong?</h2>

<p>I don’t want to sound harsh (dammit, I did it again), but… I bet your team is doing
things wrong. It’s not hard at all to mess things up and continuously thinking that
everything is fine. It happens a lot with shy teams; they might talk to each other about
these things, but they avoid raising the flag.</p>

<p>So, my advice here is, don’t trust your feelings; pause and observe their mood and
interactions during the meeting (take this advice to the next level and apply it to
every other meeting, you might see the same patterns) and ask yourself a simple question:
are they worth it?</p>

<h2 id="how-they-really-are-most-of-the-times">How they really are (most of the times)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Waste of time;</li>
  <li>Unnecessary pressure;</li>
  <li>Live status report.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your standup looks like a status report (you might have to pause and observe first),
you landed the right post, I guess. It’s not cool to have status reports, not cool at all.
It’s stressful and depressing. Not the right way to start the day, if it’s your case.</p>

<h2 id="you-dont-need-another-status-report">You don’t need another status report</h2>

<p>There’s a common practice of using standups to ask developers how long it takes to finish
a given feature. “Are you done yet?”, “And now, it’s finished?”, “How long it will take?”.</p>

<p>I don’t like these types of questions. It triggers feelings of pressure, insecurity, doubt,
you name it; I can’t find any valid reason to ask these kinds of questions during a standup.</p>

<p>A lot of people fear the spotlight, and it’s fine. A lot of people fear missing behind, and
again, it’s fine. It might be stressful to watch your teammates delivering multiple features
while you’re struggling with something complex. What if you struggle for two days or more?</p>

<p>In a standard status report, you either say that you finished something yesterday, or that
you’ll try to finish it today; you don’t say you’re struggling, you don’t ask for help, but
you should, and your teammates should offer their help.</p>

<h2 id="yesterday-yesterday-yesterday">Yesterday, yesterday, yesterday</h2>

<p>There’s another common practice of <em>just</em> telling what you did yesterday. Do you really need
to tell your teammates what you did yesterday? Unless you’re not making any kind of progress,
or you’re doing solo work (which you shouldn’t, if you work on a team), your teammates should
know already what you did yesterday.</p>

<p>We live in a world where every single line of code you do, is probably linked up to the related
feature. There are <em>issues</em>, <em>commits</em>, <em>pull-requests</em>, <em>merges</em>, <em>validations</em>, <em>deploys</em>,
<em>releases</em>. There are notifications and logs for each of these actions, and all of them are linked,
all of them should involve multiple people (if you work in a small team, ideally it should involve
all of your team), so the question is, why should you repeat yourself every single day?</p>

<p>The answer is: you shouldn’t; everyone in your team should know already what you did yesterday.
You did your work, you were able to communicate with your teammates, you even shipped the feature
into production, everyone at the company should know by now what you’ve been doing!</p>

<h2 id="what-about-writing-instead-of-speaking">What about writing instead of speaking?</h2>

<p>I like to write things down:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It helps me formalize my thoughts</li>
  <li>It serves as a personal diary</li>
  <li>Tends to improve my writing skills</li>
  <li>I can share them in multiple mediums</li>
  <li>I can look back and see what I wrote a few weeks ago.</li>
</ul>

<p>What if you wrote down your daily/weekly/monthly progress, instead of giving a live status report
every single day? If you value outstanding documentation, you’re probably surrounded by people
with outstanding writing skills. Writing should not be a problem for these kinds of individuals.</p>

<p>Everything you need for a <em>status report</em> like standup is already available on your digital collaboration
platform. You have multiple features, multiple work items, multiple states (todo, in-progress, done)
for each work item, multiple assignees for each work item, plus their corresponding commits, pull-requests,
deploys…</p>

<h2 id="tracking-disperse-but-valuable-information">Tracking disperse (but valuable) information</h2>

<p>You can make use of this valuable (but disperse) information and track it on your team channel. At the
end of the day, everyone in the team should know that Pedro took an item from <em>todo</em>, had a discussion
with another two teammates in the issue itself before merging three detailed commits into <em>master</em> that
were deployed into production a few minutes later.</p>

<p>If you want to give daily detailed updates, you can still write a compacted version of the activity log.
Give the activity log a try, and go with weekly updates; encourage your team to write their macro
accomplishments of the week; bundle those together and give a nice presentation to the whole company.
There are so many companies and open-source projects out there that deliver amazing products without
syncing every single day, why should you?</p>



<p>If you want to have some kind of human contact, write down your status and use those standups for things
that really matter: collaboration, collaboration, and collaboration. Check for dependencies, ask for help,
offer help, unblock the blockers, discuss and plan your day (especially if you’re pairing/mobbing), and for
f*cks sake, say hi to your teammates…</p>

<h2 id="is-there-any-action-point">Is there any action point?</h2>

<p>Optimize your daily team routine, drop those f*cking status reports and use that slot to start the day
(or week) in the right mood!</p>

        <div>

          <div data-article-id="121" id="article-body">
            <p>Over the years, I have been fortunate to spend lots of time (full-time for the last 2 years) learning from how thousands of early-stage (pre-series-A) COSS founders think, operate, build and more.</p>

<p>The #1 most critical quality I often see missing from their thought process and overall approach is a deep understanding of what I like to call "Market Dynamics". Let's dig into what I mean.</p>

<p>When building a COSS company in the early days, it is common to focus only on the technology. You are building something exciting for developers or end users who care about open source. It might be easy to think that once you build this exciting open source thing, everyone will organically learn about it and start to use it.. and that assumption might end up being right! Open source has amazing ways of finding efficient distribution, engagement and stickiness with large user communities, quickly.</p>

<p>In reality, as a COSS founder, you almost always have to be equal parts business builder (entrepreneur) and open source builder (technologist).</p>

<p>However, what nearly every early-stage COSS founder I speak with fails to deeply understand is the importance of having a clear point-of-view on the following questions, and furthermore, very thoughtful data that serve to illuminate a comprehensive perspective on a given market:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Once I build a commercial product or service around my open source core, who am I targeting? Who is/will be the end user customer?</p></li>
<li><p>What will I charge my end user customer for, exactly?</p></li>
<li><p>What pain points am I solving for that will be measurable enough to have someone pay for solving them?</p></li>
<li><p>Am I operating in a space that existing/legacy vendors are serving? If yes, who are those companies? What do they charge for? How do they charge for it? What are the revenues/growth rates or analyst sentiment on that market?</p></li>
<li><p>Is my end user customer educated about the capabilities of a COSS product (not your open source project) I will build in future? If not, do I have to educate those potential customers about a partially or completely new "terminology stack" in order for them to see the value? In other words, am I creating a new category/market or disrupting an existing one? Or something in between?</p></li>
<li><p>If I am operating in an existing market instead of creating a new one, what does that current market look like? How large is it (# of customers, $ spent per year, competitors, etc)? Is it evolving (why and how)?</p></li>
<li><p>Is my open source core a feature of a larger product that may be hard or improbable to commercialize at scale on its own? (bundling vs. unbundling)</p></li>
<li><p>Are there other companies (open core or not) addressing the customer market I am going after in the future? If yes, who are they and how are they doing? (funding, growth, revenue, etc)</p></li>
<li><p>What are my technical differentiators that will give my commercial product a distinct advantage, and why?</p></li>
<li><p>How will I charge for my commercial product (unit of measure, pricing model, etc) and is this based on re-thinking an existing approach already in the market, where customers have been conditioned to pay a certain way, or is this likely to be a new pricing approach?</p></li>
<li><p>How will I "go-to-market" with my future product? How will I achieve distribution? How will I access my target customers? How will they discover me?</p></li>
<li><p>How will my product sales motions work in the early days? Self-serve? Hands-on?</p></li>
<li><p>When will I start to build commercial product and what will the drivers be which will affect that timeline?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These are just a few high-level questions that, if answered with critical consideration, can unlock a great deal of clarity about how to mitigate risks and make better decisions. </p>

<p>As a solo or duo technical founding team, you often may NOT need to hire another team member early on to answer these questions. In fact, if you need to bring on another team member in order to begin to precisely answer these questions and develop strong points-of-view, you may not be the right founding team for the company you are building.</p>

<p>The best founding teams (CTO and CEO) both have strong understandings of these questions and have different ways of looking at the questions. </p>

<p>There are no perfectly "right" or "wrong" answers. The only failure is in forgetting to think carefully about all of these questions from Day 0 or when you embark on your journey to build a company.</p>

	<div>
		
<p><a href="http://sat.aero.cst.nihon-u.ac.jp/nexus/E0_Top.html">NEXUS</a>, also called FO-99, is a Japanese Amateur satellite built by <a href="http://www.nihon-u.ac.jp/en/">Nihon University</a> and <a href="https://www.jamsat.or.jp/index_e.html">JAMSAT</a>. It was launched on January 2019, and one of its interesting features is a π/4-DQPSK high-speed transmitter for the 435 MHz Amateur satellite band.</p>



<p>I was always interested in implementing a decoder for this satellite, due to its unusual modulation, but the technical information that is publicly available is scarce, so I never set to do it. A few days ago, <a href="http://uz7.ho.ua/">Andrei Kopanchuk UZ7HO</a> asked me a question about the Reed-Solomon code used in this satellite. He was working on a decoder for this satellite, and had some extra documentation. This renewed my interest in building a decoder for this satellite.</p>



<p>With some help from Andy regarding the symbol mapping for the π/4-DQPSK constellation, I have made a <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/gr-satellites/blob/master/examples/satellites/nexus.grc">decoder GNU Radio flowgraph</a> that I have added to <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/gr-satellites/">gr-satellites</a>.</p>



<p>The modulation used by NEXUS is actually listed as π/4-QPSK 38k4 in several sites, such as in the <a href="http://nexusoperation.seesaa.net/article/479513451.html">satellite operations schedule</a>. However, to be more precise, the modulation is 19.2 kbaud π/4-DQPSK. This means that each pair of bits is encoded as the phase shift between one symbol and the next one. There are four possible phase shifts: \(\pi/4\), \(3\pi/4\), \(5\pi/4\), and \(7\pi/4\).</p>



<p>Thus, if the constellation is rotated appropriately, the constellation symbols are \(1\), \(i\), \(-1\), \(-i\) for even symbols, and \((1+i)/\sqrt{2}\), \((-1+i)/\sqrt{2}\), \((-1-i)/\sqrt{2}\), \((1-i)/\sqrt{2}\) for odd symbols. These are two QPSK constellations staggered by a 45 degree rotation.</p>



<p>The symbol mapping used by NEXUS to transform the phase differences between adjacent symbols into dibits is shown in the table below, together with the more usual QPSK symbol mapping that assigns to the constellation symbols \(z = \pm 1 \pm i\) the dibit given by \((\operatorname{Re}(z)+1)/2\), \((\operatorname{Im}(z)+1)/2\) (here the function \(t \mapsto (t+1)/2\) represents justs a bipolar to unipolar transformation, so that the symbol mapping accounts essentially to taking the real and imaginary parts of the symbol, which is very useful for decoding).</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Phase difference</th><th>NEXUS symbol mapping</th><th>QPSK symbol mapping</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>\(\pi/4\)</td><td>00</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>\(3\pi/4\)</td><td>01</td><td>01</td></tr><tr><td>\(5\pi/4\)</td><td>11</td><td>00</td></tr><tr><td>\(7\pi/4\)</td><td>10</td><td>10</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Comparing the NEXUS symbol mapping with the usual QPSK mapping, we see that we can convert between them by inverting the bits and swapping I and Q, so this gives an effective way of decoding the NEXUS symbol mapping. However, the NEXUS symbol mapping can be constructed in a more natural way by taking the usual order of the 2-bit Gray code, indexed by the phase differences in increasing order.</p>



<p>The baudrate (symbol rate) for the NEXUS signal is 19.2 kbaud. Probably the signal is listed as 38k4 because the bitrate (not taking FEC into account) is 38.4 kbit/s.</p>



<p>The frames transmitted in this signal are standard CCSDS Reed-Solomon frames with a frame size of 223 bytes (not counting the 32 Reed-Solomon parity check bytes). The dual basis is used for the Reed-Solomon code.</p>



<p>The payload of each Reed-Solomon codeword contains a single AX.25 frame, using some sort of HDLC encoding. The best way to describe this encoding is that if we take the payload and invert the bit ordering in each of the bytes (i.e., if we replace \(b_7b_6\ldots b_1b_0\) by \(b_0b_1\ldots b_6b_7\)), then we obtain a perfectly compliant AX.25 frame using HDLC. Bit stuffing, the LSB byte ordering of AX.25, and the CRC-16 CCITT are used. The payload starts by a single <code>0x7e</code> flag, and after the AX.25 frame, <code>0x7e</code> flags are repeated until the end of the payload. These final <code>0x7e</code> flags may or may not be byte-aligned depending on the amount of bit stuffing. This is represented by the image below, which Andy has shared. Note that the zero padding field should actually be <code>0x7e</code> padding.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/NEXUS-frame.png"><img width="942" height="252" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/NEXUS-frame.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/NEXUS-frame.png 942w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/NEXUS-frame-300x80.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/NEXUS-frame-644x172.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/NEXUS-frame-768x205.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 942px) 100vw, 942px"></a><figcaption>NEXUS π/4-DQPSK signal frame structure</figcaption></figure>



<p>This frame structure is quite interesting, because it resembles <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FX.25_Forward_Error_Correction">FX.25</a> in that an AX.25 frame is wrapped by an outer FEC layer. FX.25 is designed to be backwards compatible with AX.25, since an AX.25 receiver will just ignore the wrapping. However, the NEXUS framing is not AX.25-compatible, because of the CCSDS synchronous scrambler and also because the bit ordering in each byte needs to be inverted.</p>



<p>I am curious about why this frame structure was used, since it doesn’t give backwards compatibility with AX.25 receivers (and in any case, there are no 19k2 π/4-DQPSK AX.25 modems that I know of, so backwards compatibility is not very useful). If backwards compatibility is not desired, then it seems much more simple to include the AX.25 frame directly into the Reed-Solomon codeword payload, without using any of the HDLC features (though some way to mark the frame end or length would be needed).</p>



<p>The GNU Radio decoder flowgraph is shown in the figure below. The recording I’ve used has been provided by Andy and can be downloaded <a href="https://gist.github.com/daniestevez/da86fa0d02380d34868f2d1faf87ca1e/raw/4e56972159614675d8b52eed8e8860c9f4b61778/nexus.wav">here</a>. It uses 96ksps real sampling and the signal is centred at about 18750 Hz.</p>



<div>
<div>
<p>A Frequency Xlating FIR Filter is used to move the signal to IQ baseband at 48ksps. Then there is an AGC and the Symbol Sync block, that performs RRC matched filtering and symbol clock recovery.</p>



<p>Each symbol is multiplied by the complex conjugate of the preceding symbol in order to get a constellation that gives the phase difference between adjacent symbols. This constellation is decoded to dibits by using the relation with usual QPSK constellation explained above.</p>



<p>Then the gr-satellites <a href="https://gr-satellites.readthedocs.io/en/latest/components.html#ccsds-deframers">CCSDS Reed-Solomon deframer</a> is used to synchronize to the CCSDS frames, descramble and decode the Reed-Solomon code. The bytes in the payload are reflected to invert the bit ordering and then sent into the HDLC deframer, which checks the CRC-16 and outputs the AX.25 frames.</p>
</div>



<div>
<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nexus_flowgraph.png"><img width="1128" height="1052" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nexus_flowgraph.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nexus_flowgraph.png 1128w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nexus_flowgraph-300x280.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nexus_flowgraph-644x601.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nexus_flowgraph-768x716.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1128px) 100vw, 1128px"></a><figcaption>GNU Radio NEXUS π/4-DQPSK decoder flowgraph</figcaption></figure>




</div>
</div>



<p>Note that this decoder uses non-coherent demodulation of the differential constellation. Another approach would be to use coherent decoding by including a Costas loop. One way to do so would be to contra-rotate every other symbol by 45 degrees at the output of the Symbol Sync block, in order to compensate for the constellation staggering. Then a regular QPSK Costas loop can be used. At the output of the Costas loop, the 45 degree contra-rotation can be undone. Then the decoding can proceed as in the non-coherent case, by multiplying each symbol with the complex conjugate of the previous one.</p>

<p><span>People who were skeptical of Bitcoin before its recent price surge, told themselves that they’d buy Bitcoin if it dropped to the $1,000-$2,000 range. This range keeps going up for the skeptics. “…every time the price goes up in the future, these ‘mental buy limits’ go up as well, increasing the likelihood of Bitcoin’s future survival,” Nick explains.</span></p>
<p><span>“…both the price of gold and the price Bitcoin are based around one thing and one thing alone—belief. The belief that these assets will have value in the future.” — Nick Maggiulli</span></p>
<p><span>Nick compares Bitcoin to the early years of the ability to invest in gold. “Though Bitcoin is unlikely to follow a similar path to gold, it is likely to exhibit similar behavior. This means that Bitcoin will continue to have huge run ups in price followed by violent crashes. Crashes that may last years (and possibly decades) in the future.” — Nick Maggiulli</span></p>
<p><span>“…if Bitcoin’s market capitalization were to match that of gold, it would be worth over $500,000 a coin. This is why some investors are so bullish on Bitcoin.” — Nick Maggiulli</span></p>

								<p><b><i>My two cents</i></b><span>: That last fact is pretty mind-blowing. As an investor, the question becomes will Bitcoin ever reach the same market capitalization as gold? Nobody knows the answer to that question, but choosing to invest in Bitcoin means you’re willing to find out. I’m willing to find out. Albeit, I barely put any money in, although many people don’t realize you don’t have to buy 1 whole Bitcoin to invest. You’re able to buy $100 worth or whatever amount you’re comfortable with and still “own Bitcoin.” You’d just be a partial owner alongside tons of other partial owners. </span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>RBAC and ABAC are terms that security teams commonly throw around when discussing authorization and permissions systems. Most developers have heard them at some point and may have a sense for what they mean, but many aren't clear on how to think about RBAC and ABAC as tools for modeling permissions in their apps.</p><p>When building access control in an app, the common misunderstanding is that it's an "either/or" — that it's a decision between RBAC <em>or</em> ABAC — when in fact most applications want for <strong><em>both access control models</em>.</strong></p><p>This page will explain:</p><ul role="list"><li>What is role-based access control (RBAC)?</li><li>What is attribute-based access control (ABAC)?</li><li>What are common use cases and patterns for RBAC &amp; ABAC, and what do you get from each model?</li><li>Why should you think about using both RBAC and ABAC together?</li></ul><p>‍</p><h2>What is Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)?</h2><p><strong>RBAC, which stands for Role-Based Access Control, is a broad classification for using roles to control the access that users have to resources.</strong> Most people are familiar with the concept of roles, and expect them to be a part of any authorization system. For many app developers, roles are the first and fastest step in implementing application authorization.</p><p><a href="https://docs.osohq.com/getting-started/rbac.html">Roles can vary in how they are used, and how they are implemented</a>. Because of this, "RBAC" doesn't have an exact meaning, and it can be confusing and even frustrating to see it characterized as a one-size-fits-all solution.</p><p>Roles provide a structure for assigning groups of permissions to users. They give us a repeatable way to assign those permissions, rather than listing them out to each user every time we want that user to have those permissions. When done well, a role can convey to a user an intuitive understanding of what she can expect to do in the application.</p><p>Imagine we're building a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application like <a href="http://salesforce.com/">Salesforce.com</a>. We want to have at least one person who can, for instance, add new users, delete users, and a maybe do a few other administrative tasks for the company. We could list out these permissions for this one person. (This pattern is actually called an Access Control List, or ACL.) But if we expect to give these same permissions to another person at the company in the future, we'll need to list them out all over again.</p><p>Instead, we can group these permissions into a single <em>role</em>, give that role a name – say, Admin – and assign that role to the people who are responsible for carrying out these tasks.</p><h3>How Does RBAC Work?</h3><p>Most applications start out with simple authorization models because it may not be clear what access patterns the users will want. Roles are a common framework to reach for because: a) most people know about them, and b) you can take a pretty big hammer to your access controls with them.</p><p>For instance, you might say that Users can only take actions <em>foo, bar and baz</em> in an application, whereas Admins can do everything. Problem solved 😎!</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1483105c9a72fd0a3b662a/5ffd06657387a5b07045d2f5_roles%20small.png" loading="lazy" alt="Example: Role-Permission Mapping for Simple RBAC System"></p><figcaption>Example: Role-Permission Mapping for Simple RBAC System</figcaption></figure><p>A typical implementation of this simple model is to store this role ("user" or "admin") in the users table in the database. We map the role to a set of permissions — i.e., what the role is allowed to do. We can configure this information statically in the application, or in some cases we might even enable users to configure custom roles where they get to choose what a role can do.</p><p>Finally, when the user tries to take an action, we enforce this control by checking what role the user has and whether the action is in the set of permissions for their role.</p><h3>The limitations of RBAC</h3><p>This simple model holds up for a short while. But over time, it degrades as common use cases don't quite fit.</p><p>For example, we hire a new type of an employee – say, an IT administrator – and we want to let her add and remove users from the CRM, but we don't want her to see any sales data. The quickest solution is to create a new role with just these permissions. No big deal. Now let's say we hire a contractor, and we want that person to be able to do data entry; we can make a scoped role for him too wherein he can enter data but can't delete data or do anything else...</p><p>As you can see, the overarching approach to this type of problem using roles is: as new scenarios come up, create new, very specific roles. This often leads bizarre groupings of permissions and other hard-to-debug roles setups many folks have encountered in the wild.</p><p>What's more, with this mapping of roles and permissions and the underlying model, developers are left with little choice but to expose a 2D matrix to their end-users, who then have to squint at it to figure out what role or combination of roles they should pick in order to do whatever they're trying to do.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1483105c9a72fd0a3b662a/5ffd0648c5d8bda506b8d011_roles%20big.png" loading="lazy" alt="Example: When RBAC Role-Permission Mapping Starts to Hurt"></p><figcaption>Example: When RBAC Role-Permission Mapping Starts to Hurt</figcaption></figure><p>What's more, the roles model is often insufficient because most applications' underlying data models don't easily fit in a 2D matrix. They're not a flat list of things a user can do. An application might need to traverse organizational hierarchies (VP&gt;manager&gt;etc.), navigate nested resources (parent company&gt;subsidiary, etc.), and model other relationships that don't map to a simple list.</p><p>Let's take our CRM example again. We use this app to track information about prospects and customers – e.g., leads, contacts, deals, and accounts. Let's say we start with a small team. We have some sales reps, managers, and a VP.</p><ul role="list"><li>Sales Reps: can see and edit accounts and deals</li><li>Managers: can additionally approve quotes</li><li>VPs: can additionally assign/re-assign accounts</li></ul><p>Over time, the team grows, and we decide we want to break it up regionally – North America, Europe and Asia. What do we do? We could add roles to reflect the intersection of each role and continent, which would look something like this:</p><ol role="list"><li>VP - North America</li><li>VP - Europe</li><li>VP - Asia</li><li>Manager - North America</li><li>Manager - Europe</li><li>...</li></ol><p>And maybe we have a Global VP who needs the VP role for <em>all</em> regions.</p><p>Then we grow the team further and split it into junior and senior sales teams. Now we need to segment roles by level (VP, manager, etc.), region (Europe, etc.), and sub-team (junior vs. senior).</p><p>In an application like this, thinking about roles as a flat structure across the whole application can quickly lead to more roles than we care to manage.</p><p>Instead, we can think about roles as multidimensional data associated to data structures. For example, if we take our initial set of roles — Sales Reps, Managers, VPs — and associate them to a combination of user and a geographic region, then we can represent the desired granularity without introducing new roles.</p><p>Most RBAC implementations do not actually support this form of roles.</p><p>Traditionally, this kind of context-dependent role is instead considered a form of Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC).</p><p>‍</p><h2>What is Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)?</h2><p><strong>Attribute-based access control (ABAC) is sufficiently broad in that it's both incredibly powerful and almost entirely meaningless and useless as a category of authorization.</strong> While many folks probably think they don't understand the term, they have probably used it in one form or another before.</p><p>ABAC is a way of controlling access to data based on properties (i.e., attributes) of the user and the resource she is accessing. A simple example might be "all users can read <em>public</em> data." In this case, "is public" is an attribute of the data.</p><p>Another example might be: "only users who are <em>staff</em> can read documents that are <em>confidential.</em>" Here we specify the logic using both an attribute of the user – if she is staff or not – and a property of the data – is it confidential or not.</p><p>ABAC is also way of controlling access based on who the user is <em>in relation to</em> the resource or data she wants to access**.** "Users can edit their own files" is an example that may be familiar to many developers – it grants a permission (to edit) based on a relationship (ownership) of a resource (a file).</p><p>Given that attributes can be just about anything, ABAC spans so many scenarios that as a solution set it's not a terribly useful thing to point to. What is perhaps more useful, however, is to describe some of the patterns and use cases that come up frequently. We could use ABAC to implement access control for any of the following:</p><ul role="list"><li>Collaboration applications – e.g., 'a user can edit a file if she owns it or someone has given her editing privileges'</li><li>A multi-tenant application – e.g., 'a user can read this data if she belongs to this company'</li><li>Free vs. paid tiers – e.g., 'a user can access these features if she is a paid subscriber'</li><li>Hierarchies – e.g., 'a user can view this data if she owns it or if she manages an employee that owns it'</li><li>Impersonation – e.g., 'a user can view this data if she owns it or if she is a support engineer with permission to impersonate that user at this time'</li><li>And so on</li></ul><h3>How Does ABAC Work?</h3><p>Developers often "implement" ABAC without realizing it. For example, an if statement that checks whether the user is the file owner is actually a basic ABAC implementation.</p><p>ABAC is a superset of RBAC. Whereas RBAC is a flat 2D model that maps roles to a set of permissions, ABAC is multi-dimensional. So to implement an ABAC system, we need an interface that helps us express a potentially broader variety of rules about who can do what – specifically, we need one that lets us map both attributes on the user and attributes on the resource.</p><p>We can achieve this in a few different ways:</p><ul role="list"><li>Data in a database - We implement permissions by specifying constraints on the query – e.g., <strong>WHERE resource.owner_id = ?</strong> – or as a separate check in the application after data has been accessed.</li><li>Fields from a token - We pass around cryptographic tokens (e.g., JWTs) containing information about the user and what she can do. Application code or proxies check for the presence of correct fields on the token. For example, it might check that a token has the correct scope – e.g., <strong>"read:account" in token.scopes</strong>.</li><li>Policy engine - We express authorization logic using a policy language, and evaluate it over the relevant input data. For …</li></ul></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Ctrl + Alt + Delete the President.</strong> Last week, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/01/07/us/capitol-building-trump">after a violent riot at the capital</a>, Twitter and Facebook <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/09/technology/trump-twitter-ban.html">erased the President of the United States from social media</a>. He was further banned from, or severely restricted from communicating by: <a href="https://www.axios.com/platforms-social-media-ban-restrict-trump-d9e44f3c-8366-4ba9-a8a1-7f3114f920f1.html">Reddit, Twitch, Shopify (??), Snapchat, TikTok, and Stripe.</a> Within 24 hours, amidst a chorus of “it’s just the free market, losers, if you don’t like it build your own app,” Google and Apple worked in concert to remove Parler, the “free speech” alternative social media app popular on the political right, from their app stores. Amazon followed the move with the equivalent of tech industry napalm, taking the extraordinary step of suspending Parler from using Amazon Web Services, effectively shutting the company down. The loosely-framed charge against both Trump and Parler was incitement of violence and insurrection. There were no trials. There was no evidence presented for any crime formally argued. This is law in the age of corporate oligarchy. It is purposefully ambiguous, it is uncompromising, and when you run afoul of the powers that be, there is no recourse. Not even for the “most powerful man in the world.” </p><p>This of course begs the question: who is actually in charge right now? </p><p>Today, the internet is a life-critical layer of our world. In some sense, what happens on the internet —&nbsp;from payments to communication —&nbsp;is all that matters, as without it few things of significance in the “real world” are possible. You would be forgiven for not remembering that Trump was impeached last year, as it meant practically nothing. But erasing him from the internet? If this sticks, and Trump can no longer communicate or raise funds at scale, a small handful of unelected tech executives just ended a president’s political career. In theory, they can legally do this to anyone, which means they are effectively the most powerful people alive. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-should-we-address-the-growing-power-shift-from-washington-to-silicon-valley/2018/11/19/1470eb9a-e9e4-11e8-bbdb-72fdbf9d4fed_story.html">Silicon Valley is our nation’s shadow capital, argues Katherine Boyle,</a> and welcome to the shadow state. It is not a democracy. </p><p>The immediate arguments both in favor and against Trump’s censorship were equally ridiculous. From the camp against, we were told the technology industry’s actions were comparable to Chinese-style censorship. This is not even close to true. The Chinese Communist Party executes political dissidents, and while our nation is not immune to such governance, and many Americans do perversely seem to want CCP-style censorship, such dystopia has not yet descended on our country. As Dan Primack correctly notes: &nbsp;</p><p>From the camp in favor of vanishing Trump — people who have warned us of some ambiguous corporate overreach for decades, which I suppose in hindsight only ever meant “money people bad” —&nbsp;we were told this is simply what a free market looks like. Free speech cannot be constitutionally guaranteed where private corporations are concerned, as it infringes on the owner of a company’s rights to free association and speech (again, an interesting point of concern from the “business is always wrong” corner of the commentariat). If you don’t want to be vanished, we’re told, build your own sprawling, multibillion-dollar, duopolistic communications platform. But legally speaking, this is in the first place not straightforward. </p><p>In <em>Pruneyard Shopping Center Vs. Robins</em>, <a href="https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/583/pruneyard-shopping-center-v-robins#:~:text=Robins%20(1980)&amp;text=In%20PruneYard%20Shopping%20Center%20v,afoul%20of%20the%20Fifth%20Amendment">the Supreme Court ruled California could protect political protesters from being evicted from private property.</a> This case built on a body of law that flourished throughout the 60s and 70s, and included such cases as <em>Marsh v. Alabama</em> (1946), <em>Lloyd Corporation Ltd. v. Tanner</em> (1972), and <em>Amalgamated Food Employees Union Local 590 v. Logan Valley Plaza</em> (1968). We haven’t even touched the <em>Sherman Antitrust Act</em>, or the much-discussed <em>Section 230</em>, and this is already complicated. In any case, the notion one should simply build a competitor platform if he isn’t happy with his Twitter ban has never really been serious, as everyone who works in tech is well aware it isn’t possible to build such a platform absent ideological submission to the shadow state. This was plainly evidenced by Parler’s fate last week. </p><p>If a natural right can’t meaningfully be exercised, can it really be said to exist? David Sacks has been absolute fire on this question all week:</p><p>The American Bill of Rights was written at the time of the printing press, a machine that anyone could buy, the street corner, on which anyone could sell a paper, a system of public roads and walks for distribution, and thousands of small businesses that comprised the “market,” any one of which, absolutely, could refuse to sell a paper, but no one or two (or five in obvious collusion) were capable of censoring a single voice out of public existence. Today, the internet is the gateway through which almost our entire democracy is conducted. It is where we go to learn about the world, almost without exception. It is our contemporary printing press, our street corner, our public roads and walks, and our market, all combined and dominated by a small handful of giants from the same class, of roughly the same politics, and from mostly the same region. </p><p>Should this tiny, unelected group of people so-empowered be allowed to vanish any voice from public, for any reason? Is this truly in keeping with the spirit of the Constitution? Separate from the legal questions: is this the kind of country you want to live in? </p><p>We are in danger, here —&nbsp;clearly, come on,<em> you know that this is true</em> —&nbsp;of something very dark. </p><p><strong>Ok but insurrection though.</strong> I recently spoke with a tech executive who supported Trump’s ban from public existence. He asked what theoretical action I would think worthy of such incredible censorship from the industry. A coup? Insurrection? What about incitement of violence? Herein lies tech’s only reasonable defense of itself, and the most popular argument in favor of Trump’s purge from the internet: he was hurting people. Isn’t that enough to act? The problem is the evidence here is ambiguous, and the argument lends itself to valid accusations of hypocrisy, as all of these things have been perpetrated by other political leaders, both at home and abroad, and often in a manner not ambiguous at all. The position is also somewhat naively oblivious of a political leader’s role, which is —&nbsp;I hate to break it to you, folks —&nbsp;violence. This is not to say violence is okay. This is not to excuse any of Trump’s deeply unhelpful ambiguity. This is only to say the logical consequence of the technology industry’s extraordinary actions last week must necessarily be massive, global censorship. Let’s set aside for a moment the question of whether or not censorship of this kind would be healthy. Is it really what our shadow state is planning? Because if dramatically accelerated speech crackdowns aren’t on the menu, tech’s actions sum only to narrow, draconian, partisan censorship. </p><p>It should go without saying I’m against activist political violence, and think everyone who participated in last week’s riot at the capitol should be tried and, when convicted, jailed. But I’ve said it anyway, repeatedly, both specifically in the context of the capitol riot and consistently, in every other context we’ve seen such behavior, throughout most of our batshit crazy 2020. I have felt compelled to speak about this issue as often as I have because what took place in Washington last week was not an outlier event. </p><p>The capitol riot was the latest in a string of unacceptably violent outbursts for which media personalities, activists, and politicians have spent the last year apologizing, and in many cases, by the standards to which we are now holding Trump —&nbsp;“dog whistles,” contributions to a “culture of hate” or “violence” —&nbsp;actively encouraging. Some cases have been less ambiguous. “Non-violence is an important tool for protests,” wrote Slate magazine this summer amidst a kind of chaos we have not seen on American streets for over half a century, <a href="https://twitter.com/Slate/status/1268415955937513473?s=20">“but so is violence.”</a> People were killed at the capitol, and property, both public and private, was destroyed. A federal building was invaded. All of these things are insane, and wrong, and intolerable. They are also illegal. Again: <em>these people should be tried, and when convicted sent to prison</em>. But have we so soon forgotten <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/goodbye-summer-of-love-11607898398">our summer of love in the CHAZ</a>? Or do we simply believe the MAGA Viking more likely to succeed in “insurrection” than the unhinged Stalinist baristas in Seattle explicitly calling for revolution? </p><p>I’ve been told repeatedly this week, while raising questions about a scale of censorship we have literally never before seen, that at least one of the capitol rioters was planning an assassination. This is chilling. If proven true, it will unfortunately also not be unique. Have we already memory-holed the Republican Congressional baseball shooting, where Congressman Steve Scalise and three of his colleagues were nearly killed by an unhinged Bernie Sanders stan? And how do we think this would-be assassin was radicalized? Carrier pigeon? No, the internet appears to be catalyzing significant political radicalization. The problem is deep, and broad. It is also by the way something <a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/tether-part-i">I write about not infrequently.</a> I’m glad the industry is finally concerned with the phenomenon, but is Jack Dorsey really prepared to own the issue? Because I’m sorry, but the problem isn’t Trump’s Twitter account, no matter how easy that would make this —&nbsp;in a sense, the problem appears to be Twitter. I’m pretty sure it’s driving us insane. </p><p>Gather round, friends. Have I told you yet about the time (this Christmas Eve) when a wildly-popular Marxist podcaster expressed a desire to see me dead in direct response to a piece I wrote about his fiancé’s boss, my San Francisco district supervisor? What about the time, immediately after, when his followers asked for my address, presumably to kill me? Do yourself a favor and keyword search the word “guillotine,” or the hammer and sickle emoji (which, while we’re on the topic, why the fuck does that exist?). Here’s …</p></div></div>

            Basic information about how the SDKs code function. They start with a call to the Android/Java API that deals with audio recording and playback. From there with a buffer array full of some audio data, it can then be sent to a native code library that is also installed as part of the SDK. These libraries handle the more CPU intensive work such as sifting through the data using various common methods (Goertzel et al) to find audio signals of interest.

<p>When it comes to programming, frameworks are there to make your life easy. React, Vue, Larvel, Bootstrap, I can go on and on to list your favourite frameworks.</p>
<p>When it comes to web development, I love to use frameworks because, </p>
<ul><li>It helps me to follow best practises.</li><li>Once I got used to a framework development becomes super easy and increases my productivity.</li></ul>
<p>But, recently two things happened to me that question me about frameworks and how they can change or alter the way you think in programming.</p>
<p>The first occasion happened when I attempted a challenge to create a javascript todo app that fits inside a single tweet, AKA, I had to make a bare minimal todo app under 280 characters.</p>
<p>I tried so hard to complete the challenge in plain javascript, only to give up, and ended up using a framework because I thought it is not possible to do it in plain javascript. I even went on to write a post and even comment on HackerNews that it is not possible to do it in plain javascript, only to be proven wrong by many talented developers on HackerNews.</p>
<p>You can read more about that here</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>The second occasion happened to me when I was trying to make a simple HTML login page.</p>
<p>I’m used to using a CSS framework like Bootstrap or <a href="https://bulma.io/">Bulma</a>, and later modifying the CSS to fit my requirements, and even add more rules as I go along the way.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to the login page, I didn’t want to use a framework, because I don’t need all the unnecessary CSS rules, all I wanted to have two input boxes, some text and a button. So I decided to make a custom CSS file instead.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t simple as I initially thought, I have gotten used to using a css framework to a point I was too bored to write some basic CSS rules for the simple login page. </p>
<p>I wanted the instant snappy feeling. Add some classes box, and you are done, boom, you have a decent design in five minutes. But with heaps of unwanted, unused CSS rules polluting the page.</p>
<p>But that was not the case, I had to write some basic css in order to get things working, and it felt boring, and painful drag.</p>
<p>I call this the framework trap, you have gotten used to depending on a single framework so much, that you tend to forget the basics, or want to bypass the basics, or it has altered your thinking pattern like in the first instance, where I felt like there was no other way to solve the challenge other than using a framework.</p>
<p>I may have fallen to the trap of Vue, Bootstrap or Bulma, but think to yourself, replace my frameworks with React, Angular or some other framework, have you ever got caught in the framework trap?</p>
<p><strong>No by this post, I don’t mean that you should not use any framework, and I will continue to use frameworks, and kudos to all the FOSS developers who make these awesome frameworks. </strong></p>
<p>But don’t get caught in a framework trap, and know that there can be multiple solutions for a single problem.</p>

<h2>
Descriptions
</h2>
<h3 id="SECURITY-1889">
XSS vulnerability in notification bar
</h3>
<p><strong>
SECURITY-1889
/
CVE-2021-21603
</strong></p><p>Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier does not escape notification bar response contents (typically shown after form submissions via Apply button).</p>
<p>This results in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to influence notification bar contents.</p>
<p>Jenkins 2.275, LTS 2.263.2 escapes the content shown in notification bars.</p>
<h3 id="SECURITY-2035">
Stored XSS vulnerability in button labels
</h3>
<p><strong>
SECURITY-2035
/
CVE-2021-21608
</strong></p><p>Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier does not escape button labels in the Jenkins UI.</p>
<p>This results in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by attackers with the ability to control button labels.
An example of buttons with a user-controlled label are the buttons of the Pipeline <code>input</code> step.</p>
<p>Jenkins 2.275, LTS 2.263.2 escapes button labels in the Jenkins UI.</p>
<h3 id="SECURITY-2153">
Reflected XSS vulnerability in markup formatter preview
</h3>
<p><strong>
SECURITY-2153
/
CVE-2021-21610
</strong></p><p>Jenkins allows administrators to choose the markup formatter to use for descriptions of jobs, builds, views, etc. displayed in Jenkins.
When editing such a description, users can choose to have Jenkins render a formatted preview of the description they entered.</p>
<p>Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier does not implement any restrictions for the URL rendering the formatted preview of markup passed as a query parameter.
This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability if the configured markup formatter does not prohibit unsafe elements (JavaScript) in markup, like <a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/anything-goes-formatter/">Anything Goes Formatter Plugin</a>.</p>
<p>Jenkins 2.275, LTS 2.263.2 requires that preview URLs are accessed using POST and sets Content-Security-Policy headers that prevent execution of unsafe elements when the URL is accessed directly.</p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Note</p>
</td>
<td>
In case of problems with this change, these protections can be disabled by setting the <a href="https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/system-properties/">Java system properties</a> <code>hudson.markup.MarkupFormatter.previewsAllowGET</code> to <code>true</code> and/or <code>hudson.markup.MarkupFormatter.previewsSetCSP</code> to <code>false</code>.
Doing either is discouraged.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<h3 id="SECURITY-2171">
Stored XSS vulnerability on new item page
</h3>
<p><strong>
SECURITY-2171
/
CVE-2021-21611
</strong></p><p>Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier does not escape display names and IDs of item types shown on the New Item page.</p>
<p>This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to specify display names or IDs of item types.</p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Note</p>

<p>Jenkins 2.275, LTS 2.263.2 escapes display names and IDs of item types shown on the New Item page.</p>
<h3 id="SECURITY-1923">
Improper handling of REST API XML deserialization errors
</h3>
<p><strong>
SECURITY-1923
/
CVE-2021-21604
</strong></p><p>Jenkins provides XML REST APIs to configure views, jobs, and other items.
When deserialization fails because of invalid data, Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier stores invalid object references created through these endpoints in the Old Data Monitor.
If an administrator discards the old data, some erroneous data submitted to these endpoints may be persisted.</p>
<p>This allows attackers with View/Create, Job/Create, Agent/Create, or their respective */Configure permissions to inject crafted content into Old Data Monitor that results in the instantiation of potentially unsafe objects when discarded by an administrator.</p>
<p>Jenkins 2.275, LTS 2.263.2 does not record submissions from users in Old Data Monitor anymore.</p>
<p>In case of problems, the <a href="https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/system-properties/">Java system properties</a> <code>hudson.util.RobustReflectionConverter.recordFailuresForAdmins</code> and <code>hudson.util.RobustReflectionConverter.recordFailuresForAllAuthentications</code> can be set to <code>true</code> to record configuration data submissions from administrators or all users, partially or completely disabling this fix.</p>
<h3 id="SECURITY-1452">
Arbitrary file read vulnerability in workspace browsers
</h3>
<p><strong>
SECURITY-1452
/
CVE-2021-21602
</strong></p><p>The file browser for workspaces, archived artifacts, and <code>$JENKINS_HOME/userContent/</code> follows symbolic links to locations outside the directory being browsed in Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier.</p>
<p>This allows attackers with Job/Workspace permission and the ability to control workspace contents (e.g., with Job/Configure permission or the ability to change SCM contents) to create symbolic links that allow them to access files outside workspaces using the workspace browser.</p>

<p>Jenkins 2.275, LTS 2.263.2 no longer supports symlinks in workspace browsers.
While they may still exist on the file system, they are no longer shown on the UI, accessible via URLs, or included in directory content downloads.</p>
<p>This fix only changes the behavior of the Jenkins UI.
Archiving artifacts still behaves as before.</p>
<h3 id="SECURITY-2021">
Path traversal vulnerability in agent names
</h3>
<p><strong>
SECURITY-2021
/
CVE-2021-21605
</strong></p><p>Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier allows users with Agent/Configure permission to choose agent names that cause Jenkins to override unrelated <code>config.xml</code> files.
If the global <code>config.xml</code> file is replaced, Jenkins will start up with unsafe legacy defaults after a restart.</p>
<p>Jenkins 2.275, LTS 2.263.2 ensures that agent names are considered valid names for items to prevent this problem.</p>
<p>In case of problems, this change can be reverted by setting the <a href="https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/system-properties/">Java system property</a> <code>jenkins.model.Nodes.enforceNameRestrictions</code> to <code>false</code>.</p>
<h3 id="SECURITY-2023">
Arbitrary file existence check in file fingerprints
</h3>
<p><strong>
SECURITY-2023
/
CVE-2021-21606
</strong></p><p>Jenkins provides a feature for jobs to store and track fingerprints of files used during a build.
Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier provides a REST API to check where a given fingerprint was used by which builds.
This endpoint does not fully validate that the provided fingerprint ID is properly formatted before checking for the XML metadata for that fingerprint on the controller file system.</p>
<p>This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to check for the existence of XML files on the controller file system where the relative path can be constructed as 32 characters.</p>
<p>Jenkins 2.275, LTS 2.263.2 validates that a fingerprint ID is properly formatted before checking for its existence.</p>
<h3 id="SECURITY-2025">
Excessive memory allocation in graph URLs leads to denial of service
</h3>
<p><strong>
SECURITY-2025
/
CVE-2021-21607
</strong></p><p>Jenkins renders several different graphs for features like agent and label usage statistics, memory usage, or various plugin-provided statistics.</p>
<p>Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier does not limit the graph size provided as query parameters.</p>
<p>This allows attackers to request or to have legitimate Jenkins users request crafted URLs that rapidly use all available memory in Jenkins, potentially leading to out of memory errors.</p>
<p>Jenkins 2.275, LTS 2.263.2 limits the maximum size of graphs to an area of 10 million pixels.
If a larger size is requested, the default size for the graph will be rendered instead.</p>
<p>This threshold can be configured by setting the <a href="https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/system-properties/">Java system property</a> <code>hudson.util.Graph.maxArea</code> to a different number on startup.</p>
<h3 id="SECURITY-2047">
Missing permission check for paths with specific prefix
</h3>
<p><strong>
SECURITY-2047
/
CVE-2021-21609
</strong></p><p>Jenkins includes a static list of URLs that are always accessible even without Overall/Read permission, such as the login form.
These URLs are excluded from an otherwise universal permission check.</p>
<p>Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier does not correctly compare requested URLs with that list.</p>
<p>This allows attackers without Overall/Read permission to access plugin-provided URLs with any of the following prefixes if no other permissions are required:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>accessDenied</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>error</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>instance-identity</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>login</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>logout</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>oops</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>securityRealm</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>signup</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>tcpSlaveAgentListener</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>For example, a plugin contributing the path <code>loginFoo/</code> would have URLs in that space accessible without the default Overall/Read permission check.</p>
<p>The Jenkins security team is not aware of any affected plugins as of the publication of this advisory.</p>
<p>The comparison of requested URLs with the list of always accessible URLs has been fixed to only allow access to the specific listed URLs in Jenkins 2.275, LTS 2.263.2.</p>
<p>In case this change causes problems, additional paths can be made accessible without Overall/Read permissions:
The <a href="https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/system-properties/">Java system property</a> <code>jenkins.model.Jenkins.additionalReadablePaths</code> is a comma-separated list of additional path prefixes to allow access to.</p>

Credentials stored in plain text by TraceTronic ECU-TEST Plugin
</h3>
<p><strong>
SECURITY-2057
/
CVE-2021-21612
</strong></p><p>TraceTronic ECU-TEST Plugin 2.23.1 and earlier stores credentials unencrypted in its global configuration file <code>de.tracetronic.jenkins.plugins.ecutest.report.atx.installation.ATXInstallation.xml</code> on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.</p>
<p>These credentials can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.</p>
<p>TraceTronic ECU-TEST Plugin 2.24 adds a new option type for sensitive options.
Previously stored credentials are migrated to that option type on Jenkins startup.</p>

<p><strong>
SECURITY-2098
/
CVE-2021-21613
</strong></p><p>TICS Plugin 2020.3.0.6 and earlier does not escape TICS service responses.</p>
<p>This results in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control TICS service response content.</p>
<p>TICS Plugin 2020.3.0.7 escapes TICS service responses, or strips HTML out, as appropriate.</p>

<article>
      <p>Snowpack v3.0 is here! This is our biggest release yet with brand new features including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-bundled streaming imports</strong> - Import any npm package, on-demand.</li>
<li><strong>Integrated build optimizations</strong> - Built-in bundling, preloading, minification, and more.</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript API</strong> - Integrate with Snowpack’s brand new native JS API.</li>
<li><strong>Node.js Runtime API</strong> - Import your Snowpack-built files directly into Node.js.</li>
<li><strong>Bug fixes, stability improvements, and a whole lot more!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Install the newest version of Snowpack to get started:</p>
<pre><code>$ npm install snowpack@^3.0.0
</code></pre>
<p>Or, try out one of our updated <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-snowpack-app">Create Snowpack App</a> starter templates:</p>
<pre><code>$ npx create-snowpack-app new-project-directory --template  @snowpack/app-template-react
</code></pre>
<h2 id="reimagining-web-development-for-esm">Reimagining Web Development for ESM</h2>
<p>1 year ago, Snowpack first released with the mission to reimagine web development for modern JavaScript and ESM. Snowpack leverages modern web features to deliver a frontend build tool that needs just 50ms to start up &amp; react to new file changes, regardless of project size. In comparison, traditional web bundlers could take several seconds or even full minutes to start up in large projects.</p>
<p>Snowpack v3.0 marks another huge leap on our mission to push web development forward with the release of <strong>streaming imports</strong>. Streaming imports make it possible to import any package directly into your project, pre-built and pre-bundled for immediate use. It’s the power of the entire JavaScript ecosystem, at your fingertips.</p>

</video>
<h2 id="what-are-streaming-imports%3F">What are Streaming Imports?</h2>
<p>The typical web developer installs and manages their JavaScript dependencies locally using a package manager CLI like <code>npm</code>, <code>yarn</code> or <code>pnpm</code>. These npm packages can’t run directly in the browser, so additional work is needed to resolve, process, build and bundle these packages for the browser before you can actually use them.</p>
<p><strong>What if we could simplify this? What if you could skip the “npm install” step entirely and just fetch the relevant, pre-built package code on-demand via ESM import?</strong></p>
<pre><code><br><span>import</span> <span>*</span> <span>as</span> React <span>from</span> <span>'react'</span><span>;</span><p><br><span>import</span> <span>*</span> <span>as</span> React <span>from</span> <span>'https://cdn.skypack.dev/react@17.0.1'</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre>
<p>That URL in the example above points to <a href="https://www.skypack.dev/">Skypack</a>, a popular JavaScript CDN that we built to serve every package&nbsp;on npm as ESM. Importing dependencies by URL like this is well supported in Snowpack, Deno, and all major browsers. But writing these URLs directly into your source code isn’t ideal and makes development impossible without a network connection.</p>
<p><strong>Snowpack v3.0 brings together the best of both worlds:</strong> Get the simplicity of <code>import 'react'</code> in your own source code and let Snowpack fetch these dependencies behind the scenes, pre-built and ready to run in the browser. Snowpack caches everything for you automatically, so you can continue to work offline after the first package fetch.</p>
<p>This new workflow has several benefits over the traditional “npm install” approach:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speed:</strong> Skip the install + build steps for dependencies, and load your dependencies on-demand as pre-build, pre-bundled ESM code.</li>
<li><strong>Safety:</strong> ESM packages are pre-built into JavaScript for you and never given access to <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec19-zimmermann.pdf">run code on your machine</a>. Third-party code only ever runs sandboxed in the browser.</li>
<li><strong>Less Tooling:</strong> ESM packages are managed by Snowpack, so frontend projects that don’t need Node.js (Rails, PHP, etc.) can drop the npm CLI entirely if they choose.</li>
<li><strong>Identical Final Build:</strong> When you build your site for production, package code is transpiled with the rest of your site and tree-shaken to your exact set of imports.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is our bet on the future of web development. But if this all sounds too wild for you or you have some technical reason to keep managing your dependencies with npm, don’t worry. This is <strong>100% opt-in</strong> behavior for those who want it. By default, Snowpack will continue to pull your npm package dependencies out of your project <code>node_modules</code> directory like it always has.</p>
<p>Check out our guide on <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/guides/streaming-imports">Streaming Package Imports</a> to learn more about how to enable this new behavior in your project today.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/post-snowpackv3-esbuild.png" alt="js api"></p>
<h2 id="built-in-optimizations%2C-powered-by-esbuild">Built-in Optimizations, Powered by esbuild</h2>
<p><a href="https://esbuild.github.io/">esbuild</a> is a marvel: it performs 100x faster than most other popular bundlers their own benchmarks. esbuild is written in Go, a compiled language that can parallelize heavy bundling workloads where other popular bundlers – written in JavaScript – cannot.</p>
<p>Snowpack already uses esbuild internally as our default single-file builder for JavaScript, TypeScript and JSX files. Snowpack v3.0 takes this integration one step further, with a new built-in build optimization pipeline. Bundle, minify, and transpile your site for production in 1/100th of the time of other bundlers.</p>
<p>Snowpack is able to adopt esbuild today thanks to an early bet that we made on the future of bundling: <strong>bundling is just a post-build optimization.</strong> Thanks to this early design decision, esbuild can be plugged in and swapped out of your Snowpack build as easily as any other bundler.</p>
<p>esbuild is still a young project, but its future looks promising. In the meantime, we will also continue to invest in the existing bundler plugins for a long time to come, so that more mature projects can continue to use mature bundlers like Webpack &amp; Rollup.</p>
<p>To get started, check out the <code>optimize</code> option in our newest <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/guides/optimize-and-bundle">Optimizing Your Snowpack Build</a> guide.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/post-snowpackv3-jsapi.png" alt="js api"></p>
<h2 id="a-new-javascript-api">A New JavaScript API</h2>
<p>Snowpack’s new JavaScript API grants you more advanced control over Snowpack’s dev server and build pipeline, helping you build more powerful integrations on top of Snowpack to unlock new kinds of dev tooling and server-side rendering (SSR) solutions.</p>
<p><a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/whats-the-deal-with-sveltekit">SvelteKit</a> is the new official web app framework from the Svelte team, built with Snowpack. SvelteKit uses our new JavaScript API to manage the build pipeline and build files on-demand. Snowpack helps SvelteKit speed up development, with zero rapid updates on file change and zero upfront server start-up cost.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/microsite">Microsite</a> is another exciting new project built with Snowpack. Microsite is a Static Site Generator (SSG) for Preact that features automatic partial hydration, so that you send as little JavaScript down to the client as possible.</p>
<p>Check out our new <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/reference/javascript-interface">JavaScript API reference</a> to start building your own custom integrations on top of Snowpack.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/post-snowpackv3-runtime.png" alt="js api"></p>
<h2 id="a-new-node.js-runtime">A New Node.js Runtime</h2>
<p>Speaking of Svelte, this next feature comes directly out of our collaboration with the Svelte team. As a part of building out SvelteKit, Rich Harris created a server-side runtime for Snowpack. This runtime lets you import any Snowpack-built file directly into Node.js, handling things like ESM-&gt;CJS conversion and CSS extraction automatically.</p>
<p>The result is a unified build pipeline across both Node.js and the frontend, with all of the on-demand build performance benefits of Snowpack. Importing frontend code to run in Node.js unlocks features like true server-side rendering (SSR), test runner integrations for Jest/uvu/Mocha, and more.</p>
<p>Check out our new <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/guides/server-side-render">SSR guide</a> to get started and learn more about all of the different ways that you can connect to your Snowpack build.</p>
<p>🥳</p>
<h2 id="snowpack%E2%80%99s-one-year-anniversary">Snowpack’s One Year Anniversary</h2>
<p>Last week marked Snowpack’s one-year anniversary of the original v1.0.0 release. Looking back, I’m blown away by everything that’s happened since:</p>
<ul>
<li>150+ releases (from <code>v0.0.1</code>, all the way to v3.0 today)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/plugins">100+ Snowpack plugins</a> to choose from (and growing fast!)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack/graphs/contributors">100+ individual contributors</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack/stargazers">15,000+ stars on GitHub</a></li>
<li>#1 Developer Productivity Boost Winner, <a href="https://osawards.com/javascript/2020">2020 JS Open Source Awards</a></li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>The untyped lambda calculus has a very simple grammar with just three term formers: <span>\(\def\sp{\mspace{5mu}}\)</span></p>
<p><span>\[ \mathrm{term}
 \mathrel{\vcenter{\hbox{::}}{=}} v \sp
  | \sp \lambda \sp v \sp . \sp \mathrm{term} \sp
  | \sp \mathrm{term} \sp \mathrm{term} \sp
  \]</span></p>
<p>Or in Haskell:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>data</span> <span>Lam</span> a <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2">  <span>Var</span><span> ::</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Lam</span> a</span>
<span id="cb1-3">  <span>Lam</span><span> ::</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Lam</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Lam</span> a</span>
<span id="cb1-4">  <span>App</span><span> ::</span> <span>Lam</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Lam</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Lam</span> a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In order that this work as a theory of computation, we need some notion of evaluation and this is driven by <span>\(\beta\)</span>-reduction. The standard jargon in lambda caluclus is to say that a <span>\(\beta\)</span>-redex is any subterm of the form <span>\((\lambda \mathrm{x} \sp . \sp \mathrm{f}) \sp \mathrm{arg}\)</span>. On such a <span>\(\beta\)</span>-redex we can then step via (capture-avoiding) substitution:</p>
<p><span>\[ (\lambda \mathrm{x} \sp . \sp \mathrm{f}) \sp \mathrm{arg}
    \rightsquigarrow
   f\sp[x  \mathrel{\vcenter{\hbox{:}}{=}} \mathrm{arg}]
  \]</span></p>
<p>Formally we then extend this to a congruence relation on Lambda terms via rules of the form:</p>
<p><span>\[
  M \rightsquigarrow M' \Rightarrow M N \rightsquigarrow M' N
\]</span> <span>\[
  N \rightsquigarrow N' \Rightarrow M N \rightsquigarrow M  N'
  \]</span></p>
<p>Precisely how we choose to set up these rules to give a computational semantics to our language corresponds algorithmically to a choice of evaluation strategy. As such, this opens up myriad interesting questions related to order of evaluation and normal forms and so on. Instead we will largely bypass these considerations and concentrate on the more humdrum (but no less vital) matter of the practicalities of performing such capture-avoiding substitutions. The basic problem with too naive an approach is as follows:</p>
<p><span>\[ (\lambda \sp \mathrm{x} \sp . \sp \lambda \sp y \sp . \sp  x) \sp \mathrm{y}
    \rightsquigarrow
   (\lambda \mathrm{y} \sp . \sp y)
  \]</span></p>
<p>Here we have substituted the <em>free</em> variable y into our lambda term and it has become <em>bound</em>. This is semantically incorrect: the names of free variables are meaningful because, in spirit, they refer to names we have defined elsewhere (that is, they can be looked up within a context, or, in other words, they are <em>open</em> for further substitution). Conversely, the names of bound variables are, computationally speaking, unimportant. In fact, it is usual to refer to the grammar we have introduced earlier as <em>pre-lambda terms</em> and to take lambda terms as referring to the equivalence classes under <span>\(\alpha\)</span>-equivalence. This refers to the (equivalence) relation whereby two terms are equivalent if we can consistently rename the bound variables of one to obtain the other (here too we need to take care, <span>\(\alpha\)</span>-renaming <span>\(\mathrm{x}\)</span> to <span>\(\mathrm{y}\)</span> in the above term would lead to a different sort of variable capture). Most accounts of <span>\(\alpha\)</span>-equivalence are themselves intimiately tied up with the question of how to perform substitution (and locally nameless is no different in this respect).</p>
<p>In practice this means that in order to compute <span>\((\lambda \mathrm{x} \sp . \sp \mathrm{f}) \sp \mathrm{arg}\)</span> we would first <span>\(\alpha\)</span>-rename <span>\(\mathrm{x}\)</span> to a variable that is neither already named within <span>\(\mathrm{f}\)</span>, nor appears free within <span>\(\mathrm{arg}\)</span>. Carrying out such a procedure by brute force is workable, but tends to be rather error-prone. A straightforward approach along these lines is described in <a href="http://augustss.blogspot.com/2007/10/simpler-easier-in-recent-paper-simply.html">this excellent post</a> by Lennart Augustsson.</p>
<p>There are a <a href="https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/user/edwardk/bound">whole host</a> of more sophisticated methods for dealing with the problem of capture-avoiding substitution. Perhaps one of the best known is to use De-Bruijn indices. The idea here is to replace all bound variables by a natural number. This indicates the variable’s distance from its binding site. All free variables are then represented by distinct natural numbers greater than the maximum depth of any binding site in the term. We then keep track of these variables within the environment under which computation is performed. For instance, the following is how one might translate a typical term into De-Bruijn indices:</p>
<p><span>\[ (\lambda \sp \mathrm{x} \sp . \sp \lambda \sp y \sp . \sp  x \sp z)
    \longrightarrow
   (\lambda \sp \lambda \sp . \sp 1 \sp 3 )
   \]</span> <span>\[
   [z \mapsto 3]
  \]</span></p>
<p>Here we keep both the translated lambda term but also the context for how to read free variables.</p>
<p>This approach offers two key advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capture avoiding substitution becomes a matter of keeping binding distance arithmetic in check.</li>
<li>The De-Bruijn representation gives canonical representatives for <span>\(\alpha\)</span>-equivalence classes, thus allowing us to test for <span>\(\alpha\)</span>-equivalence via syntactic equality of terms.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, Bob Atkey has, rather aptly, referred to the ability to read terms written with DeBruijn indices as a “cylon detector”. What we gain in ease of implementation we give up in much worse readability.</p>
<p>Instead we turn to the hybrid approach in the paper <a href="http://www.cs.ru.nl/~james/RESEARCH/haskell2004.pdf">I Am Not a Number – I am a Free Variable</a>. Let us keep free variables free and use De-Bruijn indices only for bound variables:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>-- Our variable type keeps the old free variables and uses</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><span>--integers to represent bound variables.</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><span>data</span> <span>Var</span> a</span>
<span id="cb2-4">  <span>=</span> <span>F</span> a</span>
<span id="cb2-5">  <span>|</span> <span>B</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb2-6"></span>
<span id="cb2-7"><span>-- Locally nameless terms will be the same lambda terms with</span></span>
<span id="cb2-8"><span>-- variables now labelled either bound or free.</span></span>
<span id="cb2-9"><span>type</span> <span>LocallyNameless</span> a <span>=</span> <span>Lam</span> (<span>Var</span> a)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Notice how, because we use the same lambda terms with this representation, we still have names at binders. This is useful as we can recover the named term we started out with, carrying along all such names as we perform work. Here is how we convert between the two representations:</p>

<p>Now let’s see that this works as expected (this is, for me, a worrying amount of bookeeping to leave to “Looks good!”). Let us use quickcheck to see that <strong>fromLocallyNameless</strong> is a left inverse to <strong>toLocallyNameless</strong>:</p>

<p>Thankfully, this does indeed work as expected:</p>
<pre><code>Tests
  Property Tests
    fromLocallyNameless ∘ toLocallyNameless == id: OK (0.35s)
      +++ OK, passed 1000 tests.</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have terms in locally nameless representation, we can perform substitution in a fairly straightforward manner. In the McBride–McKinna (MM) paper, they refer to this operation as <strong>“instantiate”</strong>. It is also common in the locally nameless literature to call the operation <strong>“opening”</strong> or <strong>“open”</strong> because it involves opening the body of a term to substitute for its outermost bound variable. As this accords with our intuitions on the meaning of substitution of locally nameless terms, we will follow this convention.</p>
<p>Note that in the code below, we follow (at least in spirit) the MM approach of using a scope type to denote a term that is only legal as the body of an expression (i.e.&nbsp;a term which may have bound variables referring to a non-existant outer binder such as <span>\(\lambda \sp . \sp 1\)</span>). In our case, we only use a type synonym; however, in a more substantial implementation, one should use a newtype to get the type safety that such a measure confers.</p>

  <article>


<p>It’s a new year and there’s a new <a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/releases/tag/v0.13.0">Gleam release</a>! Let’s take a look
at what this one brings.</p>

<h2 id="gotta-go-fast">Gotta go fast</h2>

<p>The compiler was no slouch but with this new version it’s faster than ever
thanks to improvements to the Gleam and Erlang code generators, as well as a
full rewrite of the parser by <a href="https://gitlab.com/greggreg">Greg</a>.</p>

<p>With these changes compiling Gleam code is 1.8 times faster, and formatting
Gleam code is a super nimble 4.6 times faster! On my machine Gleam compiling
the standard library now takes ~170ms, and formatting all the files takes ~70ms.</p>

<p>This is only the start. Gleam compilation is currently single threaded and
doesn’t make use of any caching, so there’s lots of opportunities to make big
performance improvements in future.</p>

<h2 id="even-better-errors">Even better errors</h2>

<p>Greg’s parser rewrite wasn’t just about performance, it also greatly improved
the error messages caused by syntax errors. Here are some examples to click through:</p>

<h2 id="type-safe-division">Type safe division</h2>

<p>Division is a tricky problem thanks to the number zero. In mathematics the
result of dividing any non-zero number by zero is undefined, making it is a
question with no answer.</p>

<p>Sadly as programmers we can’t leave it undefined, have to do something. At
some point some code will be written that divides by zero, so what should the
language do when that happens? There are largely three options:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Throw an exception</li>
  <li>Return <code>Infinity</code></li>
  <li>Return zero</li>
</ol>

<p>Throwing an exception is the approach taken by Erlang and other BEAM
languages, and historically this is the approach taken by Gleam. However,
there is a problem.</p>

<p>Gleam aims to be an exception free language, and the <code>assert</code> keyword is
intended as being the only way to crash a process. Errors should be
represented by the type system, so it is not in keeping with the design and
goals of the language for division to sometimes crash when dividing numbers.</p>

<p>Languages such as JavaScript that follow IEEE 754 return an <code>Infinity</code> value
when dividing by zero, which may be positive or negative. This is a familiar
solution to many programmers, and it fits well with Gleam’s “never implicitly
crash” goal.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there is no <code>Infinity</code> value on the Erlang virtual so Gleam
would have to implement this. While possible this would cause problems with
Erlang and Elixir interop- we could no longer safely pass Gleam numbers to
Erlang functions as they may be this special <code>Infinity</code> value, which would
likely cause a crash. The same problem would occur when calling Gleam code
from Erlang or Elixir, resulting in adding Gleam libraries to your Erlang or
Elixir application being less appealling.</p>

<p>The last option is to follow in the footsteps of languages such as Pony,
Isabelle, Lean and Coq and return zero. This might seem strange at first, but
it is type safe, allows us to maintain good interop with other BEAM
languages, and is representable on any other platform we might target in
future.</p>

<p>In Gleam dividing by zero returns zero!</p>



<h2 id="improved-documentation">Improved documentation</h2>

<p>Gleam has the ability to render <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/">HTML
documentation</a> for your code, ready to
upload to Hexdocs.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/michaeljones">Michael Jones</a> documentation for
functions and types can automatically insert links to GitHub, GitLab, or
BitBucket so you can quickly see how they are implemented.</p>

<p><img src="https://gleam.run/img/gleam-0-13-docs-link.jpg" alt="A screenshot of Gleam's rendered docs showing a link to source code"></p>

<p>Let us know if you use another source code hosts and would like support added too.</p>

<p>Following up from that <a href="https://github.com/michallepicki">Michał Łępicki</a>
added a version selector so that you can quickly find the documentation for
the version of the library you are using. This dropdown is integrated with
Hexdocs so it will display all versions of the library, rather than just
earlier ones.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

				
<h2>Preamble</h2>



<p>The direct way to a PCI passthrough virtual machines on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. I try limit changes of the host operating system to a minimum, but provide enough details, that even Linux rookies are able to participate.</p>



<p>The final system will run Xubuntu 20.04 as host operating system(OS), and Windows 10 2004 as guest OS. Gaming is the main use-case of the guest system. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, the setup process can be pretty complex. It consists of fixed base settings, some variable settings and several optional (mostly performance) settings. In order to sustain readability of this post, and because I aim to use the virtual machine for gaming only, I minimized the variable parts for latency optimization. The variable topics itself are linked in articles – I hope this makes sense. 🙂</p>



<h3>About this guide</h3>



<p>This guide targets Ubuntu 20.04 and is based on my former guides for Ubuntu <a href="https://mathiashueber.com/windows-virtual-machine-gpu-passthrough-ubuntu/">18.04</a> and <a href="https://mathiashueber.com/amd-ryzen-based-passthrough-setup-between-xubuntu-16-04-and-windows-10/">16.04</a> host systems. </p>



<p>However, this guide should be also applicable to <strong>Pop!_OS</strong> 19.04 and newer. If you wish to proceed with <strong>Pop!_OS</strong> as host system you can do so, just look out for my colorful <strong><span><span>Pop!_OS</span></span></strong> labels.</p>



<h4>Breaking changes for older passthrough setups in Ubuntu 20.04</h4>



<h5>Kernel version </h5>



<p>Starting with kernel version 5.4, the “vfio-pci” driver is no longer a kernel module, but build-in into the kernel. We have to find a different way instead of using <code>initramfs-tools/modules</code> config files, as I recommended in e.g. <a href="https://mathiashueber.com/windows-virtual-machine-gpu-passthrough-ubuntu/">the 18.04 guide</a>.</p>



<h5>QEMU version</h5>



<p>Ubuntu 20.04 ships with QEMU version 4.2. It introduces audio fixes. This needs attention if you want to use a virtual machine definition from an older version.</p>



<p>If you want to use a newer version of QEMU, <a href="https://mathiashueber.com/manually-update-qemu-on-ubuntu-18-04/" target="_blank" aria-label="you can build it on your own (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can build it on your own</a>.</p>



<blockquote><p><span><strong>Attention!</strong></span> </p><p>QEMU version 5.0.0 – 5.0.0-6 should not be used for a passthrough setup due to stability issues.</p></blockquote>



<h5>Bootmanager </h5>



<p>This is no particular “<em>problem</em>” with Ubuntu 20.04, but at least for one popular distro which is based on Ubuntu – <a aria-label="Pop_OS! 20.04 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://pop.system76.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Pop!_OS 20.04</a>. </p>



<p>I think, starting with version 19.04, <strong><span><span>Pop!_OS</span></span></strong> uses systemd as boot manager, instead of grub. This means triggering kernel commands works differently in <strong><span><span>Pop!_OS</span></span></strong>.</p>



<h2>Introduction to VFIO, PCI passthrough and IOMMU</h2>



<p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vfio.txt" target="_blank">Virtual Function I/O</a> (or <strong>VFIO</strong>) allows a virtual machine (VM) direct access to a PCI hardware resource, such as a graphics processing unit (GPU). Virtual machines with set up GPU passthrough can gain close to bare metal performance, which makes running games in a Windows virtual machine possible.</p>



<p>Let me make the following simplifications, in order to fulfill my claim of beginner friendliness for this guide:</p>



<p>PCI devices are organized in so called <a aria-label="IOMMU groups (opens in a new tab)" href="https://vfio.blogspot.com/2014/08/iommu-groups-inside-and-out.html" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank">IOMMU groups</a>. In order to pass a device over to the virtual machine, we have to pass all the devices of the same IOMMU group as well. In a prefect world each device has its own IOMMU group — unfortunately that’s not the case. </p>



<p>Passed through devices are isolated, and thus no longer available to the host system. Furthermore, it is only possible to isolate all devices of one IOMMU group at the same time. </p>



<p>This means, even when not used in the VM, a device can no longer be used on the host, when it is an “<em>IOMMU group sibling</em>” of a passed through device. </p>



<h2>Requirements</h2>



<h3>Hardware</h3>



<p>In order to successfully follow this guide, it is mandatory that the used hardware supports virtualization and has properly separated IOMMU groups.</p>



<p><strong>The used hardware</strong></p>



<ul><li>AMD Ryzen7 1800x (<strong>CPU</strong>)</li><li>Asus Prime-x370 pro (<strong>Mainboard</strong>)</li><li>2x 16 GB DDR4-3200 running at 2400MHz (<strong>RAM</strong>) </li><li>Nvidia GeForce 1050 GTX (Host <strong>GPU</strong>; PCIE slot 1)</li><li>Nvidia GeForce 1060 GTX (Guest <strong>GPU</strong>; PCIE slot 2)</li><li>500 GB NVME <strong>SSD</strong> (Guest OS; M.2 slot)</li><li>500 GB <strong>SSD</strong> (Host OS; SATA) </li><li>750W <strong>PSU</strong></li></ul>



<p>When composing the systems’ hardware, I was eager to avoid the necessity of kernel patching. Thus, the ACS override patch is not required for said combination of mainboard and CPU. </p>



<p>If your mainboard has no proper IOMMU separation you can try to solve this by using a <a aria-label="patched kernel (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://queuecumber.gitlab.io/linux-acs-override/" target="_blank">patched kernel</a>, or <a aria-label="patch the kernel on your own (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PCI_passthrough_via_OVMF#Bypassing_the_IOMMU_groups_(ACS_override_patch)" target="_blank">patch the kernel on your own</a>. </p>



<h3>BIOS settings</h3>



<p>Enable the following flags in your BIOS:</p>



<ul><li><code>Advanced \ CPU config - SVM Module -&gt; enable</code></li><li><code>Advanced \ AMD CBS - IOMMU -&gt; enable</code></li></ul>



<blockquote><p><strong>Attention!</strong> </p><p>The ASUS Prime x370/x470/x570 pro BIOS versions for AMD RYZEN 3000-series support (v. 4602 – 5220), will break a PCI passthrough setup. </p><p>Error: “<strong>Unknown PCI header type ‘127’</strong>“.</p><p>BIOS version <strong>up to</strong> (and including) 4406, 2019/03/11 are working.</p><p>BIOS version <strong>from</strong> (and including) 5406, 2019/11/25 are working.</p></blockquote>



<p>I used Version: 4207 (8th Dec 2018)</p>



<h3>Host operating system settings</h3>



<p>I have installed Xubuntu 20.04 x64 (UEFI) from <a href="https://xubuntu.org/download" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>



<p>Ubuntu 20.04 LTS ships with kernel version 5.4 which works good for VFIO purposes – check via: <code>uname -r</code></p>



<blockquote><p><span><strong>Attention!</strong></span> </p><p>Any kernel, starting from version 4.15, works for a Ryzen passthrough setup. </p><p><strong>Except</strong> kernel versions <strong>5.1, 5.2 </strong>and<strong> 5.3</strong> including all of their subversion.</p></blockquote>



<p>Before continuing make sure that your kernel plays nice in a VFIO environment.</p>



<h4>Install the required software</h4>



<p>Install <a aria-label="QEMU (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.qemu.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">QEMU</a>, <a aria-label="Libvirt (opens in a new tab)" href="https://libvirt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Libvirt</a>, the <a href="https://virt-manager.org/" target="_blank" aria-label="virtualization manager (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">virtualization manager</a> and related software via:</p>



<p><code>sudo apt install qemu-kvm qemu-utils libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-clients bridge-utils virt-manager ovmf</code></p>



<h2>Setting up the PCI passthrough</h2>



<p>We are going to passthrough the following devices to the VM: </p>



<ul><li>1x GPU: Nvidia GeForce 1060 GTX </li><li>1x USB host controller</li><li>1x SSD: 500 GB NVME M.2</li></ul>



<h3>Enabling IOMMU feature</h3>



<p>Enable the IOMMU feature via your grub config. On a system with AMD Ryzen CPU run: </p>



<p><code>sudo nano /etc/default/grub</code> </p>



<p>Edit the line which starts with <code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT</code> to match: </p>



<p><code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="amd_iommu=on iommu=pt"</code> </p>



<p>In case you are using an Intel CPU the line should read:</p>



<p><code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="intel_iommu=on"</code></p>



<p>Once you’re done editing, save the changes and exit the editor (<code>CTRL+x CTRL+y</code>). </p>



<p>Afterwards run:</p>



<p><code>sudo update-grub</code> </p>



<p>→ Reboot the system when the command has finished.</p>



<p>Verify if IOMMU is enabled by running after a reboot:</p>



<p><code>dmesg |grep AMD-Vi</code></p>



<div>
<p>
dmesg output
</p>
<div>

<pre><code>[ 0.792691] AMD-Vi: IOMMU performance counters supported 
[ 0.794428] AMD-Vi: Found IOMMU at 0000:00:00.2 cap 0x40 
[ 0.794429] AMD-Vi: Extended features (0xf77ef22294ada):

[ 0.794688] AMD-Vi: Lazy IO/TLB flushing enabled
</code></pre>
<p>[collapse]</p>
</div>
</div>




<h4>For systemd boot manager as used in Pop!_OS </h4>



<p>One can use the kernelstub module, on systemd booting operating systems, in order to provide boot parameters. Use it like so: </p>



<p><code>sudo kernelstub -o "amd_iommu=on amd_iommu=pt"</code></p>



<h3>Identification of the guest GPU</h3>



<blockquote><p><span><strong>Attention!</strong></span> </p><p>After the upcoming steps, the guest GPU will be ignored by the host OS. You <strong>have to have</strong> a second GPU for the host OS now!</p></blockquote>



<p>In this chapter we want to identify and isolate the devices before we pass them over to the virtual machine. We are looking for a GPU and a USB controller in suitable IOMMU groups. This means, either both devices have their own group, or they share one group. </p>



<p>The game plan is to apply the vfio-pci driver to the to be passed-through GPU, before the regular graphic card driver can take control of it.</p>



<p>This is the most crucial step in the process. In case your mainboard does not support proper IOMMU grouping, you can still try patching your kernel with <a aria-label="the ACS override patch (opens in a new tab)" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PCI_passthrough_via_OVMF#Bypassing_the_IOMMU_groups_(ACS_override_patch)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the ACS override patch</a>. </p>



<p>One can use a <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/471285/how-to-create-execute-a-script-file/471286#471286" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">bash script</a> like <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PCI_passthrough_via_OVMF#Ensuring_that_the_groups_are_valid" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">this</a> in order to determine devices and their grouping:</p>



<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
# change the 999 if needed
shopt -s nullglob
for d in /sys/kernel/iommu_groups/{0..999}/devices/*; do
    n=${d#*/iommu_groups/*}; n=${n%%/*}
    printf 'IOMMU Group %s ' "$n"
    lspci -nns "${d##*/}"
done;</code></pre>



<p>source: <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PCI_passthrough_via_OVMF#Enabling_IOMMU" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">wiki.archlinux.org</a> + added sorting for the first 999 IOMMU groups</p>

<p>When I first joined <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> almost a year
ago, one of the first things I asked
<a href="https://github.com/crawshaw">Crawshaw</a> was, “So, what database do you
use? MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite maybe?”, knowing that he loved SQLite.</p>
<p>“A text file," he replied.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, we write out one big JSON object to a text file.”</p>
<p>“How? When? <em>What?</em>”</p>
<p>“Yeah, whenever something changes, we grab a lock in our single
process and rewrite out the file!” he chuckled with glee.</p>
<p>It sounded insane. It <em>was</em> insane. Sure, it was easily testable, but
it didn’t scale. We both knew that. But it worked.</p>
<p>Until it didn’t.</p>
<p>Even with fast NVMe drives and splitting the database into two halves
(important data vs. ephemeral data that we could lose on a tmpfs),
things got slower and slower. We knew the day would come. The file
reached a peak size of 150MB and we were writing it as quickly as the
disk I/O would let us. Ain’t that just peachy?</p>
<p>So, migrate to MySQL or PostgreSQL, right? Maybe SQLite?</p>
<p>Nope, Crawshaw had other ideas.</p>
<h4 id="a-bit-of-backstory-from-david">A bit of backstory from David</h4>
<p>Tailscale’s coordination server, our “control plane”, has become known
as <a href="https://getsmart.fandom.com/wiki/CONTROL">CONTROL</a>. It’s currently
a single Go process on a single VM. The very earliest prototypes for
CONTROL used SQLite. Our original designs were very different from
what we ended up with, involving configuration databases synchronized
onto client machines and all sorts of other concepts we ended up not
needing. Through this process we would do major reorganizations of our
SQL data model every week, which required an astonishing amount of
typing. SQL is widely used, durable, effective, and requires an
annoying amount of glue to bring into just about any programming
language. (Attempts to avoid this with ORMs usually replace an
annoying amount of typing with an annoying amount of magic and loss of
efficiency.)</p>
<p>One day, fed up with the refactorings, I threw it all out and built an
in-memory data model for experimentation. That made iterating
much faster. A couple of weeks later, a customer wanted to try it
out. I wasn’t ready to commit to the data model yet and do it properly
in SQL, so I took a shortcut: the object holding all the data was
wrapped in a <code>sync.Mutex</code>, all accesses went through it, and on edit the
whole structure was passed to <code>json.Marshal</code> and written to disk. This
gave us data model persistence in ~20 lines of Go.</p>
<p>The plan was always to migrate to something else but, uh, we got busy
with other stuff and kinda forgot.</p>
<h4 id="what-comes-after-jsonmutexdb">What comes after JSONMutexDB?</h4>
<p>The obvious next step to take was to move to SQL. My favorite is still
SQLite, but I couldn’t bring myself to make an argument for migrating
a rapidly growing service to it. It certainly could work, especially
as the design of our control plane doesn’t require the high
availability of typical web services: the result of a short outage is
that new nodes can’t log in; working networks continue to work.</p>
<p>MySQL (or PostgreSQL) would come next. I’m not particularly familiar
with anything MySQL post 1998, but I’m sure it would work. The HA
story for open source databases is somewhat surprising, though: you
can either have traditional lagging replicas, or commit to
no-primary-replica clusters that have very surprising transaction
semantics. I wasn’t excited about trying to design a stable API or
good network graph calculations on top of those semantics.
<a href="https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach#what-is-cockroachdb">CockroachDB</a>
looked very promising, and indeed still does! But it’s relatively new
for a database and I was a little concerned about getting attached to
features in a fresh DBMS that would be hard to migrate away from if we
needed to.</p>
<p>Making our control server depend on MySQL or PostgreSQL also means our
control server’s testing story gets slow &amp; ugly. Brad had fought that
battle with <a href="https://perkeep.org/">Perkeep</a> and previously written
<a href="https://godoc.org/perkeep.org/pkg/test/dockertest">perkeep.org/pkg/test/dockertest</a>
which works but isn’t something we wanted to subject future employees
to. It requires Docker on your machine and it’s not particularly fast.</p>
<p>Then one day we saw a <a href="https://jepsen.io/analyses/etcd-3.4.3">Jepsen report on
etcd</a>. Unlike the usual
less-than-satisfying Jepsen reports to which we’d become accustomed,
this one said <em>good things</em> about <a href="https://etcd.io/">etcd</a>.
Combined with some positive experiences <a href="https://github.com/danderson">Dave Anderson</a>
had with it, we started thinking about whether we could just use etcd directly.
Being written in Go, we could just link it into our tests and use it
directly. No Docker, no mocks, testing what we’d actually use in
production.</p>
<p>It turned out that the core data model we were writing to disk closely
followed the pattern:</p>
<pre><code>type AllTheData struct {
	BigLock    sync.Mutex
	Somethings map[string]Something
	Widgets    map[string]Widget
	Gadgets    map[string]Gadget
}
</code></pre><p>This maps surprisingly well onto a KV-store. So this led us to etcd as
a “minimally-viable database”. It does the critical things we needed
now, which was 1) breaking the BigLock into something more akin to a
<code>sync.RWMutex</code>, and 2) reducing our I/O to only write the changed data,
not the whole world on any write.</p>
<p>(We are careful not to use any etcd features that would be hard to map onto CockroachDB.)</p>
<p>The downside of this is that etcd, while popular in Kubernetes, has
relatively few users for a database system. As a company, Tailscale is
spending an <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">innovation
token</a> on it. But the
database is conceptually small enough that we don’t have to treat it
as a black box. When we ran into a surprisingly slow key pagination
edge case in etcd 3.4, I was able to read my way through its sources
and write a fix for it in an hour. (I then discovered an <a href="https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/commit/26c930f27d46776da5fedae69267ba0b69c31185">equivalent
fix</a>
had already been applied to the next version of etcd, so we backported
that instead.)</p>
<h4 id="tailetc-our-etcd-client-wrapper">tailetc: our etcd client wrapper</h4>
<p>The client we use for etcd is open source at
<a href="https://github.com/tailscale/tailetc">github.com/tailscale/tailetc</a>. It
is built around two concepts: 1) the total data in the DB is small
enough to fit into the server’s memory and 2) reads are far more
common than writes. Given that, we want to make reads cheap.</p>
<p>The way we do that is by registering a watch against etcd. Every
change is sent to the client, which maintains an enormous cache
<code>map[string]interface{}</code> behind a <code>sync.RWMutex</code>. When you create a Tx
and do a Get, the value is read out of this cache (which may be behind
etcd, but is kept transactionally consistent by tracking the modrev: a
global incrementing ID that etcd uses to define revisions of key-value
pairs.). To avoid aliasing bugs with the cache, we copy the object
out, but avoid JSON decoding on each Get by implementing a more
efficient Clone call on objects in the cache.</p>
<p>The result is that fetching a value from etcd does not require any
network traffic.</p>
<p>This is one of those few times writing Go that I felt the limitations
of its type system as I was designing a package. If I were working in
a language with all the bells and whistles, there would be some kind
of const qualifier I could place on objects leaving the cache and
avoid cloning the memory. That said, running profiles on our server
show the copying is not a performance issue, so perhaps this is an
example of where I feel the pull towards a more complex type system
without actually having a real need for them. As is so often the case,
assumptions are dangerous, profiling is enlightening.</p>
<h4 id="one-snag-indexes">One snag: indexes</h4>
<p>The biggest problem with choosing a minimal viable “nosql” is the lack
of the wonderful index system every standard SQL DBMS supplies. We are
stuck with either storing indexes inside etcd, or managing them in
memory in our client.</p>
<p>With JSONMutexDB we generated them in memory, because it’s much easier
to make data model changes. The easy option with etcd would have been
writing them to the database, but that would have really complicated
data models. Unfortunately, if we want to move to running more than
one CONTROL process simultaneously for high-availability and better
release management, that means we no longer have exactly one process
managing the data, so our indexes need to be transaction (and
rollback) aware. So we invested what probably amounts to two or three
weeks of engineering time into designing in-memory indexes that are
transactionally consistent. This gets a bit tricky to describe, so
we’ll save that for a future blog post (and hopefully we can clean up
the code enough to open source it some day).</p>
<h4 id="the-migration">The migration</h4>
<p>The migration wasn’t very notable, which is always a good thing. We
ran both systems in parallel for a while and at some point stopped
using the old one. The most exciting thing was that our commit latency
dropped a bunch when we turned off the JSON writes. This was most
noticeable when editing networks in the admin panel. We’d include
pretty Grafana graphs here but the cut-over predates us changing our
Prometheus config to keep more history. In any case, writes went from
nearly a second (sometimes worse!) to milliseconds. When we’d started,
writes weren’t a second of course. Never underestimate how long your
“temporary” hack will stay in production!</p>
<h4 id="future">Future</h4>
<p>The most exciting thing about this work, besides ensuring the
Tailscale control plane can scale out for the foreseeable future, is
improving our release process. A consistent database we can easily
attach multiple control plane instances to means we can move to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-green_deployment">blue-green deployment</a>.
This will let Tailscale engineers experiment with deploying features
with the confidence that the worst-case outcome of a change is
limited. The goal is to keep development speed as close to the early
days of JSONMutexDB, when you could recompile and run locally in a
fraction of a second and deploy ten times a day.</p>

<h2>Ten years without Elixir</h2>
<p>José Valim committed the first bit of Elixir code January
9th, 2011, which marks a ten-year anniversary for the kid
brother of Erlang. It’s incredible how time flies on 
certain paradigms, while crawls on others.</p>

<p>I never got into Elixir, largely because it looked like
Ruby. I was a Rubyist for a good while, spent time
and effort to learn where to park my commas, semicolons,
and periods in Erlang, so I never felt that Elixir was
something I wanted.</p>

<p>Nor have I since. There was a good web framework that
came along, and since I’m of that age, you’d thing that
Phoenix would have pulled me in: it never did. I kept
hacking Erlang and just used lighter web <abbr>API</abbr>s like
Cowboy &amp; Elli, instead of going all in on a full
fledged web framework.</p>

<p>From my Erlang-colored glasses, Elixir seems to have
a lot of wins. Their packaging efforts looks like a
mature tool (Hex), and nobody seems to be complaining
about the documentation, an issue Erlang always had (though
to be honest, I never quite grasped what aspect of the
Erlang documentation to be problematic).</p>

<p>On the other hand, some of the syntax Elixir offers
is retrograde, in my humble opinion. Erlang seems to
have prettier syntax now that I have spent so much
time with it. A moot point, perhaps, considering how
subjective beauty is.</p>

<p>My strongest anti-Elixir sentiment (from armchair
reach) is their use of pipes. I know mixologists love
the Elixir pipe operator, but for someone who has
learned to necessarily un-nest code as severely as I have, I
feel as though this operator could be a detriment, or
at least come with some prickily moral hazards. More on that
can be read 
<a href="http://blog.cretaria.com/posts/erlang-beauty.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Elixir is a cool project, and managed to out-pace Erlang
in a lot of areas it struggled (community,
tooling, etc.).</p>

<p>Hats off to the Elixir team on ten enormous years of
success!</p><p><svg xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="200 0 400 800" width="400" height="800"><rect width="400" height="800" fill="#b33a3a"></rect><polygon points="299.5 150 254.5 247 351.5 247 "></polygon><path d="m321.9 548.9l-243.8 0"></path><path d="m303 247.1l0 243.8"></path><polygon points="94.5 150 49.5 247 146.5 247 "></polygon><path d="m98 247.1l0 243.8"></path><text font-family="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" font-size="60" y="112" x="10" style="fill-opacity:null">THIS END UP</text><a xlink:href="//cretaria.com"><text id="link-cretaria" font-family="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" font-size="50" y="680" x="10" fill-opacity="null">What’s Cretaria?</text></a><path d="m175 700l200 0" style="fill-opacity:null;fill:none;stroke-linejoin:null;stroke-opacity:null;stroke-width:4;stroke:#000"></path></svg></p></article>

Hours later, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension.html">Twitter banned Donald Trump</a>. Soon after, <a href="https://www.axios.com/platforms-social-media-ban-restrict-trump-d9e44f3c-8366-4ba9-a8a1-7f3114f920f1.html">a broader group of major internet companies</a> did the same. Then, <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/amazon-parler-aws">Amazon brought the Ban Hammer down on Parler</a>, the hate reactor built by hapless fall guy John Matze and heiress Rebekah Mercer.</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_storming_of_the_United_States_Capitol#:~:text=The%20storming%20of%20the%20United,in%20the%202020%20presidential%20election.">excellent justifications for why this was necessary</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/generativist/status/1348310439331995650">why this emergent coordination occurred</a> and why was necessary. I don’t want to talk about them. What matters more for me right now? <a href="https://twitter.com/generativist/status/1348374694320250881">I don’t think it will ever work again</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/generativist/status/1348374695452708864">A trans-national economy of people building censorship-resistant technology seems to have a new occasion for war</a>. The fire next time won’t be containable in similar ways.</p>

<p>This leads me to a simple conclusion: <strong>if you care about making social mediums work better in the future, your solutions must assume censorship resistance as a given</strong>. Otherwise, <a href="https://twitter.com/generativist/status/1348374705766498304">your building on an already-pruned branch</a>.</p>
<h2 id="engineering-our-augmented-space">Engineering Our Augmented Space</h2><p>Centralized social media – as it exists today – is Procrustean. On Twitter, <a href="https://generativist.falsifiable.com/metaverse/the-real-supernode-problem">super-nodes excessively synchronize attention in mal-adaptive ways</a>. <a href="https://generativist.falsifiable.com/metaverse/dunbars-number-is-quadratic">The weight of identity-to-context skews far enough towards the former that we’re prone to chronically ignoring or failing to consider the latter</a>. <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/01/16/the-internet-of-beefs/">Social beefs end proliferate in wild abundance</a>. <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2016/09/15/crowds-and-technology/">Crowds grow, swarm, and disassociate from reality</a>. All of this is all great for farming freely-offered attention. But, a good cybernetic ecosystem it does not make.</p>

<p>Given it’s defacto-albeit-not-really role as the world’s hyperspace <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sphere">public sphere</a>, a great deal of (recent) attention seems to be on making a censorship-resistant Twitter. <a href="https://twitter.com/pfrazee/status/1348415859707023362">This is a mistake</a> borne of the DWeb/Blockchain communities’ ideological defaults.</p>

<p><strong>Censorship resistance <em>may be</em> necessary for solving some of these problems. But, it’s desperately far from sufficient.</strong> Missing is the attention dedicated to creating a social environment that fits us, not one that demands we fit it. It requires considering that – while there are a variety of technological architectures for creating a distributed and decentralized social medium – not all of them are sociological solutions.</p>
<p>I am interested in finding a solution at the intersection of both problems.</p>

<p>What follows is a small projection of my view from 10,000 feet.</p>
<h3 id="1-ephemeral-by-default">1. Ephemeral By Default</h3><p>Blockchains ensure immutability. Robust consensus mechanisms afford canonical state. Both can be useful. But the latter is computationally costly. More than that, there is an expense borne by <em>the forms of expression it selects for</em>.</p>

<p>In the context of ephemeral mediums, it’s excessively restrictive. <strong>Not every statement requires non-repudiation; in social contexts, very few do.</strong><label for="sn-0"></label><span>I’m bending what non-repudiation means a bit here. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten">Right to be forgetten</a> is almost closer. Except, you can’t forget on a global immutable ledger…by definition. Ephemeral by default albeit with cryptographic signing for message authentication means what you socially reveal is <em>more</em> in your control, and fosters better norms.</span> If every utterance persists forever, people either self-censor or <em>excessively</em> fracture their identity into disposable fragments, as a defense.<label for="sn-1"></label><span><a href="https://twitter.com/balajis">@balaijis</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=Dur918GqDIw">gives a talk worth listening to about pseudonymous economy</a> that proposes the use of cryptographic attestations to imbue alts with some of main’s properties, in a precise information theoretic way. He sees it as a way to manage social capital risks as any other capital asset. The talk is fascinating, but I think it’s solving the wrong problem.</span> Both behaviors frustrate social processes – including those of consensus formation.</p>

<p>The need to <em>optionally</em> commit a statement to a ledger in contexts where non-repudiation is desirable exists, as does the need.<label for="sn-2"></label><span>For example, if you are following someone whose reputation is derived from making accurate predictions about the future, <a href="http://www.investorhome.com/scam.htm">you want their full history, not the selectively trimmed version</a>. Global and immutable state makes such scams more difficult. <em>But</em>, my contention is that, making it impossible is too socially costly. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08913819508443369">Expressive behavior exists</a> and instrumentality is a dead end.</span> But it is not a good default. The temporal context of most expressions is now. Carrying prior utterances – generally without context – forward, creates conditions for maladaptive hysteresis. The past binds longer than it need to, in ways that don’t reflect the present – and, in doing so, it limits the future.</p>
<h3 id="2-peer-to-peer-by-necessity">2. Peer-to-peer by Necessity</h3><p>On the technological side, federation offers a means of decentralization that fits in well with existing skills and practices. For example, if you can deploy a website, you can probably set up a <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">mastodon instance</a>. This matters for fostering adoption. Participation at an infrastructure/administration level doesn’t have a steep learning curve or cost of entry.</p>

<p>On the sociological side, it also seems to solve a critical problem: users have a stake in the communities they join.  Or, more accurately, users are part of communities – <a href="https://www.nationalaffairs.com/why-speech-platforms-can-never-escape-politics">it doesn’t make much sense to speak of communities absent individual stakes</a>.  This can help create incentives for the community to define and enforce its boundaries.</p>

<p>However, boundary enforcement and community cultivation seems inextricably tied up in communal ownership of identity. For example, on mastodon, your identity is subject to community/node intervention. Expulsion doesn’t render you a digital nomad; it erases the identity. For what will end up being the most passionate and proselytizing early adopters, this is too repulsive. And while you can propose networks that afford right of <em>intact</em> exit, these have the effect of neutering the enforcement mechanisms. What you have is less of a community and more of a federated network transport.</p>
<p><strong>More to the point, I think the model reflects an implement-what-we-know mentality</strong>. Early websites were nothing more than digital brochures. Federation models try to replicate…schools? Co-op boards? Cities? City states? Nation states? They tend to assume a one-to-one/belongs-to relationship often bound by geography. But the beauty of the internet is that meat space doesn’t bind. And, the brilliance of twitter showed us that association is so free, it’s almost a liquid.<label for="sn-3"></label><span>I saw this tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronzlewis/status/1349079811587780609">@aaronzlewis</a> yesterday and wanted to plug it some how. It vaguely fits, but in any case, Aaron is worth a follow for thinking about this stuff.</span></p>

<p>Recapitulating, Zuckerborg was almost preposterously wrong when he said,<label for="sn-4"></label><span>This is unfair. If you use a loss function which penalizes legibility for the purpose of algorithmic attention resale, he was <em>precisely</em> correct.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have one identity…The days of you having a different image for your work friends or co-workers and for the other people you know are probably coming to an end pretty quickly […] Having two identities for yourself is an example of a lack of integrity.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Identity is contextual. <a href="https://amzn.to/3bBieEq">We all wear different masks</a>. And, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Distinction-Routledge-Classics-Pierre-Bourdieu/dp/0415567882/ref=sr_1_1?crid=PB4KYKEX2EUU&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=pierre+bourdieu&amp;qid=1610480340&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=pierre+bor%2Cstripbooks%2C237&amp;sr=1-1">we act in ways conditional upon both our expectation, capital, and social environment</a>. This doesn’t betray a “lack of integrity.” It is a fundamental <em>and adaptive</em> part of being a human being.</p>
<p>With this rough sketch, I reach the following conclusions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Individuals must own their identities</strong>. No one except the person associated with a particular identity can revoke it. The most motivated adopters won’t allow otherwise. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>The medium itself must not mediate voluntary associations</strong>. That is, for any possible relationship pair, no entity can inhibit <em>direct</em> communication except for either of the participants. This follows from the same adopter assumption. But, it’s also a consequence of the ethereal nature of association absent geographic confinement. While this environment has perils, it is also the source of its continuing promise.</li>
</ul>

<p>This largely precludes federation. Peer-to-peer is the way forward.<label for="sn-5"></label><span>This doesn’t mean there is no role for service providers that act as proxies, caches, aggregators, etc. There surely is and will be. But, I don’t believe they should be part of the p2p core.</span></p>
<h3 id="3-computation-is-the-massage">3. Computation is the Massage</h3><p>I argued that federation won’t work because it relies upon the wrong analogies. But, if any user can reach any user, the possible interaction space is quadratic. We do need something to structure something so incomprehensible.</p>

<p>The social graph is the scaffolding of that structure. It collapses <span>\(n^2\)</span> to something we can cope with. It affords repeated interactions and social recall. It defines an architecture for message passing <em>where we act as the processors</em>.</p>

<p>However, we are social creatures and social media is omnipresent. Viewing ourselves as the processors, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law">Parkinson’s Law</a> becomes oddly relevant: work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.  Who we follow increases until we reach the point of desired infinity-scroll saturation. At this point (or well before it), processing demands on a one-to-one basis exceed our human capabilities. <a href="https://generativist.falsifiable.com/metaverse/dunbars-number-is-quadratic">We fall back upon higher-order generalizations. Fuckery ensues.</a></p>

<p>Here, social media critics generally prescribe something like “people-centric technology” as the antidote. Increasingly, I think it’s snake oil. More often then not, you can replace it with <em>RETVRN</em> without loss of meaning. Technology changes the way we relate to each other. With it, so do our aspirations, perceptions, mediators, and institutions. Some expand, and some contract. The way through isn’t to retreat to a now inaccessible past.<label for="sn-6"></label><span>Makes note to reread <em>Industrial Society and Its Future</em> as an exercise in Take Cartography.</span> The way out is to marshal our modern resources into new capabilities.</p>

<p>This is a beautiful, astrally-projected depiction of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's <em>flow</em> concept. For the unfamiliar, here's how Csikszentmihalyi describes flow, or <em>the optimal experience</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is what the sailor holding a tight course feels when the wind whips through her hair, when the boat lunges through the waves like a colt -- sails, hull, wind, and sea humming a harmony that vibrates in the sailor's veins. It is what a painter feels when the colors on the canvas begin to set up a magnetic tension with each other, and a new <em>thing</em>, a living form, takes shape in front of the astonished creator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sounds pretty good, right? Csikszentmihalyi contends that flow is how we humans can achieve happiness. And it's not something that's given; it's something we have to cultivate and grow and work towards. I cannot recommend his book enough.</p>
<p>Even better was SOUL's depiction of the non-flow state - the lost souls:</p>

<p>Definitely been there. Usually its whenever I hear, "Can you see my screen?" These poor creatures wander the astral plane, lost and unhappy and unsure why.</p>
<p>Luckily, the movie tells us it's never too late, and I believe them.</p>
<p>So, how do we achieve flow?</p>
<p>It's the deliberate combination of skill meeting challenge. More from Csikszentmihalyi:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best moments usually occur when a person's body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This post documents a legitimate flow experience I had last week that began with an observation about my podcast addiction.</p>
<h2>All My Best Friends are Podcasts</h2>
<p>Yes, that's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_63ZZRLylE">Less Than Jake</a> reference. You're welcome, 8th-Grade Charlie.</p>
<p>And, if you're at all like 28th-Grade Charlie, then you're also helplessly addicted to podcasts.</p>
<p>I listen all the time -- while I'm washing dishes, folding laundry, performing my daily Amazon cardboard box cutting ritual, even taking showers. Carly doesn't understand it, and I certainly can't explain it.</p>
<p>Am I that afraid of silence? My own thoughts? Am I so lonely for friendship that I even found this evisceration quietly comforting?</p>

<p>I know too much about ancient Rome to be able to answer these questions.</p>
<p>So, if I'm just going to accept my Overcast overlords, can I turn the tides on this one-directional relationship?</p>
<p>Yes. We can. Enter: the spark of an idea.</p>
<h2>Create a podcast from the audio of YouTube videos</h2>
<p>If I can't control what my favorite podcast hosts are talking about in any given episode, can I instead choose <em>exactly</em> what I want to listen to? What if there were a virtually unlimited source of content to consume? Surely, I could then be more deliberate in my listening habits.</p>
<p>YouTube is our answer. I've been collecting computer science talks and lectures in playlists that I always mean to "watch later" and never do. Fact is, I don't want to watch a YouTube video. I rarely ever sit down and "watch YouTube" (other than The 8-Bit Guy cleaning old VIC-20s). It's not part of my routine. I'm usually moving around too much.</p>
<p>YouTube also makes it really hard to consume something "on the go." You need to pay for their PiP or minimized mode, I think.</p>
<p>Then I found this <a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/03/02/Creating-a-Podcast-Feed-from-a-YouTube-Playlist/">post by Benjamin Congdon</a>: a simple way to create an audio podcast feed from a YouTube playlist using a <a href="https://amzn.to/3qksZiq">Raspberry Pi</a> home server. His tutorial leverages an open source project called <a href="https://github.com/mxpv/podsync/">PodSync</a>, which itself leverages <code>ffmpeg</code> and, everyone's favorite controversy, <code>youtube-dl</code>, behind the scenes to download audio from YouTube and generate a podcast RSS feed. This, this, is exactly what I was looking for!</p>
<p>Nothing to add here, other than bravo, Benjamin. I was able to follow his tutorial pretty much straight through.</p>
<p>Wait, I do have something to add. Benjamin suggests using <code>rsync</code> to upload your mp3s and xml RSS feed to s3 or the like. I did this initially, but I didn't like the idea of having to mark these files as <code>public</code> on s3 in case of some huge accidental traffic surge.</p>
<p>So I came up with another idea:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a public repo on GitHub and enable GitHub Pages (mine is <a href="https://github.com/rockswhat/listener">here</a>)</li>
<li>Init the repo in your <code>/data</code> directory on the Raspberry Pi (this is the directory with the generated <code>.xml</code> RSS feed and <code>mp3</code> audio files)</li>
<li>Change your Podsync config's hostname to your GitHub Pages site: </li>
</ul>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>hostname = "https://rockswhat.github.io/listener"`</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>Change your cron command to push to your repo (instead of <code>rsync</code> to s3):</li>
</ul>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>*/15 * * * * cd /home/pi/podsync/data &amp;&amp; git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m "update feed" &amp;&amp; git push origin main</code></pre></div>
<p>Voila! My own podcast feed of YouTube videos, publicly available on the Internet. You can add my feed to Overcast (or your favorite podcast player) with its XML URL:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>https://rockswhat.github.io/listener/listen_laterz.xml</code></pre></div>
<h3>C'mon, you really achieved flow from <em>that</em>?</h3>
<p>No, not really, but <em>almost</em>. Tutorials, good ones, at least, are guided paths toward some goal, with micro-feedback and mini-frustrations along the way. And these things are well-suited to flow. They can lead you to flow.</p>
<p>In my case, this tutorial got my gears turning. Which now gets us into to the <code>creative computing</code> side of this article.</p>
<p>I think it's important to remind ourselves to have fun with our computers. To use them to make art, make music, create weird stuff, just because we can. There's so much on our computers and phones now thanks to the Internet that can warp our minds and render us into Lost Souls. We often forget the simple joys of computers of the past, back when they were bicycles for the mind, and used adorable floppy disks or CD-ROM drives for games and encyclopedias. I know there's so much "more" that we can do with computers, but we need to remember that they are here to work for us, and not the other way around.</p>
<p>As soon as I saw Overcast fill up with audio from my <code>Listen Laterz</code> YouTube playlist, I knew I needed to keep going, to see what else I could render from clay into podcast feeds.</p>
<h2>Creating a podcast audiobook from Project Gutenberg e-books</h2>
<p>Where else can we find a giant repository of open content on the Internet that also happens to be inconvenient to consume?</p>
<p>Hello, <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a>! </p>
<p>Project Gutenberg is just about the coolest --- and one of the most important -- things on the internet. The fact that it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Gutenberg">started on the ARPANET in 1971</a> blows my mind. That is some creative, forward-thinking from its founder Michael S. Hart.</p>
<p>My idea here is simple: pick a public domain book, chop it up into chapters, convert the chapters to audio, and then generate an xml RSS feed.</p>
<p>I picked Mary Shelley's <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/84/84-h/84-h.htm">Frankenstein</a>, because, why not? I already read it a few years ago during my October "Spooky Reads" habit, but I figured it's the perfect candidate for re-animation.</p>
<p>If you've clicked the link to the text on Project Gutenberg, you'll see it's a plaintext nightmare. I'm not ashamed to admit here that I manually just chopped it up into separate text files, rather than writing a script to somehow do this for me. Whatever, ok?</p>
<p>First let's make some files.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>cd</span> pieces
<span>touch</span> intro.txt
<span>touch</span> letter-<span>{</span><span>1</span><span>..</span><span>4</span><span>}</span>.txt
<span>touch</span> chapter-<span>{</span><span>1</span><span>..</span><span>24</span><span>}</span>.txt
<span>touch</span> license.txt</code></pre></div>
<p>And then we copy-pasta.</p>
<p>Now that I've got my chapters (aka future podcast episodes) all set, we're ready to convert them to audio. What's the easiest way I can do that?</p>
<p>My "in-the-zone" brain suggests using the terminal's <code>say</code> command. I've used this command a few years ago in one of my earliest creative computing projects: a <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/terminal-man-live-in-nyc">live musical performance from a telepresence robot</a>).</p>
<p>Surely, I can write a neat little script to loop through my text files and <code>say</code> them into an <code>mp3</code>. Some Googling for <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16501663/macs-say-command-to-mp3">advice</a>, and I've soon got this Bash script going:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> *.txt<span>;</span>
<span>do</span>
    <span>echo</span> <span>"processing <span>$i</span>..."</span><span>;</span>
    <span>name</span><span>=</span><span><span>$(</span><span>echo</span> <span>"<span>$i</span>"</span> <span>|</span> <span>cut</span> -f <span>1</span> -d <span>'.'</span><span>)</span></span>
    say -v Vicki -f <span>$i</span> -o aiff/<span>$name</span>.aiff
    lame -m m aiff/<span>$name</span>.aiff mp3/<span>$name</span>.mp3
    <span>rm</span> aiff/<span>$name</span>.aiff
<span>done</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And it works! Checkpoint reached! The <code>mp3</code> files are now sitting happily in their respective <code>/mp3</code> folder. I experience a fleeting moment of joy, and then immediately plunge into the next challenge: generating an XML feed.</p>
<p>My hack-y brain suggests another copy-pasta. Let's take the feed generated by the Podsync library in the section above, replace pieces of it with Bash variables, and then loop through my text files to jam in the values I want.</p>
<p>More googling ensures, including learning a bit more about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document#:~:text=In%20computing%2C%20a%20here%20document,it%20were%20a%20separate%20file.">heredocs</a>, and I've eventually got this script:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

While the price of Bitcoin dropped sharply on Monday, it is still up more than 50 percent from just <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/30/technology/bitcoin-record-price.html" title="">a month ago</a>, when it passed its previous all-time high of around $20,000. </p><p>The problem is that Mr. Thomas years ago lost the paper where he wrote down the password for his IronKey, which gives users 10 guesses before it seizes up and encrypts its contents forever. He has since tried eight of his most commonly used password formulations â€” to no avail.</p></div></div><div><div><p>â€œI would just lay in bed and think about it,â€� Mr. Thomas said. â€œThen I would go to the computer with some new strategy, and it wouldnâ€™t work, and I would be desperate again.â€�</p><p>Bitcoin, which has been on an extraordinary and volatile eight-month run, has made a lot of its holders very rich in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/16/style/bitcoin.html" title="">a short time</a>, even as the coronavirus pandemic has ravaged the world economy.</p><p>But the cryptocurrencyâ€™s unusual nature has also meant that many people are locked out of their Bitcoin fortunes as a result of lost or forgotten keys. They have been forced to watch, helpless, as the price has risen and fallen sharply, unable to cash in on their digital wealth.</p><p>Of the existing 18.5 million Bitcoin, around 20 percent â€” currently worth around $140 billion â€” appear to be in lost or otherwise stranded wallets, according to the cryptocurrency data firm Chainalysis. Wallet Recovery Services, a business that helps find lost digital keys, said it had gotten 70 requests a day from people who wanted help recovering their riches, three times the number of a month ago.</p><p>Bitcoin owners who are locked out of their wallets speak of endless days and nights of frustration as they have tried to get access to their fortunes. Many have owned the coins since Bitcoinâ€™s early days a decade ago, when no one had confidence that the tokens would be worth anything.</p></div></div><div><div><p>â€œThrough the years I would say I have spent hundreds of hours trying to get back into these wallets,â€� said Brad Yasar, an entrepreneur in Los Angeles who has a few desktop computers that contain thousands of Bitcoin he created, or mined, during the early days of the technology. While those Bitcoin are now worth hundreds of millions of dollars, he lost his passwords many years ago and has put the hard drives containing them in vacuum-sealed bags, out of sight.</p><p>â€œI donâ€™t want to be reminded every day that what I have now is a fraction of what I could have that I lost,â€� he said.</p><p>The dilemma is a stark reminder of Bitcoinâ€™s unusual technological underpinnings, which set it apart from normal money and give it some of its most vaunted â€” and riskiest â€” qualities. With traditional bank accounts and online wallets, banks like Wells Fargo and other financial companies like PayPal can provide people the passwords to their accounts or reset lost passwords.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/08/business/00LOSTKEYS2/00LOSTKEYS2-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/08/business/00LOSTKEYS2/00LOSTKEYS2-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/08/business/00LOSTKEYS2/00LOSTKEYS2-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"><img alt="â€œI would just lay in bed and think about it,â€� Mr. Thomas said." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/08/business/00LOSTKEYS2/00LOSTKEYS2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/08/business/00LOSTKEYS2/00LOSTKEYS2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/08/business/00LOSTKEYS2/00LOSTKEYS2-jumbo.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/08/business/00LOSTKEYS2/00LOSTKEYS2-superJumbo.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" decoding="async"></picture></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Nicholas Albrecht for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>But Bitcoin has no company to provide or store passwords. The virtual currencyâ€™s creator, a shadowy figure known as Satoshi Nakamoto, has said Bitcoinâ€™s central idea was to allow anyone in the world to open a digital bank account and hold the money in a way that no government could prevent or regulate.</p></div><div><p>This is made possible by the structure of Bitcoin, which is governed by a network of computers that agreed to follow software containing all the rules for the cryptocurrency. The software includes a complex algorithm that makes it possible to create an address, and associated private key, which is known only by the person who created the wallet.</p></div><div><div><p>The software also allows the Bitcoin network to confirm the accuracy of the password to allow transactions, without seeing or knowing the password itself. In short, the system makes it possible for anyone to create a Bitcoin wallet without having to register with a financial institution or go through any sort of identity check.</p><p>That has made Bitcoin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/technology/bitcoin-black-market.html" title="">popular with criminals</a>, who can use the money without revealing their identity. It has also attracted people in countries like China and Venezuela, where authoritarian governments are known for raiding or shutting down traditional bank accounts.</p><p>But the structure of this system did not account for just how bad people can be at remembering and securing their passwords.</p><p>â€œEven sophisticated investors have been completely incapable of doing any kind of management of private keys,â€� said<span>  </span>Diogo Monica, a co-founder of a start-up called Anchorage, which helps companies handle cryptocurrency security. Mr. Monica started the company in 2017 after helping a hedge fund regain access to one of its Bitcoin wallets.</p><p>Mr. Thomas, the programmer, said he was drawn to Bitcoin partly because it was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/23/opinion/sunday/venezuela-bitcoin-inflation-cryptocurrencies.html" title="">outside the control of a country</a> or company. In 2011, when he was living in Switzerland, he was given the 7,002 Bitcoin by an early Bitcoin fanatic as a reward for making an animated video, â€œ<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um63OQz3bjo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">What is Bitcoin?</a>,â€� which introduced many people to the technology.</p><p>That year, he lost the digital keys to the wallet holding the Bitcoin. Since then, as Bitcoinâ€™s value has soared and fallen and he could not get his hands on the money, Mr. Thomas has soured on the idea that people should be their own bank and hold their own money.</p><p>â€œThis whole idea of being your own bank â€” let me put it this way: Do you make your own shoes?â€� he said. â€œThe reason we have banks is that we donâ€™t want to deal with all those things that banks do.â€�</p></div></div><div><div><p>Other Bitcoin believers have also realized the difficulties of being their own bank. Some have outsourced the work of holding Bitcoin to start-ups and exchanges that secure the private keys to peopleâ€™s stashes of the virtual currency.</p><p>Yet some of these services have had just as much trouble securing their keys. Many of the largest Bitcoin exchanges over the years â€” including the onetime well-known exchange <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/business/dealbook/mt-gox-creditors-seek-trillions-where-there-are-only-millions.html" title="">Mt. Gox</a> â€” have lost private keys or had them stolen.</p><p>Gabriel Abed, 34, an entrepreneur from Barbados, lost around 800 Bitcoin â€” now worth around $25 million â€” when a colleague reformatted a laptop that contained the private keys to a Bitcoin wallet in 2011.</p><p>Mr. Abed said this did not dim his enthusiasm. Before Bitcoin, he said, he and his fellow islanders had not had access to affordable digital financial products like the credit cards and bank accounts that are easily available to Americans. In Barbados, even getting a PayPal account was almost impossible, he said. The open nature of Bitcoin, he said, gave him full access to the digital financial world for the first time.</p><p>â€œThe risk of being my own bank comes with the reward of being able to freely access my money and be a citizen of the world â€” that is worth it,â€� Mr. Abed said.</p><p>For Mr. Abed and Mr. Thomas, any losses from mishandling the private keys have partly been assuaged by the enormous gains they have made on the Bitcoin they managed to hold on to. The 800 Bitcoin Mr. Abed lost in 2011 were a small fraction of the tokens he has since bought and sold, allowing him to recently buy a 100-acre plot of oceanfront land in Barbados for over $25 million.</p><p>Mr. Thomas said he also managed to hold on to enough Bitcoin â€” and remember the passwords â€” to give him more riches than he knows what to do with. In 2012, he joined a cryptocurrency start-up, Ripple, that aimed to improve on Bitcoin. He was rewarded with Rippleâ€™s own native currency, known as XRP, which rose in value.</p></div></div><div><div><p>(Ripple has recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/21/technology/ripple-cryptocurrency-sec-lawsuit.html" title="">run into legal troubles</a>, in part because the founders had too much control over the creation and distribution of the XRP coins.)</p><p>As for his lost password and inaccessible Bitcoin, Mr. Thomas has put the IronKey in a secure facility â€” he wonâ€™t say where â€” in case cryptographers come up with new ways of cracking complex passwords. Keeping it far away helps him try not to think about it, he said.</p><p>â€œI got to a point where I said to myself, â€˜Let it be in the past, just for your own mental health,â€™â€� he said. </p></div></div></section></article></div>]]>

        <article>

            

            <section>
                <div>
                    <div><p>Rumor has it that Redshift was named for its desire to <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2018/amazon-web-services-reportedly-named-cloud-database-redshift-order-tweak-oracle">shift people away from data warehousing offered by Oracle</a> (whose brand <a href="https://tbri.com/special-reports/oracle-openworld-2019/">used to be “red”</a> ). In that line of thinking, you can think of Snowflake as Redshiftshift.</p><p>Snowflake is a modern data-warehousing solution that’s built with the needs of today’s data teams in mind. Amazon Redshift is a huge legacy data warehousing product that, while powerful, doesn’t address these needs. Put simply, right now, Snowflake is better on almost all fronts and for most businesses than Amazon Redshift. Here’s why.</p></div><h2 id="snowflake-makes-your-life-easier">Snowflake Makes Your Life Easier</h2><div><p>Snowflake has invested in quality-of-life features — like how easy it is to share data and the user experience — from the ground-up, while Redshift is still trying to catch up. Even if all other aspects, such as pricing or concurrency, were equal (and they aren’t), this alone should tip the scale for most.</p><p>One big way Snowflake makes your life easer as a data person is that it make <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/workloads/data-sharing/">sharing data super simple</a>. It’s about as simple to share data with Snowflake as it is to share a Google Doc. </p></div><figure><img src="https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/2021/01/Snowflake-Data-Share.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Snowflake-Data-Share.png 600w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Snowflake-Data-Share.png 1000w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/Snowflake-Data-Share.png 1600w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/2021/01/Snowflake-Data-Share.png 2080w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><div><p>On a technical level, this simplicity is made possible by Snowflake’s unique ability to copy databases within your own data structure and then grant instant read access to those databases (<a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-sharing-intro.html">dive deeper into the documentation here if you want</a>). Copying a database in a safe, secure way with Snowflake takes only one click, and it’s all self-contained. When you’re done, you just click “deprovisionize” and you’re good. </p><p>The alternative is the more traditional way of sharing data that Redshift represents. Redshift (and other traditional data warehouses) require that you go through the messy, insecure, and stressful process of managing multiple duplicate ETL (extract, transform, load) data pipelines. And with Redshift, you need to work with production data (😬) if you want to copy databases within your data structure. It’s flat-out riskier and more stressful.</p><p>We could go on and on here about specific features, but at its core, Snowflake takes care of the crap for you so you can actually do your job. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bigdata/comments/ax0ixt/redshift_vs_snowflake/">One user on the r/bigdata subreddit described it like this</a> when they first switched to Snowflake, “I was skeptical but [Snowflake] actually does seem to make performance management easier and allows me more time to actually work with the data.”</p><p>As you can guess, these quality-of-life improvements have made Snowflake their fair share of fan boys/girls, us included (can’t you tell?). If you work in data, Snowflake just makes your life better.</p></div><h2 id="snowflake-is-cheaper-but-not-for-the-reason-you-might-think">Snowflake Is Cheaper, but Not for the Reason You Might Think</h2><div><p>Of course, the price of data warehouses depends on a ton of factors, but overall (<a href="https://fivetran.com/blog/warehouse-benchmark">according to our friends at Fivetran</a>) Redshift and Snowflake will cost about the same. The true cost-savings come from the tighter infrastructure Snowflake can help you build. </p><p>The big difference in cost between Snowflake and Redshift is the fact that Snowflake was built to decouple computing and storage costs. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-redshift-update-next-generation-compute-instances-and-managed-analytics-optimized-storage/">Redshift has tried to go this route</a>, but, again, it’s a game of catch-up. What this means is that storing data with Snowflake is cheap, and you pay only when you need to compute (i.e., use) that data.</p><p>Getting into the details, Snowflake uses credits whose costs fluctuate depending on the region you’re in — for instance, in the western United States, credits range from $2-$3. You can use these credits for computing purposes and other features. This credit system combined with relatively cheap storage costs — $40 per TB per month in the western U.S. — can help ensure that you pay for only what you use.</p><p>One slight downside is that with Snowflake you need to keep an eye on “credit munching.” Andrew Ferrier in the <a href="https://community.getdbt.com/">dbt Slack community</a> described working with Snowflake like this</p></div><blockquote>“On the flip side, we do munch through the credits, but most of this is due to optimizations that we can do on our side. One key tip here before deploying would be to think about setting up different types of processes on different warehouses, so that you can scale the warehouse according to need.”</blockquote><div><p>Redshift’s RA3<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-redshift-update-next-generation-compute-instances-and-managed-analytics-optimized-storage/"> allows you to decouple</a> compute and storage costs as well, but <a href="https://poplindata.com/data-warehouses/2020-database-showdown-bigquery-vs-redshift-vs-snowflake/">most Redshift users have dc2</a>, which doesn’t decouple. No matter what, if you want more space in Redshift, you need to buy more nodes, and it charges “per-hour per-node,” <a href="https://blog.panoply.io/redshift-vs-snowflake-the-full-comparison">according to Panoply</a>, which breaks down the formula like this:</p><p>Redshift Monthly Price = [ Price Per Hour ] x [ Node Cluster Size ] x [ Hours per Month ]</p><p>We’re getting into the weeds here, and others cover it more cohesively,<a href="https://www.clearpeaks.com/a-journey-from-redshift-to-snowflake-data-warehouse/"> particularly Clearpeaks</a>. Our main point here is that, despite these nuances and formulas, the real difference in costs comes from the data infrastructure Snowflake can help you build. </p><p><a href="https://resources.fivetran.com/mdsconference/deploying-a-data-team">In their webinar with Fivetran</a>, Drizly explains the evolution of their data team and data stack, which included a migration from Redshift to Snowflake. Their process was to spin up Snowflake parallel to Redshift and then slowly perform the Redshiftshift. When fully implemented, they were able to start cutting the fat in their data stack, relying solely on tools that do one thing really well. Their core stack ended up being:</p></div><ul><li><a href="https://fivetran.com/">Fivetran </a>for data ingestion that they don’t have to customize or babysit</li><li><a href="https://www.snowflake.com/">Snowflake</a> for semi-structured data storage and easy data sharing</li><li><a href="https://www.getdbt.com/">dbt </a>for transformations and a consistent modeling logic</li><li><a href="https://looker.com/">Looker </a>for analytics aimed at the end business user</li><li><a href="https://dagster.io/">Dagster</a> for overall data orchestration</li><li><a href="https://getcensus.com/">Census</a> to send transformed data back to source tools (like Salesforce)</li></ul><p>On this lean foundation, Drizly can build the data stack they need as they need it, instead of spending time, money, and effort with one-off solutions or ambiguous third-party tools. In the end, even through a massive spike in data processed due to COVID-19 (Drizly delivers alcohol by mail; what do you expect?), their operating costs didn’t significantly change.</p><h2 id="snowflake-scales-while-redshift-flails">Snowflake Scales While Redshift Flails</h2><div><p>Snowflake is built from the ground up to scale linearly, while Redshift simply doesn’t. Scaling this way is ideal for small startups looking to grow on a solid foundation of data. Trying to replicate this scaling ability with Redshift or other data warehouses can become prohibitively expensive.</p><p>If you have 40 minutes to spare, we recommend hitting “pause” and going to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gsaujml_Ff8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1102&amp;ab_channel=DataCouncil">Alessandro Pregnolato’s, head of data at Marfeel, talk on addressing complexity at scale</a>. His main point when it comes to Snowflake is that its ability to quickly and cheaply spin up <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses.html">virtual warehouses</a> is a game changer. He plays out the following scenario:</p></div><ul><li>If you have a query to run on a small machine (i.e., virtual warehouse) it might cost $3 an hour.</li><li>It could take an hour and will cost $3.</li><li>Or, with Snowflake, you spin up a machine that’s 10x bigger and costs $30 an hour.</li><li>Then, it could take you 6 minutes and still cost $3.</li></ul><div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/Gsaujml_Ff8?t=1426">Alessandro goes </a>on to say, “I can take these monster machines and 5-hour queries and make them run in 10 minutes. And I pay the same.” Redshift can’t do this. Even if it could, the fact that its most commonly used version can’t decouple storage and compute pricing, running a larger machine would break the bank. You’re forced to move slower.</p><p>Another aspect of scalability is concurrency and the handling of real-time data. Snowflake does it better. But don’t just take our word for it. <a href="https://medium.com/ro-data-team-blog/why-we-switched-to-snowflake-10c14d8dac52">Sami Yabroudi from the Ro data team has a fantastic write-up</a> about their Redshiftshift to Snowflake. </p><p>He echoes Alessandro’s point about spinning up computing resources: “Snowflake can automatically ‘spin up’ more computing resources and run all of the concurrent queries in parallel with zero drag on the execution speed of any individual query.“ Alessandro, for his part, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gsaujml_Ff8&amp;ab_channel=DataCouncil">just comes out and says</a>, “[Redshift] doesn’t scale well in terms of concurrency.”</p></div><figure><img src="https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/2021/01/Drizly-Analytics-Stack.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Drizly-Analytics-Stack.png 600w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Drizly-Analytics-Stack.png 1000w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/Drizly-Analytics-Stack.png 1600w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/2021/01/Drizly-Analytics-Stack.png 2080w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Drizly Analytics Stack Presented at Fivetran Modern Data Conference</figcaption></figure><p>And for real-time data, Sami says, “With Snowflake, there is no performance impact if we have real-time data syncing - all data in our warehouse is current to within 30 minutes.” This fact was echoed just about everywhere people talk about Snowflake, from Drizly’s webinar to Alessandro’s talk to Medium articles like Sami’s. The point is, Snowflake is built to scale in the way modern companies scale.</p><h2 id="snowflake-is-flexible-and-spry-while-redshift-is-old">Snowflake Is Flexible and Spry While Redshift Is ... Old</h2><div><p>We’ve been pretty harsh on Redshift in this article. The truth is that Redshift has a well-established role in the data industry — and by “well-established,” we mean old. </p><p>Redshift was built to be cutting-edge in 2013. That’s the same year <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK8mJJJvaes&amp;ab_channel=MacklemoreLLC">Thrift Shop</a> topped the charts (if it’s that outdated, maybe it belongs in a thrift shop?). Seven years is practically a century in data-industry terms, and it hasn’t made many significant improvements since then — at least until Snowflake started eating its lunch. There are a lot of relics Redshift still carries around that keep you from being as agile as you need to be in the modern data marketplace. </p><p>For instance, Redshift incentivizes long-term commitments, which is just them trying to lock you in. To stay agile and up to date with the seismic shifts in the data industry occurring every quarter, you need <a href="https://blog.getcensus.com/hub-and-spoke-vs-point-to-point-data-synchronization-theres-one-clear-winner/">a flexible data infrastructure</a>. And Snowflake, right now, is the best centerpiece for that infrastructure, thanks to its scalability, storage of semi-structured data, ease of use, concurrency, and more. </p><p>But the important caveat here is that Snowflake may go the way of Redshift come 2027. And we’ll be making fun of the fact that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOxj2ROIxok&amp;ab_channel=MeganTheeStallion">Savage</a> topped the charts at <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/16/investing/snowflake-ipo/index.html">the time of its IPO</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>GS2JSON is a free api which will allow you to transform any Google Sheet to a JSON file.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simply append your public spreadsheet url to: <a href="https://labs.zero.sh/api/gs2json?url=your-public-speadsheet-url" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://labs.zero.sh/api/gs2json?url=your-public-speadsheet-url</a> - Nothing else needed!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's free to use and doesn't require an API key or authentication. The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/Cosbgn/zero-labs/blob/master/api/gs2json.js" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Github</a></p>
<p>With Zero you can build great interactive dashboards pulling data directly from a Google Sheet using this API.
It's free! Read more in our blog post: <a href="https://zero.sh/blog/create-a-dashboard-with-google-sheets">Create a dashboard with Google Sheets</a></p>
<h2 id="1-make-sure-that-your-sheet-is-public">1. Make sure that your sheet is public</h2>
<p>This API can read only public sheets. To make your sheet public open it and then click on:</p>
<ol>
<li>File (On the top left of the Google Sheet window)</li>
<li>Publish for the web</li>
<li>Publish</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point you can close this popup and copy the <strong>full page URL</strong>. Directly from your browser's address bar.</p>
<h2 id="2-format-your-request">2. Format your request</h2>
<p>This API accepts only <strong>GET</strong> requests to this endpoint: <code>https://labs.zero.sh/api/gs2json</code></p>
<p>The following query parameters are allowed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the spreadsheet url often contains a hashtag symbol (#) make sure you add the URL as the last parameter or you risk that the others will be ignored, for example:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Do <code>?format=2&amp;url=https://docs...</code></li>
<li>Don't do <code>?url=https://docs...&amp;format=1</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The following parameters are accepted:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>format</strong>:
You can chose the format of your response. Possible values are 1,2 &amp; 3. Read about these below.</li>
<li><strong>sheet</strong>:
The number of the sheet in the spreadsheet (Defaults to the first sheet if nothing is passed)</li>
<li><strong>url</strong>:
This is the full spreadsheet url, something like: <em><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12345" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12345</a></em></li>
<li><strong>id</strong>:
Instead of the full url, you can also simply pass the id like: <em>12345</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-format-your-response">3. Format your response</h2>
<p>You can chose to have your data returned in 3 different ways, use the <code>format</code> parameter to chose the response your prefer.</p>
<ol>
<li>An object <em>without</em> columns names</li>
<li>An object <em>with</em> column names</li>
<li>An Array of the rows with mapped column names</li>

January 13, 2021 | https://valand.dev/blog/post/complex-software--async-machines | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://valand.dev/blog/post/complex-software--async-machines">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Complex software can be daunting to author. I will dissect and reintroduce the concept of asynchronous machines, why we need it in the first place, and how delving into the concept might help conquer complex software.</p>
<h2>Software Complexity</h2>
<p>Software complexity is the number of components inside a software, assuming that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle">a single component has a single responsibility</a>. A software with a single component that does a lot of things is regarded as not only complex but also <em>amess</em>, but I'm not going to visit that idea. I don't stick to the strict definition of single-responsibility principle that comes from OOP, therefore a component is not necessarily a class, a struct. It's just one part of a software of many with a clear distinction from the others.</p>
<h2>Async Machines</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"><em>"Machine is a mechanical structure that uses power to apply forces and control movement to perform an intended action." - wikipedia.com</em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why are we mentioning "machine" at all?</p>
<p>Computer is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automaton">automaton</a>, a self-operating machine that follows a predetermined sequence of operations. Those operations are what we call a program. Being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">Turing complete</a>, a computer can simulate itself, therefore a program can be a machine too.</p>
<p>A video game runs, you play it. While it is running, it reads inputs from peripherals. Those inputs alter the internal state. At one point, the video game can reach a particular state that prompts it to quit. That video game is a machine. Another example, NodeJS. NodeJS loads and interprets JavaScript code and executes it. In this situation, NodeJS is the machine, while the JavaScript code is the program. This is why NodeJS is a VM.</p>
<p>A program can be as boring as receiving input, processing it, and spewing output, but each passing day that simple thing does not suffice. Computers gain new capabilities, file systems, networking, multi-threading, GPU processing, and those are made available through hardware with different speeds. And not to forget the most important part of the realm of computer, human, its user, doesn't like to be kept waiting. That's why a simple input, computation, output doesn't suffice. Everything around the program, hardware interfaces, humans, are all working and reacting at different paces. Inputs and outputs are needed at different intervals. This is the original reason why the concept of asynchronous machines exists.</p>
<p>Essentially, the concept of asynchronous machines is to make all parties, which are the I/O edges of the program, the happiest they can be.</p>
<p>A case: A browser is a complex system. It is responsible for many things, connecting to and loading from servers, running web pages, sandboxing tabs, synchronizing web storage to disks, etc. In it are asynchronous machines, each responsible for different parties:</p>
<ul>
<li>A tab is running a page. Inside a page is HTML DOM, CSS style computation and JavaScript code execution. This is a human facing machine. It must always be responsive to user input. You can find evidence that unresponsiveness is an intolerable behavior for this machine, such as calling a long-running JavaScript operation will trigger a prompt that says "page is unresponsive", offering the user an escape hatch, killing the page, to make sure that the user has options all the time.</li>
<li>A tab is running a page. Inside a page is HTML DOM, CSS style computation and JavaScript code execution. It is a human facing. It must always be responsive to user input. Unresponsiveness is intolerable for it. You can find evidence of that anywhere. For example, calling a long-running JavaScript operation will trigger a prompt that says "page is unresponsive". Then it offers the user an escape hatch: to kill the page.</li>
<li>A storage-facing program is "happy" when it efficiently reads and writes to storage.</li>
<li>And many more...</li>
</ul>
<p>Messaging is the most important basis of asynchronous machines. Messaging happens at small scale, like communication between threads, as well as at large scale, like blockchain mining. Synchronous APIs directed towards asynchronous machines are either wrapper for request/response with messaging underneath, or fire-and-forget message.</p>
<p>Messaging involves message queues at the receiver's side, and sometimes at the sender's side too. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_buffer">buffer</a> at the I/O to hardware is a message queue. Hardware and a program are separate asynchronous machines. They need buffers to store unprocessed messages.</p>
<p>Queues are abstracted out for a software developer most of the time. For example, NodeJS has a lot of APIs implementing stream. NodeJS's stream is actually a buffer and its processor behind the scene, which triggers events. NodeJS users only have to understand which events do what.</p>
<p>Many projects I have worked on involve writing two or more asynchronous machines at the same time. Usually one is the UI layer and the other is a layer that interacts with storage or network. Most of the time queues need to be handwritten because it needs a custom behavior, such as merging message duplicates, has a custom backpressure mechanism, etc. Then, because the queue is handwritten, the queue runner also needs to be handwritten. The queue is a "singleton function", in which only one instance of it can exist per queue. It runs at the start of the queue appendage and stops when the queue is empty. Then, at the caller's side, a wrapper is written to make an "illusion" of synchronous calls. Most of the time it is fun.</p>
<p>Messaging can either be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_broker">brokered</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer">not brokered</a>. A simple brokered messaging would be Mutex that guards access from multiple threads, or Kafka sending messages from one service to another. A message broker is essentially the party responsible for transporting messages from one party to the other. A message broker is essentially the party responsible for transporting messages from one party to the other. Meanwhile, unbrokered messaging is when two parties don't need another party to manage their messages. Peer-to-peer communication is one of those. Being brokered and unbrokered is not a hard 1 or 0 but a spectrum. There can be a messaging mechanism in the middle of the spectrum. Shared storage is, for example, is where multiple parties store data at the same site. The shared storage acts as a passive broker. The difference between brokered and not brokered lies in how a message gets transported and how the receiver and sender must do additional process before and after the transportation, like serialization, validation, etc.</p>
<p>Knowing the existence of a message broker is crucial when you design objects' lifecycle. The message broker must live before the components that rely on it. It also must die after them. This concept seems obvious, but it's not rare for projects to fail this aspect. An easy practice is to structure code chronologically, both for declarative and imperative styles.</p>

      <pre><code><span>// In declarative language/framework:

<h2>The Line Separating FP vs OOP War Lies At The Edges of Asynchronous Machines</h2>
<p>Let's talk functional programming, or rather, programming with functional style. FP is often regarded as the opposite of OOP, while I think it's not the exact opposite. Sometime in the past birthed a language which forces you to write everything with <code>class</code>. A <code>class</code> has methods, which has call syntax <code>subject.predicate()</code>. <code>subject</code> in a sentence is active, an agent. This paradigm introduces a side effect. In the perspective of the programmer, a program written in an OOP style has many agents, whereas not every kind of program needs multiple agencies.</p>
<p>In an environment where there are no other machines with different paces, a machine only needs one agent, which is itself. The machine receives input and produces output and maybe some side effects. All components inside the machines work at the same pace, so there's no need for sub-agency, message passing, nor buffering. It is like a librarian with one mind and two hands cataloging and organizing books. The program manages data. It makes functional programming a prime paradigm in building a machine. Its principles like immutability over mutability, pure functions, recursion, higher-order functions, result in elegant code.</p>
<p>At the same time, two asynchronous machines have two agencies. Each has their memory, works at their own pace, acts on their own data, and occasionally communicates with each other. This is where the concept of multiple agencies needs to be introduced. This is, where I think, the original concept of OOP (not nowadays' OOP) makes sense. Alan Kay describes OOP as if computers are cells, and they occasionally send messages to each other. This is also why sometimes people throw jokes at functional programming for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADqLBc1vFwI">being difficult to do side-effects</a> on.</p>
<p>The line that separates FP and OOP paradigms, moreover how programmers perceive machines because of the two, lies at the edges of asynchronous machines.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~ram/pub/pub_jf47ht81Ht/doc_kay_oop_en">"I thought of objects being like biological cells and/or individual computers on a network, only able to communicate with messages" - Alan Kay</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Coda</h2>
<p>Understanding the concept of asynchronous machines is a huge help to me if we're talking about system design. While this piece of writing is a big idea presented in a rough format, I hope you get something out of it as much as I did.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">



<p>In this article, I am going to take a thorough look at an interesting piece of router/firewall hardware that I recently bought off AliExpress: A fanless Intel mini PC with six Gbit Ethernet ports that should make for an ideal router in any picky user’s home network.</p>

<p><img src="https://johannes.truschnigg.info/reviews/2021-01_fwbox/img/screenshot_2020-12-29_us__149_1_29__off_fanless_pfsense_intel_core_i5_7226u_i3_7167u_3865u_industrial_mini_pc_2_rs232_6_lan_..._.jpg" alt="original offer on aliexpress" title="Original offer on aliexpress.com"></p>

<p>If you don’t feel like spending too much time on my ramblings, you’re of course welcome to hop down to the <a href="#at-a-glance-summary-and-verdict">tl;dr-style section at the very end</a>.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&amp;SearchText=mini+pc">query AliExpress for “<em>mini PC</em>”</a>, you get back an avalanche of results. The storefront’s filtering capabilities also don’t make it easy on the potential buyer, and you will have to be ready and willing to wade through MANY colorful item descriptions and bundle choices if you are serious about finding the right fit for the purpose you have in mind. If you do, you will be rewarded with hardware designs that you just won’t be able to find anywhere in the EU’s retail market (except maybe on eBay’s or Amazon’s marketplace platforms, where dropshippers selling these probably source them from AliExpress/Alibaba themselves).</p>

<p>I have been on the lookout for a new home router/firewall appliance with Gbit Ethernet connectivity recently. I would like my new router to have enough horsepower to perform <a href="https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/cerowrt/wiki/Smart_Queue_Management/">Smart Queue Management</a> on the 300Mbps downstream link my ISP currently leases to me at home, and so I decided to give AliExpress’s x86 mini PC catalog a closer look. After a few short hours of virtual window shopping, I arrived at the <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/store/2177063">EGLOBAL Top MiniPC shop</a>. Their tagline reads <em>OEM &amp; ODM Mini PC Manufacturer</em>, and they have an impressive lineup of small-ish PC hardware in store. Compact and silent media center machines, powerful yet tiny desktop PCs, network/firewall appliances - if you’re looking to build any of these, they’ll probably have you covered.</p>

<h2 id="unveiling-the-fwbox">Unveiling the fwbox</h2>

<p>For my project, the <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000931029633.html"><em>EGLOBAL Fanless pfSense Intel 3865U Industrial Mini PC</em></a> caught my eye. That is quite a mouthful, and I quickly came to call it the <em>fwbox</em> myself. I will be referring to the piece of hardware tested here by that moniker for the remainder of the review. The fwbox’s hardware highlights, according to the manufacturer, are as follows (reproduced verbatim from the seller’s item description at the time of purchase, 2020-12-15):</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fanless system without cooling fan, no any noise, thicker and longer heat-sink fins for working as long as 7x24 hours durably.</li>
<li>6xIntel i201/i211 Gigabit RJ45 LANs and 2xRS232 COM ports, support Windows, Linux and pfSense OS.</li>
<li>1xmSATA SSD+1x2.5” SSD/HDD installation supported.</li>
<li>One embedded SIM card slot onboard, 3G/4G/WiFi optional.</li>
<li>Applied in Firewall, Network Server, Network Security, VPN Router etc.</li>
<li>Full Aluminum Alloy Black color shell, Exquisite production craft on outside design with high quality, slim design 209x150x57MM.</li>
<li>Low consumption save much energy and eco-friendly.</li>
<li>Support Watchdog, AWAL, RTC, WOL, PXE, Reset functions.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="configurable-and-optional-hardware-choices-warranty">Configurable and optional hardware choices; warranty</h3>

<p>As with many other AliExpress “mini PC” barebone offers, EGLOBAL lets the buyer choose which (soldered - which means you cannot change it later, unless you replace the whole motherboard) CPU, and if an (or which) optional storage and memory components they would like installed. I chose the 2GB RAM (PC3-12800 DDR3L SO-UDIMM) and 32GB SSD (mSATA-600) bundle, so that I would be able to start testing the machine in-depth right away, without any potential problems like minor (or not-so-minor) DRAM compatibility troubles holding me back. For the CPU, I chose the <a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/96507/intel-celeron-processor-3865u-2m-cache-1-80-ghz.html">Intel Celeron 3865U</a> - a dual core <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaby_Lake">Kaby Lake</a> (originally introduced in early 2017) Mobile/Laptop-class CPU clocking at up to 1800MHz that should easily be powerful enough to juggle everything my LAN and WAN would be throwing at it, with some headroom left for other tasks. I intend to put this 3865U to the test and see if this hunch actually holds true.</p>

<p>Although the manufacturer offers to pre-populate the miniPCIe slot with a suitable Wi-Fi card for a relatively small premium, I did not choose that option. There are only very few miniPCIe cards on the market that make decent stations when operated in Access Point mode, especially if you want to offer 802.11ac (“Wi-Fi 5”) speeds. Apart from that, you would usually want or need two distinct radios to cover all your wireless networking needs: one for covering the 2.4GHz band, and another one for the 5GHz band. Since that would take two cards/radios/slots, there’s no way to cram that into the fwbox - and USB adapters are another can of worms on their own. So, in my view, sticking to an external AP that does those wireless things well is the better choice to make, and my unit’s miniPCIe slot will remain unpopulated for the time being.</p>

<p>The seller also advertises a 3y warranty, which I would imagine to be difficult to benefit from, due to the international shipping and export/import burdens involved. Therefore, I did not make any warranty concerns or promises part of my decision making process when buying this mini PC.</p>

<h3 id="notes-on-os-and-software">Notes on OS and software</h3>

<p>With EGLOBAL shipping my device with mass storage pre-installed, they were nice enough to pre-load <a href="https://www.pfsense.org/">pfSense</a> in a fairly recent release (<a href="https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/releases/2-4-4-p3.html">2.4.4-p3</a>) for me. However, since I am not a FreeBSD expert, I will be performing my testing on GNU/Linux-based distros and operating systems instead. Experienced BSD users should not expect any nasty surprises though - the hardware really isn’t exotic, and the fact that the manufacturer actively advertises pfSense as the “expected” (and pre-loaded) OS for the fwbox certainly implies good compatibility between hardware and that choice of OS.</p>

<h3 id="notes-on-delivery-and-import-fees">Notes on delivery and import fees</h3>

<p>When I purchased the fwbox, my desired configuration was offered by EGLOBAL for US$ 193.35/EUR 163.75. DHL charged another EUR 43.69 on top of that to have the fwbox delivered to my doorstep from China in less than two weeks (even though they presumably were drowning in shipments over Christmas), while also handling import turnover tax and tariffs and the like for me. I consider that fair, and the grand total of about EUR 210 is absolutely fair for the kind of device when compared with Mini PC offers available here in Austria, like <a href="https://www.zotac.com/de/product/mini_pcs/ci329-nano">Zotac’s ZBOX</a> et al.</p>

<h2 id="looking-closer-at-the-hardware">Looking closer at the hardware</h2>

<h3 id="ethernet-and-networking-considerations">Ethernet and networking considerations</h3>

<p>The main feature and selling point of this specific mini PC variant, at least to me, is the six integrated Gbit-speed Ethernet ports. They’re all <a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/series/68667/intel-ethernet-server-adapter-i210-series.html">Intel i210</a>-based and are connected to the system via PCIe (2.5GT/s each) individually - the Ethernet ports on the fwbox’s back are therefore not connected to a software-configurable, internal Ethernet switch like you would find on most SOHO routers or the like. As a consequence, if you want the fwbox to act mostly like one of these appliances, you will have to emulate whatever a switch does “in software”, on the main CPU. Luckily, Linux can do that both easily end efficiently, by configuring a bridge over as many Ethernet (and other) devices/links as you want.</p>

<p>Most dedicated switching hardware comes with special offloading features and performance enhancements that give it an edge over general purpose networking solutions - but with the comparatively powerful host CPU the fwbox has at its heart, combined with the decent Ethernet adapters and drivers in play, it should be able to keep up in most (if not all) scenarios that involve up to six bridged Gbit links. On the flip side, we gain the unparalleled flexibility that Linux and other free OS offer to do as we please with all frames, packets, flows, and whatever else the fwbox will have to relay and route and proxy through it.</p>

<h3 id="device-case-front">Device/case front</h3>

<p>Apart from the obviously important embedded hardware components, there’s more interesting details to explore. As you’ve already been able to glean from the specs quoted earlier, the fwbox comes with four USB-A (USB 3.0 SuperSpeed, 5Gbps) and two COM/Serial (1x9P, 1xRJ-45) ports on the front. All these are easily accessible and live right next to an HDMI port (wired up to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Graphics_Technology#Kaby_Lake">Intel HD Graphics 610</a> IGP, which makes for a very fast console framebuffer - and probably even a decent media center appliance…), if you ever need to plug in a display to diagnose potential problems on a VT. The front also features a neatly looking, upside-down power button, and a slightly sunk-in reset button, which seems practically impossible to trigger by accident.</p>

<p><a href="https://johannes.truschnigg.info/reviews/2021-01_fwbox/img/fwbox_case_front.jpg"><img src="https://johannes.truschnigg.info/reviews/2021-01_fwbox/img/thm_fwbox_case_front.jpg" alt="fwbox front view" title="fwbow - Front view"></a></p>

<h3 id="device-case-back">Device/case back</h3>

<p>On the back, we have the aforementioned six Ethernet ports, two activity LEDs (red for power and green for mass storage activity - both far too bright, of course), the AC in, and two knobs for connecting Wi-Fi antennas, should your configuration need them. The two corresponding internal cables that connect these antennas to the Wi-Fi card dangle loosely on the inside, and are responsible for the audible rattling noises the fwbox emits whenever you tilt or shake it. If you’re not using them, you will want to make sure there’s no possibility for them to cause any kind of harm to the internals of your system, and carefully stow them away on the fwbox’s inside.</p>

<p><a href="https://johannes.truschnigg.info/reviews/2021-01_fwbox/img/fwbox_case_back.jpg"><img src="https://johannes.truschnigg.info/reviews/2021-01_fwbox/img/thm_fwbox_case_back.jpg" alt="fwbox back view" title="fwbox - Rear view"></a></p>

<h3 id="device-casing-and-build-quality">Device casing and build quality</h3>

<p>The manufacturer advertises the case as “exquisite production craft on outside design with high quality”, and the fwbox lives up to the meaning that supposedly tries to convey. It really feels solid and well-crafted. The matte black, all-aluminum case has a certain charm to it in my eyes, and acts as a very effective heatsink to boot - the whole design is fanless, and completely inaudible under all operating conditions. Still, I wouldn’t want this little tank of a PC to have to try hiding in plain sight in the living room. Luckily, it doesn’t need to: Given its relatively small width, it fits perfectly well inside a 10” rack. If you choose that, you’ll have to be a little creative when mounting it (as it doesn’t include rails), and reserve 2HE due to its somewhat protruding heat dissipation fins, however.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: With data breach risks and regulations on the rise, data access for developers will become increasingly restricted. Add to that the escalating complexity of mimicking production data in-house, and DevOps teams stand to face a sudden shortage of quality data for development and testing in the year ahead.</p><p>Perhaps the only thing riskier than making predictions for 2021, given the unprecedented year that was 2020, is not making predictions and responding to the trends when it comes to data privacy. Reflecting on what we’ve seen in the industry and in conversations with our customers, here are the developments we see unfolding in the year ahead.</p><h2>2021 will be the worst year for data breaches yet.</h2><p>The scale of data breaches will be worse in 2021 than ever before. How do we know? The <a href="https://www.identityforce.com/blog/2020-data-breaches" target="_blank">past few years</a> have been nothing but a steady upward climb. Even though the number of <em>breaches</em> decreased from 2019 to 2020, the number of <em>records exposed</em> in those breaches more than doubled, from 15.1 billion records in 2019 to <a href="https://pages.riskbasedsecurity.com/hubfs/Reports/2020/2020%20Q3%20Data%20Breach%20QuickView%20Report.pdf" target="_blank">36 billion in 2020 as of Q3</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Companies may be fighting the good fight in safeguarding against breaches, but when a breach occurs, they’re losing more data than ever. And with work-from-home now the norm for so many, the risks of a breach are <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/news/data-security-lapses-surge-in-work-from-home-era" target="_blank">heightened</a>.</p><h2>Remote work will redefine data governance—permanently.</h2><p>With the above in mind, the shift to remote work is changing how people think about <a href="https://www.tonic.ai/post/remote-work-data-sprawl">security for distributed teams</a>, especially around data minimization and access restrictions. We’re seeing changes in internal processing and an increase in tooling to reduce the use of sensitive data within an organization.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The real potential here is for ways that do so without limiting employees from getting work done. At Tonic, we're doubling down on this need as we believe these shifts are here to stay.</p><h2>Using production data in development is OUT.</h2><p>Thanks to privacy legislation like GDPR and CCPA/CPRA, the shift away from using production data in development and testing has been steadily picking up speed. But it’s not yet the gold standard that it should be.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Between the risks of remote work and ever stronger regulations on the horizon, we expect this shift to accelerate dramatically over the coming year. Some companies will opt to create dummy data in house; others will <a href="https://www.tonic.ai/post/building-data-de-identification-infrastructure">consider the work involved</a>, and seek out solutions like Tonic, to rapidly get high-quality, representative data at scale.</p><h2>Data access will make or break developer productivity.</h2><p>Developer productivity sets apart successful organizations from unsuccessful ones, making rapid, easy access to high quality data more important than ever. As applications become more advanced, the data involved in their use and creation is becoming increasingly complex.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Traditional dev tools simply aren't up to the challenge of meeting today’s data needs, and in-house solutions fail over time. Organizations that don’t find a faster, safer way to get their developers the data they need will be left behind.&nbsp;</p><h2>Privacy needs will impact cloud migrations.</h2><p>Simply put, migrating from on-prem to cloud data lakes needs to be done with privacy in mind. Compliance with regulations can impact how a company's data can be stored in the cloud. Data sanitization pre-migration may be a necessary step in the process, and data access post-migration must be carefully defined. We’re seeing many companies combine the potential of cloud data warehousing like Snowflake with streamlined data de-identification like Tonic to get the best that modern privacy tools and cloud storage solutions have to offer.</p><h2>Federal data privacy legislation is coming.</h2><p>You’ve probably heard <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/congress-may-finally-pass-federal-data-privacy-law-in-2021-2020-12" target="_blank">this</a> <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/2021-best-chance-for-federal-privacy-legislation/" target="_blank">elsewhere</a> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/predictions-2021-privacy-becomes-an-imperative-in-a-year-of-transition/" target="_blank">as</a> <a href="https://www.information-age.com/forrester-releases-privacy-cyber-security-predictions-2021-123492371/" target="_blank">well</a>. We’re all in agreement: it’s high time the US set a federal standard for data privacy. In the past two years, as many as <a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/state-comparison-table/" target="_blank">27 states</a> have taken matters into their own hands, introducing state-level privacy legislation. California, Maine, and Nevada have already signed their bills into law, complicating the landscape of compliance requirements companies must meet. Legislation at the federal level is in everyone’s best interest, from consumers to legislators to corporations.</p><p>So there you have it, the good, the bad, and the critical to keep in mind as we navigate another year in this unexpected landscape. We’re excited to see Tonic helping our customers address many of these concerns. If safe data access and developer enablement is top of mind for you in 2021 and our predictions strike a chord, <a href="https://www.tonic.ai/demo">drop us a line</a>. Here’s to a safe and happy new year!</p></div><div><h2>What’s a Rich Text element?</h2><p>The rich text element allows you to create and format headings, paragraphs, blockquotes, images, and video all in one place instead of having to add and format them individually.

<![CDATA[Task managers aren't built for ICs]]>

January 13, 2021 | https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/post/ic-task-managment/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/post/ic-task-managment/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Modern task managers carry two implicit assumptions. At first glance, they seem correct.</p>
<p>But if you’re an IC, there’s a good chance that your task manager has caused you unnecessary pain by assuming:</p>
<ol>
<li>A task manager needs to remember all of your tasks</li>
<li>All tasks can use a similar creation workflow</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s not obvious why these are wrong.</p>
<p>Here’s why, and how to fix the problems they cause.</p>
<h2 id="permanent-tasks-cause-fatigue">Permanent tasks cause fatigue</h2>
<p>Before starting Tandem, my manager Tim previously co-founded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/01/yahoo-acquires-to-do-app-astrid/">Astrid</a>, a personal task manager, which he later sold to Yahoo.</p>
<p>At Astrid, Tim tried an interesting re-engagement email. Users who had been inactive for 6 weeks were asked: “want to delete all your tasks and start fresh?”</p>
<p>The hypothesis was that these inactive users had tasks that overwhelmed them. Either the amount, the complexity, or the low importance of backlogged tasks, caused users to put tasks off. So every time these users visited Astrid, they saw tasks they couldn’t do, felt bad, and eventually stopped visiting. The psychology of procrastination in action. So Astrid’s re-engagement email offered the users a chance to start fresh.</p>
<p>And it was impressively compelling. Most re-engagement emails get a 1% response rate. This email had about 5%.</p>
<p>I imagine those users had the same feeling you get when you move from one browser to another, or from one task manager to another, and leave your bookmarks, open tabs, backlogged tasks, to start fresh in the name of increased productivity.</p>
<p>But simply deleting the backlog doesn’t end the cycle.</p>
<hr>
<p>Nowadays, Tim uses a simpler task manager—a notebook. He uses a page a day, adds some tasks from JIRA, and when tasks come in during the day, he writes them down and works on them when he’s available. These are mostly small tasks, things that are easy to forget. If he gets an bug (important to track) or a task he can delegate, he puts it in JIRA.</p>
<p>The notebook isn’t meant to store issues forever. The pages get turned, and previous information becomes less accessible. So the next day, if he needs to carry over something that hasn’t been completed, he needs to make the conscious decision to do so.</p>
<p>This solution solves task-management fatigue. And incidentally, it solves another problem:</p>
<h2 id="the-gap-in-task-management">The gap in task management</h2>
<p>We know not all tasks are created the same. When we look at the tools used for tracking tasks and goals, there’s something for every level of the company:</p>
<br>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Level</th>
<th>Goal</th>
<th>Tool</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Company quarter-level</td>
<td>Quarterly Goals</td>
<td>Notion/Gdocs</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Org quarter-level</td>
<td>KPIs</td>
<td>Notion/Gdocs, JIRA Epics</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Team sprint-level</td>
<td>Tickets</td>
<td>JIRA Tasks/Bugs</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Personal day-level</td>
<td>???</td>
<td>???</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Except at the personal day-level, where you’re working on tickets, getting requests for feature updates from your PM, bug discoveries from QA, and breaking down your actual tickets into different tasks, which may require subtasks that weren’t anticipated.</p>
<p>One proposal is that you should track all of these tasks, no matter how small, in JIRA. But the teams I see successful at implementing this are those that can afford to work at a slower, more “enterprise” pace. Which isn’t a problem—at least for engineering—but it’s often not an option at smaller startups, when learning cycles must be fast.</p>
<p><em>Even if you work at a larger company, at a slower pace, you may relate when it comes to personal life: tasks come from a variety of directions, at all times. You can’t toss every minor task in a task manager.</em></p>
<p>You can’t fix every task before the next one comes in. If you only use JIRA, you choose between possibly forgetting these small tasks, or breaking your train of thought to search, categorize, and fill out a form every time you get a small task.</p>
<p>On the flip side, quickly writing these down in a temporary place means that you don’t need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>spend mental effort remembering minor tasks,</li>
<li>or take significant time to file minor issues.</li>
<li>have your task manager filled with minor issues you’ve forgotten to close,</li>
<li>or leave hastily-written issues for later, when you forget what the vaguely titled issue is for.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="filling-the-gap">Filling the gap</h2>
<p>But solution is cheap and simple: a temporary, personal task manager.</p>
<p>You may already use one. Tim’s notebook is a good example. I personally DM myself on Slack.</p>
<details zgotmplz="">
<summary>An example of how I Slack myself</summary>
<div>
<h4 id="using-slack-for-daily-personal-tasks">Using Slack for daily personal tasks</h4>
<p>When I’m working, and get a non-urgent task that would otherwise interrupt me, it goes in my Slack DMs. This is what it looks like:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/imessage-as-a-task-manager/IMG_7647.jpg">
</p>
<p>Some days are quiet</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/imessage-as-a-task-manager/IMG_7644.jpg">
</p>
<p>And some are hectic</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the morning, to re-build yesterday’s context, I just look at yesterday’s list. If there are unfinished items, I can carry them over. But it’s a conscious decision. I don’t need to carry over optional, low-priority tasks.</p>
<p>And if you’ve got a bad memory, there’s a huge benefit for team stand-ups. I used to write JQL filters to search JIRA (doesn’t work—and misses tasks), now I just take a look at Slack.</p>
</div>
</details>
<p>The important requirements are just that your task manager:</p>
<ol>
<li>Requires effort to carry over old tasks, and</li>
<li>Makes writing down tasks quick</li>
<li>Isn’t used for notes</li>
</ol>
<p>So take out a notebook, open Slack, pick what works for you. And see—does it let you focus less on managing your tasks, and more on doing them?</p>
<hr>


<p>I think these tools have interesting ideas to help ICs manage tasks.</p>

<p>Ravi, my old college roommate and friend since high school, left Microsoft to build <a href="https://www.getamna.com/">Amna</a>, a personal task manager with tight browser integration.</p>
<p>I resonate with the thesis: recently I switched away from Firefox Tree Style Tabs, because I noticed that by organizing my tabs (which were part of tasks), it inadvertently became a de-facto task manager. But it wasn’t built for that!</p>
<p>Amna solves that exact problem: each task you do spawns a browser that keeps all of your relevant tabs.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/imessage-as-a-task-manager/amna1.jpg">
</p>
<p>All the tabs in this browser window are related to the same task, and Amna keeps their state when I close the browser.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/imessage-as-a-task-manager/amna2.jpg">
</p>
<p>After I'm done with a task, I can go back and look at the tabs I had open.</p>
</div>
<p>It helps prevent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muscle-memory opening HN, clicking an interesting blog post, and leaving it open “to read later” for several weeks</li>
<li>The pain of trawling through bookmarks and browser history, when you realize you forgot something</li>
<li>The clutter of leaving tabs open to prevent forgetting something</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve forgotten a time when you had less than five tabs open, <a href="https://www.getamna.com/">try using Amna</a>.</p>
<h3 id="jam">Jam</h3>
<p><a href="https://jam.dev/">Jam</a> was started by two of my ex-Cloudflare friends, Dani and Irtefa. It’s probably the fastest way for PMs/designers to directly make comments on a website. So you get less minor interruptions, and more clarity on the requested change.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/imessage-as-a-task-manager/jam2.jpg">
</p>
<p>All you do is type `jam` on the page, click an element, and type the comment</p>
</div>
<p>But I don’t include Jam here just for that. Jam also allows you to <a href="https://words.jam.dev/introducing-jam-wand/">offload the actual copy changes</a> to your PM, which flat-out decreases your minor tasks.</p>

<p><em>All organisms, including humans, face the fundamental challenge to interact with the environment in a manner that maximizes rewards while minimizing situations that lead to harm or such that cause boredom. Our reward system motivates us to primarily engage in activities that provide us with positive reinforcements. Fully aware of our biological traits, the strategy of the major media outlets is intended to disturb our values, make thinking seem unnecessary, and withdraw money from our bank accounts. But we don’t argue. We comply. And as I’ll argue below, this blind pursuit towards gratifying stimulus can be harmful to us.</em></p>



<p>This piece is a bit over 4000 words. </p>



<p>And right from the start, I can safely say that you don’t want to read it. Or maybe you do, but the mere thought that you’ll have to consume – manually go through – all of these pretty 4000 words surely make your head spin.</p>



<p>As I’ll explain below, you want to read something shorter. Something with more pictures and less text. Something with less friction. Actually, it will be best if this text magically transforms itself into a video that also plays in your native language.</p>



<p>I know this for a fact. I know this because I’m too, like everyone else, suffering from the degenerating ability to concentrate.</p>



<p>Recently, I wrote a whole article about our desire to receive regular doses of <a href="https://durmonski.com/self-improvement/lack-of-feedback/" target="_blank" aria-label="feedback (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">feedback</a>. While there I cover a lot of ground that is similar to the thesis below, it’s only scratching the surface on how the concept applies to our lives in the current times.</p>



<p>Reportedly, our attention span is getting shorter and shorter.<span id="easy-footnote-1-12750"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-12750" title="This statement is based on the study done by Nature Communications, <a aria-label=&quot;Abundance of information narrows our collective attention span (opens in a new tab)&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-04/tuod-aoi041119.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot;>Abundance of information narrows our collective attention span</a>."><sup>1</sup></a></span> But instead of the content that is being produced to help us increase our concentration, most platforms and publications do the opposite, they tailor their content to our inability to concentrate for more than 10 seconds. And instead of adjusting our media to the content, we adjust our content to the media.</p>



<p>What does this mean?</p>



<p>Well, in short, you don’t see a lot of websites or video creators that produce long-form pieces of content. Instead, we see most people focusing on producing and later sharing short, sweet, bite-size-type of content. </p>



<p>Why are such channels and platforms booming?</p>



<p>In our current reality, in order to sell something, in order to get people to watch and to make them pay attention to what you offer, you need to avoid complexity at all costs. Keep everything brief. Provide constant stimulation through variety, novelty, and movement. Don’t strain the attention and focus heavily on visuals and verbal precision.</p>



<p>These tactics make a lot of sense. After all, we’re bombarded by tons of news and other media on a daily basis. Thanks to the internet and emerging technologies, people around the world can now easily create content which means that the content available for consumption has quadrupled in less than 10 years.<span id="easy-footnote-2-12750"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-12750" title="Based on <a aria-label=&quot;recent reports (opens in a new tab)&quot; href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/09/26/global-online-content-consumption-doubled-in-2020/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot;>recent reports</a>, the average daily time spent consuming information is now six hours and 59 minutes, which includes phone, TV, and other forms of digital media."><sup>2</sup></a></span> And since our time per day remains more or less the same – 24 hours – it’s only logical to try to make content bite-sizy in order to save people some time and give them the opportunity to “taste” more opinions while still having a couple of minutes per day to shower and prepare food for themselves.</p>



<p>Plainly, long-form content is hard to fit into our days. That’s why platforms that provide ways to share short snippets of text, photos, and videos are booming.<span id="easy-footnote-3-12750"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-12750" title="Hey, even I do it! My <a aria-label=&quot;book summaries (opens in a new tab)&quot; href=&quot;https://durmonski.com/category/book-summaries/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot;>book summaries</a> present the main lessons from big books without you having to read the whole text."><sup>3</sup></a></span></p>



<p>This popular ambition everyone is aiming towards – to shorten everything and to fiercely remove all thinking barriers – is worsening our situation in the long-run.</p>



<p>We think that collecting viral tweets and saving Instagram carousels is making us smarter and intellectually more resilient, but we are simply further degenerating our already heavily fragmented attention.</p>



<p>If you’re still here after this too-long-for-most-people-to-consume introduction, let’s start my thesis where I’ll argue that the modern tools that focus on bite-sized-type of content and stripping away thinking are actually damaging our lives (not to mention preventing us from completing our long-term goals).</p>







<h2>How Our Brains Are Structured to Operate?</h2>



<p>My argument starts by sharing my findings in regards how our brains are wired to approach the surrounding environment.</p>



<p>According to neuroscience, we are mainly stimulus-driven creatures.<span id="easy-footnote-4-12750"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-12750" title="Based on <a href=&quot;https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-psych-010416-044216&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; aria-label=&quot;Learning, Reward, and Decision Making (opens in a new tab)&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot;>Learning, Reward, and Decision Making</a>."><sup>4</sup></a></span> We pursue rewards and behavior that will give us faster a sense of accomplishment and at the same time, require less computational resources. Put in a 21st-century language, “move fast and break things.”</p>



<p>That’s why we’ll often hear people say that “I want to feel better and move closer to pleasure by moving further away from pain and suffering.”</p>



<p>This often translates to: focusing on tasks that give returns now, in this very moment, and disengaging your participation in tasks that require too long to receive some sort of gains.</p>



<p>And it makes a lot of sense.</p>



<p>After all, if you are starving, if you are in a difficult financial situation, you will most likely do “any kind” of work, regardless of your long-term ambitions and goals.</p>



<p>The reward, money, in this case, which is actually the means to get food, is an absolute must for us to survive. And when the situation is complicated, we want to get it fast.</p>



<p>But it’s not only money. All of our senses are focused towards obtaining rewards as fast as possible. After all, for the brain to operate, and for the body to feel that what it’s doing is aligned with its main goal – to survive in the world for longer – a constant feed of reinforcements must be established otherwise you’ll question your actions and existence. </p>

If we do not get a proportionate return for our efforts, we will feel that our actions have been in vain. And we will probably stop doing the activity that does not bring results.</figcaption></figure>







<p>And that’s not all, along with physical survival – avoiding harm – we also want emotional prosperity – feeling good.</p>



<p>To rephrase, you want to get praise for what you’re doing. This praise while a lot of times from the outside perspective main seem vain and unimportant – think of social media likes and badges of honer – give to the brain important food. You see the likes and the nice words from others in your social media profile as what you’re doing is correct and that you’re worthy of living here – on the planet.</p>



<p>This is clearly visible in the actions of children.</p>



<p>From an early age, all they do is attract attention. Actually, in the book <a aria-label="The Evolving Self (opens in a new tab)" href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/the-evolving-self/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Evolving Self</a>, Robert Kagan explains that children are “designed” to be attractive. He states, “Among the ways an infant draws another to him, none is more powerful than his eyes.” After all, when born, we’re small and fragile. We need others to adore us. But most importantly, to stick around, so they can take care of us.</p>



<p>That’s why your children will interrupt you every time they make a new drawing or every time they create something new with their toys. But the new doodle or the new lego-tower constructed is not that important for them. They don’t simply invite you to play with them or to look at their creation, they want <em>you</em>, to tell <em>them</em>, that <em>they </em>matter. They are attached to you not only because you’re their biological parent, or the person providing food and other means for them to live. They also see you as the main source for their valuation. Thanks to the praise they receive from you, they feel valued.</p>



<p>The more frequent the praise, the better they feel.</p>



<p>This trait doesn’t go away when we grow up though.</p>







<h2>We Are Always Looking For Ways to Feel Valuable</h2>



<p>If we can put the above in one line, it will be perhaps the following: “Am I worthy?”</p>



<p>But let me expand this further so it can make more sense: “Am I spending my time, my resources, my mental capacity, in a way that will give me rewards that will ultimately reinforce my perception of worthiness?”</p>



<p>All the time, we’re asking ourselves this question. It can take different forms and shapes in different situations, but the core goal is always getting a firm yes to the question “Am I worthy?”</p>



<p>Here are some examples:</p>



<ul><li>Do you love me?</li><li>Do you like my project?</li><li>Do you like my new hair?</li><li>Do you like what I posted on my social media account?</li></ul>



<p>These questions are often not directly asked, of course. We transform them in some sort of actions.</p>



<p>For example, we won’t ask our spouse all the time “do you love me?” But we’ll do a lot of other things hoping to trigger sensations in them that will eventually get back to us in a form of food for our ego: We’ll prepare dinner hoping that he/she will like it and kiss us on the cheek which basically means, “You are worthy!”</p>



<p>We’ll share pictures of ourselves wearing fancy pajamas online hoping that others will like them. The more likes and comments we get, the more this means that “we are worthy and that we matter!”</p>



<p>Of course, there is more…</p>



<p>We’ll fine-tune our projects, arrange our desks, clean our rooms, buy expensive watches and designer-clothes, hoping that others will notice so we can get a nice dose of the “I matter” syrup.</p>



<p>The more the better.</p>



<p>And since the more the better is our guiding force, we focus on doing things that give us quick returns as opposed to doing things that will take years to accomplish.</p>



<p>Like in this picture:</p>

<p>This means that we’ll rather buy an expensive item that will immediately provide us with feedback about how we look and who we are instead of investing or exercising for 6 months, losing weight, and gaining bigger results but waiting for longer.</p>



<p>Since we now get the concept of how we operate, let’s look at how our modern media is tailored.</p>

<p>But what does the state of <em>data science</em> hiring look like today?</p>
<p>Here’s the gist of the article in two-sentences for the busy reader.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: There are <strong>70% more open roles</strong> at companies in <em>data engineering</em> as compared to <em>data science</em>. As we train the next generation of data and machine learning practitioners, let’s place more emphasis on engineering skills.</p>
<hr>
<p>As part of my work developing an <a href="https://www.confetti.ai/">educational platform</a> for data professionals, I think a lot about how the market for data-driven (machine learning and data science) roles is evolving. </p>
<p>In talking to dozens of prospective entrants to data fields including students at top institutions around the world, I’ve seen a tremendous amount of confusion around what skills are most important to help candidates stand out in the crowd and prepare for their careers. </p>
<p>When you think about it, a <em>data scientist</em> can be responsible for any subset of the following: machine learning modelling, visualization, data cleaning and processing (i.e. SQL wrangling), engineering, and production deployment. </p>
<p>How do you even begin to recommend a study curriculum for newcomers?</p>
<p>Data speaks louder than words. So I decided to do an analysis of the data roles being hired for at every company coming out of <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/">Y-Combinator</a> since 2012. The questions that guided my research:</p>
<ul>
<li>What data roles are companies most frequently hiring for?</li>
<li>How in-demand is the conventional <em>data scientist</em> that we talk about so much?</li>
<li>Are the same skills that started the data revolution relevant today?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want the full details and analysis, read on. </p>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>I chose to do an analysis of YC portfolio companies that claim to make some sort of data work part of their value proposition. </p>
<p>Why focus on YC? Well, for starters, they do a good job of providing an easily searchable (and scrapable) <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/">directory of their companies</a>. </p>
<p>In addition, as a particularly forward-thinking incubator that has funded companies from around the world across domains for over a decade, I felt they provided a representative sample of the market with which to conduct my analyses. That being said, take what I say wit a grain of salt, as I didn’t analyze super-large tech companies.</p>
<p>I scraped the homepage URLs of every YC company since 2012, producing an initial pool of ~1400 companies. </p>
<p>Why stop at 2012? Well, 2012 was the year that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet">AlexNet</a> won the ImageNet competition, effectively kickstarting the machine learning and data-modelling wave we are now living through. It’s fair to say that this birthed some of the earliest generations of data-first companies.</p>
<p>From this initial pool, I performed keyword filtering to reduce the number of relevant companies I would have to look through. In particular, I only considered companies whose websites included at least one of the following terms: AI, CV, NLP, natural language processing, computer vision, artificial intelligence, machine, ML, data. I also disregarded companies whose website links were broken. </p>
<p>Did this generate a ton of false positives? Absolutely! But here I was trying to prioritize high recall as much as possible, recognizing that I would do a more fine-grained manual inspection of the individual websites for relevant roles.</p>
<p>With this reduced pool, I went through every site, found where they were advertising jobs (typically a <em>Careers</em>, <em>Jobs</em>, or <em>We’re Hiring</em> page), and took note of every role that included data, machine learning, NLP, or CV in the title. This gave me a pool of about 70 distinct companies hiring for data roles. </p>
<p>One note here: it’s conceivable that I missed some companies as there were certain websites with very little information (typically those in stealth) that might actually be hiring. In addition, there were companies that didn’t have a formal <em>Careers</em> page but asked that prospective candidates reach out directly via email. </p>
<p>I disregarded both of these types of companies rather than reach out to them, so they are not part of this analysis.</p>
<p>Another thing: the bulk of this research was done towards the final weeks of 2020. Open roles may have changed as companies update their pages periodically. However, I don’t believe this will drastically impact the conclusions drawn. </p>
<h2>What Are Data Practitioners Responsible For?</h2>
<p>Before diving into the results, it’s worth spending some time clarifying what responsibilities each data role is typically responsible for. Here are the four roles we will spend our time looking at with a short description of what they do:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Data scientist</em>: Use various techniques in statistics and machine learning to process and analyse data. Often responsible for building models to probe what can be learned from some data source, though often at a prototype rather than production level. </li>
<li><em>Data engineer</em>: Develops a robust and scalable set of data processing tools/platforms. Must be comfortable with SQL/NoSQL database wrangling and building/maintaining ETL pipelines.</li>
<li><em>Machine Learning (ML) Engineer</em>: Often responsible for both training models and productionizing them. Requires familiarity with some high-level ML framework and also must be comfortable building scalable training, inference, and deployment pipelines for models.</li>
<li><em>Machine Learning (ML) Scientist</em>: Works on cutting-edge research. Typically responsible for exploring new ideas that can be published at academic conferences. Often only needs to prototype new state-of-the-art models before handing off to ML engineers for productionization.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Many Data Roles Are There?</h2>
<p>So what happens when we plot the frequency of each data role that companies are hiring for? The plot looks  like this:</p>

<p>What immediately stands out is how many more open <em>data engineer</em> roles there are compared to traditional <em>data scientists</em>. In this case, the raw counts correspond to companies hiring <strong>roughly 55% more</strong> for data engineers than data scientists, and roughly the same number of machine learning engineers as data scientists.</p>
<p>But we can do more. If you look at the titles of the various roles, there seems to be some repetition. </p>
<p>Let’s only provide coarse-grained categorization through role consolidation. In other words, I took roles whose descriptions were roughly equivalent and consolidated them under a single title. </p>
<p>That included the following set of equivalence relations: </p>

<p>I probably could have lumped <em>ML research engineer</em> into one of the <em>ML scientist</em> or <em>ML engineer</em> bins, but given that it was a bit of a hybrid role, I left it as is. </p>
<p>Overall the consolidation made the differences even more pronounced! There are <strong>~70%</strong> more open <em>data engineer</em> than <em>data scientist</em> positions. In addition, there are <strong>~40%</strong> more open <em>ML engineer</em> than <em>data scientist</em> positions. There are also only <strong>~30%</strong> as many <em>ML scientist</em> as <em>data scientist</em> positions. </p>
<h2>Takeaways</h2>
<p><em>Data engineers</em> are in increasingly high demand compared to other data-driven professions. In a sense, this represents an evolution for the broader field. </p>
<p>When machine learning become hot 🔥 5-8 years ago, companies decided they need people that can make classifiers on data. But then frameworks like <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow</a> and <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> became really good, democratizing the ability to get started with deep learning and machine learning. </p>
<p>This commoditized the data modelling skillset. </p>
<p>Today, the bottleneck in helping companies get machine learning and modelling insights to production center on data problems. </p>
<p>How do you annotate data? How do you process and clean data? How do you move it from A to B? How do you do this every day as quickly as possible?</p>

<p>All that amounts to having good engineering skills. </p>
<p>This may sound boring and unsexy, but old-school software engineering with a bend toward data may be what we really need right now. </p>
<p>For years, we’ve become enamored with the idea of data professionals that breathe life into raw data thanks to cool demos and media hype. After all, when was the last time you saw a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</a> article about an ETL pipeline? </p>
<p>If nothing else, I believe solid engineering is something we don’t emphasize enough in data science job training or educational programs. In addition to learning how to use <em>linear_regression.fit()</em>, learn how to write a unit test too!</p>
<p>So does that mean you shouldn’t study data science? No. </p>
<p>What it means is that competition is going to be tougher. There are going to be fewer positions available for what is looking to be an abundance of newcomers to the market trained to do data science. </p>
<p>There will always be a need for people that can effectively analyze and extract actionable insights from data. But they have to be good. </p>
<p>Downloading a pretrained model off the Tensorflow website on the <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html">Iris dataset</a> probably is no longer enough to get that data science job. </p>
<p>It’s clear, however, with the large number of <em>ML engineer</em> openings that companies often want a hybrid data practitioner: someone that can build and deploy models. Or said more succinctly, someone that can use Tensorflow but can also build it from source.</p>
<p>Another takeaway here is that there just aren’t that many ML research positions. </p>
<p>Machine learning research tends to get its fair share of hype because that’s where all the cutting-edge stuff happens, all the <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">AlphaGo</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/">GPT-3</a> and what-not. </p>

<p>The other day, as I was going through some of my old notes, I stumbled upon something I had written about the console, the terminal and the shell on Unix-like operating systems. I have decided to rewrite these notes in order to share them here on my website. So without further ado we will now stroll down memory lane and take a quick look at the origins of the Unix terminal and shell. And I will also give my advice to new users on Linux or BSD regarding the choice of terminal emulator and shell.</p>

<h2 id="the-terminal-and-the-console">The terminal and the console</h2>

<p>Early computers where huge machines that consisted of multiple cabinets, e.g. one cabinet for the CPU, one or more cabinets for tape drives, one cabinet for each disk drive, one cabinet for a punched card reader and one cabinet for a high speed printer. The image below is a Univac 9400 system from 1967 consisting of several cabinets.</p>

<p>The "console" was the "control console". In the pictures below is a "UNIVAC 1" control console and a "UNIVAC 2" control console.</p>

<p>The word terminal comes from the Latin "terminus", meaning "an end, a limit, boundary line", indicating that it's the terminating end or "terminal" end of a communications process. You will sometimes hear the description "a dumb terminal" when referring to a text-based environment where the computer is <i>just taking input and showing text</i> while the real work happens at the other end, typically in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer">mainframe</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprinter">teleprinter</a> or TTY was the first kind of terminal. Rather than a monitor you would have a literal typewriter in front of you. When you typed on it, you would see the text on a piece of paper and that text would be send to the computer. When the computer replied, you would see the typewriter print on the paper. Some models could also be used to create punched tape for data storage (either from typed input or from data received from a remote source) and to read back such tape for local printing or transmission.</p>

<p>In the picture below is a Teletype 33 ASR Teleprinter. It was introduced in 1963 as an electro-mechanical teleprinter and it was one of the most popular terminals in the communications industry. The ASR stands for <b>A</b>utomatic <b>S</b>end and <b>R</b>eceive. The ASR 33 had a built-in punched tape reader and tape punch which allowed the user to save programs.</p>

<p><img src="https://unixsheikh.com/includes/images/asr33.jpg" alt="33 ASR Teleprinter"><br><span>A Teletype Model 33 ASR teleprinter, usable as a terminal.</span></p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b><br>If you're interested I can highly recommend that you take a look at Charles Baetsen's Hobby Page as he has a wealth of information about the <a href="https://va3ngc.weebly.com/asr-33-documentation.html">Teletype 33 ASR</a> in the form of both user manuals, installations manuals and videos.</p>

<p>In the picture below Ken Thompson (sitting) and Dennis Ritchie (standing) is using a 33 ASR teleprinter connected to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11">PDP-11</a>, the picture is from 1972.</p>

<p><img src="https://unixsheikh.com/includes/images/thompson-ritchie-pdp-11.png" alt="Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie"></p>

<p>Later, as computers became much smaller, it was possible to integrate multiple components into one single unit, with both a video monitor and a keyboard put together inside it, and the "console" now became more or less synonymous to the "terminal". Both the "console" and the "terminal" now referred to the physical video terminal that had replaced both the teleprinter and the old control console.</p>

<p>The video terminal provides a way for the kernel and other processes to send text output on the monitor to the user, and to receive text input from the user via the keyboard.</p>

<p>The VT100 is a video terminal, introduced in August 1978 by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). It was one of the first terminals to support ANSI escape codes for cursor control and other tasks, and added a number of extended codes for special features like controlling the status lights on the keyboard. This led to rapid uptake of the ANSI standard, becoming the de facto standard for terminal emulators.</p>

<p><img src="https://unixsheikh.com/includes/images/dec-vt100.jpg" alt="DEC VT100"><br><span>A DEC VT100</span></p>

<p>The VT220 is an ANSI standard video terminal introduced by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in November 1983. The VT240 added monochrome vector graphics support to the base model, while the VT241 did the same in color. The 200 series replaced the VT100 series. Among its major upgrades was a number of international character sets, as well as the ability to define new character sets, and a much lighter keyboard.</p>

<p><img src="https://unixsheikh.com/includes/images/dec-vt220.jpg" alt="DEC VT220"><br><span>A DEC VT220</span></p>

<p>Today, in the software world, "console" and "terminal" has become completely synonymous.</p>

<h3 id="the-virtual-terminal">The virtual terminal</h3>

<p>A virtual terminal or virtual console is a program that simulates a physical terminal. For example, both the Linux kernel and BSD kernels support virtual terminals - terminals that are logically separate, but which access the same physical keyboard and monitor.</p>

<p>The virtual terminal gives the impression that several independent terminals are running concurrently. Each virtual terminal can be logged in with a different user and it can run its own shell and have its own font settings. The virtual terminals each use a device <code>/dev/ttyX</code>, and you can switch between them by pressing <code>Alt+FX</code> (where <code>X</code> is equal to the virtual terminal number, beginning with 1).</p>

<h2 id="the-terminal-emulator">The terminal emulator</h2>

<p>Emulation refers to the ability of a computer program to emulate, i.e. imitate, another program or device. A terminal emulator is a computer program that emulates a physical terminal within some other display architecture, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">X Window System</a>.</p>

<p>Many different terminal emulators have been developed that emulate terminals such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT52">VT52</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100">VT100</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT220">VT220</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT320">VT320</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_3270">IBM 3270/8/9/E</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_5250">IBM 5250</a>, and many others.</p>

<p>The terminal emulator takes the input you type at the keyboard and convert those to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> characters which it sends to the shell, or to a program running under the shell (more about the shell later). The terminal emulator also takes the stream of output characters from the various programs you run via the shell and displays them on the monitor.</p>

<p>The purpose of the terminal emulator is to allow access to the command line while working in a graphical user interface, such as the X Window System. Since the shell is "expecting" to interface with a human through a terminal, and we don't use a physical terminal while in a graphical environment, we need the terminal emulator.</p>

<p>You can see what terminal types are available on most Linux distributions by running <code>ls /lib/terminfo/*</code> (the path may be different on your system). On OpenBSD it's <code>ls /usr/share/terminfo/*</code></p>

<h4 id="xterm">xterm</h4>

<p><a href="https://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm.html">xterm</a> was originally written as a stand-alone terminal emulator for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAXstation#VAXstation_100">VAXStation 100 </a> (VS100) by Mark Vandevoorde, a student of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Gettys">Jim Gettys</a>, who worked at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation">DEC's</a> Cambridge Research Laboratory. It became clear that xterm would be more useful as part of X Window System than as a standalone program, so it was retargeted to the X Window System.</p>

<p>The xterm program is the default terminal emulator for the X Window System. It provides DEC VT102/VT220 features and other selected features from higher-level terminals such as VT320, VT420 and VT520. It also provides Tektronix 4014 emulation for programs that cannot use the window system directly. If the underlying operating system supports terminal resizing (for example, the SIGWINCH signal in systems derived from 4.3bsd), xterm will use the facilities to notify programs running in the window whenever it is resized.</p>

<p>Around 1996 the main line of development shifted to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XFree86">XFree86</a> implementation of the X Window System and xterm is now maintained by Thomas Dickey, who is also the current lead developer of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_%28web_browser%29">Lynx</a>, a popular customizable text-based web browser.</p>

<p>Early versions of xterm emulated the VT102 and Tektronix 4014. Later versions added control sequences for DEC and other terminals such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>VT220: Added in patch 24.</li>
    <li>VT320: Added in patch 24.</li>
    <li>VT420: DECSTR (soft terminal reset) was added in patch 34.</li>
    <li>VT520: Although not officially emulated, parts of VT520 features were implemented. Controls DECSMBV and DECSWBV for setting the margin- and warning-bell volume was added in patch 254.</li>
</ul>

<p>As with most X applications, xterm can be customized via global X resources files (e.g. <code>/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm</code>), per-user resource files (e.g. <code>~/.Xresources</code>), or command-line arguments. Most of the command-line options correspond to resource settings, as noted in the <a href="https://man.archlinux.org/man/extra/xterm/xterm.1.en">xterm manual page</a>.</p>

<p>While the name of the program is xterm, the X resource class in <code>~/.Xresources</code> is <code>XTerm</code>, e.g.:</p>

<pre>XTerm*utf8: 1</pre>

<p>The <a href="https://man.archlinux.org/man/extra/xterm/xterm.1.en">xterm manual page</a> provides a full list of features and options.</p>

<p>xterm is still being actively developed, it works really great across many different systems, it has extremely low input latency, it has many hidden gems and it is my favorite terminal emulator! For that reason I'm going to share some settings you can use in your <code>~/.Xresources</code> file:</p>

<pre>XTerm*faceName: "DejaVu Sans Mono"

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      



<p>Several years ago, I lived at the Zen Center of New York City, a Zen temple focused on supporting lay practitioners (folks who practice but also have jobs, families, and so on). Living at a Zen center is inherently intensive. You follow the temple schedule—morning and evening meditation, work and meals together, and regular meditation retreats—as well as managing your other responsibilities. Yet, there’s an ease to practicing meditation in such a place. You don’t have to expend mental energy to get yourself to practice because everything about places like ZCNYC supports your practice. Your schedule is clear. Even if you sleep in (🙋), someone will come to get you to join in the meditation hall (😅). Your life <em>systematically</em> supports your practice.</p>
<p>When I moved to California for my Ph.D., I had a hard time with my practice. I didn’t lack interest or motivation: I knew from direct experience that it was necessary. But now, without the structure of the Zen center, <em>I</em> was responsible for making it happen. After months of struggling with sitting<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> every day, I decided enough was enough. I made a vow: I was going to sit every day, first thing, for the rest of my life. I didn’t commit to a certain amount of hours or any other requirement. I just focused on consistency.</p>
<p>Making a vow to sit every day completely changed my experience. Why? The answer was clear to me almost immediately: the debate in my head was gone. There was no more “should I sit?”, no more “how long?” or “when?”. I didn’t worry about it, because it was a solved problem: I sit every day, first thing—nothing to think about. Even though spending <em>more</em> time practicing was valuable to me, I didn’t focus on that. I focused on the system that got me on the cushion. Because my practice is important to me, spending more time doing it bloomed naturally from a consistent habit; if I just got on the cushion every day, that was enough.</p>
<p>I recently read <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits"><em>Atomic Habits</em> by James Clear</a>, which I quite liked (<a href="https://kislayverma.com/books/book-review-atomic-habits/">here’s a summary</a>). Many books on productivity amount to one or two useful blog posts wrapped in 200 pages of gimmicky marketing, but I found this book readable and practical, supported by research. When I read the book, I realized: oh, what I did with my practice was an atomic habit. I focused on small, consistent actions that build on their own. I ingrained them in my life so that I did not need to think about it. I <em>became</em> a person who gets on the cushion every day.</p>
<div id="data-science-as-an-atomic-habit">

<p>In Clear’s view, the most important habits are small and consistent, whose benefits slowly build and compound over time, much like my commitment to sit every day. Where we get tripped up is this second part, and this especially true in learning data science. We <em>think</em> our abilities should grow linearly to our effort, but that is not so. My experience learning R and other data science tools followed this type of non-intuitive path: I had an expectation of what my progress should be that turned out to be quite different from what actually happened. When you’re learning R or python, for instance, you may find yourself wondering why, if you’re coding or studying every day, you still feel like the language doesn’t <em>get</em> you. Clear uses a diagram to show this, but since this is a data science post, we might as well draw it in R:</p>
<pre><code>library(ggplot2)
inner_thoughts &lt;- tibble::tribble(
  ~x,  ~y,    ~label,
  0,   800,   "Cool!",
  0.9, 800,   "...?",
  1.8, 1400,  "object... of\ntype... closure?",
  3.9, 900,   "Ugghhhh",
  5.3, 1200,  "Ugghhhhhh",
  6.7, 2500,  "Oh wait",
  7.7, 4000,  "...!!",
  8.5, 8000,  "!!!!!",
  7.9, 20000, "Oh sure, it's easy"
)

ggplot() + 
  geom_function(fun = exp, size = 1.2, color = "firebrick") + 
  geom_text(data = inner_thoughts, aes(x, y, label = label), hjust = 0) +
  xlim(0, 10) + 
  ggtitle("Mastering a programming language") + 
  theme_void(24)</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/4e6574a4bf8b405234b074df4c5784d1b278afae/e3e2b/post/2021-01-04-data-science-as-an-atomic-habit/index.en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="672"></p>
<p>This is the stubbornly quiet path of practice: our abilities lag behind our effort. At the “Ugghhhh” stage, our internal motivation starts to dissolve. Sure, you can make a plot or whatever, but you’re still fighting errors all day. What do you have to show for it at this point? Not that much more, you might feel, than when you started. But our growth is rarely linear: often, it’s explosive, at least at critical moments <a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. We suddenly begin to make connections, which help us build other relationships, and so on. Growth is never infinite (bad news: even if you manage to improve every day, you’ll die eventually), but it’s also rarely as linked to our <em>immediate</em> efforts as we expect.</p>
</div>
<div id="practice-and-becoming-are-one-action">

<p>With a meaningful habit—like learning data science—part of the issue is that we’re focused on the results as if our (not) being a data scientist is equal to how many errors our code makes. But that’s not quite right. If you’re learning to run, for instance, you aren’t becoming a person who runs for 30 minutes. You’re becoming a <em>runner</em>. That transformation is more profound, more challenging, and more bountiful. Running 30 minutes is just a useful strategy to engage with that transformation. When you’re sitting down with code and data, you’re not becoming a person who types R code without errors<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. <a href="https://jamesclear.com/identity-based-habits">You’re <em>becoming</em> a data scientist</a>. Becoming—birth—is a slow, sometimes painful, but ultimately astounding process. In Zen, we say, “don’t put a head on top of your own.” Don’t confuse the results with what’s really happening.</p>
<p>One of the better Hadley Wickham gifs is this one, <a href="http://datascience.la/hadley-wickhams-dplyr-tutorial-at-user-2014-part-1/">where he’s warning R learners</a> that, well, you’re going to suck at R for a while:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">…and that was the last time I ever asked Hadley for a pep talk. <a href="https://t.co/w0ThvrqqDs">pic.twitter.com/w0ThvrqqDs</a></p>— Mara Averick (@dataandme) <a href="https://twitter.com/dataandme/status/1022233480497954817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 25, 2018</a></blockquote>


<p>The fuller quote is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whenever you’re learning a new tool, for a long time, you’re going to suck… But the good news is that is typical; that’s something that happens to everyone, and it’s only temporary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve always liked this because you <em>should</em> prepare yourself for not being a master programmer for a while; it is an inherent part of the process and mostly unavoidable. However, I also think it’s good to recognize that your learning and effort are not going to waste. <em>Becoming</em> a data scientist merely lags behind the effort we put in to <em>practicing</em> data science. Practice and becoming are one process, one action, but we often don’t see how they’re connected. What’s happening underneath the surface of our effort is quiet—right until it rises with a fury.</p>
</div>

<div id="tracking">

<p>It helps if you track your habit to make sure you <em>are</em> showing up. One nice feature of GitHub is that it shows your commit history in a heatmap; if you commit, it’s green, and if not, it’s gray. If your habit is to make a commit every day, don’t leave any gray squares.</p>
<p><img src="https://malco.io/2021/01/04/data-science-as-an-atomic-habit/img/gitmap.png" width="742"></p>
<p>GitHub’s heatmap is very similar to a popular productivity technique: <a href="https://lifehacker.com/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret-281626">The Seinfeld Chain</a>. Jerry Seinfeld committed to writing a joke every day. He had a big, daily calendar, and he crossed off a day in red marker every time he wrote. You build up a chain of red Xs. Quoth Jerry: “Don’t break the chain.”</p>
<p>Several apps are good for this. I use <a href="https://www.thehabithub.com/">HabitHub</a>. I used to draw out 365 squares in my gridded Moleskine notebook and cross them off manually.</p>
<p>Right now, I track five habits on HabitHub. I slowly added them, focusing on one at a time, until they felt secure, then I add another. I also made modifications to them over time as my needs for this support changed. Some habits became so automatic that I didn’t need to track them anymore, while others benefited from creating a new, closely-related habit to stack on the one that had become stable.</p>
</div>
<div id="trust-yourself">

<p>Ultimately, what you’re cultivating here is consistency and patience with the process. We often conflate patience with grit. Patience, however, is not endurance; patience is trust. It is, in particular, trust in yourself. That’s good news because, while keeping your nose to the grindstone is useful, it’s not sustainable. Eventually, you run out of nose. Instead, apply your grit to where it’s most beneficial: consistency and trust. Get to the keyboard every day; make that commit every day; show up. While you’re doing that, choose to see your victories. Cultivate trust in yourself by witnessing yourself <em>for who you are</em>: someone who is capable of what you’ve set out to do. Witness the evidence of your abilities—perhaps small and simple at first. Then witness them bloom.</p>

Perception of work (job demands and job control) may become a major cause of employees’ work addiction. The international group of researchers including the HSE University scientist explored the link between work addiction risk and health-related outcomes using the framework of Job Demand Control Model. The results were published in the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7593928/" rel="nofollow"><em>International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</em></a>.</p>  <p>Workaholics are people who usually work seven and more hours more than others per week. There are potential reasons for that: financial problems, poor marriage or pressure by their organization or supervisor. What can differentiate a workaholic behaviour from similar behaviour like work engagement? Workaholism is also known as a behavioural disorder, which means the excessive involvement of the individual in work when an employer doesn’t require or expect it.</p> </div>








    
    
        <p>The scientists aimed to demonstrate the extent to which the work addiction risk is associated with the perception of work (job demands and job control), and mental health in four job categories suggested by Karasek’s model or Job Demand-Control-Support model (JDCS). The JDCS model assumes four various work environments (four quadrants) in which workers may experience a different level of job demands and job control: passive, low-strain, active, and tense/job-strain. Job control is the extent to which an employee feels control over doing work.</p>


<div><ul>  <li>Passive” jobs (low job control, low job demands) might be satisfying to a worker as long as the workers reach the set goal.</li>  <li>Low strain” jobs have high job control and low job demands. Individuals in this category are not particularly at risk of mental health problems, and it corresponds typically to creative jobs such as architects.</li>  <li>Active” workers have high job demands and high job control. They are highly skilled professionals with responsibilities, such as heads or directors of companies. Those highly skilled workers have very demanding tasks but they have high levels of decision latitude to solve problems.</li>  <li>Finally, workers at risk of stress-related disorders are those within the “job strain” group (high demand and low control). For example, healthcare workers from emergency departments are typically in job strain because they cannot control the huge workload.</li> </ul>  <p>The study was conducted in France because it is one of the industrial countries with growing numbers of occupations. The authors of the research collected data from 187 out of 1580 (11.8%) French workers who agreed to participate in a cross-sectional study using the WittyFit software online platform. The self-administered questionnaires were the Job Content Questionnaire by Karasek, the Work Addiction Risk Test, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale and socio-demographics. The authors of this study divided all the participants based on their occupational groups and investigated the link between work addiction risk and mental and physical health outcomes.</p> </div>

<p>‘One of the novelties of this research was to introduce vulnerable occupational groups to organizations or job holders. For example, if we find that work addiction risk can be found more in some occupations and may result in negative outcomes for the health situation then we can give this information to decision makers in this organization or, for example, to the ministry of health. And they could intervene to prevent this problem.’</p>

            
        </div>


<div><p>The results show that high job demands at work are strongly associated with work addiction risk but the job control level does not play the same role. The prevalence of work addiction risk is higher for active and high-strain workers than for passive and low-strain workers. These two groups of workers appeared to be more vulnerable and therefore can suffer more from the negative outcomes of work addiction risk, in terms of depression, sleep disorder, stress and other health issues.</p>  <p>‘We found that job demands could be the most important factor that can develop work addiction risk. So this factor should be controlled or should be investigated by the organization's manager, for example, HR staff, psychologists. Also another conclusion could be the job climate like job demands of each job category can influence the rate of work addiction risk. Thus in this study we actually focused on external factors like job demands not internal factors like the personal characteristics,’ adds Morteza Charkhabi.</p>  <p>The researchers found that people with higher work addiction risk compared to people with low work addiction risk have twice the risk of developing depression. Sleep quality was lower to workers with high risk of work addiction compared to workers with low risk of work addiction. Also women had almost twice the work addiction risk than men.</p> </div></div></div>]]>

through candidates, and for a file to open.</p><p>Emacs froze for <em>5 seconds</em> before showing me the <code>find-file</code> prompt. Which
isn’t great, because when writing software, opening files is actually
something one needs to do all the time.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/find_file_linux.png"></figure><p>Luckily, Emacs is “the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time
display editor”, and comes with profiling capabilities: <code>M-x profiler-start</code>
starts a profile and <code>M-x profiler-report</code> displays a call tree showing how
much CPU cycles are spent in each function call after starting the profile.
Starting a profile and running <code>M-x find-file</code> showed that all time was being
spent in a function called <code>ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code>, which was being
called by <code>file-name-at-point-functions</code>, an <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html%5Fnode/emacs/Hooks.html#:~:text=A%20few%20hooks%20are%20abnormal,are%20used%20in%20some%20way.">abnormal hook</a> run when <code>find-file</code>
is called.</p><p>If you're familiar with Vim you can think of Emacs <i>hooks</i> as
Vim <i>autocommands</i>, only with much better ergonomics.</p><p>I checked the documentation for <code>ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code> with <code>M-x describe-function ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code> and it didn’t seem
to be something essential, so I removed the hook by running <code>M-x eval-expression</code>, writing the form below, and pressing <code>RET</code>.</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">(<span>remove-hook</span> <span>'file-name-at-point-functions</span> <span>'ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</span>)
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>This solved the immediate problem of Emacs blocking for 5 seconds every
time I ran <code>find-file</code>, with no noticeable drawbacks.</p><div><p>As I write this I attempt to reproduce the issue by re-adding
<code>ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code>
to
<code>file-name-at-point-functions</code>.
I can't reproduce it anymore. The initial issue might have been</p><ul><li>caused by having manually mutated the Emacs environment via ad-hoc code
evaluation (drifting from the state defined in configuration)</li><li>caused by settings or packages that aren't in my configuration anymore</li><li>fixed by settings or packages that were recently added to my
configuration</li><li>fixed by some recent package upgrade</li></ul><p>Or some combination of the above. I have no idea exactly what.
Which is to say: maintaining Emacs configurations is complicated.</p></div><p>I could now navigate around and open files. The next thing I tried in this
remote git repository was searching through project files. The great
<em>projectile</em> package provides the <code>projectile-find-file</code> function for that,
but I had previously given up making projectile perform well with remote
buffers; given how things are currently implemented it seems to be
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=projectile+tramp">impractical</a>. So I installed the <em>find-file-in-project</em> package for use on
remote projects exclusively: <code>M-x package-install find-file-in-project</code>.</p><p>Most Emacs commands are accessible via key combinations, with defaults
that can be customized to be anything you want. I'll stick to referencing
command names themselves instead of their default keybindings.</p><p>Both <code>projectile-find-file</code> and <code>find-file-in-project</code> (aliased as <code>ffip</code>):</p><ul><li>show a narrowed list of all project files in the minibuffer</li><li>prompt the user to filter and scroll through candidates</li><li>open a file when <code>RET</code> is pressed on a candidate.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/projectile_find_file_linux.png"></figure><p>To disable projectile on remote buffers I had the following form in my
configuration.</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">(<span>defadvice</span> <span>projectile-project-root</span> (<span>around</span> <span>ignore-remote</span> <span>first</span> <span>activate</span>)
  (<span>unless</span> (<span>file-remote-p</span> <span>default-directory</span> <span>'no-identification</span>) <span>ad-do-it</span>))
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>Which causes the <code>projectile-project-root</code> function to not run its usual
implementation on remote buffers, but instead return <code>nil</code> unconditionally.
<code>projectile-project-root</code> is used as a way to either get the project root for
a given buffer (remote or not), or as a boolean predicate to test if the
buffer is in a project (e.g., a git repository directory). Having it return
<code>nil</code> on remote buffers effectively disables projectile on remote buffers.</p><p>Emacs
<i><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Advising-Functions.html">advices</a></i> are a way of modifying the behavior of existing functions without
having to redefine them. They serve a similar purpose as hooks, but are
more flexible.</p><p>I then wrote a function that falls back to <code>ffip</code> when projectile is
disabled and bound it to the keybinding I had for <code>projectile-find-file</code>,
so that I could press the same keybinding whenever I wanted to search for
projects files, and not have to think about whether I’m on a remote buffer
or not:</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1

already tell that Emacs was GCing a lot; enabling this setting makes a

</p> 

<p>
2021, Jan 13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—&nbsp;
11 minute read
</p>
<p>One of my friends recently brought up the idea of consulting for startups. He’s been working in software for almost two decades, and he’s worked for a few well-known startups in the area. He definitely has skills and knowledge that would be valuable for a startup, so he was surprised when I told him <strong>startup consulting is not a good idea.</strong></p>
<p>I’ve thought about this topic a lot. I have worked for early-stage startups, done some startup consulting, and met plenty of startup consultants. A few of them have actually been pretty successful.</p>
<p>That said, I steer consultants away from startups when they ask, and in this post, I’ll explain why. I love working with startups, so please don’t read this as a knock against them. As you’ll see, they’re just an objectively poor target market for consultants.</p>
<p><em>Learning more about startups? I’ve compiled a list of <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/startup-books">my favorite books for founders here</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="what-is-startup-consulting">What is Startup Consulting?</h2>
<p>First off, when I say “consultant,” I’m not talking about freelancers or contract hires. Those two categories of employees are essentially tax shelters for small companies that can’t afford full-time people yet, and their work is typically very execution-focused.</p>
<p>I’m also not talking about advisors, mentors, or coaches. People in these roles are typically more focused on asking questions or serving as a sounding board. If you’re an experienced entrepreneur coaching a new founder, that’s great. I have several mentors, and they’re invaluable, but they don’t make a living from helping people like me.</p>
<p>A startup consultant is someone whose business is to come into a small company, ask some questions, analyze the data, prepare a report, and make recommendations based on their findings. They don’t execute tasks or manage team members directly (although there are exceptions) but focus instead on high-level strategy.</p>
<p>Startup consultants aren’t typically involved for the long-term (and are almost never offered equity), but the good ones might provide some follow-through to see how their recommendations pan out. They might also offer a retainer to answer questions about their recommendations as they come up, but they usually aren’t part of the day-to-day.</p>
<h3 id="why-do-people-start-consulting-for-startups">Why Do People Start Consulting for Startups?</h3>
<p><strong>The most lucrative piece of the consulting market is focused on Fortune 500 companies.</strong> That’s where giants like <a href="https://www.consultancy.uk/news/14018/the-10-largest-consulting-firms-in-the-world">PwC, Deloitte, E&amp;Y, KPMG, McKinsey, and BCG</a> all play, but for one-person consulting shops or small agencies, it’s pretty hard to land one of these customers.</p>
<p>So, many new consultants set their sites on startups. Some figure they can take their experience from a larger company (or, god forbid, <a href="https://www.cleverism.com/why-you-should-not-hire-mbas-for-startup/">an MBA</a>) to help early-stage startups “grow up.” Others trade on a former employer’s success (i.e., people who put “Formerly Google/Apple/Facebook/etc.” in their Linkedin bios), using name recognition to attract startups that like having a name brand behind their consultants.</p>
<p>These hopeful new consultants hang up their shingles, offering something vague like “Proven Growth Strategies” or “Scalable Product-Led Growth.” If they <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/the-key-to-networking-keeping-in-touch">have a deep personal network</a>, they’ll probably find enough clients to survive for a couple of years, but most of them won’t stick with the startup market long.</p>
<h2 id="the-case-against-startup-consulting">The Case Against Startup Consulting</h2>
<p>While startups can make decisions quickly - <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3006682/not-so-fast-10-hasty-mistakes-startup-founders-make">almost to a fault</a> - they aren’t an easy market to serve. They’re price sensitive, have high expectations, and prone to failure. Let’s dive into each of these points and see how they affect startup consulting.</p>
<h3 id="1-founders-have-unrealistic-expectations">1. Founders Have Unrealistic Expectations</h3>
<p>What consultants offer is squishy, and for big companies, it can be more political than practical:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“CEOs that want or need to make an unpopular decision often bring in a consulting firm to help. This provides ammunition to recommend an unpopular or risky decision to the board. The CEO can also distance herself from an unpopular decision by blaming the consultants.” - <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-value-do-consulting-firms-like-McKinsey-Bain-et-al-really-add-to-an-operation-What-exactly-is-it-that-they-do-that-commands-such-premium-compensation-and-more-importantly-has-created-an-entire-sustainable-and-enduring-industry/answer/Raj-Ramanan">Raj Ramanan, Co-Founder at Loku</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>While large companies hire consultants to validate decisions or reassure institutional investors, startups hope you will solve their deepest, darkest problems.</strong> Your recommendation isn’t just a handy report for investors - they’re going to stake the future of their business on it.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YkVXgqm.png" alt="Large company vs. startup consulting"></p>
<p>While you will certainly send the startup off with the strategy document you promised, anyone who has worked with a startup knows that <strong>things change too fast for a static recommendation like this to make any difference</strong>. They’re going to need you to come back and revise the strategy as they learn new things. Unfortunately, you probably didn’t build that into the price, so now you’re annoyed that they won’t just follow your original plan, and they’re annoyed that they spent $20k for an outdated document.</p>
<h3 id="2-price-sensitivity">2. Price Sensitivity</h3>
<p>As a consultant, it would seem that the obvious solution to the first problem is to simply <em>charge the startup more for ongoing help</em>. The problem is that <strong>startups must be frugal to survive</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“People who are cheap are much more likely to succeed. And not just because their money lasts longer; a frugal attitude seems to correlate with success.” - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=189830">Paul Graham, Y Combinator</a></p>

<p>Most funded startups are trading on borrowed time and get 12-18 months of runway per fundraise. Bootstrapped startups aren’t any better because the founders tend to be sacrificing more out of pocket to keep the lights on.</p>
<p>While large companies get budgets earmarked for hiring consultants or completing specific projects, small startups usually have to run all major expenditures by the founder. I’ve known founders who won’t let division heads charge so much as $100 to the company card without clearance from the CEO.</p>
<p>So while you look at your $200 per hour price tag as a bargain for startups (McKinsey is charging <a href="https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/revealed-mckinsey-partners-charge-16-000-a-day-before-discounts-20190808-p52f2a">$16k per day, after all</a>), they see it as a significant line item on a razor-thin budget. Misalignment like this is bound to lead to disappointment on one side or the other.</p>

<p>“In truth, startups rarely need new ideas — they already have more than they know what to do with. So adding yet more ideas to the backlog is stressful, especially without the resources to execute them.” - <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/why-startups-hate-consultants-5b245ec275d3">Dave Bailey, CEO Coach</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I recently met with a startup that hired a very senior person from a big tech firm. He loved having a big title, but when the time came to build the product, he was unwilling to roll up his sleeves and write any code.</p>
<p><strong>“I’m the CTO who drives the Ferrari, not the Toyota,”</strong> he said.</p>
<p>In the first few years, startup founders spend at least 80% of their time on low-level, hands-on drudgery: sales calls, product development, social media management, writing email campaigns, hiring key people, setting up payroll/books/insurance/etc…It’s not glamorous work, but it needs to get done.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WTxowB5.png" alt="Startup founders and grunt work"></p>
<p>So, it’s tough for a startup to justify bringing on a consultant who <em>only</em> offers high-level strategy at an hourly rate many times higher than their early employees.</p>
<p>Most startup founders who have cleared the first couple of bars by doing some fundraising and making some sales are pretty smart people. They don’t need a consultant who’s never been in their shoes to tell them how to run their business; they need humble people who can get their hands dirty and make shit happen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Consultants had a very topical view of our business, did not sit with us every day, and did not have the same passion and zeal for our company that we as founders naturally had. After three months, we stopped using them and learned a very important lesson.” - <a href="https://www.startups.com/library/expert-advice/should-you-hire-startup-consultants">Gray Skinner, CEO at Droplr</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if you restrict your work to startups within a single industry or market, as a consultant, you’re never going to be as “bought-in” as the founders. So, when you come in and make a recommendation that flies counter to what the founder believes, they can simply write it off. “She must not see what we see.”</p>
<p>Whether the founder is right or wrong doesn’t matter. What matters is their perception that outside consultants are never going to be as dedicated or see the vision that they do.</p>
<p>You might be able to filter startups out if they’re especially hostile to consultants, but it’s usually hard to tell what their attitude will be until you start to make recommendations to them.</p>
<h3 id="5-the-expert-problem">5. The “Expert” Problem</h3>
<p>Most consultants consider themselves experts in some specific field. That’s great, but as I’ve pointed out in the past, <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/experts">experts fall prey to the same biases that the rest of us do</a>.</p>
<p>For one thing, many consultants tend to overgeneralize their experience. If you’ve been in marketing at a few startups, you might think you know everything there is to know about startup marketing. Even if you don’t project this hubris publicly, it affects the way you make decisions and closes you off to new inputs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We love anecdotes so much because it’s often much easier for people to believe someone’s testimony as opposed to understanding complex data and variation across a continuum. Anecdotes exempt us from having to prove our point: it’s happened once; that’s solid proof as far as I’m concerned.” - <a href="https://manuel.friger.io/blog/advice">Manuel Frigerio</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This overgeneralization problem seems especially toxic in startup consulting because what worked in <a href="">cutting-edge startups</a> five years ago won’t necessarily work today.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The solution the firm comes up involves a high tech presentation and even higher tech case studies, but when it comes to the true substance of the steps they recommend, it may as well be 1982.” - <a href="https://www.inc.com/michael-schein/how-consultants-kill-business.html">Michael Schein, CEO at Microfame Media</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="6-founders-need-to-learn-for-themselves">6. Founders Need to Learn for Themselves</h3>
<p>I recently saw a consultant who would sit down with a founder in <em>any industry</em> for an hour and tell them which marketing channels they should use.</p>
<p>I am skeptical that this will work. A startup’s early successful marketing channels will be based on which avenues the founder is most familiar with and where their target market hangs out. You can tell a founder to “just use Instagram ads,” but if they’ve never run an Instagram …</p></div></article></section></div>

<p>Open Source Security, Inc is proud to announce its funding of a full-time and 
public development effort of a <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a> front-end for <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>.
In this blog post, we'll detail the motivations for our involvement and the benefits the public will reap
as a result of this effort.</p>

<h2>A Security Need</h2>

<p>In July of last year, shortly after my virtual <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Kza6fdkSU">presentation</a> at the Linux Security Summit 
North America entitled <a href="https://grsecurity.net/10_years_of_linux_security.pdf">"10 Years of Linux Security - A Report Card"</a>, we put out a 
<a href="https://twitter.com/spendergrsec/status/1283005179135221761">call</a> to other 
companies interested in funding a GCC front-end for Rust.

The motivation for this arose
from outreach from Nick Desaulniers of Google on <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAKwvOdmuYc8rW_H4aQG4DsJzho=F+djd68fp7mzmBp3-wY--Uw@mail.gmail.com/T/">LKML</a> 
to discuss the possibility of Rust support in the Linux kernel at the upcoming Linux 
Plumbers Conference.  One obvious hurdle mentioned immediately was that the kernel is most 
commonly compiled with GCC, while Rust currently requires rustc/LLVM.  According to reports of
the resulting discussion, kernel 
developers were open to the idea of allowing the kernel to be built with GCC and the Rust 
portions with LLVM, as long as the two were ABI compatible.</p>

<p>Such discussions appeared to sidestep a more fundamental issue however: the security 
viability of a mixed assembly/C/Rust execution environment and how cohesive security 
functionality could be provided while mixing different compilers with different 
implementations/availability of said functionality.  The importance of this topic, though apparent 
on reflection, was formalized just recently in a paper by Michalis Papaevripides and Elias 
Athanasopoulos of the University of Cyprus entitled <a href="https://www.cs.ucy.ac.cy/~eliasathan/papers/tops20.pdf">"Exploiting Mixed 
Binaries"</a>.  In it, they detail how the overall security of an execution 
environment can be reduced by the introduction of code written in Rust or that of another 
language where the same binary-level security is not provided by the compiler.  An excerpt from page 3 of the paper makes the impact clear:</p>

<blockquote>
"We experimentally show that CFI can be bypassed using Rust/Go code for developing clearly 
more straight-forward exploits than current state-of-the-art CFI bypasses [57, 70]. Our 
exploits do not rely on respecting the statically computed Control-flow Graph (CFG) for 
bypassing the enforced CFI and are much simpler to implement. [ ... ]
Again, we stress here that in the absence of the safe part (Rust/Go code), the unsafe part 
cannot be trivially exploited."
</blockquote>

<p>
The same exact scenario above was one of the motivations for Microsoft to recently push for their
<a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/08/17/control-flow-guard-for-clang-llvm-and-rust/">Control Flow Guard (CFG) support</a>
in Clang and Rust (see the heading of "Rust linked with C/C++").
</p>

<p>As the source of the GCC plugin infrastructure in the Linux kernel and nearly all of the GCC plugins adapted
for inclusion in the upstream Linux kernel, we too immediately spotted the importance of this problem and set out
to ensure both those plugins as well as the security features built-in to GCC itself are able to instrument code
from all languages supported by the Linux kernel with compatible and consistent security properties.</p>

<h2>Funding Process</h2>

<p>So despite not expecting Rust code to land in the Linux kernel in the near future, we reached out to other 
companies as mentioned above to pull together funding for the GCC front-end effort.  None of the leads 
came to fruition, so we as a company decided to bootstrap the process, in the hopes that as progress in the work
is observed, others would join in.  Further, we wanted to offer funding under the same terms we would want as developers, 
across the entire spectrum: stability, salary, benefits, ownership, etc -- not token compensation or bounties 
that treat those working on free/open source software for the public as somehow <em>less</em> than 
developers of proprietary code.  To that end, we decided to fund the first year of a full-time
developer for the work ourselves.</p>

<p>If the failed experiment of the Core Infrastructure Initiative (<a href="https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/">CII</a>) taught us anything, it's that
one finds dedicated and competent developers for some work not among whoever happens to apply, but 
among those already involved in the work as a passion project.  This led us to reach out 
to <a href="https://thephilbert.io/">Philip Herron</a>, who we noticed was <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs">already working</a> on a GCC front-end for Rust with involvement
of external contributors.  We were extremely pleased to hear Philip was interested in performing the work 
full-time.</p>

<p>News of our outreach eventually extended to the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/steering.html">GCC Steering 
Committee</a>, who contacted us to coordinate efforts.  They were very helpful in recommending to us <a href="https://www.embecosm.com/">Embecosm</a>, a UK-based company with deep experience and involvement in 
GCC/LLVM development, among many other areas.  Embecosm graciously offered to contribute to the effort by 
handling Philip's employment and, at no cost to us, providing project management services to help ensure the project's success.  
The location, expertise, and sharing of our vision of doing right by the developer couldn't have been a 
better match.</p>

<h2>Vendor-Neutral, Developed in the Open</h2>

<p>To make sure the project remains vendor-neutral and in the public interest, Open Source Security, Inc. will not own any of the copyright over the code developed through its funding.
All relevant GCC code for the project is GPLv3-licensed and copyright is assigned, as required for upstream GCC inclusion, to the Free Software Foundation (FSF).  The work is being performed in the open, with Philip providing public monthly status updates on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/Reporting">https://github.com/Rust-GCC/Reporting</a>.  Reports are already available for the months of November and December.
</p>

<h2>Get Involved</h2>

<p>For more information about the "how" of this effort, Embecosm has prepared a 
blog at <a href="https://www.embecosm.com/2021/01/12/gcc-rust-how-it-can-be-achieved/">https://www.embecosm.com/2021/01/12/gcc-rust-how-it-can-be-achieved/</a> that we encourage 
all those interested to read.  To get involved in contributing technical work to the 
effort, Philip can be found on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/the_philbert">@the_philbert</a> or committing to the project's Github repository at <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs">https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs</a>.

    <p>This isn’t a theoretical piece about freedom and digital technologies. This is a real ongoing trend that is at best observed around secure messaging application Signal by Open Whisper Systems and it’s founder Moxie Merlinspike. His view and management of Signal reflects a wider trend that jepordises world’s freedom.</p>
<p>Signal is a secure messaging software that has changed the field a lot. Signal is built upon propriety software Textsecure and RedPhone applications that had been developed by Merlinspike and his co-founder Stuart Anderson. When Twitter acquired Whisper Systems, it releases both software under free software licenses. Merlinspike left Twitter acquired Whisper Systems, founded Open Whisper Systems and merged -once the private property of himself- TextSecure and Redphone into Signal.</p>
<p>Signal is free software. “Free as in freedom”, their client and server code is licenced under GPLv3 and AGPLv3. This makes the code and only the code itself pro-freedom. Just because the code it self free does not necessarily make the coder “free” as well and that is the problem we face today!</p>
<p>Open Whisper Systems led by Moxie Merlinspike, who is behind Signal, is and was never behind freedom. This has been seen in the light of LibreSignal (<a href="https://github.com/LibreSignal/LibreSignal/issues/37#issuecomment-217211165">https://github.com/LibreSignal/LibreSignal/issues/37#issuecomment-217211165</a>) debate where a fork of Signal client is build without unfree dependencies and published on the F-droid free software repository on Android. After much debate about federation, the claimed server resources and freedom, followed by legal trademark threats Libresignal has been removed from F-droid and so was anybody’s chance of using Signal as a secure messenger who doesn’t use Google services. <a href="https://wire.com/en/blog/axolotl-proteus-encryption-protocols/">Wire</a> case is just another example.</p>
<p>This approach is not only a threat to free software it is a recurring threat to human kind!</p>
<p>To prove this bold claim one needs to look at one recent blog post from Open Whisper Systems and a presentation made in 36C3 by Merlinspike.</p>
<p><a href="https://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/">Signal’s blog post</a>
<a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/01/02/on-privacy-versus-freedom/">Matrix’s blog Post</a></p>
<p>The main points of his claims can be listed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decentralized systems are harder to build</li>
<li>Decentralized systems are harder to evolve</li>
<li>Decentralized systems are harder to secure</li>
<li>Decentralized systems are becoming concentrated in predominant provider anyways</li>
<li>If users don’t trust their app provider they have the freedom to use something else</li>
</ul>
<p>While his claims are true up to a certain point they are only superficial. Through these points Merlinspike claims that, centralized services are superior in modern times!</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/01/02/on-privacy-versus-freedom/">anyone who is interested in the depth of this debate can start reading Martix’s answer to Merlinspike at the link here</a></p>
<p>It is really unnecessary to explain in depth why this type of thinking is dangerous when a simple change in words can tell more than 1000 page work. Let’s rename the object and compare his digital dystopia with one that has occured several times through-out analog human history and which once again recures today;</p>
<ul>
<li>Democracies are harder to build</li>
<li>Democracies are harder to improve</li>
<li>Democracies are harder to secure</li>
<li>In democracies power is becoming concentrated in predominant hands anyways</li>
<li>If people do not like their democracy provider (country) they have the freedom to leave and go another provider.</li>
</ul>
<p>One doesn’t need to think hard to see what Merlinspike is advising. He claims democracies suck because of the hardships of human organization and proposes autocracy to manage the world in favour of the helpless people occupying it. Why? Because democracies are inefficient and people don’t want that!</p>
<p>If he had given the same statement about democracies and governmental politics as he gave about federative systems it would have provoked outrage! People died for freedom, they are still dying and struggling around the globe. Then someone comes and stomps over every ideal which human society ever build up until this point in history and proclaims themselves the world leader! Think about it!</p>
<p>The example given is bad but why are Merlinspike’s claims about decentralized systems not considered bad as well? Because digital freedom has not yet been lost and won by blood or are we still asleep? Just because code is free, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the coders mind is also free! Freedom is not just a license, it is an ideal in any condition that we must stand for!</p>

    </span></p><p><em>This is a thought exercise to help explore what is okay (and what isn't) when it comes to the exchange between personal information and the provision of a personalised service.</em></p><p>Imagine you've moved to a new city and you're in need of a hairdresser to do your hair every other week. Perhaps you try out one or two different ones first, or perhaps you go with a friend's recommendation. Either way, after a short while you've settled on a hair dresser you're happy with. They're professional, they treat you well, they remember your name and you build up a relationship with them over time.</p><p>As you visit this hairdresser more often, they gain more experience with your specific hair type, your preferred hair style and your preferred hair products. Perhaps the hairdresser, knowing that you have particularly thick hair, and remembering that you dislike the way it curls around your ears when it gets too long, ensures a shorter cut in those areas by default. Or, perhaps remembering that you’re most happy when your hair has a bouncy look to it, they introduce you to a specific type of wax that helps you achieve that type of effect.</p><p>There's a direct relationship here between (1) how much the hairdresser knows about you, and remembers about you, and (2) the quality of the service you receive. The more the hairdresser knows about you, the better the service they can provide. It's convenient to you when you don't have to explain what you want every time you visit. It's valuable to you when your hairdresser knows so much about your hair and your preferences that they're able to suggest things to you you didn't even know you wanted. It can also be nice if they remember the names of your children, or if they ask about that issue you were grappling with at work the last time you stopped by.</p><p>Now imagine it’s time for your regular haircut, so you visit your trusted hairdresser. You sit down in the salon chair, as you've been doing every other week and they tell you they'll be "right with you." As you look into the mirror in front of you, you see them in the reflection walking up to the coat hanger where you've hung up your coat. Having arrived at your coat they start to insert their hand into your coat's pockets one by one. For each pocket they extract its contents (your wallet, your mobile phone, your keys <sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>) and examine each carefully, before placing them back. After having made their way through your entire coat, they return to your chair to finally tend to your needs: "So, what will it be today? The usual?"</p><p>In this real-life scenario most people would, at the very least, be astonished but hopefully also a bit angry. You might want to say: "Hey! What are you doing in my coat?" Now imagine their response being "Oh, that's just a new policy we've introduced which helps us improve our service to you. You see," they continue, "as I was examining the items in your coat, I noticed a car key with an Audi logo. One of my friends happens to be an Audi mechanic. I can put you in touch with him, if you're interested, and they can help you if your car ever breaks down. I also made note of the contacts in your phone, and if one of them ever comes in for a haircut, and I'll be sure to give them a special treatment, on the house." <sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup></p><p>Would this explanation suffice for you? Would it be sufficient justification for rummaging <sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> through your coat? Would it quench the anger you felt above?</p><p>I would hope that to most people this justification sounds silly, perhaps even patronizing and certainly not an adequate justification for rummaging through your belongings. Whether or not the hairdresser's rummaging improves his service to you doesn't matter.</p><p>The only thing that matters here is that your hairdresser has no business rummaging through your fucking coat <sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup>.</p><p>Please remember how this makes you feel. We're going to change some variables in the story and see what happens.</p><p>Let's go back to our imagined scenario. You feel offended that your hairdresser went through your coat and you say: "Hey man, I didn't agree to that!"</p><p>"Oh, I'm sorry" he replies "I didn't mean to offend you. But actually, you did consent to this new policy. You see, there's a sign at the door which says:</p><p><em>‘Anybody that walks through this door consents to their coat being rummaged through for purposes of improving our service to you.'</em></p><p>So by walking through the door, you've actually given your consent." <sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup>.</p><p>Let’s ignore, for the sake of brevity, the issue of whether walking through a door could reasonably constitute giving consent. Imagine instead that you don't catch the hairdresser rummaging through your coat, but instead they tell you their assistant will examine all your belongings while you lie back, close your eyes and have your hair washed by them with lavender shampoo.</p><p>Try to notice within yourself: Do you feel less outrage if you're not witnessing the act of someone rummaging through your coat, but you know it's happening? For me it makes it slightly more difficult to "find" the outrage inside of myself. Since I’m not witnessing the act with my own eyes, I need to first imagine it happening before I'm able to perceive any level of outrage. The outrage is still there, but it's become a bit harder to access. It's become a bit more distant if you will.</p><p>Let's continue to change variables. Let's imagine there's no assistant but the hairdresser has installed a high tech camera in the room which, without touching your coat and within a microsecond, is able to scan your coat and analyze all its contents. In doing so, it is able to extract the same information the hairdresser and their assistant were able to do when they were doing it themselves. Imagine this takes place in a split second and it happened as you sat down.</p><p>Do you feel angry about what just happened? Do you feel less outrage than before now that the violation is invisible to you, instantaneous and done through an inanimate object?</p><p>For me, I feel outrage, but it's become less visceral and more intellectual. It's as if I only feel outrage because I’m able to follow a sequence of logical steps to arrive at the conclusion that the outcomes of the camera scan and the physical rummaging are one and the same. That said, without the image of a person with their hands in my coat (imagined or not), it’s more difficult to feel outraged. It’s also harder to feel outraged when the violation is committed by an inanimate object. For one, I'm not sure who to get angry at, and I somehow feel less violated when it's a machine or an algorithm committing the act.</p><p>Now go one step further and imagine it's not even a high-tech camera doing the scanning, but some unknown technology which you cannot see and do not understand. It’s not located anywhere you can point at, it’s just “there” somewhere in the hairdresser’s salon with you as it scans the contents of your jacket.</p><p>Are you able to find any outrage at all this time? </p><p>I can still find it, but it’s even more difficult to find than before. With the camera at least I had something I could focus my anger on (and could potentially smash). Without any identifiable person or object committing these acts, the act itself seems to slowly lose the property of being something one could potentially object to.</p><p>My outrage seems to require at a minimum a crime and a perpetrator. I struggle to find those here. Only by invoking the analog equivalent from before and by imagining an actual person committing these acts do I feel outrage. But equating this last scenario to the analog equivalent feels slightly awkward; an oversimplification. As a result, the outrage doesn’t transfer fully from one scenario to the other.</p><p>By changing the process through which the information was extracted while keeping the outcome (the extracted data) the same, my outrage circuitry has almost entirely been bypassed. This was achieved by making the scenario more abstract, instantaneous, invisible and by making the actor an inanimate, unidentifiable piece of technology.</p><p>Now, one final step. Imagine we hadn't started with the analog example of the rummaging hairdresser and the emotional memory of how that made you feel. Imagine instead we would have started with the invisible, instantaneous, inanimate technology. Would you have been able to feel any outrage? Any whatsoever? Would you naturally think of coming up with an analog equivalent scenario to gauge your outrage?</p><p>You actually don't need to imagine the last example. If you're currently using WhatsApp, you're living inside of it. The hairdresser represents Facebook and the coat rummaging policy represents their new privacy policy, or Facebook's general conduct for that matter. If you don't feel outrage, then perhaps that's because you haven't imagined the analog equivalent of what's happening yet (which isn't always self-evident, that’s what I’ve tried to help you with here) <sup id="fnref-6"><a href="#fn-6">6</a></sup>.</p><p>The key observation to note here is that the outrage that gets triggered inside of you gets modulated by <em>the manner in which</em> your information gets extracted, not so much <em>if</em> it gets extracted. It's as if robbing someone of $100 would somehow be less outrageous if you did it through the internet rather than snatching it directly from their wallet.</p><p>In a high-tech society, where we’re surrounded by technological abstractions upon abstractions, should we only be relying on our instinctual outrage circuits to be our moral compasses when they can so easily be fooled?</p><p><em>Even though the hairdresser in this story (Facebook / WhatsApp) is rummaging through your coat, there are many reputable hairdressers (messaging services) that do not. My favourite alternative is <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> <sup id="fnref-7"><a href="#fn-7">7</a></sup>, but I've heard good things about <a href="https://threema.ch/">Threema</a> and although I don't get the impression the technology is accessible enough to port my friends and family, I'm supportive of what <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a> is trying to accomplish.</em></p></div></article></div>]]>

Nearly every culture has stories to tell about people who lived for thousands of years, showing that extending lifespan has always been one a deep desire across humanity. While modern medicine does not strive to find the fountain of youth, keen interest in promoting longevity has prompted research into the mechanisms of aging and the possibility of anti-aging drugs. Researchers now know that mitochondria play an important role in aging. Specifically, when mitochondria are harmed in some way and their function is impaired, a process called mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR<sup>mt</sup>) occurs that repairs mitochondria and benefits cell survival. Therefore, some scientists think it is possible to increase lifespan by identifying drugs that activate UPR<sup>mt</sup>.</p><p>Dr. Eriko Kage-Nakadai and her colleagues from Osaka City University in Japan are one of the many research teams fascinated by aging research. As Dr. Kage-Nakadai explains, “<em>Even though aging is not a disease, drugs may slow down aging and mitigate or prevent its negative effects on our health.” </em>Current research shows promising signs. Experiments with <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em>—a worm commonly used in biological research as a model—have found several compounds that increase the worm’s lifespan by triggering UPR<sup>mt</sup>.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Against the backdrop of these previous studies, this team, in their <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10522-020-09907-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new study published in <em>Biogerontology</em></a><em>,</em> screened about 3,000 drugs in worms that are engineered to glow if drug treatment activates <em>hsp-6</em>, a gene that is highly expressed when UPR<sup>mt</sup> occurs. It is interesting to note that of these 3000 drugs, 1300 were off-patent drugs approved by the USFDA, EMA, and other agencies, and the remaining 1700 were unapproved bioactive ones.</p><p>Through this method, Dr. Kage-Nakadai’s team identified metolazone, a drug used to treat heart failure and high blood pressure. They then tested the drug on <em>C. elegans </em>and found that it increased wild-type worm lifespan. Additionally, they found that metolazone did not extend lifespans in worms in whom the genes <em>atfs-1, ubl-5, </em>and <em>nkcc-1</em> were mutated (non-working). The former two genes are known to be essential for UPR<sup>mt</sup> function, suggesting that metolazone is acting on the UPR<sup>mt</sup> pathway. The third gene, <em>nkcc-1</em>, “encodes” a protein that is part of a protein family targeted by metolazone in its usual function as an anti-hypertension drug. The fact that metolazone did not increase the lifespans of <em>nkcc-1</em> mutated <em>C. elegans </em>suggests that the drug may need to block the <em>nkcc-1</em> protein to activate the UPR<sup>mt</sup> pathway. Furthermore, metolazone “induced” <em>hsp-6 </em>(<em>Hspa9</em> in humans) expression in HeLa cells (a human cell line commonly used in biological research), suggesting that the drug’s UPR<sup>mt</sup>-related effects possibly span multiple species.</p></div></div><div><figure><p><img width="438" height="297" src="https://www.impact.science/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/FIGURE_1_OSAKC_3-e1609992340163.jpg" data-src="https://www.impact.science/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/FIGURE_1_OSAKC_3-e1609992340163.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" data-srcset="https://www.impact.science/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/FIGURE_1_OSAKC_3-e1609992340163.jpg 438w, https://www.impact.science/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/FIGURE_1_OSAKC_3-e1609992340163-300x203.jpg 300w" data-sizes="(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px" srcset="https://www.impact.science/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/FIGURE_1_OSAKC_3-e1609992340163.jpg 438w, https://www.impact.science/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/FIGURE_1_OSAKC_3-e1609992340163-300x203.jpg 300w"></p></figure></div><div><p>Scientists found that <em>C. elegans</em> administered metolazone lived longer than those that were not given the drug. This suggests that metolazone, despite being an anti-hypertension drug, can be used in anti-aging research | Image courtesy: Eriko Kage-Nakadai, Osaka City University</p></div><div><div><p>When asked about the broader significance of her work, Dr. Kage-Nakadai comments, <em>“What is particularly exciting is that we tested already available approved drugs here, and we have revealed the potential of repurposing existing drugs for aging control. Worms always give us many hints.”</em></p><p>As the researchers state, this work is just the start, but it opens up a new road to a future of anti-aging drugs.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It started as an outright clone, later evolved on its own, quite interesting way. I’m talking of Weibo.</p>
<p>Weibo started in 2009, and a year later already had 100 million users. Chinese people are very online, and they very much enjoy the sort of casual, easy dopamine release that comes from microblogging. The Japanese are also avid Twitter users, incidentally, while they never had much of a blogosphere. The language also helps: 150 Chinese characters amount to about triple that in English, so you can say quite a lot.</p>
<p>As usual in China, there’s little regulations, and little enforcement of existing regulations, so once Weibo came in it was very free and open. It was the first national forum of public opinion that the Chinese had ever seen. It became huge almost instantly, and of course the most popular part of it was political debate. Everyone and their mother had become a political pundit on Weibo, rather amusingly forgetting they lived in a Communist single-party state. For a couple years people shat on their mayors, their governors, this or that politician, this or that policy, or even the Communist party itself. The American Embassy joined the party with their famous Air Quality reports (at the time air quality in China was really awful and the government refused to release figures), which were promptly retweeted by 300 million boomers with added comments on how much better America was at everything.</p>
<p>Well that situation couldn’t last. China was at the moment undergoing a rather big leadership transition (Xi Jinping assumed power in late 2012), so the massive agitation going on at Weibo went on undeterred. But governments, certainly the Chinese government, might be slow, but once they get moving they’re unrelenting. In 2013 China decided to crack down on free speech on Weibo, and crack down they did. Famous accounts which had been too edgy politically got visits by police, if not outright arrested. Some were jailed, others had to make public proclamations of loyalty to Socialist values. We’re talking of people with tens of millions of followers; China is a big country.</p>
<p>Once the big guys were dealt with pour encourager les autres, the masses were targeted with the beginning stages of what has now become a very sophisticated apparatus of keyword censorship. In Weibo today you just can’t search what you want. If there’s a rumor that Xi Jinping has farted this morning, the word “fart”, “frt”, “f4rt” and all permutations that might come up are all promptly banned from searching at any sizable Chinese social media. That’s step 1: stop the thing from going viral. Step 2 is deleting already existing mentions of the fart. The thing. That takes time but they have an army of censors (which Weibo was forced to hire at their expense) to take care of that. Step 3 is banning you from tweeting about the fart, but that’s a last resort, as it’s the most annoying and harder to implement.</p>
<p>Soon enough Weibo just became unusable. Most people up there were on the platform precisely to shitpost on politics, to be edgy, to shit on the government, to be a viral pundit, retweeted by 50 million people at least once in their lives. The new regulations were so oppressive that most people just left. Not to some other similar platform. There had been some at the beginning but they all lagged off and eventually were killed, and the government wouldn’t allow a new microblogging site. When Weibo was censored people just left, period. They abandoned the public square. They mostly retreated to WeChat, the national instant messaging app. Some didn’t get the message and started being edgy on their public statuses, but most just retreated to private chat groups, where they could be safe from the prying eyes of government. The public square was killed, on purpose, and it never recovered.</p>
<p>Well, not quite. After politics were banned from Weibo, only the most inane stuff was allowed to remain. Mostly celebrities and PR accounts, and the odd clueless boomer. But it’s been years now, so plenty of people who need an easy internet exposure but have no intention to talk politics are still on Weibo, many producing quite decent content. A lot of aspiring intellectuals have also learned what is politically correct and what not and have managed to survive. Plenty still get banned mercilessly after some innocent mishap though, as Carl Zha (by all indications a paid propagandist for the government) who lost 10 million followers after dissing some Chinese fighter jet or something. But the platform is lively again, if in a more boring, sanitized way. Half a generation of youngsters have grown up without knowing what legal shitposting was like, and so just don’t do it. You can’t miss what you’ve never known.</p>
<p>Now, America isn’t China, so there’s no guarantee that the situation will evolve in the same way. Maybe Parler or Gab manage to survive the multi-pronged assault by every single part of the tech stack, and they thrive as a hotbed of right wing activism. I don’t find it very likely though. I see Twitter becoming a sanitized platform where only government-approved speech is allowed, and most people will be fine with that. I’ll stay on Twitter if only to follow a bunch of academic linguists who I find interesting. Also Japanese Twitter has its charm, as Twitter censorship is much, much weaker in exotic languages.</p>
<p>So to recap: I think we should do what the Chinese did, which is retreat to private groups. So go to Telegram, to Urbit if you’re smart.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Anti-cheat development is, by nature, reactive; anti-cheats exist to respond to and thwart a videogame’s population of cheaters. For instance, a videogame with an exceedingly low amount of cheaters would have little need for an anti-cheat, while a videogame rife with cheaters would have a clear need for an anti-cheat. In order to catch cheaters, anti-cheats will employ as many methods as possible. Unfortunately, anti-cheats are not omniscient; they can not know of every single method or detection vector to catch cheaters. Likewise, the game hacks themselves must continue to discover new or unique methods in order to evade anti-cheats.</p><h2 id="the-reactive-development-cycle-of-game-hacking"> <a href="#the-reactive-development-cycle-of-game-hacking">The Reactive Development Cycle of Game Hacking</a></h2><p>This brings forth a reactive and continuous development cycle, for both the cheats and anti-cheats: the opposite party (cheat or anti-cheat) will employ a unique method to circumvent the adjacent party (anti-cheat or cheat) which, in response, will then do the same.</p><p>One such method employed by an increasing number of anti-cheats is to execute core anti-cheat functions from within the operating system’s kernel. A clear advantage over the alternative (i.e. usermode execution) is in the fact that, on Windows NT systems, the anti-cheat can selectively filter which processes are able to interact with the memory of the game process in which they are protecting, thus nullifying a plethora of methods used by game hacks.</p><p>In response to this, many (but not all) hack developers made (or are making) the decision to do the same; they too would, or will, execute their hack, either wholly or in part, from within the operating system’s kernel, thus nullifying what the anti-cheats had done.</p><p>Unlike with anti-cheats, however, this decision carries with it numerous concessions: namely, the fact that, for various reasons, it is most convenient (or it is only practical) to execute the hack as an unsigned kernel driver running without the kernel’s knowledge; the “driver” is typically a region of executable memory in the kernel’s address space and is never loaded or allocated by the kernel. In other words, it is a “manually-mapped” driver, loaded by a tool used by a game hack.</p><p>This ultimately provides anti-cheats with many opportunities to detect so-called “kernel-mode” or “ring 0” game hacks (noting that those terms are typically said with a marketable significance; they are literally used to market such game hacks, as if to imply robustness or security); if the anti-cheat can prove that the system is executing, or had executed, unsigned code, it can then potentially flag a user as being a cheater.</p><h3 id="analyzing-a-threads-kernel-stack"> <a href="#analyzing-a-threads-kernel-stack">Analyzing a Thread’s Kernel Stack</a></h3><p>One such method - the focus of this article, in fact - of detecting unsigned code execution in the kernel is to iterate each thread that is running in the system (optionally deciding to only iterate threads associated with the system process, i.e. system threads) and to initiate some kind of stack trace.</p><p>Bluntly, this allows the anti-cheat to quite effectively determine if a cheat were executing unsigned code. For example, some anti-cheats (e.g. BattlEye) will queue to each system thread an APC which will then initiate a stack trace. If the stack trace returns an instruction pointer that is not within the confines of any loaded kernel driver, the anti-cheat can then know that it may have encountered a system thread that is executing unsigned code. Furthermore, because it is a stack trace and not a direct sampling of the return instruction pointer, it would work quite reliably, even if a game hack were, for example, executing a spin-loop or continuous wait; the stack trace would always lead back to the unsigned code.</p><p>It is quite clear to any cheat developer that they can respond to this behavior by simply running their thread(s) with kernel APCs disabled, preventing delivery of such APCs and avoiding the detection vector. As is will be seen, however, this method does not entirely prevent detection of unsigned code execution.</p><h3 id="copying-out-then-analyzing-a-threads-kernel-stack"> <a href="#copying-out-then-analyzing-a-threads-kernel-stack">(Copying Out, Then) Analyzing a Thread’s Kernel Stack</a></h3><p>Certain anti-cheats - EasyAntiCheat, in particular - had a much more apt method of generating a pseudo-stacktrace: instead of generating a stack trace with a blockable APC, why not copy the contents of the thread’s kernel stack asynchronously? Continuing the reactive cheat-anti-cheat development cycle, EasyAntiCheat had opted to manually search for instances of nonpaged code pointers that may have been left behind as a result of system thread execution.</p><p>While the downsides of this method are debatable, the upside is quite clear: as long as the thread is making procedure calls (e.g. x86 call instruction) from within its own code, either to kernel routines or to its own, and regardless of its IRQL or if the thread is even running, its execution will leave behind detectable traces on its stack in the form of pointers to its own code which can be extracted and analyzed.</p><h2 id="callouts-continuing-the-reactive-development-cycle"> <a href="#callouts-continuing-the-reactive-development-cycle">Callouts: Continuing The Reactive Development Cycle</a></h2><p>Proposed is the “callout” method of system thread execution, born from the recognition that:</p><ol><li>A thread’s kernel stack, as identified by the kernel stack pointer in a thread’s ETHREAD object, can be analyzed asynchronously by a potential anti-cheat to detect traces of unsigned code execution; and that</li><li>To be useful in most cases, a system thread must be able to make calls to most external NT kernel or executive procedures with little compromise.</li></ol><h3 id="the-life-cycle-of-the-callout-thread"> <a href="#the-life-cycle-of-the-callout-thread">The Life-cycle of the Callout Thread</a></h3><p>The life-cycle of a callout thread is quite simple and can be used to demonstrate its implementation:</p><ul><li>Before thread creation:<ul><li>Allocate a non-paged stack to be loaded by the thread; the callout thread’s “real stack”</li><li>Allocate shellcode (ideally in executable memory not associated with the main driver module) which disables interrupts, preserves the old/kernel stack pointer (as it was on function entry), loads the real stack, and jumps to an initialization routine (the callout thread’s “bootstrap routine”)</li><li>Create a system thread (i.e. PsCreateSystemThread) whose start address points to the initialization shellcode</li></ul></li><li>At thread entry (i.e. the bootstrap routine):<ul><li>Preserve the stack pointer that had been given to the thread at thread entry (this must be given by the shellcode)</li><li>(Optionally) Iterate the thread’s old/kernel stack pointer, ceasing iteration at the stack base, eliminating any references/pointers to the initialization shellcode</li><li>(Optionally) Eliminate references to the initialization shellcode within the thread’s ETHREAD; for example, it may be worth changing the thread’s start address</li><li>(Optionally, but recommended) Free the memory containing the initialization shellcode, if it was allocated separately from the driver module</li><li>Proceed to thread execution</li></ul></li></ul><p>In clearer terms, the callout thread spends most of its time executing the driver’s unsigned code with interrupts disabled and with its own kernel stack - the real stack. It can also attempt to wipe any other traces of its execution which may have been present upon its creation.</p><h3 id="the-usefulness-of-the-callout-thread"> <a href="#the-usefulness-of-the-callout-thread">The Usefulness of the Callout Thread</a></h3><p>The callout thread must also be capable of executing most, if not all, NT kernel and executive procedures. As proposed, this is effectively impossible; the thread must run with interrupts disabled and with its own stack, thus creating an obvious problem as most procedures of interest would run at an IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL. Furthermore, the NT IRQL model may be liable to ignore our setting of the interrupt flag, causing most routines to unpredictibly enter a deadlock or enable interrupts without our consent.</p><p>A mechanism to allow for a callout thread to invoke these routines of interest, the callout mechanism, is therefore used to:</p><ol><li>Provide a routine which can be used to conveniently invoke (“call out”) an external function; and in this routine,</li><li>Load the thread’s original/kernel stack pointer;</li><li>Copy function arguments on to the kernel thread’s stack from the real stack;</li><li>Enable interrupts;</li><li>Invoke the requested routine (within the same instruction boundary as when interrupts are enabled);</li><li>Cleanly return from the routine without generating obvious stack traces (e.g. function pointers);</li><li>Load the real stack pointer and disable the interrupt flag, and do so before returning to unsigned code; and</li><li>Continue execution, preserving the function’s return value</li></ol><p>While somewhat complicated, the callout mechanism can be achieved easily and, to a reasonable degree, portably, using two widely-available ROP gadgets from within the NT kernel.</p><h3 id="the-usefulness-of-iretq"> <a href="#the-usefulness-of-iretq">The Usefulness of IRET(Q)</a></h3><p>The constraint of needing to load a new stack pointer, interrupt flag, and interrupt pointer within an instruction boundary was immediately satisfied by the IRET instruction.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, the IRET (lit. “interrupt return”) instruction is intended to be used by an operating system or executive (here, the NT kernel) to return from an interrupt routine. To support the recognition of an interrupt from any mode of execution, and to generically resume to any mode of execution, the processor will need to (effectively) preserve the instruction pointer, stack pointer, CPL or privilege level (through the CS and SS selectors; and while they have a more general use-case, this is effectively what is preserved on most operating systems with a flat memory model), and RFLAGS register (as interrupts may be liable to modify certain flags).</p><p>To report this information to the OS interrupt handler, the CPU will, in a specific order:</p><ol><li>Push the SS (stack segment selector) register;</li><li>Push the RSP (stack pointer) register;</li><li>Push the RFLAGS (arithmetic/system flags) register;</li><li>Push the CS (code segment selector) register;</li><li>Push the RIP (instruction pointer) register; and, for some exception-class interrupts,</li><li>Push an error code which may describe certain interrupt conditions (e.g. a page fault will know if the fault was caused by a non-present page, or if it were caused by a protection violation)</li></ol><p>Note that the error code is not important to the CPU and must be accounted for by the interrupt handler. Each operation is an 8-byte push, …</p></div></div>

It’s a blunt but powerful tool for punishing people who would use your platform to incite violence or commit other crimes. But building healthy, happy communities requires much more than removing their worst users. You don’t have a healthy media ecosystem just because Donald Trump no longer dominates it.</p><p>With that in mind —&nbsp;and in an effort to turn our attention to some constructive ideas after a terrifying week —&nbsp;today I want to talk about an effort to design better digital spaces. For those of you who work on platforms, or hope to someday, I hope it will spark a sense of what else could be possible in your work. And for those of us who live and work on these platforms, I hope the ideas shared here give us a better sense of what we could and should demand from the digital world. </p><p>The ideas come from <a href="https://newpublic.org/">Civic Signals</a>, a new nonprofit organization dedicated to building “flourishing, public-friendly digital spaces.” It’s led by Eli Pariser, author of the 2011 bestseller <em>The Filter Bubble</em> and the co-founder of Upworthy; and Talia Stroud, director of the Center for Media Engagement at the University of Texas at Austin. For the past two years, they led an inquiry into what makes for good digital spaces. And on Tuesday, the first day of their inaugural <a href="https://newpublic.org/festival">New Public Festival</a>, they released the results of their research. (<a href="https://newpublic.org/signals">You can find it all here</a>.)</p><p>The research began with the observation that in the offline world, healthy communities have traditionally been served by thriving public spaces: town squares, libraries, parks, and so on. Like digital social networks, these spaces are open to all. But unlike those networks, they are owned by the community rather than a corporation. As you would expect, that difference results in a very different experience for the user.</p><p>Public spaces display a number of features that build healthier communities, according to researchers. “Humans have designed spaces for public life for millennia,” they write, “and there are lessons here that can be helpful for digital life.”</p><p>Here’s a list&nbsp;(emphasis theirs). These spaces:</p><blockquote><ul><li><p>Develop <strong>programming</strong> – social activities – that draw different groups in, without over-optimizing for any one group</p></li><li><p>Offer visual <strong>cues as to what kinds of behavior are invited</strong> in the space</p></li><li><p>Are designed to be physically accessible and <strong>attractive to many different populations</strong></p></li><li><p>Engage <strong>stewards, leaders, and maintainers</strong> who can do the labor of community-building&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Are designed in <strong>partnership with the communities that use them</strong>.</p></li></ul></blockquote><p>Save for the third bullet point on that list, these are not features that I would associate with any of our largest social platforms. And that begins to explain, I think, the rot we find throughout them. Giant, rudderless communities left to imagine for themselves what they ought to do on a platform, or how they ought to behave, often turn on one another. </p><p>Imagine if a Facebook, or a Reddit, or a YouTube offered actual programming to these communities —&nbsp;constructive, creative tasks that go beyond individual fundraisers or the creation of content. Would they not wind up with services that they were more proud of? </p><p>It’s relatively easy to imagine what this might look like. Over the past couple of months, I’ve been captivated by the story of <a href="https://variety.com/2021/legit/news/ratatouille-musical-actors-fund-1234881445/">the TikTok users who took it upon themselves to write a musical inspired by the Pixar film </a><em><a href="https://variety.com/2021/legit/news/ratatouille-musical-actors-fund-1234881445/">Ratatouille</a></em>. It happened spontaneously — and raised $1.9 million for the Actors Fund —&nbsp;but there’s no reason other platforms couldn’t similarly goad their users into creativity, philanthropy, or other ends more compelling than the traditional like, comment, and share.</p><p>On Monday, I attended a virtual briefing with Pariser and Stroud to learn about their findings. While they began with drawing analogies to the physical world, their research ultimately explored the possibilities contained within digital-only spaces as well. Ultimately, the team identified 14 design principles for building better digital spaces. The principles are grouped into four categories:</p><ul><li><p>Welcoming new users to the space and to conversations within it.</p></li><li><p>Helping people to understand the world.</p></li><li><p>Connecting people across hierarchies and divides.</p></li><li><p>Enabling people to act together.</p></li></ul><p>What I love about these principles is that they take a point of view on human behavior. Facebook’s mission “to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together” reads somewhat similar to the bullet points above, but is ultimately much less prescriptive about how the network ought to be used. The same could be said of Twitter’s mission to “serve the public conversation.”</p><p>The centerpiece of the Civic Signals research is a survey of more than 10,000 platform “super users” around the world about how well they believe existing social networks live up to the design principles identified in the research. The results are a mixed bag, as you would expect —&nbsp;Facebook ranked high for cultivating a sense of belonging and inviting everyone to participate, but low for showing people reliable information or ensuring people’s safety. Twitter ranked high on building bridges between groups, but low for showing reliable information.</p><p>For Pariser and Stroud, the lesson is that better digital spaces are both necessary and possible. The question is whether the principles they’ve identified can be incorporated into existing platforms, or will need to be baked into a new project from scratch. And should that new project be a traditional venture-backed startup, or a digital public space managed by a government or nonprofit community? </p><p>When I asked them, they told me that they welcome experimentation. “We need private actors <em>and</em> more public platforms if we want all these needs to be met,” Pariser told me. </p><p>But perhaps because none has yet succeeded on a grand scale, it’s the prospect of a public digital space that intrigues me the most. It intrigues Pariser, too. </p><p>“If you look at physical communities, there’s a reason that libraries are libraries and not venture-backed bookstores,” Pariser said. “They do different things. And those functions are really important as well.”</p><p>Stroud noted that no existing platform had performed well across the board in its survey, suggesting that there could be significant demand for the sort of spaces envisioned by Civic Signals.</p><p>“And some of these are really base-level things that you would want in a space,” Stroud said. Things like protecting users’ safety, or their data, or simply making them feel welcome when they join. “I think there’s a lot of opportunity for innovation.”</p><p>The New Public Festival continues online Wednesday and Thursday.

For most of us, that’s not a big deal. We have our whole lives ahead of us to work, so taking a few months off to “find yourself” can be completely justifiable.</p><p>Well, let’s just say that wasn’t the case for me.</p><p>I spent sleepless nights scouring job postings for any company that might be interested in what little I had to offer. I smacked that “Upload Resume” button around like it was my arch nemesis, but made sure to carefully upload the proper file format before doing so.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A01-Uploading-Resume.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A01-Uploading-Resume.png" alt="upload PDF for resume" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A01-Uploading-Resume.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A01-Uploading-Resume-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A01-Uploading-Resume-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A01-Uploading-Resume-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A01-Uploading-Resume-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>My days consisted of nothing but napping, eating, uploading, and submitting. To put it mildly, I was in a state of panic to find some sort of work.</p><p>Some might have viewed this obsessive job search as an impressive character trait. It may have masqueraded as a signal of ambition, an indicator that I was a guy that had his priorities straight.</p><p>The truth, however, was far from that. I wasn’t driven by some magnificent search for purpose, or the nagging desire to provide value to society. I was driven by something far less chivalrous:</p><p>My intense, terrifying fear of being homeless.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A02-Thinking-of-Homelessness.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A02-Thinking-of-Homelessness.png" alt="fear of homelessness" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A02-Thinking-of-Homelessness.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A02-Thinking-of-Homelessness-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A02-Thinking-of-Homelessness-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A02-Thinking-of-Homelessness-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A02-Thinking-of-Homelessness-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>For the longest time, this fear is what drove my panicked desire to find stable, well-paying work (regardless of how <a href="https://moretothat.com/pointless-job/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pointless it was</a>). I thought that as long as I could save some money with each paycheck, I wouldn’t have to sleep in the streets if something went awry.</p><p>Some of you may understand this fear, while others may view it as deeply irrational. I know people from wealthy backgrounds who have this fear, and people raised on welfare that don’t. My family didn’t have much money growing up, but that doesn’t quite justify the existence of this strain of fright.</p><p>Regardless of its origin, this fear was very much alive in me throughout my twenties, and it framed my perspective of money. Instead of viewing money as a generator of wealth, I saw it as an immediate safety net that (barely) kept me away from living on freeway on-ramps. The more of it I had, the more relief and distance it gave me from the streets.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A03-Safety-Net.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A03-Safety-Net.png" alt="falling into money safety net" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A03-Safety-Net.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A03-Safety-Net-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A03-Safety-Net-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A03-Safety-Net-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A03-Safety-Net-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>Well, many years have passed since then, and fortunately, I no longer have this fear.<span title="It took some time and life experience to reshape this perspective, but chief among them was the realization that being homeless was more about the poverty of love than the absence of money. As the bonds with my loved ones strengthened and took shape, this truth grew apparent and faded that fear out of my mind.">1</span> However, that doesn’t mean that I no longer think about money. It’s the <a href="https://moretothat.com/how-money-forever-changed-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">greatest story humanity has ever subscribed to</a>, so it will always be a central character in the theater of everyday life. What has changed isn’t money itself, but the way in which it colors the way I view the world.</p><p>Life is almost always a framing problem, and wealth is no exception to this. To say that money is complicated is a cliche worthy of a thousand eye rolls, but when it comes to our ongoing relationship with it, I find that it’s quite simple to explain and distill. At any given moment, our journey falls along a vertical spectrum with three main phases:</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B01-The-Money-Spectrum-smaller.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B01-The-Money-Spectrum-smaller.png" alt="more to that - the money spectrum" width="1500" height="1820" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B01-The-Money-Spectrum-smaller.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B01-The-Money-Spectrum-smaller-247x300.png 247w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B01-The-Money-Spectrum-smaller-844x1024.png 844w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B01-The-Money-Spectrum-smaller-768x932.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B01-The-Money-Spectrum-smaller-1266x1536.png 1266w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B01-The-Money-Spectrum-smaller-610x740.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>This is what I call <span>The Money Spectrum</span>, and it represents the wide variety of views we have about the almighty dollar/euro/whatever throughout our lives. Money can be a difficult thing to talk about because it invokes a blend of weird emotions, and this amorphous slushie of feelings can be hard to express through the crude tool of language.</p><p>The purpose of the Money Spectrum is to take this formless slushie and build it into a concrete model that we can all understand. The first step to solving a problem is to articulate it clearly, and that’s what this spectrum is here to do.</p><p>Each of the three phases represent a specific purpose money has for us, with Phase 1 being the ground level of this journey up the tower. We will go into what each of these three phases are soon, but before we do, keep in mind that this is a spectrum, meaning that we will find ourselves sliding along the scale at any time.</p><p>It’s entirely possible that someone will be 100% immersed in Phase 1, but it’s more likely that they will be closer to Phase 1 than Phase 2, and will share characteristics of both areas. This is an important distinction that we will make later on in this post, but for now, remember that our relationship with things are rarely absolutes, and money is no exception to this rule.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A04-Everything-is-a-spectrum.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A04-Everything-is-a-spectrum.png" alt="everything is a spectrum" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A04-Everything-is-a-spectrum.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A04-Everything-is-a-spectrum-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A04-Everything-is-a-spectrum-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A04-Everything-is-a-spectrum-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A04-Everything-is-a-spectrum-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>Let’s begin our journey up the Money Spectrum with this question: when you take a look at your bank account balance, what do you feel?</p><p>Well, if you’re a part of the 28% of Americans that have <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/banking/savings/financial-security-june-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">no emergency savings whatsoever</a>, the answer to that question will likely be a combination of fear and anxiety. When the sole purpose of money is to provide for the basic necessities of life, then your relationship with it will be a shaky one. Scarcity creates fragility, and it is this situation that opens the doors to Phase #1.</p><h3>Phase #1: Survival</h3><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B02-Entrance-to-Phase-1.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B02-Entrance-to-Phase-1.png" alt="Phase 1 - Survival" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B02-Entrance-to-Phase-1.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B02-Entrance-to-Phase-1-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B02-Entrance-to-Phase-1-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B02-Entrance-to-Phase-1-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B02-Entrance-to-Phase-1-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>One might say that we all share some space in this part of the spectrum. Ultimately, all the necessities of life require payment of some kind: the food we put in our mouths, the clothes we walk around in, the roof over our heads, etc. Without money we wouldn’t have any of these things, so it’s fair to say that it is a requisite of survival for all of us, right?</p><p>Well, not quite.</p><p>While it’s true that money is required to have these basic necessities, that doesn’t mean that we all fear the loss of these necessities equally. A low-income household and an upper middle-class family may both rent property, but the former may worry incessantly about next month’s payment, while the latter may not. Both understand the importance of money, but have different ideas of how their survival could be impacted by the lack of it.</p><p>The difficult thing about the word “survival” is how subjective it tends to be, as humans are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">more reactive to loss than to gain</a>. If a billionaire experienced a sudden reversal in fortune and couldn’t afford his ten-bedroom house anymore, it’s quite possible that he’d say his very survival was being threatened.</p><p>To remove this fog of subjectivity, let’s zoom in on the Survival part of the spectrum and break it down. When I use the word “survival” in this post, I’m simply referring to one’s ability to exist and to have one’s health. In the illustration below, I’ve separated the section out into its smaller constituents, with the level of poverty increasing the lower you go.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B03-Subsections-of-Phase-1.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B03-Subsections-of-Phase-1.png" alt="the stages of survival" width="1500" height="1520" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B03-Subsections-of-Phase-1.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B03-Subsections-of-Phase-1-296x300.png 296w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B03-Subsections-of-Phase-1-1011x1024.png 1011w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B03-Subsections-of-Phase-1-768x778.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B03-Subsections-of-Phase-1-610x618.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>At the lowest level, you have no money or access to food, and you are literally starving to death. This is more likely a function of national/civic infrastructure than an individual’s lack of money, as this is quite rare in any first-world country. However, it is still largely a function of having no fiscal resources, and this is the worst place one can find themselves in as a result of that.</p><p>A step up would be the lack of shelter, or homelessness. This is where one’s fears regarding survival can start feeling real, despite the fact that they are probably nowhere near it (my own fear was a good example of this). This likely happens because most of us are vividly familiar with the problem of homelessness, and have grown up seeing real-life evidence of it everywhere.</p><p>I have clear childhood memories of my parents interacting with the homeless, and you probably do as well. Homelessness is an ever-present window into the difficulties of the human condition, and it reminds you of what can be possible when things go wrong. When we think about our survival being threatened, this familiar sight is where the mind can point to, regardless of how distant that place actually is.</p><p>The next few steps up the spectrum have to do with one’s idea of survival once they have their basic necessities (food/water, shelter, and clothing). Survival is no longer a relentless exercise in acquiring these necessities, but more so a strong commitment in maintaining them. And of course, the fuel that keeps the resource engine running is money.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B04-Money-as-fuel-for-basic-necessities.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B04-Money-as-fuel-for-basic-necessities.png" alt="money fuels basic necessities" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B04-Money-as-fuel-for-basic-necessities.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B04-Money-as-fuel-for-basic-necessities-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B04-Money-as-fuel-for-basic-necessities-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B04-Money-as-fuel-for-basic-necessities-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B04-Money-as-fuel-for-basic-necessities-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>In order to sustain the health of oneself and one’s family, a consistent stream of income is needed, and this generally comes in the form of paid employment. Keep in mind that toward the upper-end of the Survival phase, you are no longer fighting for existence; you are fighting for preservation. You want the flow of money to be predictable, something you can count on every few weeks to sustain the level of basic resources you need.</p><p>A job provides this sense of security, and when you view money as a means for survival, holding this job is all that matters. It doesn’t matter how much you hate your job or how terrible the working conditions may be; as long as the number of hours you work result in a predictable deposit amount, you’ll succumb to it.</p><p>But if this pattern continues and time runs in your favor, there’s a point in which the lines between the Survival phase and Phase #2 (which I’ll reveal shortly) start getting blurry.</p><p>At what point does your job provide you with enough money to feel a sense of security? Is it when you’re no longer living paycheck-to-paycheck and you’re able to save some money each month? If that’s the case, what do your savings have to look like for you to feel a sense of relief? $2,000? $10,000? $30,000?</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B05-Savings-in-Phase-1.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B05-Savings-in-Phase-1.png" alt="how much savings is enough" width="1500" height="1520" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B05-Savings-in-Phase-1.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B05-Savings-in-Phase-1-296x300.png 296w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B05-Savings-in-Phase-1-1011x1024.png 1011w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B05-Savings-in-Phase-1-768x778.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B05-Savings-in-Phase-1-610x618.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>Toward the upper end of this phase, survival becomes more about your mindset and less about your reality. You are well past the place where you risk sleeping in the streets, but you may continue to operate under the belief that it could happen at any time. This traps you into a limited way of thinking, and paralyzes your potential for growth.</p><p>When you’re in a survival mindset, you will always feel like you’re barely holding onto what you have. Whether that’s $1,000 or $100,000, nothing you have can adequately push away the fears you have about sliding down the spectrum. This may be the result of parental conditioning, personal experience, or any number of reasons, but the longer you view money as a means for survival, the less willing you will be to take the risks required to lead a fulfilling life.</p><p>Risk is usually accompanied with the emotion of fear, and if you’re operating on survival mode, you will be scared to do anything uncertain, no matter how small that risk actually is:</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/E01-Fear-vs-Risk-in-Survival-Mode.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/E01-Fear-vs-Risk-in-Survival-Mode.png" alt="high survival - high fear" width="1500" height="1500" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/E01-Fear-vs-Risk-in-Survival-Mode.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/E01-Fear-vs-Risk-in-Survival-Mode-300x300.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/E01-Fear-vs-Risk-in-Survival-Mode-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/E01-Fear-vs-Risk-in-Survival-Mode-150x150.png 150w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/E01-Fear-vs-Risk-in-Survival-Mode-768x768.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/E01-Fear-vs-Risk-in-Survival-Mode-610x610.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>With this level of consistent fear, you won’t do anything outside of your comfort zone.

				<p>So my last blog post, <a href="https://patrobinson.github.io/2016/11/05/docker-in-production/">Docker in Production: A retort</a>, generated a lot of comments. One of them was “Why shouldn’t you run a Database in Docker?” I’ve seen this questions a few times, but rarely reply because it’s such a long answer. But here goes.</p>

<p>EDIT: I’ve been made aware I’m not being clear that I am referring to running a database in a container management solution, like Kubernetes. The issues laid out below don’t relate to just running your database in docker with no shared storage or ability to start it automatically on a different node.</p>

<h2 id="kelsey-hightower-told-you-not-to">Kelsey Hightower told you not to</h2>

<p>He’s a smart guy, he’s worked at CoreOS and now works at Google. He has done some fantastic talks on Docker, Kubernetes and System Administration in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/Nosa5-xcATw?t=1080">Here’s him talking about it</a></p>

<h2 id="distributed-systems-are-hard">Distributed systems are hard</h2>

<p>Like really hard. But that’s ok when your application is stateless, because when it all goes to shit you just reboot things and they magically get better. But when your database gets fubar you can end up with permanent corruption. The most complex part of a distributed system is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance#The_Byzantine_Generals.27_Problem">Byzantine Generals problem</a>, which describes the problem of how we determine what is the source of truth and how do we know for certain it is the only source of truth. There are various solutions to this problem, usually implemented in the storage engine of databases. Some databases do this well, mostly NoSQL databases where it’s possible to shard data across multiple nodes by not supporting a JOIN operation. Traditional relational databases do not do this well, they generally only work  in a master-slave configuration. There are ways to run them in master-master configuration but you need a very specific skill type to execute this. If you’re doing this, well why are you reading my blog post? You know better than I do.</p>

<p>If you cannot determine what is the master node, which involves some kind of conensus algorithm and an odd number of nodes to vote on it, then you will end up with data loss and/or corruption.</p>

<h2 id="volume-management-for-docker-is-still-in-its-infancy">Volume management for Docker is still in it’s infancy</h2>

<p>There isn’t a well respected solution for how to do volume management for Docker clusters right now. Some people use NFS, but it lacks any kind of locking support on files (see <a href="http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/locking.html">this blog</a> for more details on linux file lock support). So you cannot guarentee that another system is not writing to your files.</p>

<p>GlusterFS is a recent successor to NFS, that offers much better performance, clustering and scalability. However it has several known issues that render locking unreliable.<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1194546">1</a> <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1287099">2</a></p>

<h2 id="you-lied-to-us-i-can-total-run-my-nosql-database-in-docker">You lied to us! I can total run my NoSQL database in Docker</h2>

<p>The answer here is it really depends on the underlying technology. As stated, there is no solution for filesystem level replication of data (except in a few proprietary solutions like AWS’s flagship database Aurora, VMware File System and Google File System, none of which tackle this specific use case). So instead we must rely on the storage engine of the database to do clustering and replication for us. Some are well known for their support of this (etcd, ElasticSearch and Riak KV to name a few), but it needs to be considered on a case by case basis to evaluate how well the particular database deals with this problem, because it’s so easy to get wrong.</p>

<h2 id="with-great-knowledge-comes-great-responsibility">With great knowledge comes great responsibility</h2>

<p>Now you know why there is significant anxiety to running databases in Docker, you have the power to make the decision for yourself.</p>

<p>If you find yourself wanting to learn more I highly recommend Pintrest’s blog on <a href="https://engineering.pinterest.com/blog/sharding-pinterest-how-we-scaled-our-mysql-fleet">how they sharded their MySQL Cluster</a>. They use Zookeeper, similar to etcd, to keep the configuration of which data lives in which MySQL database. This provides a highly available, consistent store. But they still recommend you “only read/write to the master… It simplifies everything and avoids lagged replication bugs.”</p>

<p>I’ve yet to see a blog post about somebody containerising their MySQL server and how it went really well.</p>

<h2 id="edit-some-solutions-to-the-problems-i-have-presented-here">EDIT: Some solutions to the problems I have presented here</h2>

<p>Some people have pointed out a couple of solutions to the problem presented here. One is the Kubernetes <a href="http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/petset/">PetSet</a> concept. While still in Alpha (so obviuosly not fit for Production), this looks to be solving the exact problem of ensuring one and only one master exists at any one time.</p>

<p>Uber also <a href="https://eng.uber.com/dockerizing-mysql/">blogged about their dockerizing of MySQL</a> which is a very similar solution to the Kubernetes approach. They are defining the cluster topology up front, which guarentees a single master. They don’t talk about how they generate the master, but since that obviously comes from another source it’s likely highly consistent.</p>

<p>So today we still can’t run Docker inside a container cluster, but there are some good solutions on the roadmap.</p>

<p>Check out my <a href="http://patrobinson.github.io/2017/12/16/should-i-run-a-database-in-kubernetes/">follow up post</a> on this ∂subject.</p>

<p>If you have done enough of that kind of programming, you’ll immediately see how Zig is tackling relevant problems, but if you don’t have such experience, then the front page could very easily look like a never-ending list of things you don’t have an opinion about.</p>

<p>When the Zig project started, its audience was almost exclusively people with a lot of relevant experience, since those would be the only ones able to evaluate the promise and limits of the newborn language.</p>
<p>Today we’re at a point where Zig is becoming increasingly compelling for people coming from all layers of the stack. People have written <a href="https://github.com/Hejsil/mecha" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">parser combinators</a>, <a href="https://github.com/prime31/zig-gamekit" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">2d game rendering libraries</a>, <a href="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/futureproof/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a live editor for GPU shaders</a>, and much more. </p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong: all these projects have been developed by early adopters who wanted to try <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/buggy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a new and exciting</a> ecosystem. Zig is not yet stable, and won’t be for a while, but we’re getting there, and in the meantime Zig is already delivering big time on at least one promise: <strong>making it possible to learn more about programming without having to first buy into vast amounts of accidental complexity</strong>.</p>
<p>This redesign had two main goals and, as always, a few practical constraints. When it comes to constraints, it’s mostly my web design and project management skills, and the scope that can be addressed in no more than a couple of months, since we needed a new website <em>now</em> and not one year from now. Let’s now take a look at the goals.</p>
<h2 id="a-friendlier-first-impression"><a href="#a-friendlier-first-impression" aria-label="a friendlier first impression permalink"></a>A friendlier first impression</h2>
<p>The first goal addressed stems directly from the introduction of this blog post: we wanted to make the website more appealing to people that are looking at Zig as an opportunity to learn more about programming. For this reason, the lengthy breakdown has been moved to the Learn section and, in its place, we now have three short paragraphs that highlight some of Zig’s major features, followed by a code sample that gives you a first taste of the syntax. </p>
<p>Above the main introduction we still have the same slogan as before:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zig is a general-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining <strong>robust</strong>, <strong>optimal</strong>, and <strong>reusable</strong> software.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andrew did an outstanding job at formulating it and I believe it’s the one bit of the entire website that should probably never change.</p>
<p>Next to the slogan there’s a new cluster of buttons. This is where I wanted to come up with an interesting compromise: we follow the popular trend of putting a big call to action for new users, but we also use that block of space to create a single hotspot where regulars can get access to critical information. </p>

  </figure>
<p>My hope is for the big button to make new visitors become aware of that block and that, over time, checking there for docs and new releases just becomes muscle memory. That said, I know we’ll have to tweak the design once the auto-generated docs for the standard library become good enough for the front page.</p>
<p>Below everything I just described, we introduce the community and the Zig Software Foundation. The Zig project has grown to a point where governance matters and we want to show we’re doing everything the right way, up to the point of having formed a <a href="https://ziglang.org/zsf/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">nonprofit organization with a clear scope and mission statement</a>.</p>
<h2 id="internationalization"><a href="#internationalization" aria-label="internationalization permalink"></a>Internationalization</h2>
<p>The second goal of this redesign was to open the door to hosting multiple translations of the website. Having an i18n-enabled website is beneficial for multiple reasons: it helps with the first goal (i.e. help a wider range of programmers get started with Zig), it’s a good way of getting more use out of the informative materials we’ll progressively add to the website, and it’s also well aligned with the mission of the Zig Software Foundation. Lastly, I’m personally invested in the idea that we must ensure we don’t leave it to third parties to be the sole owners of all content available in a given language, as we’ve already seen bad actors exploit their position to implement a form of cultural arbitrage.</p>
<p>We’re well aware that keeping up with translations to multiple languages can quickly become an effort black hole. For this reason, I’ve tried to make sure the tooling would help in making the process as smooth as possible (more on that later), and I’ve also made sure to clarify in the design how translations are community-provided and thus best-effort.</p>

  </figure>
<p>At the moment of publication, the website can only offer <a href="https://ziglang.org/translations/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">an Italian translation</a> written by me. Italian was chosen out of necessity (i.e. it’s the only other language I speak), but it served the purpose of making me try out the ergonomics of producing a translation, and it can also act as documentation for others.</p>
<p>Finally, I should point out that there are some parts of the website we don’t plan to translate, like the News section, for example. This is another choice made out of necessity: we want to restrict translations to content with a long shelf life to reduce the amount of effort, but I don’t exclude that one day we might have enough resources to get rid of this compromise.</p>
<h2 id="implementation-details"><a href="#implementation-details" aria-label="implementation details permalink"></a>Implementation details</h2>
<p>The new website is statically generated by <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Hugo</a>. I also considered <a href="https://www.getzola.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Zola</a>, but its i18n support is not complete yet. The website lists a number of Zig code snippets, with relative output. Andrew originally implemented a program to produce release notes and language reference. That program takes in code samples, applies syntax highlighting, runs the code, and reports the output as HTML (it even retains colors from the terminal). I took the original code and packaged it as a tool with a more general interface. I called it <a href="https://github.com/kristoff-it/zig-doctest" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">zig-doctest</a> and it can be easily integrated with all kinds of static content generation tools.</p>
<p>Now a successful CI build of the <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ziglang/zig</a> repository triggers a build of the website, allowing us to catch outdated code examples much more easily. This addresses concerns raised in the past by people that would occasionally stumble upon a broken code sample.</p>
<p>Testing all code snippets is not instant as some tests include running the executable and capturing its output, so I made sure to integrate with Hugo’s caching system. I also noticed that Hugo processes tags sequentially within the same page, so I also <a href="https://github.com/kristoff-it/hugo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">added to it</a> a warmup routine that makes sure to parallelize the testing when loading the development server the first time.</p>
<p>The result is a very enjoyable development experience that only depends on Zig and two additional executables (Hugo and doctest) to be able to develop the Zig website locally, resulting in an acceptable experience for potential contributors. </p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="conclusion permalink"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope this post explains adequately the intent of this work and the practical limits of its execution. There’s still more work to do, but this seems a reasonable milestone for a first release, so I’m looking forward to working alongside the community to improve and add translations to the website.</p>
<p>For the next iteration I’ll work on improving accessibility, but first I have to focus on <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/track/zig_programming_language/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">FOSDEM, since we have a Zig dev room</a> and I have a bunch of duties to attend to. </p>
<p>When I first discovered Zig, I saw it as a way for me to learn more about all the aspects of programming I missed when working with interpreted and/or garbage-collected languages. Turns out I got to learn that <a href="https://ziglang.org/news/announcing-zig-software-foundation/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">and much more</a>, and I can’t tell you how excited I am about what’s to come. Despite everything, 2020 was a great year for Zig, and I fully expect 2021 to be even better.</p></div></div>]]>

<p><em>This is a guest post from Allie Cooper. Enjoy.</em></p>



<div><p>It’s one thing to be able to write good code, but professional written communication is something else entirely. The ability to efficiently and authentically communicate using written language is an often ironically underrated skill in software development.</p><p>This is something that new developers need to get over very quickly. “Obsessions with patterns and algorithms don’t serve anyone’s mission by themselves,” explains&nbsp;<a href="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2020/11/09/create-value-for-people/">engineer and career coach Minh Pham</a>. “While coding might be your latest skill set, it is by no means an engineer’s only skillset. Remember that at the end of the day, it doesn’t matter if your code is ugly, fancy, verbose or concise – the value you create matters. Strive to be an excellent communicator, a quality teammate, and an outstanding human.” In today’s increasingly digitized workplace, achieving these qualities means honing your professional written communication skills.</p><p><strong>Writing is Essential to Software Development</strong></p><p>Any veteran developer can tell you that non coding-related writing is part and parcel of the daily grind, which includes writing tons of bug reports, notes for yourself, documentation for co-workers, and other technical discussions over chat or e-mail. You might also be tasked with explaining technicalities in ways that can be easily understood by clients.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.inc.com/encyclopedia/written-communication.html">And as Inc points out</a>, all of this generates a permanent record of any and all significant ideas, incidents, and other facts pertinent to how you’ve handled the job. In software development, the way you write and communicate over work platforms defines a great majority of your work history.</p><p>While writing code defines your raw ability as a software developer, your written professional correspondence tells the story of your ability to work with others in an inherently collaborative and complex field. Today, the sudden digital migration brought on by the global health crisis has only made professional writing a more integral skill for thriving in the new and increasingly web-based workplace. This is as true for experienced developers as it is for those who are looking to pick up the skills necessary for the job, which brings us to our next point.</p><p><strong>The Future of Coding Education is Written and Online</strong></p><p>From basic coding courses to advanced degree programs, more and more future developers are learning essential skills through online means. And the pandemic has only increased their numbers. For instance,&nbsp;Code Platoon Coding Bootcamp online basic coding courses&nbsp;have allowed the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs to continue offering software development skills training for veterans as well as their spouses. And for safety reasons, all classes have been moved online. </p></div>



<div><p>Meanwhile top universities have also made this switch to training software specialists online.&nbsp;Maryville University’s online masters in software development&nbsp;is an advanced degree program that’s 100% web-based as well, with the perspective of producing future software consultants, UX designers, web developers, and DevOps engineers. And while these programs do include video conferencing classes, the majority of the work is through written communication. As natives to online work, the developers trained in these online programs are already developing the writing skills necessary to thriving amid the current digital migration.</p><p>In short, the field of software development is only getting more competitive and web-based. And while there’s no shortage of genius code writers for companies to cherry-pick from online universities and coding courses, the combination of a great coder and a great online communicator remains rare.</p><p><strong>Practice Makes Perfect</strong></p><p>Whether you’re already coding for a living or still learning the skill, you already have plenty of opportunities to hone your professional writing skills. Strive to be succinct and straightforward with every chat message or e-mail before hitting send. Put yourself in other people’s shoes – think about how the message you wrote will affect you if you were the one to receive it. Remember that every unnecessary word only muddles already complex conversations about technical specifications. Grammar is important, but so is writing with the perspective of being as empathic and as concise as possible – which can also allow you to develop a writing style that won’t require grammatical gymnastics. Never play to your emotions and always write with a collaborative mindset. The better you can communicate with the written word, the more value you can bring to any software development effort.</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div href=""><p>In this article I will focus on a topic widely debated by people who design engineering workflows between Ops and developers: Is there a systematic approach that can balance the maintainability of the system, the velocity at which features get shipped and the freedom of the developers?</p><p>Let's steal the concept of the Project Management Triangle and adapt it to organizing work between developers and ops. The Project Management Triangle states that quality is affected by scope, budget and time. Basically, for a given quality you can choose 2 of "complete", "fast" or "cheap". We'll call our triangle&nbsp; “the ulgy triangle of engineering process design”. It says that for a given cost, you can trade off velocity, maintainability and developer freedom. I find that optimizing for “Maintainability and Velocity'' is the winning strategy. Reaching this combination requires a new way of organizing work between the ops and the application development team.</p><p>We need to be careful though, strictly optimizing for the combination Maintainability and Velocity can lead to a significant decrease in conversations between ops and developers which in turn leads to silos. This risk has to be mitigated by regular, scheduled internal discussions around optimal workflow designs. Good teams agree on standard operating procedures supported by their internal tooling setup but keep the conversation going to continuously optimize.</p><p><span id="hs-cta-wrapper-cbd2acbb-3460-41d9-bc43-6fa6b1d316b2"><span id="hs-cta-cbd2acbb-3460-41d9-bc43-6fa6b1d316b2"><!--[if lte IE 8]><div id="hs-cta-ie-element"></div><![endif]--><a href="https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/5890440/cbd2acbb-3460-41d9-bc43-6fa6b1d316b2"><img id="hs-cta-img-cbd2acbb-3460-41d9-bc43-6fa6b1d316b2" height="628" width="1200" src="https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/5890440/cbd2acbb-3460-41d9-bc43-6fa6b1d316b2.png" alt="Webinar: How much freedom should developers have in the perfect DevOps setup?"></a></span></span></p><p>‍<br></p><h2>The ugly triangle&nbsp;</h2><p>In an ideal world, I would want to work in an engineering team that works with high velocity, everybody could use the methods they prefer without bothering too much with transactional conventions. And the best thing would be: our setup would remain easy to maintain. Unfortunately my experience over the past ten years tells me that this is just a dream. In the real world a team can choose any of the following combinations: Freedom + Velocity, Velocity + Maintainability and Maintainability and Freedom for a fixed team size (i.e. cost).<br></p><p>Let’s go through the individual elements to try to understand and force-rank their importance.<br></p><p><strong>Velocity</strong> is my personal number one. By far. Much too often, as teams grow, they slow down. I loved Jason Warner’s mantra-like quote when we recently chatted: “when you slow you die”. <a href="https://humanitec.com/blog/jason-warner-why-github-built-their-own-internal-developer-platform">(Actually consider reading this interview because he says tons of stuff that is relevant if you like this article).</a> Speed means you’re faster than your competition in shipping awesome stuff, it means you can react to customer demand or to that bug that keeps hindering people from buying, on black friday. But we can also look at the sheer numbers, for instance the graphics from McKinsey’s study across 431 businesses and they’ll tell us: there is a significant correlation between engineering velocity and business outcomes as well as sheer innovation power of a business.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5c73bbfe3312822f153dd310/5fe1c79f70fc6ee802e19974_LPpwoN2XGixETWqOUhZG-IJ5I99sXbBCPmYVVKpht8UIVzD9mxroHevOVWhh6HAXxGRTDJ8REquDL2WAUivmEiPEnwuVi0uMTcMMPvs1PRXFVc4X6pwnaiofFoKYsPR1mjUunbNe.png" alt=""></p><figcaption><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/developer-velocity-how-software-excellence-fuels-business-performance" target="_blank">McKinsey and Company, Development velocity - how software excellence shapes business outcomes, Correlating revenue and developer velocity.</a></figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5c73bbfe3312822f153dd310/5fe1c79f6e26a6103cf19b8d_YmSXBY5GjquY0CMgCBgOXPa1DkY8v3BC3Gp5iu6xbJBel0eKEi7Ne51TLEZj-4Cs9zu2PnO35oHIkutcPbEAlUzi7CLmtfgRCBtHzaujS-BAi34RkQ3Cm5yfQrPU0YDKaeR1jjOp.png" alt=""></p><figcaption><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/developer-velocity-how-software-excellence-fuels-business-performance" target="_blank">Graphic: McKinsey and Company, Development velocity - how software excellence shapes business outcomes, Velocity correlates with ability to innovate.</a></figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>As the first rule in business is to stay in business I believe it’s fair to assume this is priority #1.<br></p><p><strong>Maintainability</strong> is non-negotiable for so many reasons. Hard to maintain systems lead to technical debt and so eat up vast amounts of resources. What does this mean in practice? I recently chatted to Paolo Garri, Director of Technology at Sport1, a German broadcaster. They had 400 unstructured scripts in their setup. And unstructured means several languages and formats (bash, YAML, python, etc.) and a complete mess in the way these scripts and manifests themselves were structured. This led to key-person dependencies, time sunk into maintaining these scripts and overwhelming internal documentation. The impact on the Ops team was severe: time you put into maintenance is time you lose for innovation. Setups that are hard to maintain usually don’t allow for developer self-serving which in turn puts ops under pressure because they are busy keeping up with manual requests from the team.</p><p>Let’s move away from an n=1 and look at the broader data-set. First of all let’s check what share the cost (and subsequently developer life-time) of maintenance has as a percentage of the total cost (and life-time) of a product. To do this let’s look at a small meta-analysis of what authors say about the percentage of maintenance cost of total cost:<br></p><p><strong>Author</strong></p><p><strong>Maintenance as a % of Build Cost</strong></p><p><a href="http://galorath.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/software_total_ownership_costs-development_is_only_job_one.pdf" target="_blank">Daniel D. Galorath: 75%</a></p><p><a href="http://courses.cs.vt.edu/csonline/SE/Lessons/LifeCycle/Lesson.html#refs">Stephen R. Schach</a>: 67%</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_maintenance#cite_note-2">Thomas M. Pigoski</a>: &gt;80%</p><p><a href="http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/The_60/60_Rule">Robert L. Glass</a>: 40% – 80%</p><p>f &gt;90%</p><p>Although there is quite a lot of variance, it’s probably fair to assume that the percentage of build cost spent on maintenance is somewhere between 40%-90%. That&nbsp; is a significant chunk. To call maintainability a vital impact factor we should look at how code-quality (maintainability) impacts cost. In other words: does it pay off to optimize for maintainability of code in order to reduce future cost? If not, the proportions of build cost eaten up by maintenance would just be a necessary evil.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5c73bbfe3312822f153dd310/5fe1c79fb11c53f63b52a4fb_vGpYCibENVJo6wueiW2yEfvzKcrpQAqQwRJFi7zQE9GZ_LYDKXQq7zeMozV6Jvw9agu1aWLRX1zndoNsf-jc9YX3FIykfF8y5yx4FsQWwBi9Hh4feSUCdvHv8wUgplN8o6fKc9fx.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Rob Waller, mapping maintainability against cost, <a href="https://dev.to/robdwaller/the-code-maintainability-test-5df3#:~:text=Code%20maintainability%20is%20a%20fundamental,difficult%20to%20add%20new%20features." target="_blank">here.</a></figcaption></figure><p>As you can see: as maintainability increases, costs fall. Maintenance costs never fall to zero but they do fall dramatically as a codebase improves. Admittedly “maintainability” is a vague and imprecise variable and we need to accept the general trend rather than specific analysis.<br></p><p><strong>Freedom</strong>, well what does this actually mean? Well what I mean by this more specifically is the freedom&nbsp; to choose tools and technologies that are part of the developer / ops workflow. (I’m not talking about the langues developers use to write the apps and services they are developing - we’ll focus on the developer / ops workflows.) Let's look specifically at configuration management as an example.<br></p><p>A high degree of freedom in this sense means an individual team-member is not only entirely free on how to express configurations but also on how to get those running in the target infrastructure. Zooming in on the Kubernetes ecosystems in this world it would be entirely up to her whether she wants to define configs as Helm Charts, a Kustomize patch or vanilla Kubernetes manifests. She would also be free to choose&nbsp; how to update the target resource as long as the desired outcome would meet the expectation.<br></p><p>A low degree of freedom would mean the developer could not choose how to write configurations. There would be a strict baseline schema and she could only apply limited changes to this schema. She would then use internal tooling that would update the target resource for her.&nbsp;</p><p>The conclusions we can draw from the above example (and sadly there isn’t sufficient research to actually back those up with data) are the following:&nbsp;</p><p>Freedom of choice affects maintainability negatively. Meaning if you allow teams to randomly choose how they manage configurations and stich processes together with scripts the maintainability is affected. So: a high degree of freedom leads to a high degree of variance to understand, document and ultimately maintain. The more freedom the less maintainability.</p><p>Restriction of freedom thus seems inevitable. How important is it really that every developer can write the container specifications or the helm-charts the exact way she wants? How does this change the overall picture? Does this make your team more attractive to applicants? Not really! After all, application developers are more and more specialized in their respective field. A react developer cares about typescript much more than about terraform and frankly, that’s ok.<br></p><h2>Be very careful when restricting freedom</h2><p>With this force-ranking it becomes clear that the winning combination is Maintainability and Velocity. At the same time this implies that we will have to restrict freedom. But restricting freedom is a dangerous endeavor. You’re taking away context and choice while relying on the opinion of a few what the right thing to do is.<br></p><p>If we’re looking at common models how teams design the intersect between developers and operations (and thus fiddle with freedom) three patterns come to mind:<br></p><p><strong>Pattern #1:</strong> <em>You build it and I run </em>it or <em>the zero-freedom pattern.</em> In this pattern there is strict separation of concerns. Application developers write their code, maybe elements of the configuration. They then throw the package over the fence where ops picks it up and runs it. This model is antiquated. Practitioners of the latest DevOps methodology would probably agree that this is not the way to go. It might lead to better maintainability, maybe a higher velocity but it also leads to strange and misaligned incentives for both developers and ops.. In this model the team has zero freedom. This is definitely not what I mean when I vote for the maintainability-velocity combination.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5c73bbfe3312822f153dd310/5fe1c79f9bd7dd904cf42400_wiEl_EB4hPzpk-MS134_eBnRhDan7Bga2lNihFlIwaJxOL3bHO3DApSv3foCGlMxW3buv8dYVHvxP5MYViS1FbUN13wu5E5vdNxI_EBBxEf_rrpz1nrBisoYLLIXHk-XKEhv1aT0.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>Pattern #2:</strong> <em>You build it, you run it and I don’t exist </em>or <em>the total freedom pattern.</em> In this pattern there are no operators at all. Some (in my opinion) misinterpret this as the purest form of DevOps. Developers not only have to handle their applications, but also look after the underlying infrastructure (i.e. the cluster, managed databases etc). This setup leads to a very high degree of freedom. Everyone does everything and especially has to do everything, there really is no choice. While this approach works for very small teams of highly trained engineers it almost consistently fails in practice if it comes to scaling teams, especially in an enterprise context. The reason is that developers tend to specialize as they move through their careers. For example, senior front end developers who win are those who specialize in (for example) TypeScript with React. That’s what they will be benchmarked against, not their ability to handle DevOps related tasks. This pattern leads to huge pressure on the ops team through requests from developers raining down on them. This reinstates pattern #1 with the downsides of missing structure. Now you get the requests from …</p></div></div>

called by <code>file-name-at-point-functions</code>, an <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html%5Fnode/emacs/Hooks.html#:~:text=A%20few%20hooks%20are%20abnormal,are%20used%20in%20some%20way.">abnormal hook</a> run when <code>find-file</code>
is called.</p><p>If you're familiar with Vim you can think of Emacs <i>hooks</i> as
Vim <i>autocommands</i>, only with much better ergonomics.</p><p>I checked the documentation for <code>ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code> with <code>M-x describe-function ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code> and it didn’t seem
to be something essential, so I removed the hook by running <code>M-x eval-expression</code>, writing the form below, and pressing <code>RET</code>.</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">(<span>remove-hook</span> <span>'file-name-at-point-functions</span> <span>'ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</span>)
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>This solved the immediate problem of Emacs blocking for 5 seconds every
time I ran <code>find-file</code>, with no noticeable drawbacks.</p><div><p>As I write this I attempt to reproduce the issue by re-adding
<code>ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code>
to
<code>file-name-at-point-functions</code>.
I can't reproduce it anymore. The initial issue might have been</p><ul><li>caused by having manually mutated the Emacs environment via ad-hoc code
evaluation (drifting from the state defined in configuration)</li><li>caused by settings or packages that aren't in my configuration anymore</li><li>fixed by settings or packages that were recently added to my
configuration</li><li>fixed by some recent package upgrade</li></ul><p>Or some combination of the above. I have no idea exactly what.
Which is to say: maintaining Emacs configurations is complicated.</p></div><p>I could now navigate around and open files. The next thing I tried in this
remote git repository was searching through project files. The great
<em>projectile</em> package provides the <code>projectile-find-file</code> function for that,
but I had previously given up making projectile perform well with remote
buffers; given how things are currently implemented it seems to be
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=projectile+tramp">impractical</a>. So I installed the <em>find-file-in-project</em> package for use on
remote projects exclusively: <code>M-x package-install find-file-in-project</code>.</p><p>Most Emacs commands are accessible via key combinations, with defaults
that can be customized to be anything you want. I'll stick to referencing
command names themselves instead of their default keybindings.</p><p>Both <code>projectile-find-file</code> and <code>find-file-in-project</code> (aliased as <code>ffip</code>):</p><ul><li>show a narrowed list of all project files in the minibuffer</li><li>prompt the user to filter and scroll through candidates</li><li>open a file when <code>RET</code> is pressed on a candidate.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/projectile_find_file_linux.png"></figure><p>To disable projectile on remote buffers I had the following form in my
configuration.</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">(<span>defadvice</span> <span>projectile-project-root</span> (<span>around</span> <span>ignore-remote</span> <span>first</span> <span>activate</span>)

</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>Which causes the <code>projectile-project-root</code> function to not run its usual
implementation on remote buffers, but instead return <code>nil</code> unconditionally.
<code>projectile-project-root</code> is used as a way to either get the project root for
a given buffer (remote or not), or as a boolean predicate to test if the
buffer is in a project (e.g., a git repository directory). Having it return
<code>nil</code> on remote buffers effectively disables projectile on remote buffers.</p><p>Emacs
<i><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Advising-Functions.html">advices</a></i> are a way of modifying the behavior of existing functions without
having to redefine them. They serve a similar purpose as hooks, but are
more flexible.</p><p>I then wrote a function that falls back to <code>ffip</code> when projectile is
disabled and bound it to the keybinding I had for <code>projectile-find-file</code>,
so that I could press the same keybinding whenever I wanted to search for
projects files, and not have to think about whether I’m on a remote buffer
or not:</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1

<code>ivy--insert-minibuffer</code> and 9% of the time—roughly 3 whole seconds!—
garbage collecting. I had <code>garbage-collection-messages</code> set to <code>t</code> so I could
already tell that Emacs was GCing a lot; enabling this setting makes a
message be displayed in the echo area whenever Emacs garbage collects. I
could also see the Emacs process consuming 100% of one CPU core while it was
frozen and unresponsive to input.</p><p>The <code>profiler</code> package implements a

(17% of CPU time) were spent on Emacs waiting for user input, so we can
ignore it for now.</p><p>As I get deep in drilling down on <code>ivy--insert-minibuffer</code>, names in the
“Function” column start getting truncated because the column is too narrow.

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1609697572806_14361"><div><p>The desire to get more sales off-Amazon doesn’t just come from the risk that they suspend our company from their platform. It’s also about the cost of selling there relative to other channels. If we sell $100 worth of product on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/viahart">our Amazon store</a>, on average, we get $48.25 back. At <a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?query=viahart&amp;redirect=false">our Walmart.com store</a>, we get $54.50 and on <a href="https://www.ebay.com/str/viahart">eBay store</a>, we get $57.50 back. On <a href="https://viahart.com/">our website (which could use a bath!)</a>, by virtue of not having a commission and by having much lower per unit shipping costs driven by larger orders (the more you ship, the cheaper it is to ship per unit), we get $83.10 back!</p><p>What’s driving those cost differences between the big marketplaces Amazon, eBay, and Walmart? It’s not shipping. It costs us roughly the same to ship out of our warehouse as it does for us to use Amazon’s FBA. eBay’s has slightly lower commissions, but the main reasons for the cost differences between these marketplaces are:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Refunds - It could be Amazon’s customer service or perhaps the customers themselves, but Amazon grants more refunds (2.6% of revenue) than either Walmart (1.9%) or famously seller friendly eBay (1%)</p></li><li><p>Storage - It costs a lot of money to store your products in Amazon’s fulfillment centers. We spent 2.4% of our Amazon revenue on storage. Amazon’s service was very spotty this year, but being able to reach 99.99% of America within 1-2 days is pretty awesome and this is a big driver of why Amazon owns 93.4% of our sales.</p></li><li><p>Advertising - Depending on what website A/B testing they’re doing, as many as 6 out of the top 7 results in an Amazon search can be advertising.  Even when a customer searches for your brand, if you want to be seen before your competition, you need to pay Amazon. We paid them 3.55% of our Amazon revenue in 2020. As less competitive marketplaces, we did not see the need to pay for advertising on eBay or Walmart. </p></li></ol></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1609697572806_20928"><div>

At that level of margin, moving your sales from Amazon to eBay would result in a 38% improvement in profits, which is huge. Shifting those sales from Amazon to one’s own website would represent a more than 3x increase in profits! Of course, if this were easy, we would have done it already. Unfortunately, getting traffic to one’s website is oftentimes a costly affair and it could be expected that a good portion of those profits would go to Facebook or Google.</p><p>Logistics and Covid-19 or Why It’s Better to Be Lucky Than Good</p><p>When the lockdowns first hit in the United States, it caused a massive shift in spending from brick-and-mortar to e-commerce. When government assistance arrived, it turbocharged online consumer spending even further. So for almost everyone in the e-commerce industry, 2020 was the best year they’ve ever had.</p><p>That said, it was a logistics nightmare, all year.

This past weekend, on January 9th, we celebrated 10 years since <a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/commit/337c3f2d569a42ebd5fcab6fef18c5e012f9be5b">the first commit to the Elixir repository</a>. While I personally don’t consider <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> to be 10 years old yet - the language that became what Elixir is today <a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/commit/6052352b6281752b905b30eb5b08fac0f51f68cd">surfaced only 14 months later</a> - a decade is a mark to celebrate!</p>
<p>
The goal of this post is to focus on the current state of some projects in the ecosystem and then briefly highlight a few of the exciting efforts coming over the next months.</p>
<h2>
Recap: The language goals</h2>
<p>
When I started working on Elixir, I personally had the ambition of using it for building scalable and robust web applications. However, I didn’t want Elixir to be tied to the web. My goal was to design an <em>extensible</em> language with a diverse ecosystem. Elixir aims to be a general purpose language and allows developers to extend it to new domains.</p>
<p>
Given Elixir is built on top of Erlang and Erlang is used for networking and distributed systems, Elixir would naturally be a good fit in those domains too, as long as I didn’t screw things up. The Erlang VM is essential to everything we do in Elixir, which is why <em>compatibility</em> has become a language goal too.</p>
<p>
I also wanted the language to be <em>productive</em>, especially by focusing on the tooling. Learning a functional programming language is a new endeavor for most developers. Consequently their first experiences getting started with the language, setting up a new project, searching for documentation, and debugging should go as smoothly as possible.</p>
<p>
Extensibility, compatibility, and productivity are the goals we built the language upon.</p>
<h2>
Recap: Elixir in production</h2>
<p>
Last year we started <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/cases.html">a series of articles on companies using Elixir in production on the official website</a>. As of today, we have 7 production cases listed with more coming this year! Overall it is very exciting to see many different companies using a variety of business models and industries running Elixir in production.</p>
<p>
Companies like <a href="https://www.brex.com/">Brex</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/06/23/growing-with-elixir-at-brex/">case</a>), <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/08/real-time-communication-at-scale-with-elixir-at-discord/">case</a>), <a href="https://getdivvy.com/">Divvy</a>, <a href="https://www.podium.com/">Podium</a>, and <a href="https://salesloft.com/">SalesLoft</a> have reached <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn_(finance)">“unicorn status”</a> and rely heavily on Elixir. Startups like <a href="https://www.joinblvd.com/">Boulevard</a> (<a href="https://soundcloud.com/elixirtalk/episode-166-feat-sean-stavropoulos">podcast</a>), <a href="https://community.com/">Community</a>, <a href="https://duffel.com/">Duffel</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/12/10/integrating-travel-with-elixir-at-duffel/">case</a>), <a href="https://www.ockam.io/">Ockam</a>, <a href="https://www.mux.com/">Mux</a>, <a href="https://ramp.com/">Ramp</a>, <a href="https://remote.com/">Remote</a>, and <a href="https://www.v7labs.com/">V7</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2021/01/13/orchestrating-computer-vision-with-elixir/">case</a>) also use Elixir and have received funding in the last year or two. Elixir is also used within known brands and enterprises such as <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/">Bleacher Report</a>, <a href="https://www.change.org/">Change.org</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/27/delivering-social-change-with-elixir-at-change.org/">case</a>), <a href="https://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/09/24/paas-with-elixir-at-Heroku/">case</a>), <a href="https://www.pagerduty.com/">PagerDuty</a>, <a href="https://www.pepsico.com/">PepsiCo</a>, and <a href="https://www.therealreal.com/">TheRealReal</a>.</p>
<p>
There is also a special category of startups that run Elixir alonside an open source model, such as <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible Analytics</a>, <a href="https://app.supabase.io/">Supabase</a>, <a href="https://logflare.app/">Logflare</a> (<a href="https://runninginproduction.com/podcast/11-logflare-is-a-log-management-and-event-analytics-platform">podcast</a>), and <a href="https://hex.pm/">Hex.pm</a> (<a href="https://runninginproduction.com/podcast/19-hexpm-is-elixirs-official-package-manager">podcast</a>) itself. Still on the open source front, you will find projects like <a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</a> and <a href="https://changelog.com/">Changelog</a>. There also many small scale and hobby projects that use Elixir for a productive and joyful development experience.</p>
<h2>
Recap: Diverse ecosystem</h2>
<p>
Today, Elixir has a diverse ecosystem that works on a wide range of domains and industries. Let’s take a look at some examples.</p>
<h3>
Web</h3>
<p>
Most developers are familiar with using Elixir for web development thanks to <a href="https://phoenixframework.org/">the Phoenix web framework</a>. Phoenix gained traction in the ecosystem because it was the first to fully leverage the language and the platform for building real-time applications besides the usual MVC (Model-View-Controller) offering.</p>
<p>
It all started with Phoenix Channels, as a bi-directional communication between clients and servers, and Phoenix PubSub, which uses Erlang’s distributed compatibilities to broadcast messages across nodes. As far as I know, Phoenix was the first major web framework to provide a multi-node web real-time solution completely out-of-the-box. Regardless if you are using one node or ten nodes, everything just works, with minimal configuration and dependencies.</p>
<p>
Phoenix has matured a lot since its first stable release. Phoenix v1.2 included <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Presence.html">Phoenix Presence</a>, that allows developers to track which users, IoT devices, etc are connected to your cluster right now. No databases or external dependencies required! This is one of the problems that look deceptively simple at first, but once you outline all scalability, performance, and fault-tolerance requirements, it <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/11/17/real-time-collaboration-with-elixir-at-slab/">becomes quite complex</a>. Luckily, Phoenix is running on a platform that excels at these problems, and I am not aware of any other framework that provides such a lean and elegant solution as part of its default stack.</p>
<p>
Most recently, <a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view">Phoenix LiveView</a> was released and brought new ways to build rich, real-time user experiences with server-rendered HTML, inspiring developers to attempt similar solutions for other languages and frameworks. You can read the <a href="https://dockyard.com/blog/2018/12/12/phoenix-liveview-interactive-real-time-apps-no-need-to-write-javascript">original announcement</a> or <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/build-a-real-time-twitter-clone-in-15-minutes-with-live-view-and-phoenix-1-5">learn how to build a real-time Twitter clone in 15 minutes</a>. As part of the <em>Live</em> family, we have also announced <a href="https://twitter.com/josevalim/status/1250846714665357315">Phoenix LiveDashboard</a>, making monitoring and instrumentation a first-class citizen for Phoenix applications.</p>
<h3>
Embedded and IoT</h3>
<p>
While I always expected Elixir to shine for building web applications, I was taken by surprise when I heard about the <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves platform</a> for creating high-end embedded applications. However, once I learned their premise, it all made sense: writing embedded systems <em>is</em> complicated. Reasoning about failures is hard. So what if we could leverage the decades of lessons learnt by Erlang/OTP to design embedded applications? What if a fault on the Wi-Fi driver could be fixed by having a supervisor simply restart it? After all, the first major use of Erlang/OTP was in an embedded system, the Ericsson AXD301 ATM switch.</p>
<p>
Nerves brings the Elixir ecosystem and the battle-tested Erlang VM to edge computing, providing a rich developer experience using proven technology. Nerves started as a one step process for turning an Elixir project into a complete software image for common hardware devices. Today, Nerves is being used in production in industrial automation, machine learning, consumer electronics and more, with <a href="https://farm.bot/">Farmbot</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/08/20/embedded-elixir-at-farmbot/">case</a>) and <a href="https://www.rosepoint.com/">Rose Point Navigation</a> being two of the most notable examples.</p>
<p>
The Nerves team also created <a href="https://www.nerves-hub.org/">NervesHub</a>, a fully open-source device management system. Combining all these technologies makes Elixir a comprehensive language for building end-to-end IoT platforms.</p>
<h3>
Data ingestion and pipelines</h3>
<p>
Shortly after Elixir v1.0 was released, the Elixir Core Team and I started looking into abstractions for tackling data ingestions and data pipelines in Elixir. We ran through a couple designs until we eventually <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2016/07/14/announcing-genstage/">landed on GenStage</a>: a behaviour for exchanging data with back-pressure between Elixir processes and external systems. For an introduction, make sure to check out <a href="https://youtu.be/srtMWzyqdp8?t=242">my keynote introducing both GenStage and Flow</a>.</p>
<p>
Today, almost 5 years later, GenStage has been used by many industries and has become one of the factors driving Elixir adoption. For example, you can read how both <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/08/real-time-communication-at-scale-with-elixir-at-discord/">Discord</a> and <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/27/delivering-social-change-with-elixir-at-change.org/">Change.org</a> have built systems on Elixir and GenStage that handle spikes and run at massive scale.</p>
<p>
However, GenStage was just the beginning. In 2019, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOExnT1PYjs">we announced Broadway</a>, which is a higher-level abstraction on top of GenStage that makes building data ingestion pipelines a breeze. We originally released with Amazon SQS support. Nowadays, RabbitMQ, Google Cloud PubSub, Apache Kafka, and other sources (known as producers in Broadway terms) are also available.</p>
<h3>
Audio/Video streaming</h3>
<p>
Since the Erlang VM was designed for scalable network processing, one can expect to also be an excellent platform for audio and video streaming. However, if you also wanted to process and transform those streams on the fly, the situation becomes much more complicated as you likely have to integrate with native code.</p>
<p>
Luckily, the tables have turned when Erlang/OTP 20 was released a couple years ago with the so-called Dirty NIFs. The Erlang VM always had the ability to invoke native code, but this native code could not run for long, as to not interfere with the preemptive features of the Erlang runtime. Dirty NIFs allow developers to tag native code either as IO or CPU bound, which runs on specific threads. Between ports (I/O based), NIFs, Dirty NIFs, and remote nodes, developers now have many options to interface with native code with different performance and reliability guarantees. That’s exactly the foundation the <a href="http://www.membraneframework.org/">Membrane Framework</a> builds on top of.</p>
<p>
Membrane was extracted from RadioKit, a startup aiming at disrupting the radio broadcasting industry. Originally it focused on processing and mixing audio. Later, <a href="https://www.swmansion.com/">Software Mansion</a> acquired the framework and provided stable funding and a solid team to help it grow into a full-scale framework. Currently, it allows developers to process, transmit, broadcast, and transform audio and videos streams on the fly. Whether you are building a Twitch clone, a VOD application or a video conferencing system, Membrane provides a growing set of high-level abstractions and pre-made modules so you don’t have to dive into idiosyncrasies of particular codecs, protocols, and formats. </p>
<h2>
Looking ahead: what is coming in 2021</h2>
<p>
The year of 2021 looks very exciting for the Erlang Ecosystem and the Elixir community. In this section, we are going to mention some of the things we expect to see in 2021.</p>
<h3>
Erlang/OTP 24 with JIT</h3>
<p>
In September 2020, <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/2745">Lukas Larsson and the Erlang/OTP team</a> announced a JIT compiler for the Erlang VM called BeamAsm. How faster the JIT will be in practice depends on your application but the results posted in the announcement are promising. To quote Lukas:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
If we run the JSON benchmarks found in the <a href="https://github.com/devinus/poison/tree/master/bench">Poison</a> or <a href="https://github.com/michalmuskala/jason/tree/master/bench">Jason</a>, BeamAsm achieves anything from 30% to 130% increase (average at about 70%) in the number of iterations per second for all Erlang/Elixir implementations. For some benchmarks, BeamAsm is even faster than the pure C implementation <a href="https://github.com/davisp/jiffy">jiffy</a>.  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>
More complex applications tend to see a more moderate performance increase, for instance, RabbitMQ is able to handle 30% to 50% more messages per second depending on the scenario.  </p>

However, with the development of technology, the support has included more and more new functions, and its importance has grown. The COVID-19 pandemic also contributed to the development of IT support. In this article, we will figure out why IT support is important for business, why its quality directly affects the company’s profits, and what the prospects for this area are.</span></p>
<h2><span>The historical value of IT support</span></h2>
<p><span>The responsibilities of this service have grown in number steadily as technology, methodologies, and customer relationships have evolved.</span></p>
<p><span>Today, the main functions of the IT help desk include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>technical support for the company’s employees;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>support of external clients – users of the company’s products;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>maintenance of the company’s infrastructure and its applications/products;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>control over the execution of requests at the agreed service levels;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Call Center/Help Desk;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>work with the Service Desk system;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>filling the knowledge base;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>monitoring the quality of the company’s IT services;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>communication with clients, employees, contractors.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>And this is without a lot of smaller tasks that differ depending on the specifics of a company. Most of them are hidden from prying eyes like the underwater part of an iceberg.</span></p>
<p><span>Despite the deepness of modern IT support, there is an opinion that this support for both employees and customers does not have an essential impact on the financial performance of the company. This point of view has been formed over decades, so no wonder that changing it is very difficult. But the world does not stand still, and changes have affected this function of the business as well.</span></p>
<p><span>It is the support service that is often the first point of contact between customers and a company, and it has great potential to take their relationship to the next level. Modern IT support specialists are no longer bearded geeks in sweaters who speak incomprehensible tech jargon.</span></p>
<p><span>Nowadays, a qualified IT support specialist is a person with a high level of sociability and empathy, as well as teamwork and problem-solving skills. Such a specialist is constantly evolving and puts the needs of the client first. And they can give the business something more than solving clients’ problems and advising them.</span></p>
<h2><span>COVID-19: a tragedy or a chance?</span></h2>
<p><span>The coronavirus pandemic directly affected the development of IT support services, just as it affected all businesses across the world. From the digital transformation era perspective, these changes present a tremendous opportunity for CEOs around the world.</span></p>
<p><span>The pandemic has greatly accelerated the global development of digital processes. Companies that managed to implement digital solutions in time have already seen practical benefits for their businesses. Those that hadn’t, realized their oversight with the beginning of the transition of the whole world to remote work. There is no doubt that the trend will not decline but, vice versa, only grow in the coming years.</span></p>
<p><span>This opens up new opportunities and forces businesses to be more flexible, including in IT processes. In addition, the massive transfer of IT teams around the world to remote work has opened the eyes of companies to the effectiveness of remote support. More and more companies are announcing their plans to work in this mode at least for the whole of 2020, and some are organizing this process on an ongoing basis.</span></p>
<p><span>The work of IT support is going to a new level and increasing the value of the outsourcing format. Outsourcing companies often have a higher level of process maturity and a larger pool of resources than internal IT teams. Moreover, outsourcing services also actively introduce new digital approaches and change their models in accordance with modern customer requirements. Their flexibility is now extremely high, and the benefits of using their services are maximized.</span></p>
<p><span>These companies operate at agreed levels of service, so the client can be confident in the quality of service they will receive and how much it will cost. Both </span><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/customer-service-support/insights/trending-topics/coronavirus-impact"><span>Gartner</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/digital-transformation/articles/delivering-customer-service-during-COVID-19.html"><span>Deloitte</span></a><span> are reporting the increased value of outsourcing services during the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span>There are many examples of successful transfer of customer service to outsourcing companies, including by such well-known entities as Microsoft, Dell, Ford Motor Company, CISCO, General Electric, American Express. Cost reduction remains one of the major reasons for such transfers, but </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/operations/articles/global-outsourcing-survey.html"><span>Deloitte research shows</span></a><span> that modern companies are concentrating more on the overall value they can get from the outsourcing services instead of just cost savings.</span></p>
<h2><span>The digital future of IT support services</span></h2>
<p><span>Digital transformation is primarily perceived as the introduction of new technologies and communication channels in the work with clients. More and more companies are implementing chatbots, virtual assistants, notifications via messengers, polls via social networks, etc. Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Big Data are also increasingly used to create additional customer benefits in IT services.</span></p>
<p><span>But even this is not enough to get the maximum benefits of the current period of digital transformation. Now the most important thing is to change how the operating model of IT support works with clients. All operational processes need to be improved to meet the new service requirements that are put forward by today’s customers.</span></p>
<p><span>IT support teams should reorient from their usual performance indicators to those that are more important for the business:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Net Promoter Score</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Customer Lifetime Value</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Customer Profitability.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>The new benchmarks for the IT support function should be aimed at increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty by creating additional benefits for them. And IT support team leaders should reconsider processes much more often. This will ensure that the quality of their teams’ work meets the current requirements of clients.</span></p>
<p><b>Additional features of the support service that add value to your business:</b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Analyzing customer needs and behaviors</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Identifying key touchpoints of customers</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Growing customers’ loyalty through a personalized experience</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Demonstrating to customers how they can get the best from the new digital solutions</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Providing fast feedback about the efficiency of new methods and technologies</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span>All this makes it obvious that there is a need for urgent changes in the operational approaches of IT support for every company that wants to achieve maximum success in working with clients. The old approaches are hopelessly outdated, and the competition is higher than ever before. At the same time, the scale of the ongoing digital changes is enormous and brings many benefits to the business.</span></p>
<p><span>Those companies that adapt to the demands of the new era faster than others will be the first to maximize their competitive advantages. And clients, for their part, will tend to work with those companies that are actively implementing digital solutions in their work for the sake of the clients’ convenience. This is a win-win situation.</span></p>
<h2><span>Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span>The transformation has already affected all aspects of the business: sales, marketing, development, and so on. But the support service has one big advantage over all others: it historically has the maximum flexibility necessary to work effectively with customers. In a fast-paced world, support teams who work directly with customers on a daily basis are used to changing their approaches and tools as soon as required.</span></p>
<p><span>Since customers now more than ever dictate to companies the level of service they receive, the willingness of organizations to respond quickly to these requirements plays center stage. And here, the flexibility of customer service specialists and their developed software skills will be more useful than ever.</span></p>
<p><span>The determination to act and change is needed for one more reason. Digital transformation is not the last of the key trends affecting the business environment. It will be followed by other trends, also critical for business development. The sooner companies start implementing technological innovations, the sooner they will have the opportunity to be among the leaders in their field.</span></p>
<p><span>This mindset is now more important than ever for leaders who determine the strategy for support services for the coming months and years. Today, clients are very demanding and highly value quality service. The opportunities that have opened up for companies in the current era of digital transformation may be exactly the accelerator that many of them dream of. The only question is who is ready to change quickly for the benefit of clients and for the sake of their future – in practice, not just in words.</span></p>

</p>

<p>The first publication of the first VideoLAN NuGet package dates back to April 1st, 2018 (no joke!). We have been steadily adding new packages since then to cover all platforms supported by both LibVLC and .NET.</p>

<p>Today, we actively publish and maintain <strong>15 NuGet packages</strong>, 6 of which  actually containing native platform-specific code. The remaining 9 packages are managed C# DLLs composed of the main binding (<a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/LibVLCSharp/">LibVLCSharp</a>) and various GUI toolkit integrations for getting users up and running quickly.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Xamarin.Android</li>
  <li>Xamarin.iOS</li>
  <li>Xamarin.tvOS</li>
  <li>Xamarin.Mac (Cocoa)</li>
  <li>Windows Classic (WPF, WinForms, GTK)</li>
  <li>Windows Universal (UWP for Desktop, mobile and Xbox)</li>
  <li>Linux including desktop, server and Raspberry Pi (GTK)</li>
  <li>Xamarin.Forms</li>
  <li>Uno Platform (UWP, Android, iOS)</li>
  <li>Avalonia (Windows, macOS, Linux)</li>
</ul>

<p>LibVLCSharp counts about <strong>19 contributors</strong>, with most people doing one-off contributions and mainly 2 active maintainers (<a href="https://github.com/jeremyVignelles">Jérémy</a> and myself). I’d like to thank each of them for their valuable OSS contributions!</p>



<p>Many exciting things! More game engine integrations, ongoing LibVLC 4 support, interop performance improvements and plenty of new integrations, samples and features are yet to be implemented.</p>

<p>We have a diverse and (mostly) well-defined <a href="https://code.videolan.org/videolan/LibVLCSharp/-/issues">backlog</a> of both features to implement and bugs to fix, with a varying degree of difficulty, and always welcome new contributors. We are available on the <a href="https://discord.gg/3h3K3JF">LibVLC community Discord server</a> (320+ members).</p>

<p>I recently mass refactored our production codebase at work. And I did so without the fear of breaking things. It was a full-stack refactor, and I did changes to our apps, test code and DevOps code. After finishing the mass refactor, I did zero manual testing. So, how did I do this? With the help of automated testing like this, of course:</p>

<p>In the rest of this article, I will give you a sense of how large refactors are done in production codebases of large enterprise products. I will talk more about the product that I worked on more in a moment. I will also explain the tools and technologies that helped me in the process of mass refactoring.</p>

<h2 id="what-did-i-do">What Did I Do?</h2>
<p>I have refactored our large production codebase over the span of four months. I did this refactor module by module and product by product. I have probably touched our entire tech stack during this (hence the importance of being a full-stack engineer!). I made changes to our clients (mobile and desktop) in their UI and core code. I adapted our tests code to the changes that I’ve done to the product. I have also changed our DevOps code extensively, to accommodate the changes I’ve done to the product and test code. Following animation is from my method chaining article, which was partly inspired by the changes that I did to our test framework. If you want to check out the full article, it is in the resources section above.</p>

<video width="790" height="300" controls=""><source src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/media/method_chaining.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<p>Changes were mostly technical (i.e. swap one JSON library with another, adapt the code to new UI libs, use method chaining in test code etc.) so correctness of the changes from product management perspective was not entirely relevant. However, verifying that functionality remained the same, and everything continued to work in production as-is was #1 priority. Further code level changes that I’ve done is not the point of this article so I won’t dig deeper. I did most of my refactors using IntelliJ IDEA, which supports all the programming languages we use and has enormous refactoring capabilities. We also have a ton of static code analyzers, linters, and code reformatters built into our continuous-integration process, which was also very helpful in detecting defects at code level early on. Finally, our code peer-review process using pull-requests has the most important code quality assurance factor.</p>

<p>After I was done with the refactors, I made zero manual testing on our products. Neither did I have any fear of breaking things during this mass refactor. And oh boy, did break things! So why was I not fearful of breaking things? Because I knew that I could identify and fix what I broke during the refactoring process. I will talk more about our quality assurance tech in a moment.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-our-product">What is Our Product?</h2>
<p>Our product is a large enterprise VPN software. It has been under development by a large team for the last 5+ years, so it has a considerably complex codebase. It has key hardware integrations, so reliability is quite important. When you integrate software and hardware features, you get a large surface area for bugs. Testing the hardware integrations is incredibly daunting since you need to get the hardware in test to the right state to test things correctly every time. In addition, we have clients for all major desktop and mobile OSes, and a vast DevOps infrastructure to automate the assembly of these clients. I want to leave a bit of mystery here, as I will write a separate article on what I do in my day-to-day work.</p>

<h2 id="why-was-i-so-confident">Why Was I So Confident?</h2>
<p>As a senior engineer, it is my duty to initiate and take on riskier projects. When done right, a large refactor and a refresh of the codebase can make working with the products a joy again. While initiating this mass refactor project, I was fully confident that I would not end up destroying our products, as I knew that a considerable number of automated end-to-end tests that I implemented over long years got my back. Also, I have recently created a mobile device farm, extending our end-to-end testing coverage to mobile devices. As you can see in the following photo, I have Android devices on the left and iOS devices on the right, and a MacBook as the host. All the connected devices are controller by the host machine:</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/how-i-mass-refactored-our-production-codebase-without-fear/media/device_farm.jpg" alt="My Device Farm Implementation"></p>

<p>Mass end-to-end testing like this, also known as acceptance testing, makes mass refactoring a less worrisome task. However, you still have to trigger tests every time you complete a part of your refactor and make sure to fix any broken tests or features. Depending on the test suite size and availability of automation hardware, this might take days. Of course, to verify the full correctness of my refactors, I had the run the entire test suite, and not just the end-to-end tests. Our unit and integration test coverage is also solid and they run on our CI servers as a part of our build process. Especially having integration tests that verify our software design decisions were invaluable, including our API endpoints and other 3rd party software integrations. Especially when dealing with our software’s modules written in scripting languages (JavaScript, Python, etc.), our unit tests came in quite handy. I depend on those unit tests to verify that I broke none of the expected input/output types, as the compiler cannot do it for me in a dynamic programming languages</p>

<p>Before going into device farms, let me briefly mention automated testing.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-automated-testing">What is Automated Testing?</h2>
<p>In summary, automated testing has three main parts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Unit testing. Unit testing tests the smallest sections of your code, which is mostly going to be your functions. You can even have multiple tests per function based on the behavior of your functions. And there are some great frameworks for it like NUnit, JUnit, Mocha, etc. which will help you organize your tests better.</li>
  <li>Integration testing. As the name suggests, integration testing tests the integration of your software components. For instance, one integration test can test the integration of multiple functions, classes, or even modules. You can use the same unit testing frameworks that I mentioned above for integration testing too.</li>
  <li>End-to-end (acceptance) testing. This is the endgame. End-to-end testing is where you test your product just like an end-user would do. You simulate real user interactions with your product using end-to-end testing frameworks like Selenium, Appium, etc. More on this in the next section.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have a complete video on software quality assurance where I describe how software companies test their products, starting with unit tests and going all the way to end-to-end (acceptance) testing level. If you want to see it, link to it is in the resources section above.</p>

<h2 id="device-farms-and-test-labs">Device Farms and Test Labs</h2>
<p>Now comes the fun part. This is where you get to play with your products on real devices. Of course, you don’t want to play with the devices indefinitely; you want to automate that process. For my device farm implementation for our products, I used Appium, which uses Selenium’s WebDriver protocol for all clients. Appium can control both web apps and native apps. It can even control hybrid web UI + native core apps (i.e. Electron apps). A single Appium server instance running in a host machine can control all the connected devices, and the apps and browsers installed on those devices:</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/how-i-mass-refactored-our-production-codebase-without-fear/media/appium_architecture_diagram.png" alt="Appium Architecture Diagram"></p>

<p>In my implementation, I connected all our mobile devices to a single host machine via a USB hub, and the host machine is controller by Appium:</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/how-i-mass-refactored-our-production-codebase-without-fear/media/device_farm_usb_hub.jpg" alt="Device Farm With USB Hub"></p>

<p>Now let’s watch my device farm implementation in live-action in our office:</p>

<video width="790" height="300" controls=""><source src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/media/device_farm.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<p>As you can see, I have both Android and iOS devices connected to a single MacBook. Everything except for one power-hungry tablet is going through the USB hub. It is a little messy, but it has been working great. When someone triggers an automated test run, one of the devices is selected at random for the given platform. Then the entire test suit runs on that device, and the test results are collected. There is quite a bit of room for improvement, but this, along with our similar setup for desktop clients, enabled me to make extensive changes to our sensitive production codebase with confidence.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize that automated testing on real devices is substantially better than manual testing in the long run. You will save a ton of time via automation like this, and you can keep expending your testing coverage for your optimum quality assurance needs. You really don’t need to take the route that I took and implement all these yourself. You can utilize ready-to-use device farms provided by Google Firebase Test Lab, Amazon Device Farm, etc.:</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/how-i-mass-refactored-our-production-codebase-without-fear/media/firebase_test_lab.png" alt="Firebase Test Lab"></p>

<p>However, if you choose to implement your own device farm, remember that a lot of the publicly available device farms were born from internal implementations as I did. So you can always provide parts of your infrastructure as a service if you ever decide to go IaaS/SaaS route.</p>

<p>As a bonus in my implementation, people can RDP into the main test machine and control the phones remotely for manual testing when needed. Also, there are …</p></section></div></div>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> is a personal knowledge management and sharing system inspired by <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>, built on <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> and <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>You can use <strong>Foam</strong> for organising your research, keeping re-discoverable notes, writing long-form content and, optionally, publishing it to the web.</p>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> is free, open source, and extremely extensible to suit your personal workflow. You own the information you create with Foam, and you’re free to share it, and collaborate on it with anyone you want.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-use-foam">How do I use Foam?</h2>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> is a tool that supports creating relationships between thoughts and information to help you think better.</p>

<p><img src="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/assets/images/foam-features-dark-mode-demo.png" alt="Foam kitchen sink, showing a few of the key features"></p>

<p>Whether you want to build a <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/">Second Brain</a> or a <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/">Zettelkasten</a>, write a book, or just get better at long-term learning, <strong>Foam</strong> can help you organise your thoughts if you follow these simple rules:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a single <strong>Foam</strong> workspace for all your knowledge and research following the <a href="#getting-started">Getting started</a> guide.</li>
  <li>Write your thoughts in markdown documents (I like to call them <strong>Bubbles</strong>, but that might be more than a little twee). These documents should be atomic: Put things that belong together into a single document, and limit its content to that single topic. (<a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/#principles">source</a>)</li>
  <li>Use Foam’s shortcuts and autocompletions to link your thoughts together with <code>[[wiki-links]]</code>, and navigate between them to explore your knowledge graph.</li>
  <li>Get an overview of your <strong>Foam</strong> workspace using a [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/features/graph-visualisation.md" title="Graph Visualisation">graph-visualisation</a>] (⚠️ WIP), and discover relationships between your thoughts with the use of [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/features/backlinking.md" title="Backlinking">backlinking</a>].</li>
</ol>

<p>Foam is a like a bathtub: <em>What you get out of it depends on what you put into it.</em></p>

<h2 id="whats-in-a-foam">What’s in a Foam?</h2>

<p>Like the soapy suds it’s named after, <strong>Foam</strong> is mostly air.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The editing experience of <strong>Foam</strong> is powered by VS Code, enhanced by workspace settings that glue together [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recommended-extensions.md" title="Recommended Extensions">recommended-extensions</a>] and preferences optimised for writing and navigating information.</li>
  <li>To back up, collaborate on and share your content between devices, Foam pairs well with <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</li>
  <li>To publish your content, you can set it up to publish to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> with zero code and zero config, or to any website hosting platform like <a href="http://netlify.com/">Netlify</a> or <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: This documentation was researched, written and published using <strong>Foam</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>⚠️ Foam is still in preview. Expect the experience to be a little rough.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These instructions assume you have a GitHub account, and you have Visual Studio Code installed.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Use the <a href="https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template">foam-template project</a> to generate a new repository. If you’re logged into GitHub, you can just hit this button:</p>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template/generate" data-icon="octicon-repo-template" data-size="large" aria-label="Use this template foambubble/foam-template on GitHub">Use this template</a></p>

    <p><em>If you want to keep your thoughts to yourself, remember to set the repository private, or if you don’t want to use GitHub to host your workspace at all, choose <a href="https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template/archive/master.zip"><strong>Download as ZIP</strong></a> instead of <strong>Use this template</strong>.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository">Clone the repository locally</a> and open it in VS Code.</p>

    <p><em>Open the repository as a folder using the <code>File &gt; Open...</code> menu item. In VS Code, “open workspace” refers to <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces">multi-root workspaces</a>.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When prompted to install recommended extensions, click <strong>Install all</strong> (or <strong>Show Recommendations</strong> if you want to review and install them one by one)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>After setting up the repository, open <code>.vscode/settings.json</code> and edit, add or remove any settings you’d like for your Foam workspace.</p>

<p>To learn more about how to use <strong>Foam</strong>, read the [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes/recipes.md" title="Recipes">recipes</a>].</p>

<p>Getting stuck in the setup? Read the [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/frequently-asked-questions.md" title="Frequently Asked Questions">frequently-asked-questions</a>].</p>

<p>Check our <a href="http://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues">issues on GitHub</a> if you get stuck on something, and create a new one if something doesn’t seem right!</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> doesn’t have features in the traditional sense. Out of the box, you have access to all features of VS Code and all the [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recommended-extensions.md" title="Recommended Extensions">recommended-extensions</a>] you choose to install, but it’s up to you to discover what you can do with it!</p>

<p><img src="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/assets/images/foam-navigation-demo.gif" alt="Short video of Foam in use"></p>

<p>Head over to [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes/recipes.md" title="Recipes">recipes</a>] for some useful patterns and ideas!</p>

<h2 id="call-to-adventure">Call To Adventure</h2>

<p>The goal of <strong>Foam</strong> is to be your personal companion on your quest for knowledge.</p>

<p>It’s currently about “10% ready” relative to all the features I’ve thought of, but I’ve only thought of ~1% of the features it could have, and I’m excited to learn from others.</p>

<p>I am using it as my personal thinking tool. By making it public, I hope to learn from others not only how to improve Foam, but also to improve how I learn and manage information.</p>

<p>If that sounds like something you’re interested in, I’d love to have you along on the journey.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Read about our [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/principles.md" title="Principles">principles</a>] to understand Foam’s philosophy and direction</li>
  <li>Read the [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/contribution-guide.md" title="Contribution Guide">contribution-guide</a>] guide to learn how to participate.</li>
  <li>Feel free to open <a href="https://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues">GitHub issues</a> to give me feedback and ideas for new features.</li>
</ul>

<p>Aurora is an <a href="https://cloud.netapp.com/blog/aws-cvo-blg-aws-databases-the-power-of-purpose-built-database-engines" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AWS database</a>&nbsp;service that is compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL, but uses an innovative database engine behind the scenes. Applications that currently use MySQL/PostgreSQL can be migrated to Aurora with minor or no changes.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>An Aurora database instance can store between 10 GB—64 TB, with data divided into 10 GB blocks and distributed on different disks.</p>
<p>Aurora offers easy scalability—storage is scaled automatically when the database grows, and to support more read requests, you can create up to 15 Aurora Read Replicas.</p>

<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">
<p>Relational Database Service (RDS) is a managed database service that supports several popular database engines, including: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, MariaDB, and Oracle.</p>
<p>RDS can help you perform a wide range of database management tasks, including data backup and recovery, patching, and migrations.</p>
<p>RDS automatically backs up database instances, captures daily snapshots of data, preserves transaction logs, and enables point-in-time recovery. Additionally, the service automatically patches database engine software.</p>
<p>To improve the reliability and availability of workloads, RDS enables replication of databases with automated failover across several availability zones.</p>

<h2 id="sub_2">AWS Aurora vs RDS: Feature Comparison</h2>
<p>Here are a few ways Aurora compares to Amazon RDS.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p><strong>Amazon RDS</strong> improves I/O performance by using SSDs for database storage. You can choose between two SSD storage options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Optimized OLTP</strong>—storage is optimized for high I/O transaction database workloads. Each database instance can support up to 30,000 IOPS.</li>
<li><strong>General purpose</strong>—cost effective hardware offering 3 IOPS per stored GB.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Amazon Aurora</strong>&nbsp;improves on the performance of standard MySQL by 5x, and improves on standard PostgreSQL by 2x, with the same hardware configuration. Aurora is a new database engine built to make the most of available compute capacity, memory, and network bandwidth.</p>
<h3>Storage</h3>
<p><strong>Amazon RDS</strong> can provision storage up to 6TB, on-demand without downtime.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon Aurora</strong> automatically increases storage from a minimum of 10 GB to a maximum of 64 TB, in increments of 10 GB, based on current usage—you do not need to pre-configure storage. Storage scaling does not affect database performance.</p>
<p>However, for MySQL, Aurora only supports the InnoDB storage engine. Tables are automatically converted if they use another storage engine.</p>
<h3>Replication</h3>
<p><strong>Amazon RDS </strong>allows up to five live database copies, known as read replicas. RDS failover is done manually, so some data loss may occur.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon Aurora</strong> also provides read replicas, which share the same data volume as the original database instance. Up to 15 read replicas are supported. Failover is done fully automatically with no data loss. It also supports creating a highly available database cluster with synchronous replication across multiple availability zones.</p>
<h3>Backup</h3>
<p><strong>Amazon RDS</strong> performs a daily snapshot of your database, and saves transaction logs to allow point-in-time recovery. The snapshot occurs during a backup window you can specify. While the snapshot is being taken, storage I/O may be interrupted while data is copied, affecting database performance. Backups are saved to S3 with very high durability.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon Aurora</strong> backups are continuous, incremental backups that do not affect database performance. Also, there is no need to take frequent snapshots to enable point in time recovery.</p>
<h2 id="sub_3">Amazon RDS or Aurora? Factors to Consider Before Choosing</h2>
<p>We covered a feature by feature comparison of the two database services. Here are some other important considerations before you select the service that is right for you.</p>
<p><strong>Availability</strong></p>
<p>Especially for production databases, <a href="https://cloudian.com/guides/backup-cloud-storage/data-backup-in-depth/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">data backup </a>is a critical consideration. Aurora offers higher availability and better resilience than RDS, due to its unique storage model, and ability to perform continuous backups and restore with a very low recovery point objective (RPO).</p>
<p><strong>Database engine support</strong></p>
<p>Aurora only supports MySQL and PostgreSQL. If you need to run other database engines, such as SQL Server, you will need to opt for RDS.</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong></p>
<p>Aurora is generally more expensive than RDS for the same workloads. RDS is priced based on type and size of instance and EBS volume. Aurora pricing is mainly based on instance size and storage is billed according to actual usage. Keep in mind read replicas represent an extra cost in both platforms.</p>
<h2 id="sub_4">AWS Aurora and RDS with Thundra</h2>
<p>Thundra provides deep insights into the microservice applications. Todays’ distributed applications are developed and served on the cloud, and modern tools like Thundra enable developers to trace their apps and debug the code easily. Thundra instruments in a plug and play fashion and automatically traces the requests made to Aurora and RDS databases. You can understand what the query is and the duration of the query made to the database. Thundra provides data privacy by enabling the users to mask their sensitive data inside the calls. <a href="https://blog.thundra.io/which-database-should-i-choose-for-my-serverless-applications" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Check this blog post</a> where we discuss which database to choose for cloud applications.</p></span>

<h2>Reverse Engineering The Great Escape</h2>

<p><dfn>The Great Escape</dfn> is a classic 1986 prison break game for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum">48K ZX Spectrum</a>. I've spent a considerable amount of time reverse engineering its routines and documenting its workings while simultaneously reimplementing it as portable C code. The following pages describe the process I went through.</p>

<p>This is an expanded-upon write-up of some of what I can dimly recall saying while presenting <a href="http://slides.com/dpt/the-great-escape/#/">these slides</a> to my team at INSIDE Secure (formerly Metaforic, now called <a href="https://www.verimatrix.com/">Verimatrix</a>) in Glasgow at a talk in January 2016.</p>

A lot has changed for me. I gave up management by quitting my job as a Director of Engineering and took a job as just a good ol' Software Engineer at <a href="https://ghostinspector.com/">Ghost Inspector</a>. A lot of reasoning went into that decision, but to sum it up: I was sick of commuting and managing. Considering what's happened in the last year, I'm glad I made that choice!</p><p>As a lifelong introvert, I was being drained on a daily basis by having to manage other people. I had been juggling that while still coding for about four years straight. During that time, I was a user of Ghost Inspector, so when the opportunity opened up, I jumped at the chance to work there and I'm so glad that I did.</p><p>What attracted me to Ghost Inspector was the product, but what has kept me here is the amazing work environment. There may be bigger, more exciting challenges in the job market, but working here is without a doubt the best job I've ever had! For most of my career, I jumped from company to company, looking for that "hockey stick growth". But what I eventually realized is that I'd rather have stability and trust. At previous startups, we were only stable for the few months after the most recent funding round.&nbsp;<a href="https://ghostinspector.com/about/">Justin and the rest of the team</a>&nbsp;have built a business that grows at a very sustainable pace. We're only beholden to our customers, not venture capital investors. The only deadlines are the ones we set for ourselves, and those are pretty rare.</p><p>The typical Agile process used by most software companies creates a lot of meetings that, in my opinion, are not respectful of a software developer's time. The majority of meetings are focused on determining what they should work on, when they should start, and how long it should take. A system designed around tracking velocity with points, will heavily incentivize speed and efficiency. So now all those meetings talking about work, instead of doing it, feel like impediments to completing points. I have worked at places that handle this better than others, but there's always that underlying pressure that creates at least a bit of animosity around meetings.</p><p>We have a completely different process at Ghost Inspector. I would describe our software development methodology as Agile-lite -- we take the few good parts and leave the rest behind. We have a backlog of epics and stories with all the good features we want to deliver to our customers. However we&nbsp;<strong>don't do sprints</strong>. Without sprints, we're able to skip all the other Agile rituals that I personally loath. Here's a list of all the&nbsp;<a href="https://dzone.com/articles/types-of-meetings-in-scrum-and-agile">meetings we don't do</a>. No sprints means no sprint planning. No points means no estimation meetings. Without a product owner needing to constantly check the velocity of every story, we don't need to give a status update every day. We generally only meet once a week. Thankfully, not once do I remember anyone saying the word "blocker".</p><p>I've lost track of the amount of time wasted on just scheduling meetings at previous companies. Even the daily status was always hotly debated. Too early and all the night owls are grumbling. Too late and you risk interrupting the flow of the early birds. I can't tell you how nice it is to stop thinking so much about&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;we work and instead just think about the actual work. My levels of stress have been reduced to an extremely low level while working here. The meetings we do have feel particularly important and useful and I welcome them!</p><p>As a developer, I have all the autonomy I could ever wish for. There are constant opportunities to learn new skills. We don't work on the bleeding edge by any means, but we have a diverse set of projects that allow us to experiment with new technologies. Here's a truncated list of all the different projects I've worked on in the last year and a half:</p><ul><li><a href="https://ghostinspector.com/blog/continuous-integration-testing-for-wordpress/">a WordPress plugin with e2e tests in Docker on CI</a></li><li>two-factor authentication using Auth0</li><li>rebuilt the browser extension in React.js</li><li>built a user-facing search engine with Elasticsearch</li><li>added API endpoints to export to CSV (with documentation!)</li><li>created a deploy script with an <a href="https://github.com/nanovazquez/yargs-interactive">interactive CLI</a> and GitHub action checks</li><li>wrote <a href="https://ghostinspector.com/blog/ghost-inspector-wordpress-plugin/">several</a> <a href="https://ghostinspector.com/blog/develop-wordpress-plugin-with-webpack-and-react/">different</a> <a href="https://ghostinspector.com/blog/automated-ui-testing-for-wordpress/">blog</a> <a href="https://ghostinspector.com/blog/continuous-integration-testing-for-wordpress/">posts</a></li></ul><p>All of this is possible because we have a rock-solid customer base, a stable system for our application, a team who trusts and respects each other, and a CEO who enables us to do our best work. I'm really happy to have joined the team.</p><p>Follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/simpixelated">Twitter</a> and don't hesitate to send me a message if you have any questions about moving from management back to individual contributor, or using the good parts of agile, or how to avoid meetings!

<p>Email is a powerful tool that is an inextricable part of everyone’s lives.
Despite countless valiant efforts to kill it and replace it with something
better, email continues to live on in more or less the same form it has had
since the 1990s. Technology that endures this long deserves a fair amount of
attention and praise.</p>

<p>There are two main reasons why email continues to be useful today. It is simple
to use, and it is not owned or controlled by a single company. Every attempted
replacement has failed at excelling in either one or both of those qualities.
Simple tools can often be extended in ways that the original authors never could
have imagined in the beginning. And because users are in control of the core
functionality, new use cases can be explored completely independently.</p>

<p>Computer users have a tendency to over-generalize when solving problems. In
other words, when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. In
this post, we are going to be looking at a lot of nails that can probably be
hammered down with email. At a fundamental level, email clients are tools
designed for storing and retrieving sequences of messages which can contain
arbitrary data. Looking at it this way, it is not difficult to imagine a variety
of use cases that can be accomplished with minimal amounts of scripting.</p>

<p>I do seriously think that email is a solid tool for a lot of these purposes, and
in fact use it as such for a few of these purposes every day. However, the main
purpose of this post is exploration, not general advice.</p>

<h2 id="to-do-list-one-that-you-actually-check">To-Do List (One That You Actually Check)</h2>

<p><img src="http://zanneth.com/assets/post-assets/email/todo-list.png" alt="To-Do List"></p>

<p>The first use case is pretty obvious, and it is one that likely a large number of
people already employ on a daily basis.</p>

<p>By far the single most important productivity discovery that I made in my life
is <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2006/01/04/email-dmz">Inbox Zero</a>. Inbox Zero is
the simple idea that your email inbox should contain only a list of messages
that require some sort of action. Once the action associated with those messages
is completed, the message is archived or moved to a different folder. I have
been using Inbox Zero for years now and I rarely forget to do anything
important after integrating it into my life.</p>

<p>Need to remember to pack for your flight next week? You probably already got a
confirmation about your reservation in your email. Leave it in your inbox until
you are finished preparing for your trip, and archive it when you are done.</p>

<p>How about one-off reminders that are not associated with messages already in
your inbox? Just send an email to yourself with the action item in the subject
line. Use the body of the message to write down any notes you want, and reply to
the message to keep a record of additional notes if you need them.</p>

<p>What about periodic reminders that repeat on some interval, like reminding
yourself to pay a bill on time every month? Write a simple script that sends you
an email about it and schedule it to run once a month. At the end of each month,
you will have a new to-do item in your inbox with an actionable task in the
subject line.</p>

<p>The great part about using email as a to-do list is that you are already
checking it with some degree of regularity. Smartphone apps or web-based to-do
lists quickly lose their value the moment users lose interest or switch to using
something else. They also frequently become buggy or overburdened with features
that don’t add any value. This will never be a problem with email because you
can always use your favorite client as long as it continues to work with the
standard protocols. Syncing across multiple devices is a given, since your email
is already doing this.</p>

<h2 id="news-reader">News Reader</h2>

<p><img src="http://zanneth.com/assets/post-assets/email/rss2email.png" alt="RSS"></p>

<p>RSS is a really elegant and simple way to subscribe to a feed of updates from
your favorite websites. Since the early 2000s, RSS has been integrated into a
lot of different services all across the net, and serves as the foundation for a
variety of different web-based content platforms such as podcasts.</p>

<p>In order to actually use RSS, you need a client that is capable of aggregating
entries from multiple different feeds and displaying them in some manner.
Managing a list of entries, tracking read or unread state, and displaying HTML
content is exactly what every email client is already good at doing.</p>

<p>I like using <a href="https://github.com/rss2email/rss2email">rss2email</a> for this.
rss2email delivers stories from my feeds into a special mailbox on my email
server that I check approximately every morning. Since the end result is just
IMAP messages stored on my email server, I can read them using my favorite
email client on whatever device I happen to be using that day.</p>



<p><img src="http://zanneth.com/assets/post-assets/email/update-blog.png" alt="Updating a Blog"></p>

<p>Setting up a frictionless workflow for updating your personal website can be
rather difficult, especially if you want to be able to do it while on-the-go and
away from your usual workstation.</p>

<p>If you are maintaining a blog on a personal website or for a business, the focus
should primarily be on the content itself and not on writing markup, updating a
source control repository, or publishing static content to a file server or
database. At the end of the day, you want to be able to write your content in a
message and send it to your server to publish.</p>

<p>Writing rich-text or plain-text content, saving drafts, and publishing that
content to a server is the perfect job for an email client. Your email client
can even allow including inline images sent as attachments, or links that point
to other websites. Once you are done writing your post, send it to a special
email address that activates a script on the other end to convert your email
message into a blog post. <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x135.html">PGP</a>
can be used by both the client and the server to ensure that it is actually you
who is authoring the blog post and not someone else. Forget about OAuth or
anything more complicated than that.</p>

<p>Social media feeds can be updated in a similar manner. All of your server-side
functionality can be multiplexed using different email addresses for each
service. For example, you can use <code>blog@mydomain.com</code> to send updates to your
blog, and <code>mastodon@mydomain.com</code> to publish toots on your
<a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a> account. Writing the code for this is a
breeze, since your favorite programming language already has libraries for
dealing with SMTP and IMAP.</p>

<h2 id="a-user-interface-to-a-search-engine-or-database">A User Interface to a Search Engine or Database</h2>

<p>It’s pretty simple to build an API for a web service these days. However,
choosing the right library or designing the right API can sometimes be an
unnecessary burden when working on a personal project that only has one or two
users.</p>

<p>Email can be used as an interface between a user and a web service when the
input and output are simple enough.</p>

<p>For example, imagine that you have a file server with a large amount of photos
stored on it and you want to be able to search those photos and retrieve them at
random. The server could use machine learning libraries such as Tensorflow to
categorize the photos and attach metadata on them.</p>

<p>Instead of building a custom web-based user interface for this, you could use
email instead. The user sends an email with the search term in the subject line,
such as “pizza”, to a special email address that corresponds to the file server
containing the photos. Just like in the previous example, PGP or S-MIME can be
used as an authentication mechanism to ensure that only authorized users can
access the photos being requested. Once the server has collected a search
result, it replies to the query email with matching photos attached as MIME
parts. The email server keeps a record of previous queries, along with their
returned results as replies, in an easily displayable and searchable format.</p>

<h2 id="the-only-limit-is-your-imagination">The Only Limit is Your Imagination</h2>

<p>Connecting email accounts to small shell scripts is a simple but powerful
concept that can unlock a wide variety of different applications. You can build
these apps with the comforting knowledge that they are all based on federated
and robust protocols used by hundreds of different email clients which have
stood the test of time.</p>

<p>Using the rich text editing features of your email client, combined with a
hierarchical organization system based on folders, allows you to do a lot of
tasks that have previously been accomplished using buggy and monolithic tools.
Privacy and security issues that plague web-based tools can be effectively
avoided when using email, because you are in control of both the client and
the server. You also get syncing to multiple devices for free, since IMAP was
designed to facilitate managing email from multiple clients at once since the
beginning.</p>

<p>I’m always interested in learning about new uses of email. If you know about
some of these yourself, send me an email about them.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">






<p> In an announcement that has stunned the computer industry, Ken
Thompson, Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan admitted that the Unix
operating system and C programming language created by them is an
elaborate prank kept alive for over 20 years. Speaking at the recent
UnixWorld Software Development Forum, Thompson revealed the following:</p>

<p> "In 1969, AT&amp;T had just terminated their work with the
GE/Honeywell/AT&amp;T Multics project. Brian and I had started work with an
early release of Pascal from Professor Niklaus Wirth's ETH Labs in
Switzerland and we were impressed with its elegant simplicity and power.
Dennis had just finished reading 'Bored of the Rings', a National Lampoon
parody of the Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. As a lark, we decided
to do parodies of the Multics environment and Pascal. Dennis and I were
responsible for the operating environment. We looked at Multics and
designed the new OS to be as complex and cryptic as possible to maximize
casual users' frustration levels, calling it Unix as a parody of Multics,
as well as other more risque! allusions. We sold the terse command
language to novitiates by telling them that it saved them typing.  </p>

<p> Then Dennis and Brian worked on a warped version of Pascal, called
'A'.  'A' looked a lot like Pascal, but elevated the notion of the direct
memory address (which Wirth had banished) to the central concept of the
"pointer" as an innocuous sounding name for a truly malevolent construct.
Brian must be credited with the idea of having absolutely no standard I/O
specification: this ensured that at least 50% of the typical commercial
program would have to be re-coded when changing hardware platforms.  </p>

<p> Brian was also responsible for pitching this lack of I/O as a feature: 
it allowed us to describe the language as "truly portable". When we found
others were actually creating real programs with A, we removed compulsory
type-checking on function arguments. Later, we added a notion we called
"casting": this allowed the programmer to treat an integer as though it
were a 50kb user-defined structure. When we found that some programmers
were simply not using pointers, we eliminated the ability to pass
structures to functions, enforcing their use in even the simplest
applications. We sold this, and many other features, as enhancements to
the efficiency of the language. In this way, our prank evolved into B,
BCPL, and finally C.  </p>

<p> We stopped when we got a clean compile on the following syntax: 
<code>for(;P("\n"),R-;P("|"))for(e=C;e-;P("_"+(*u++/8)%2))P("|
"+(*u/4)%2);  </code>

</p><p> At one time, we joked about selling this to the Soviets to set their
computer science progress back 20 or more years.  </p>

<p> Unfortunately, AT&amp;T and other US corporations actually began using
Unix and C. We decided we'd better keep mum, assuming it was just a
passing phase. In fact, it's taken US companies over 20 years to develop
enough expertise to generate useful applications using this 1960's
technological parody. We are impressed with the tenacity of the general
Unix and C programmer. In fact, Brian, Dennis and I have never ourselves
attempted to write a commercial application in this environment.  </p>

<p> We feel really guilty about the chaos, confusion and truly awesome
programming projects that have resulted from our silly prank so long ago." 
</p>

<p> Dennis Ritchie said: "What really tore it (just when ADA was catching
on), was that Bjarne Stroustrup caught onto our joke. He extended it to
further parody Smalltalk. Like us, he was caught by surprise when nobody
laughed. So he added multiple inheritance, virtual base classes, and later
...templates. All to no avail. So we now have compilers that can compile
100,000 lines per second, but need to process header files for 25 minutes
before they get to the meat of "Hello, World".  </p>

<p> Major Unix and C vendors and customers, including AT&amp;T, Microsoft,
Hewlett-Packard, GTE, NCR, and DEC have refused comment at this time. 
</p>

<p> Borland International, a leading vendor of object-oriented tools,
including the popular Turbo Pascal and Borland C++, stated they had
suspected for Windows was originally written in C++. Philippe Kahn said:
"After two and a half years programming, and massive programmer burn-outs,
we re-coded the whole thing in Turbo Pascal in three months. I think it's
fair to say that Turbo Pascal saved our bacon". Another Borland spokesman
said that they would continue to enhance their Pascal products and halt
further efforts to develop C/C++.  </p>

<p> Professor Wirth of the ETH Institute and father of the Pascal, Modula
2, and Oberon structured languages, cryptically said "P.T. Barnum was
right." He had no further comments.  </p>

January 13, 2021 | https://cp4space.hatsya.com/2021/01/08/the-neural-network-of-the-stockfish-chess-engine/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://cp4space.hatsya.com/2021/01/08/the-neural-network-of-the-stockfish-chess-engine/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						<p>Last time, we <a href="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/2020/12/13/shallow-trees-with-heavy-leaves/">briefly mentioned</a> the high-level differences between Stockfish and Leela Chess.</p>
<p>To recap, Stockfish evaluates about 100 million positions per second using rudimentary heuristics, whereas Leela Chess evaluates 40 000 positions per second using a deep neural network trained from millions of games of self-play. They also use different tree search approaches: Stockfish uses a variant of alpha-beta pruning, whereas Leela Chess uses Monte Carlo tree search.</p>
<p>An important recent change to Stockfish was to introduce a neural network to evaluate the positions in the search tree, instead of just relying on hardcoded heuristics. It’s still much simpler than Leela Chess’s neural network, and only slows down Stockfish to exploring 50 million positions per second.</p>
<p>The real cleverness of Stockfish’s neural network is that it’s an <strong>efficiently-updatable neural network (NNUE)</strong>. Specifically, it’s a simple feedforward network with:</p>
<ul>
<li>a large (10.5M parameters!) input layer, illustrated below, that can utilise two different levels of sparsity for computational efficiency;</li>
<li>three much smaller layers (with 17.5k parameters in total) which are evaluated densely using vector instructions;</li>
<li>a single scalar output to give a numerical score for the position, indicating how favourable it is for the player about to move.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything is done using integer arithmetic, with 16-bit weights in the first layer and 8-bit weights in the remaining layers.</p>
<h3>The input layer</h3>
<p>Let’s begin by studying the first — and most interesting — layer. Here’s an illustration I made using Wolfram Mathematica:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nnue-initial.png" alt="" width="640" height="760" srcset="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nnue-initial.png 640w, https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nnue-initial-253x300.png 253w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></p>
<p>The inputs to the layer are two sparse binary arrays, each consisting of 41024 elements. It may seem highly redundant to encode a chess position using 82048 binary features, but this is similar to <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2016/06/wide-deep-learning-better-together-with.html">an approach</a> (called ‘feature crosses’) used in recommender systems.</p>
<p>What are the two sparse binary arrays, and why do they have 41024 features? My preferred way of interpreting these two arrays are as the ‘worldviews’ of the white king and the black king. In particular, the differences are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coordinate systems:</strong> because black and white pawns move in opposite directions, the two players need to ‘see the board from opposite angles’. This already happens in regular (human) chess because the two players are seated opposite each other at the chessboard, so one player’s ‘top’ is the other player’s ‘bottom’. If you imagine each player numbering the squares from top to bottom, left to right, then any physical square would be called <em>n</em> by one player and 63 − <em>n</em> by the other player.</li>
<li><strong>Piece types:</strong> instead of viewing the pieces as black or white, a player sees it as either ‘mine’ or ‘theirs’. The 10 non-king piece types are thus {my pawn, their pawn, my knight, their knight, my bishop, their bishop, my rook, their rook, my queen, their queen}.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason for these ‘player-relative coordinate systems’ is that it means that Stockfish can use the same neural network irrespective of whether it’s playing as white or black. The network uses <em>both</em> your king’s worldview and your enemy king’s worldview for evaluating a position, because they’re both highly relevant (you want to protect your own king and capture your enemy’s king).</p>
<p>So, why does each worldview have 41024 features? It can be seen as an outer product (or tensor product) of:</p>
<ul>
<li>a 64-element feature encoding the position of the king whose worldview this is, in their own coordinate system. This is ‘one-hot encoding’, where exactly one of the 64 entries is ‘1’ and the other 63 entries are ‘0’.</li>
<li>a 641-element feature encoding, for each of the 64 × 10 ordered pairs (square, piece-type), whether or not that square is occupied by that piece. The 641st element is unused, and is (according to the <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Stockfish_NNUE">Chess Programming Wiki</a>) apparently a result of the network being ported from Shogi to chess.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the two 64-by-641 outer product matrices* is then flattened (the matrix is ‘reshaped’ into a vector with the same entries) to yield the corresponding 41024-element ‘sparse worldview’. In the input layer, each of the two 41024-element sparse worldviews are then affinely transformed to form a 256-element ‘dense worldview’.</p>
<p><strong>*Important note:</strong> the 41024-element sparse binary arrays are never explicitly materialised, either as a 64-by-641 matrix or as a 41024-element vector. The Stockfish NNUE effectively ‘fuses’ the construction of these sparse vectors with the subsequent affine transformation (described below), updating the 256-element dense worldviews directly when the configuration of pieces on the chessboard is modified.</p>
<p>There are <strong>two levels of sparsity</strong> which are utilised when computing this affine transformation from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7B41024%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbb{R}^{41024}" title="\mathbb{R}^{41024}"> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7B256%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbb{R}^{256}" title="\mathbb{R}^{256}">, allowing the network to be efficiently evaluated many times in a tree search:</p>
<ul>
<li>the 41024-element implicit vectors are themselves sparse: the number of nonzero elements is equal to the number of non-king pieces on the board.</li>
<li>moving a piece typically changes very few of the entries of the vector: if it’s a regular non-king move, only 2 entries change; if it’s a non-king move with capture, then 3 entries change.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s this second aspect which warrants the name ‘efficiently updatable’: when a move is made (or unmade, since we’re doing a tree search), we only need to add/subtract a few 256-element matrix columns from the resulting ‘dense worldview’ to update it.</p>
<p>Unless a king is moved, this (2 or 3 vector additions/subtractions) beats summing all of the matrix columns corresponding to nonzero entries (up to 30 vector additions), which in turn unconditionally beats doing a regular dense matrix-vector multiplication (41024 vector additions). That is to say, the second-level sparsity is about 10 times more efficient than the first-level sparsity, which is in turn about 1000 times more efficient than naively doing a dense matrix-vector multiplication.</p>
<p>The two dense worldviews are concatenated according to which player is about to move, producing a 512-element vector, which is elementwise clamped to [0, 127]. This elementwise clamping is the nonlinear activation function of the input layer, and (as we’ll describe) the hidden layers use a similar activation function. We can think of this as a ‘clipped ReLU’, which is <a href="https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/blob/master/src/nnue/layers/clipped_relu.h">exactly what the Stockfish source code calls it</a>.</p>
<h3>The remaining layers</h3>
<p>The two hidden layers each use 8-bit weights and 32-bit biases. The activation function first divides the resulting 32-bit integer by 64 before again clamping to [0, 127], ready to be fed into the next layer. The output layer also uses 8-bit weights and 32-bit biases, but with no nonlinear activation function.</p>
<p>The first hidden layer takes 512 inputs (the clamped concatenated worldviews) and produces 32 outputs. The second hidden layer takes those 32 values as inputs, and again produces 32 outputs. The output layer takes those 32 values as inputs, and produces a single scalar output.</p>
<p>Since these subsequent layers are applied to dense vectors, they can’t use the same ‘efficiently updatable’ approach as the input layer; that’s why they’re necessarily substantially smaller. They can, however, use hardware vectorisation instructions (SSE/AVX) to apply the linear transformation and activation function.</p>
<p>This scalar output is then <a href="http://www.talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=75506&amp;start=9">further postprocessed</a> using other Stockfish heuristics, including taking into account the 50-move rule which isn’t otherwise incorporated into the evaluation function.</p>
<p>Observe that the neural network doesn’t actually have complete information, such as whether a pawn has just moved two squares (relevant to <em>en passant</em>), whether a king is able to castle, and various other information pertaining to the rather complicated rules for determining a draw. This is okay: the network is only being used as a cheap approximate evaluation for a position; when deciding what move to make, Stockfish performs a very deep tree search and only uses this approximate evaluation in the leaves.</p>
<p>Equivalently, you can think of this as being a massive refinement of the approach of ‘look a few moves ahead and see whether either player gains a material or positional advantage’, using a neural network as a much more sophisticated position-aware alternative of crudely ‘counting material’.</p>
<p>This is a neural network, so the weight matrices and bias vectors of the layers were learned by training the network on millions of positions and using backpropagation and a gradient-based optimiser. Of course, for supervised learning, you need a ‘ground truth’ for the network to attempt to learn, which seems somewhat circular: how do you even gather training data? The answer is that you use the classical version of Stockfish to evaluate positions <strong>using the deep tree search</strong>, and use that as your training data.</p>
<p>In theory, you could then train another copy of the NNUE using the NNUE-enhanced Stockfish as the evaluation function, and then iterate this process. Leela Chess does the same thing: its current network is trained on positions evaluated by using deep lookahead with the previous network as the leaf evaluation function. Note that the construction of the training data is orders of magnitude more expensive than training the network with this data, as you’re doing thousands of evaluations of the previous network (owing to the deep tree search) to construct each item of training data for the new network.</p>
<h3>Further reading</h3>
<p>The network is <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Stockfish_NNUE">described and illustrated</a> on the Chess Programming Wiki, which also has tonnes of references to forum discussions and other references. The first description of an NNUE was a Japanese paper by Yu Nasu (who suggested it for the board game Shogi instead of chess); the paper has <a href="https://github.com/asdfjkl/nnue">since been translated</a> into English and German. There’s also the Stockfish source code, which is very well organised (there’s <a href="https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/tree/master/src/nnue">a directory</a> for the NNUE) and clearly written.</p>

<p>This is a video of The Action Lab’s James Orgill painting the entire interior of a room he made out of insulation board with the world’s blackest commercially available paint, Musou black, which absorbs 99.4% of light. He then turns on an overhead light bulb to see what it looks like inside. It looks…weird. My eyes did not like that. Of course my eyes don’t like much besides being closed and napping if we’re being perfectly honest. Although occasionally they do request I push on them really hard with the fleshy parts of my palms below the thumbs until I get a headache and see all sorts of painful colors and patterns, but that’s rare. </p>
<p>Keep going for the video, the reveal and experimenting begins at 3:30.</p>

        <hr id="5022b494-4d62-4cdb-949e-71cde6598179">
        
        <hr id="70bf0a0b-e2be-4205-ab11-7380136e2a36">
        
        <p id="6595f0c7-f94b-4772-8c12-22b107c82c47">End-user databases are all the buzz these days — Notion, Airtable, Coda, Roam, etc. These products have made it possible for people to model information in a way that feels more natural and intuitive to the way we experience it in our daily lives.</p>
        <p id="69014b56-b04f-4baf-be70-2c0ba0ad30e9">I love building products like Notion, but building these kinds of products is hard. For two reasons:</p>
        <ol id="3c07bc59-4c8a-4b48-bdb0-1bf930336c2e" start="1">
          <li>Most people don't have the technical literacy about databases and information architecture to actually automate and organize their lives with these tools.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol id="d5625fcf-2e32-45ce-acc4-d73e1d38d037" start="2">
          <li>The databases we have today aren't well-suited for dynamic user-generated filters and sorts.</li>
        </ol>
        <p id="aa0edb68-c072-4214-acf9-8e6e243900dd">This second challenge is more technical and I will hide all of these programmer-related details behind a toggle so you don't have to read them if you'd like.</p>
        <ul id="33a92bec-cc3c-4881-9fda-d91198d3ffee">
          <li>
            <details>
              <summary>🤖 Technical Details</summary>
              <p id="64d9a82d-8237-4a9f-b83f-eb9eae786157">Underneath any end-user database is <em>another</em> database and so much complexity arises from the challenge of building a database inside a database. Solutions to this problem vary widely and make some sort of trade-off between scalability (performance) and complexity.</p>
              <p id="9dd2cc1a-1eb6-4af8-9c22-d486c3e9dc99">Some applications load the entire end-user database in-memory. This creates long initial load times, but really performant interactions once the application loads. There are obvious scalability issues with this approach, but it is fairly simple to implement.</p>
              <p id="e10696df-1d8a-47ff-9365-701d9ff58d00">Other applications resort to O(n) scans on the server to fetch data and filter/sort records in memory with a few caching and indexing optimizations when convenient. The problem here is that users can create their own columns and filters dynamically. If your cloud application is backed by a SQL database, for example, it’s worrisome to allow users to edit the database schema and create an unbounded number of tables and indexes. Thus, you must resort to filtering records in-memory.</p>
              <p id="30d92414-92a1-4469-99ba-643219826c94">If you're dedicated to O(log n) queries, you'll need to build indexes yourself (unless there's some amazing database I am unaware of). On every write, you can compute what indexes need to be updated and you write to a NoSQL database to incrementally update a cached query result. This can lead to a good solution, but it comes at the cost of consistency. Now that you're building your own indexes outside of the database, writes are no longer transactional and you lose the guarantee of being able to read your own write.</p>
              <p id="c04b352e-bd9a-44ad-ba88-17ac5cc502ff">Another solution is to have a separate database for every user and allow users to edit the schema of their own isolated database. This allows writes to be transactional, but creates other kinds of collision problems (i.e. dealing with merge conflict) when you want users to be able to collaborate. With separate databases for each user, you're also doing a lot more computing labor, especially if the same records are shared amongst many people.</p>
              <p id="7c45a3a9-7051-4386-a53f-d246c9ba7310">Long story short, existing databases are not great for building end-user databases.</p>
              
            </details>
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p id="f41a9378-fc1b-4ea2-a13a-cb918178cff3">I plan to address this first reason by giving you a mental model of what databases are and a first-principles understanding of how they work.</p>
        <p id="1d0ea7ea-6760-43cc-a728-4b3a1d7efe3b">I'll introduce databases as an abstract concept and then we'll work through a real-world example to explore how databases leverage sorting and filters to lookup information quickly.</p>
        <p id="088e64ab-1cbd-49c2-85e5-ac16a93efcfa">By the end, I hope to show you how these information architecture concepts are immensely powerful and totally approachable for non-technical people. </p>
        <p id="69cf1cd2-0e55-4a55-8d70-a407a8cba1e3">Lastly, I want to convince you that software based on these concepts will be far superior to anything we use today for end-user database applications. If these concepts are interesting to you, <a target="_blank" href="mailto:ccorcos@gmail.com">please reach out</a>! I love sharing ideas. 😁</p>
        
        <p id="a546e1c2-8a2d-4d3a-8d6b-0e74b0f867f0">Databases are filing cabinets.</p>
        <p id="437c4e5d-072f-4e2c-a690-f23c26fa06f4">Databases don't have to be so complicated. If you strip away all the fancy semantics, you end up with something simple and familiar.</p>

        <p id="aef2d2df-d75a-43cf-a023-943585a6f450">Dictionaries, calendars, and filing cabinets are particularly useful because they represent information in a sorted order, making it possible for us to retrieve information quickly and efficiently using a process called <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">binary search</a>. Databases are no different, they're also containers of sorted information.</p>

        <h2 id="b5562604-4d38-4feb-84bd-6f536aea58cc">What is sorted information?</h2>
        <p id="2238e190-e73f-43c3-96d3-44daa545e966">Alphabetical, numerical, compound, lexicographical Encodings.</p>
        <p id="e4db1ca2-03e3-4767-883b-83b12f484fd6">The simplest way to sort something is alphabetically (a.k.a <em>lexicographically</em>) and this is how words are sorted in the dictionary. But we often find ourselves sorting by more than one property. For example, a contact list is often sorted by last name, <em>then</em> first name. This is called a <strong>compound sort</strong>. </p>
        
        <p id="3f686c5c-6eed-4ad6-8eb3-73168fa60be6">For example, notice that "Thomas Robins" should come before "Charlie Robinson" when sorting this way and that a compound sort is fundamentally different from simply joining the words together and then sorting.</p><pre id="82947e67-674e-4edd-8b12-6d7a800dee7a"><code>// Compound Sort: Last, First
Robins, Thomas
Robinson, Charlie

// Joining the words, then sorting: Last + First
RobinsonCharlie
RobinsThomas</code></pre>
        
        <p id="c545d059-b2b0-4678-8fd4-40aa6d7bdafd">We do this kind of compound sorting all over the place. Dates, in particular, are compound sorted by year, <em>then</em> month, <em>then</em> day.</p><pre id="cc0fb85d-ab5f-4e44-8947-0a504713b758"><code>January 10, 2019
...
December 28, 2019
...
August 26, 2020
...</code></pre>
        <p id="ef7175d9-a258-4f95-afe7-0ce9b274df54">Notice that this kind of sorting isn't exactly alphabetical. The months in a year are definitely not sorted alphabetically — each month has an underlying order within a year. Even days of the month aren't alphabetically sorted — they're numerically sorted.</p>
        
        <p id="9d475882-2657-4dc0-a0d4-7e8456c1a201">Numerical sorting is different from alphabetical sorting because alphabetical sorting compares letter-by-letter. For example, if we sorted numbers alphabetically, then 10 would come before 2 because the first digit "1" is before "2".</p><pre id="e4876df9-d390-4c6e-b0a8-c3201a7e43fa"><code>// Alphabetical Sort
1
10
11
2
3
...
9

// Numerical sort
1
2
3
...
9
10
11</code></pre>
        <p id="934e9af4-eb81-43ab-8dd1-9d973c87eb93">A simple way to represent numbers in a way that can be sorted alphabetically is to put zeros at the beginning of the number. This works well for small numbers with a known maximum size such as the months in a year. </p><pre id="245e5864-d979-4b11-944c-eb6a46ade312"><code>// Zero-padded numbers representing months in a year.
01
02
03
...
09
10
11
12</code></pre>
        <p id="becf436f-03a3-4bad-a0f7-519f75156d75">And in fact, we can represent dates in a way that can be sorted alphabetically using <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601 date format</a>. </p><pre id="6c4b1b11-3f63-4789-b0d5-4e0145fc9750"><code>2019-01-10
...
2019-12-28
...
2020-08-26
...</code></pre>
        
        <p id="82017443-040f-4acf-9810-23cd870f9c5e">Representing dates this way is convenient because it doesn't require domain knowledge to understand how to sort them. There are an infinite number of things that can be sorted arbitrarily: a deck of cards, the status of a project, your rock collection—they are all just different types of things.</p>
        <p id="7ddb731a-5ae6-4745-8134-9dc166ec26f4">In general, lexicographical encodings are important because they allow databases to store arbitrary information in the correct order without needing additional knowledge about the type of information that is being sorted.</p>
        
        <ul id="9983c3de-f661-4eb5-82a0-54f7af61c590">

              <p id="5339e8c2-5d28-41fe-8f64-fca7f3df92c3">You've probably experienced frustration with this when looking at files in your filesystem. <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_sort_order">Natural sort</a> solves this problem elegantly by representing both alphabetical and numerical sort at the same time.</p>
              <p id="22c8cbba-c26b-4fb1-8f46-f50abce95449">Representing numbers as lexicographically sortable is another interesting challenge, particularly very large and very small numbers. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ealmansi/elen/blob/master/resources/elen.pdf">Elen</a> is an interesting approach for encoding floating precision numbers.</p>
              <p id="31067abe-ad6c-4491-b84a-825c02101577">Tuples can be represented as compound sortable by separating each item with null-byte (and escaping null-bytes inside each item).</p>

        <p id="e0f0bb9b-fa2a-4b90-9201-a13005754346">You can think of databases much in the same way you think of system filing cabinets. To explore this analogy further, let's imagine that you are in charge of administering a police department where you keep track of a variety of information about every police officer in your region — name, badge number, address, and precinct, among other details.</p>
        
        <p id="60068181-62be-45e4-979e-b7a04b4d0ed9">As the administrator of this information, you're responsible for making sure that everything is up to date and easily accessible.</p>
        
        <p id="244c9ed1-6e90-4a3b-a370-59fa67d0cd5f">To keep things simple, you start by keeping all officer information in a filing cabinet sorted by badge number. This makes it easy to retrieve information about any officer based on their badge number, for example when an officer gets promoted or moves to a new address.</p>
        
        <figure id="7b5ff822-3bb7-4db6-b9a1-3872565c69bb"><img src="https://ccorcos.github.io/filing-cabinets/assets/Filing_cabinets_8.png">

        <h2 id="c78d6501-da7f-4633-b2e4-4a429cfd0008">Read/Write Trade-off</h2>
        <p id="e6dfff08-0cd8-4af5-96b2-448a8a05302c">How we copy information into other cabinets.</p>
        <p id="47066dd1-5373-4fac-8a18-0a29a5703390">One day, the police chief asks you for the address of every officer in the 60th precinct.</p>
        <p id="46c18841-1de6-4cd9-a084-cb39b033b939">With all of this information in a single filing cabinet sorted by badge number, this is a painful request because you have to scan through every file and check if each officer is in the 60th precinct.</p>
        <p id="9fb77909-54eb-4ecb-9059-10642f19e8f1">Maybe this is just a one-time request so you can labor over it and be done with it, but the police chief says that every month he wants to mail a bonus check to every officer in the precinct with the most arrests. If you're going to have to do this every month, maybe it's worthwhile to make this job a bit faster.</p>
        
        <p id="da5b845b-2a98-48f0-a688-857dd844a990">To solve this problem, you create another filing cabinet where you sort all officers by precinct. To keep things simple, you photocopy all of the information in the <em>Badge #</em> cabinet over to the <em>Precinct</em> cabinet. Now when the chief asks you to get the address of every officer in a precinct, you can use this new filing cabinet to quickly retrieve …</p></div></div>

When you create your One account your money will be stored in Pockets, similar to how they were organized at Simple.</p><p>When you first get started, you’ll have a few default Pockets. A Pocket for spending: Spend Pocket, another for savings: Save Pocket and you’ll have a special Pocket to automatically save: Auto-Save Pocket. <a href="https://www.onefinance.com/features/#autosave">The Auto-Save Pocket</a> will need to be toggled “on” but it’s there, ready to be used.</p><p>Easily create free and unlimited Pockets around your life and your people. There’s no limit to how many Pockets you can create in your <a href="https://www.onefinance.com/features/">One account</a>. Each pocket has its own account and routing number, so you can transfer funds directly in and out of Pockets from external sources (example: to pay bills).&nbsp; You can also share individual Pockets with other One users. You’ll also have the flexibility to choose which Pocket is debited when you use your One card by assigning your card to it in the One app. Adjust what Pocket your card points to at any time!</p><p>P.S. We’re actively working on new upgrades to One that will include enhanced features similar to Simple’s Safe-to-Spend and Expenses and Goals.</p><h3>Does One connect to Mint?</h3><p>At the moment, One is not available with Mint but is available on any budgeting tool that utilizes the Plaid exchange network.</p><h3>When will Mint add One?</h3><p>Mint prioritizes what financial institutions to add based on user demand. If you’d like to see One work with Mint, please follow below for a step-by-step guide on how to request it directly with the Mint team.</p><p>Mint users can request One to be added by:</p><ol><li>Logging into your Mint account through their desktop website. The app does not support requesting a new bank.</li><li>Click “+ Add Accounts” button on the top navigation bar.</li><li>Type in a few random letters (typing “One Finance” here will result in hundreds of incorrect results).</li><li>Click “Request support for your bank” button.</li><li>Type “One Finance” in the Bank name field.</li><li>Copy and paste our website URL into the bank web address field: <a href="https://www.onefinance.com/">https://www.onefinance.com</a></li><li>That’s it!</li></ol><p>We appreciate your support and hope to move up in the line fast if enough requests for One come through!</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="http://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog_Pockets.png" alt="" width="5136" height="1401" srcset="https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog_Pockets.png 5136w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog_Pockets-300x82.png 300w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog_Pockets-1024x279.png 1024w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog_Pockets-1536x419.png 1536w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog_Pockets-2048x559.png 2048w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog_Pockets-1600x436.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 5136px) 100vw, 5136px"></p><h3>Does One offer joint accounts?</h3><p>One offers something even better, Pocket sharing! You can create and share as many Pockets as you’d like with any One user(s). This feature helps you get hyper-organized with your finances especially with the ability to slice and dice your finances so you can control who and what Pocket you share. For example: partners can each have their own separate One account but share one or more Pockets with each other for shared expenses like rent, groceries, car payments etc. They’ll both be able to access only the funds within the Shared Pockets while their main One account funds stay separate. Ditch the constant requests for bill splitting and continually ping ponging money back and forth through another app.</p><h3>Can I move money between Pockets? How long does it take? Is there a limit to the amount of transfers?</h3><p>Yes! It’s easy to move money between Pockets under the “Move Money” tab in the One App. It’s instant, and there’s no limit to the amount of transfers that can be done between your Pockets.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="http://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog_Chart-1.png" alt="" width="4608" height="2836" srcset="https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog_Chart-1.png 4608w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog_Chart-1-300x185.png 300w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog_Chart-1-1024x630.png 1024w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog_Chart-1-1536x945.png 1536w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog_Chart-1-2048x1260.png 2048w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog_Chart-1-1600x985.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 4608px) 100vw, 4608px"></p><h3>What does APY and APR mean? <b>Why does One have higher rates than other brands?</b></h3><p>The Annual Percentage Yield, or “APY”, is a percentage rate reflecting the total amount of interest paid to you on your account. Our APYs are based on the interest rates we offer and how often interest compounds (interest on the amounts you contribute plus any interest you have already earned).</p><p>The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is the amount you pay each year to borrow money, including fees, expressed as a percentage.</p><p>One is able to offer higher rates because as a digital banking service we don’t have the traditional overhead that brick and mortar banks have. Instead of keeping the cost savings, we put it back into our product offerings, such as the 3.00% APY* One users enjoy in their Auto-Save Pocket, and the 1.00% APY* we provide on existing savings balances (up to $25k for our paycheck direct deposit customers). We’re able to maintain these industry-leading rates to our customers for two primary reasons. First, we focus on generating revenue through interchange (essentially card spending activity, which is driven by the expense that businesses pay to accept credit and debit cards) and fairly priced credit and lending, instead of fees like traditional banks. Second, our savings products are designed to help build, and rebuild, financial wellness, a big component of which is emergency savings and a cushion for unexpected expenses. For customers with very large existing savings balances looking for a place to park their money just to earn returns, we may not be the best option, and that is okay. We are focused on helping to improve and maintain financially healthy habits for our customers, while offering the most compelling and best priced spending, saving and credit options in the market.</p><h3>Can a One account receive a wire transfer?</h3><p>Yes! All One accounts can accept wire transfers but are not able to send wire transfers. One accounts can also receive international wire transfers. Please <a href="https://help.onefinance.com/hc/en-us/requests/new">contact</a> our team for additional information needed to accept an international transfer.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="http://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/group.png" alt="" width="5136" height="2387" srcset="https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/group.png 5136w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/group-300x139.png 300w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/group-1024x476.png 1024w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/group-1536x714.png 1536w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/group-2048x952.png 2048w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/group-1600x744.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 5136px) 100vw, 5136px"></p><h2>Your feedback is our fuel | One updates coming soon</h2><p><span>There’s been a lot of great feedback from Simple users and we’re actively listening, combing through every post and working to update One. Our team is reprioritizing to make sure we fill in the biggest gaps first so our new friends from Simple can feel less anxiety and regain their financial peace of mind. Here’s a quick list of top requested updates (in no particular order) and how we’re approaching them:</span></p><h3>Recurring Transfers</h3><p><strong>Request Level:</strong> High<br><strong>Status:</strong> Currently working on<br><strong>Availability:</strong> Shortly</p><p>You’ll recognize this feature as “funding schedule.” It’s automating the funding of expenses and goals. We completely agree this is a feature One needs STAT. Manually allocating funds whenever new money lands in your One account is not fun.</p><p>Right now, you can allocate up to 10% of your <a href="https://www.onefinance.com/direct-deposit/">paycheck direct deposit</a> (up to $1,000/month) to automatically deposit into your Auto-Save Pocket. You’ll earn 3.00% APY* in the Auto-Save Pocket.</p><p>Our team imagines that an early version of the recurring transfers feature will allow a user to set similar rules for what money ends up in which created Pocket. Example: $100 to Grocery Pocket on the 3rd of every month.</p><h3>Virtual Cards For Every Pocket</h3><p><strong>Request Level:</strong> Medium<br><strong>Status:</strong> In queue<br><strong>Availability:</strong> Launch first pass in Q1</p><p>This feature will help One users who have a very tight management around their recurring expenses. You’ll be able to set up dedicated Pockets, each with a unique virtual card number to pay these recurring bills. Example: a dedicated card to pay for your “Streaming TV” Pocket bill only. We’re also planning to support these cards later in Apple Wallet and Google Wallet to make spending even easier.</p><h3>Configurable Overdraft</h3><p><strong>Request Level:</strong> Medium<br><strong>Status:</strong> Currently working on<br><strong>Availability:</strong> Launching Q1</p><p>Currently, the only Pocket that has overdraft protection is the default Spend Pocket. This Pocket comes with a built-in <a href="https://www.onefinance.com/features/#creditLine">Credit Line</a> in case your account dips below zip. We’re currently working on allowing any created Pocket to be auto-filled by available funds in the Spend Pocket when funds aren’t available to fill the transaction in the other Pocket. This update will take a lot of guesswork out of bill payments, including payments that have different amounts each month.</p><h3>MFA/2FA</h3><p><strong>Request Level:</strong> Medium<br><strong>Status:</strong> Currently working on<br><strong>Availability:</strong> Shortly</p><p>We recognize that multi-factor authentication is an important security feature and are actively working to get this up and running.</p><h3>Remote Check Deposit</h3><p><strong>Request Level:</strong> High<br><strong>Status:</strong> Currently working on<br><strong>Availability:</strong> Launch in February</p><p>Grandparents send checks, the landlord still wants a check, work pays you with a check…love them or hate them checks are still a part of daily banking. The ability to deposit checks with your mobile device is in the works.</p><h3>Mail A Check</h3><p><strong>Request Level:</strong> Medium<br><strong>Status:</strong> In queue<br><strong>Availability:</strong> Coming soon!</p><p>We will soon support the ability to “cut a check” all within the One app. Users will be able to fill in the details and we’ll handle the printing and mailing of the physical check, free of charge! This feature will be in lieu of traditional paper checkbooks. Let’s be honest, those thick books just collect dust in a drawer and only have 1 or 2 taken out anyway.</p><p>We’re excited to bring these features to life, and know they’ll be a huge step towards getting you back to the kind of stress-free workflows you worked so hard to fine-tune over the years with Simple. Thank you so much for all your feedback! We can’t stress this part enough…keep it coming! With your help, we can continue to constantly improve One.</p> </div></div>]]>

<p><strong>Here’s a transcript from Tim Ferriss’s interview with Marcus Aurelius:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tim: Thanks for joining me, Marcus. Or should I use your title: Caesar?</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: You may call me Marcus. I do not stand on ceremony.</p>
<p>Tim: Fair enough. So, I want to start at the beginning. What is Stoicism?</p>
<p>Marcus: Stoicism is a philosophy of life. It is a way of looking at the world. It is about seeing clearly what is in front of us and feeling what is in our hearts. It is about doing what is right, no matter what the cost. It is about living according to nature and treating others with kindness and respect.</p>
<p>Tim: I like that. So, what is the goal of Stoicism?</p>
<p>Marcus: The goal of Stoicism is to live a good life, a life in accordance with nature.</p>
<p>Tim: What does that mean?</p>
<p>Marcus: It means doing what we ought to do, not doing what we want to do. It means acting rationally, not emotionally.</p>
<p>Tim: Ok, so how do we do that?</p>
<p>Marcus: By paying attention to what is in our power and not worrying about the rest.</p>
<p>Tim: That’s a great answer, but what does it mean?</p>
<p>Marcus: It means we have control over our actions, our judgments, and our feelings. It means we can choose how we respond to events outside of our control. It means we can choose what to think.</p>
<p>Tim: I like that. So, how do you apply Stoicism to life?</p>
<p>Marcus: By facing the world with a smile and acting with justice, kindness, and honesty.</p>
<p>Tim: I like that too. So, can you give me an example?</p>
<p>Marcus: Sure. When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they can’t tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own—not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands, and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: These are obstructions.</p>
<p>Tim: That’s a great passage. So, how do we deal with adversity?</p>
<p>Marcus: By recognizing that it is nothing more than what it is: a thing that can be endured.</p>
<p>Tim: That’s hard.</p>
<p>Marcus: It is, but it is also liberating.</p>
<p>Tim: How do you mean?</p>
<p>Marcus: The things that cause us suffering are those that are out of our control. Death, illness, poverty, dishonor, slander, and all such things. If you accept that they are fated to happen, they will lose their power over you.</p>
<p>Tim: That’s a powerful idea. So, how do we deal with pain?</p>
<p>Marcus: The first step is recognizing that pain is an opinion, not a fact. The second is accepting that it can’t be changed. The third is being thankful that it isn’t worse.</p>
<p>Tim: That’s a great way of putting it. So, what’s the best way to deal with other people?</p>
<p>Marcus: Be kind. Everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.</p>
<p>Tim: What about those who are unkind?</p>
<p>Marcus: They are like children, who are unkind not by choice but because they don’t know better.</p>
<p>Tim: How do we deal with external events that we can’t control?</p>
<p>Marcus: We accept that we have no control over them.</p>
<p>Tim: I like that. I have a question. I’ve heard it said that Stoicism is a cold and emotionless philosophy.</p>
<p>Marcus: That’s not true. Stoics feel all the emotions—they just don’t allow those emotions to determine their behavior.</p>
<p>Tim: So, you’re saying that Stoics don’t repress their emotions?</p>
<p>Marcus: No. The Stoic does not indulge her emotions, but she feels them fully and completely.</p>
<p>Tim: What about death?</p>
<p>Marcus: Death is nothing to us. When we exist, death is not yet present. And when death is present, then we no longer exist. It doesn’t concern us at all.</p>
<p>Tim: That’s a great answer. So, can you sum up Stoicism for me?</p>
<p>Marcus: Sure. I can tell you that it is the art of living. It is about seeing clearly, doing good, and facing adversity. It is about accepting what cannot be changed and freeing yourself from the things that cause you suffering. It is about being strong and kind. It is about seeing the world as it is, not as you want it to be.</p>
<p><strong>Tim: I like that. For a small change of topic, there are a few questions I like to ask. As you may know I’m a huge fan of books and read dozens of them every year. What is the book (or books) you’ve given most as a gift, and why? Or what are one to three books that have greatly influenced your life?</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: I’m a big fan of biographies, especially those of the great philosophers and statesmen. I like to read about how others have dealt with adversity and challenges. I also love history books, especially those of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Tim: I like that. What about books you’ve read recently that you would recommend?</p>
<p>Marcus: I’ve been reading The Obstacle is the Way by Ryan Holiday. It’s about how to turn obstacles into advantages.</p>
<p>Tim: That sounds good. I’ll check it out. What about books that have greatly influenced your life?</p>
<p>Marcus: The Enchiridion by Epictetus.</p>
<p>Tim: I guess you like Roman philosophers. What about favorite quotes?</p>
<p>Marcus: I have many favorites.</p>
<p>Tim: Give me some.</p>
<p>Marcus: “It is difficult to fight against one’s natural impulses.”</p>
<p>“Accept life as it comes.”</p>
<p>“The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.”</p>
<p>“How much time he saves who does not look to see what his neighbor says or does or thinks.”</p>
<p>Tim: I like those. What about favorite movies or TV shows?</p>
<p>Marcus: I’m a big fan of many of the HBO series, such as Rome, The Sopranos, and Game of Thrones.</p>
<p><strong>Tim: What purchase of $100 or less has most positively impacted your life in the last six months (or in recent memory)? My readers love specifics like brand and model, where you found it, etc.</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: I’m a big fan of the Moleskine notebooks. I just ordered the new “junior” version.</p>
<p><strong>Tim: How has a failure, or apparent failure, set you up for later success? Do you have a “favorite failure” of yours?</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: I failed at many things early in my life. I failed as a student, as an athlete, and as a politician. I failed as a husband and a father. But each failure taught me something about myself and the world. I learned from these failures and became a better man for it.</p>
<p><strong>Tim: If you could have a gigantic billboard anywhere with anything on it — metaphorically speaking, getting a message out to millions or billions — what would it say and why? It could be a few words or a paragraph.</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: “You have power over your mind—not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.”</p>
<p><strong>Tim: What is one of the best or most worthwhile investments you’ve ever made? (Could be an investment of money, time, energy, etc.)</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: Travel. I’ve visited many countries and have learned much from others.</p>
<p><strong>Tim:What is an unusual habit or an absurd thing that you love?</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: I love to swim. I’ve done it every day for years.</p>
<p>Tim: What is the best advice you’ve ever received?</p>
<p>Marcus: I have no talent for drinking. I must therefore leave it alone.</p>
<p>Tim: I like that. So, what’s a personal habit that contributes to your success?</p>
<p>Marcus: I write in a journal every single day</p>
<p><strong>Tim: In the last five years, what new belief, behavior, or habit has most improved your life?</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: I’ve adopted a no-complaining policy. I used to complain all the time about everything. This doesn’t mean I don’t have complaints—it means I keep them to myself.</p>
<p><strong>Tim: What advice would you give to a smart, driven college student about to enter the “real world”?</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: Educate yourself. Read as much as you can. Surround yourself with people who are better than you. Don’t waste time on jealousy or resentment. Don’t let your emotions control you. Find a cause that is bigger than yourself and devote yourself to it.</p>
<p><strong>Tim: What are bad recommendations you hear in your profession or area of expertise?</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: “Your gut doesn’t matter.” You must learn to trust your gut and use it to navigate the world.</p>
<p>“It’s too late for this.”</p>
<p>“You’re too old for that.”</p>
<p>“You’ll never be able to do that.”</p>
<p><strong>Tim: In the last five years, what have you become better at saying no to (distractions, invitations, etc.)? What new realizations and/or approaches helped? Any other tips?</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: I’ve learned that it’s better to give a small amount of time to many people than a lot of time to a few people.</p>
<p><strong>Tim: When you feel overwhelmed or unfocused, or have lost your focus temporarily, what do you do? (If helpful: What questions do you ask yourself?)</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: I take a break and do some exercise. Then, I get back to work.</p>
<p>Tim: If you were to start again, what would you do differently?</p>
<p>Marcus: I would have studied philosophy much earlier in life. It has changed everything for me.</p>
<p>Tim: If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be? (There’s no right answer. I’m just curious.)</p>
<p>Marcus: I would like to be able to read other people’s minds. I’m pretty good at understanding what others are thinking, but I’d like to be able to read their thoughts directly.</p>
<p>Tim: One last question: What does success mean to you?</p>
<p>Marcus: Finding a purpose larger than yourself and devoting your life to it.</p>
<p>Tim: Thank you, Marcus, I really enjoyed this.</p>
<p>Marcus: It was a pleasure.</p>
<p>If you liked this conversation, I think you’ll like my book, Tools of Titans: The Tactics, Routines, and Habits of Billionaires, Icons, and World-Class Performers. In the book I deconstruct world-class performers’ routines and habits you can apply to your</p>

<p>Hello 👋&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know you like to use WhatsApp, I use WhatsApp as well. One of the most important things in WhatsApp that differentiates itself from other messaging apps like Viber, Messenger and Telegram is WhatsApp’s privacy.</p>
<p>WhatsApp chats are end-to-end encrypted. Which means once you hit the send button on your phone, WhatsApp scrambles the message so no one in the middle can read it, not even WhatsApp themselves can read what you send. Therefore called end-to-end encryption.</p>
<p>You get this feature as soon as you install and start using WhatsApp, while you need to enable end-to-end encryption on other chat apps that you use (Telegram, Messenger etc). So you are at risk of the app creator, your government reading your messages.</p>

<p><strong>However, starting&nbsp;from February 8th, WhatsApp is changing is policies, to loosen some of it’s privacy features because Facebook (the company that owns WhatsApp) plans to make money out of WhatsApp.<p>This including sharing your data with advertisers, companies, and businesses that might chat on WhatsApp.</p></strong></p>
<p>You might have already got this message asking you to agree to these new terms, and if you agree with it, you are agreeing to share your data with other companies.</p>

<p>Even though we are not sure whether WhatsApp or businesses can read your messages or not after the&nbsp;February 8th&nbsp;because the message is very vague, this update coming&nbsp;on February 8th&nbsp;means that&nbsp;<strong>WhatsApp is not safe anymore, and should not to be used for private communications.</strong></p>
<h2>Why use Signal?</h2>
<p>Signal is a chat app, just like WhatsApp. But unlike WhatsApp Signal is a non profit organization, which meansSignal does not have to sell your messages and information to advertisers like WhatsApp is planning to do in order to make money.<br>Signal also enables end-to-end encryption by default, so your chats are safe just like WhatsApp.<br>People like Elon Musk and others have asked everyone to switch to Signal once WhatsApp announced their new privacy policy about selling your data.</p>

<p>Interestingly, public materials about the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/drawbridge/">Drawbridge</a> variant used on SQL Server are few and far between.</p>



<p>So <a href="https://threedots.ovh/slides/Drawbridge.pdf">here</a> is a slide deck about me working with Drawbridge from several years back. I’ve updated parts of it later on, keeping up partially with more recent SQLPAL versions.</p>



<p>Since I made that slide deck, lots of things happened… which will maybe be a subject for a story or two some day.</p>

    <figcaption>Unfolded Studio - The Platform for Geospatial Analytics</figcaption>
  </figure><p>Today we are delighted to officially unveil <a href="https://studio.unfolded.ai/">Unfolded Studio</a>,
our take on what the next generation geospatial analytics and visualization platform should look like.</p><p>We, the Unfolded founding team, originally met at Uber around 2015 as we started building out what has now become a suite of
leading open source geospatial technologies, including kepler.gl, deck.gl and H3. </p><p>By 2019, theis this technology stack had become quite mature,
and we realized that an extraordinary geospatial platform
could be built on top of it, so we came together to found Unfolded,
a new geospatial company with a mission to build the next generation of geospatial analytics.</p><p>Our mission is to enable effortless geospatial and temporal data analytics at
massive, planetary scales, and to share insights through geospatial visualizations
that inspire with their beauty and fluidity.</p><h2>Why Geospatial Platforms?</h2><p>Geospatial datasets are unique among data sets, in that they can be presented
in the context of maps and the physical world, rather than just as abstract graphs.
This makes it possible for viewers to quickly comprehend and draw valuable insights
from datasets that are orders of magnitude larger than would normally be possible.</p><p>Unfortunately visualizing data on maps is complicated. Ingesting, processing
and interacting with geospatial datasets is computationally and
technically demanding, especially when datasets become large,
and users typically need to solve numerous problems before insights can be reached. </p><p>For a geospatial platform like Unfolded Studio,
each of these problems represents an opportunity to help our users.</p><h2>Enter Unfolded Studio</h2><p>Our view is that any geospatial analytics platform worth considering today
must offer its users a range of critical core features:</p><ul><li>Effortless map creation</li><li>Strong exploratory visualization</li><li>Powerful geospatial analytics to help users uncover insights</li><li>Seamless cloud storage for geospatial data</li><li>Single-click map publishing </li><li>Easy ingestion of key geospatial data formats</li><li>Automation for getting data into and out of the tool</li><li>Ways to build custom applications on top of maps</li></ul><p>Note that Unfolded Studio is designed to handle not only these core geospatial data management tasks,
but more importantly is architected to address what we consider to be the hard problems in geospatial analytics.
We will share our thoughts and roadmaps around this in a follow-up blog post.</p><h3>Powerful Visualization Layers</h3><figure>

				<p><em>Alternative title: Young NB Yells At The Cloud</em></p>
<p><strong>Note that this absolutely isn’t vetted for technical accuracy.</strong>
<strong>It’s probably also not a very coherent post altogether.</strong>
<strong>I just needed to get this off my chest.</strong></p>
<p>Ever since late 2019, I’ve been using a Google Pixel 2 as my day-to-day
cellphone. While I’ve known that it didn’t respect my privacy, per the Google
tradition of being creepy and generally terrifying, I wasn’t <em>entirely</em> aware of
this phenomenon until Google told me when I registered my rooted Nook Tablet
with their services in 2014. The fact that this has been recorded six years
later was enough to set me off on a path to de-Googlify my Google phone.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://blog.knightsofthelambdacalcul.us/img/2020-01-28-1.png"> 
</figure>

<p>The first option I found was <a href="https://github.com/dan-v/rattlesnakeos-stack">RattlesnakeOS</a>, which is basically just AOSP built
on EC2. While it seemed like a competent option, and it likely is, I didn’t want
to set up an AWS account and pay $5/mo to build it, as I’m already paying $10/mo
on my current servers (including the one hosting this website). In addition,
there’s <a href="https://grapheneos.org/">GrapheneOS</a>, which is the continuation of the ill-fated CopperheadOS
(which effectively died Because Capitalism^TM after CopperheadOS was
commercialized, effectively killing the project altogether). I opted for the
latter as I wouldn’t have to set up my own build infrastructure on AWS, and the
fact that GrapheneOS decidedly had more features directly geared towards a
“hardened” Android experience, regardless of de-Googlification.</p>
<p>This of course, would be wonderful… if not for a critical roadblock.</p>
<h2 id="trying-to-unlock-the-bootloader">Trying to unlock the bootloader</h2>
<p>Here’s how it went down:
“Hey, are you able to unlock the boot-loader?”</p>
<pre><code data-lang="nil"> Λ ~ fastboot flashing get_unlock_ability
(bootloader) get_unlock_ability: 1
OKAY [  0.000s]
</code></pre><p>(read: “yeah, sure”)</p>
<p>“Okay, <em>can</em> you unlock the boot-loader?”</p>
<pre><code data-lang="nil"> λ ~ fastboot flashing unlock
FAILED (remote: 'Flashing Unlock is not allowed')
fastboot: error: Command failed
</code></pre><p>(read: “No, because I’m not able to.")</p>
<p>…so I’m left with Schrödinger’s bootloader (and not the cat from Digital Devil
Saga). Wonderful! Furthermore, I’m not the only one with this issue; not only do
some carriers lock down your ability to OEM unlock, but Google Play Services’
anti-theft protection makes it impossible to do so without an internet
connection, <em>and</em> some refurbished Pixel devices (mine being case-in-point) just
<a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/pixel-2/help/unlock-bootloader-refurbished-pixel-2-t4017557">don’t cooperate</a>, regardless as to whether or not it <em>should</em> work.</p>
<p>My experience with Google support on this topic basically boiled down to “why
are you even trying to unlock the bootloader, you idiot”, so that’s out of the
question. I’d imagine they’re probably not super happy about me stealing profits
from them by trying to escape their ecosystem.</p>
<p>On a happier note, I came across this person on Freenode’s channel #grapheneos,
which eased the tension due to them not breaking character:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="nil">       hazel1 │ hi yes okay so.
       hazel1 │ i'm on a pixel 2 non-xl, `fastboot flashing get_unlock_ability` returns 1, but `fastboot flashing unlock` says "Flashing Unlock is not allowed"
       hazel1 │ no idea where to go from here.
TheJollyRoger │ Avast! Did ye enable OEM unlocking in the OS under developer options?
       hazel1 │ i did, yes, that's what `fastboot flashing get_unlock_ability = 1` meant
       hazel1 │ also i appreciate your dedication to character.
       hazel1 │ i'm on linux, if that's important, and i'm running these commands as root.
TheJollyRoger │ Shiver me timbers, I be stuck too. Maybe someone else on this here tub will know.
</code></pre><h2 id="why-this-is-stupid">Why this is stupid</h2>
<p>This is where I turn this tech rant into a political rant, as I have no
self-control.</p>
<p>Per the majority of things that happen in the modern tech industry, this is, of
course, a byproduct of capitalism. The fact that carriers or refurbishers <em>can</em>
lock you out of customizing your own device is in it of itself terrifying, on
the merit that it’s an effective paywall to gain control of the hardware you own
— or rather, should own. While I’m a firm believer in security, and a firm
believer that the majority of people have devices that work well enough for them
(given that they’re not privacy conscious…), I’m also under the impression
that <em>people should have control over the things they own</em>. Capitalism, in the
name of profit, contradicts that scheme.</p>
<p>The fact that your carrier owns your phone, or your phone manufacturer owns your
phone, or Google owns your phone, etc, applies in bounds here. While the
saying is generally “if it’s free, you’re the product”, the fact that you’re
<strong>still</strong> the product when buying an expensive device speaks volumes about the
technological ecosystems we tend to depend on in 2020. I should be able to
unlock the bootloader without a second thought, but the fact that some
refurbisher owns the rights to do that with the device I should own, and not me,
worries me deeply.</p>
<p>I shouldn’t have to worry about whether some random thing I say is going to be
used against me in some creepy fashion three weeks later in an ad that shows up
on a torrent site when I’m trying to scrape the web for some obscure piece of
software that nobody uses or some movie that nobody watched.</p>
<p>I’m well aware that this point has been regurgitated. I’m well aware this post
doesn’t actually make much sense. But regardless, I’m scared that Google has
this much control, and I’m scared that I’m unable to remove it.</p>
<h2 id="follow-up--2020-01-29--and-a-potential-explanation">Follow-up (2020-01-29) and a potential explanation</h2>
<p>So apparently this is by design, which pretty much confirms my theory. Great.
Per a user on the <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/14920605?hl=en">Pixel Phone Help “official support forum”:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Update: I was able to get a reply from the higher levels in Google and they
simply informed the man handling my case, to his astonishment, that the
refurbishment process is intentionally locking the bootloader and that is the
way they designed it to operate. No options were given to me to remedy the
issue and I was asked if there was anything else I wanted to discuss before
they ended the call.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>This is ridiculous if true.</strong> Not only does it compound on my existing complaint
of bootloader unlocks being behind a paywall, which is already ridiculous, but
it means that even <strong>if</strong> you go through a paywall, any device defect could lead
to a permanently locked bootloader (such as my case). Even more ridiculous is
that Google’s factory Pixel images require a bootloader unlock to flash, meaning
that this locks users out of potential support options.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the theory of a refurbished device just being an unlocked
carrier edition phone is true (despite my CID being all zeroes), this is just
<em>negligence</em>.</p>
<p>Even if 99.3\% of users should <em>never</em> have to touch this option, the fact that
Google not only sends refurbished phones, but RMAs of unlockable phones with
this defect is astounding. It attests to the fact that what you own is not truly
yours even moreso than this just being a coincidence — it’s an explicit
hostile action towards the privacy-focused by Google. The former glory of Nexus
devices of being “the modder’s phone” has been changed drastically upon a vision
of a more popular “Google phone”; again, driven by capitalism.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><span><p>From the invention of the steam engine, to incandescent light, to radio, computation, and the internet, a familiar story unfolds:</p><p>In a small pocket of the world, a group of people produce immense innovation, changing the world as we know it.</p><p>Different times, different places, same story. If anything, “changing the world as we know it” is an understatement. It might be fairer to say that the <em>majority</em> of the wealth and security that we enjoy today, comes from these little pockets. </p><p>Without the steam engine, or electricity, or computers, our world would be different in kind. Many more people would be burdened by toil, many an idea would be impossible, and many a person would be dead from disease. It boggles the mind to think that these innovations took place in areas no larger than a few neighborhood blocks.</p><p>The latest place, of course, was Silicon Valley. From Intel, to Apple, to Microsoft, to Netscape, to Amazon, to Google, technology invented here continues to ripple around the world. </p><p>But, we’re facing some dangerous headwinds.</p><p>The ingredients that made Silicon Valley prosperous are beginning to disappear. For the young and ambitious hacker, it’s unaffordable to live there, and the cultural atmosphere has become stifling.</p><p>Yet our need for innovation has never been greater. From centralization to addiction, Big Tech itself has produced second order-consequences. We need solutions that protect the future of our society. And this pales in comparison to the largest problem at hand: we still have billions of people below the poverty line. There is no way for everyone to enjoy the standard of living that western people enjoy, without massive changes in technology.  </p><p>This is both daunting, and thrilling. We have big problems ahead, but humanity has managed to solve them time and time again. What are we going to do now?</p><p>One way, is to proliferate the ideas that made these areas of innovation so special. Can we reverse the trend in Silicon Valley? Even better, what if we had one thousand more Silicon Valleys of 2003, or Pittsburgs of the 1880s, or the Londons and Paris’ of the 1700s? </p><p>Throughout my life I’ve lived in about 5 cities across 3 continents, with at least 4 starkly different societal structures. Most recently I spent 6 years in Silicon Valley, where I was lucky enough to experience some of what made this place so special. </p><p>When I reflect, there are certainly ingredients I’ve noticed that made Silicon Valley stand apart from any other place I’ve lived in. I want to share them with you.</p><p>The most important ingredient I noticed was risk appetite, and a love for risk takers. </p><p>It’s surprising this isn’t a standard thing. Don’t we all respect Elon Musk? Sort of. We respect the successes, but our revealed preferences show something different. </p><p>Here’s how you can tell:  Pick a city, and ask the average student what they want to do after they graduate.</p><p>Most will say they want a prestigious job at a big company. In some even more unfortunate places, it’s that they want a prestigious and cushy job…in politics. </p><p>This doesn’t bode well for their risk appetite. But can you blame them? Imagine if the same undergraduate student has a love interest. What would the grandma say if they found out that the suitor wants to “make a rocket that flies to the moon?”. How would this suitor compare to the “deputy director of X bank”?</p><p>This attitude is shared across continents and cultures, revealing a generally conservative cultural attitude towards risk.</p><p>Now, it does vary. Being different is bad but not terrible in Germany, while it’s unbearable in Japan. Yet, by and large most places are on the “still bad” side of the spectrum.</p><p>Why does it happen this way? There may be good cultural reasons. For most of our history there was little variation in productivity. Being different didn’t get you much, outside of potential exile. </p><p>But things have changed. Technology brings extreme variation in productivity. Innovation necessarily lies in doing what hasn’t been done before. And there’s a reason why many good things <em>haven’t</em> been done before: either they look dumb, foolish, or impossible.</p><p>To exploit those opportunities, you need talented people “foolish” enough to try to build on these opportunities, and capitalists “foolish” enough to invest money in them. </p><p>Conservative risk outlooks make this impossible. It’s frustrating to see. Outside of the stigma, there isn’t much downside for the talented undergraduate student — they don’t have kids to support. And likewise for the capitalist — the amount to invest is insignificant. Just when life is the <em>least</em> risky for both, stigma prevents their action.</p><p>This is not the case in Silicon Valley. Starting a startup, even failing, only makes you a better engineer and a better candidate for greater things here. And there’s no shortage of angel investors who are ready to make a bet and write it off completely, if they believe in the slightest chance of upside. </p><p>Why? Because ambition is lauded here. </p><p>When you say you want to get to the moon, people take you seriously. An environment like that nourishes the adventurer in a person’s soul. </p><p>So, what do we do? How do we bring this kind of risk loving attitude to different cultures? </p><p>I think it’s going to be hard, but it’s not impossible. Ideas tend to spread non-linearly. </p><p>What kind of content is available in your society? Are there gripping case studies that you can share? Can you build up small pockets of like-minded people? How can you make an ambitious outlook virtuous and laudable?</p><p>Whichever city can solve for these questions, has a gold-mine on their hands. </p><p>Risk appetite, however, has a necessary side effect. </p><p>Innovation requires thinking up unintuitive ideas. You have to question the status quo. A common question you need ask is: why does X <em>really</em> have to be this way? </p><p>Well, ask this questions enough times, and you’ll discover an idea that’s unpopular in whatever zeitgeist you live in. What do you do if you have an idea like that? </p><p>In some places, the penalty is so severe, that it’s dangerous to even think of an idea like this, let alone say it. </p><p>And this becomes tragic, because when you silence dissenting ideas, you stop innovation too. There is no way to follow innovative reasoning without some dissenting ideas popping up.</p><p>When you realize this, it’s no surprise that most pockets of innovation tended to stem from western cultures. Freedom of speech, common law courts, and liberty from oppression gives a person the necessary space to think.</p><p>One kicker is, that space is unbelievably attractive to a thinker: to let your mind roam is thrilling. This means that spaces like this build on themselves: people want to move there.</p><p>So, you need civil freedoms. But you can’t stop there. You need freedom to think, but you also need freedom to <em>build</em>. </p><p>This requires an open regulatory environment. If regulation is too restrictive, it selects for the kind of company that can make it through legal hurdles: large, bureaucratic, and lawyered up. Small, innovative startups that are likely to fail will die at birth.</p><p>How do you know if your city has an enough regulatory environment? Here’s how you can tell. </p><p>Just answer these questions: How quickly can you incorporate a business? Can you hire and fire someone easily? Can you accept payments easily? What kind of permits do you need to work on crypto, autonomous driving, or drones? </p><p>If you answered in the negative, this is a bottleneck for forming a pocket of innovation in your city. Each question you answer in the positive improves your city’s chances by a magnitude. If you answer entirely in the positive, you have a city that looks incredibly attractive to great thinkers and great doers.</p><p>The most critical remaining ingredient is talent. Technology is the medium of innovation, and it requires deep expertise. So how do you get these experts? Let’s put ourselves in the mind of these experts. </p><p>One immediate upside they’ll see already, is that your city has an environment where they can think freely, and it’s possible for them to try ambitious ideas without stigma.  That’s already an unbelievably attractive proposition. </p><p>But this itself isn’t enough for talent to flourish. Talent looks for other talent. Great thinkers want to be around other great thinkers. From Princeton to Bell Labs to Palo Alto, innovators clump together. So, you need to manufacture such a clump. How could you do it? </p><p>Traditionally, the solution is to nurture a great technical university. Build a place where the smartest people can gather and work on ambitious ideas. If you have that, you have a prime ingredient. </p><p>Is there anything special you need to do with this university, outside of just making admission selective? I think so. The place has to be livable enough for the professors, and fun enough for the students to stick around after.</p><p>One heuristic to know you have a city that’s livable enough, is to answer this question: Do you have any areas where folks don’t need to use cars? If you have a walkable pocket in your city, you have a place where thinkers will thrive.</p><p>Aside from investing in a good technical University, and a walkable area, what else can you do?</p><p>The most exciting development, is to turn your city into a kind of startup itself. Choose a group of technical thinkers that other hackers look up too. These are now your customers. The goal is to get them to move to your city. If you can do that, others will follow. </p><p>How do you get them to move? Well, these folks are not used to friendly governments, and are accessible on twitter. Reach out, offer to help, do the schlep work, and a movement can start. Mayor Suarez kicked this offw and has shown what’s possible. If I was a Mayor of any other city, I’d be studying this thoroughly.</p><p>If you can get a clump to form, now you have tinder. All you need to do is to add spark.</p><p>That spark is capital. I put this last, because if you have all of the above, capital will flock to you. In todays world, money is starving for assets. Many an angel investor dreams of …</p></span></p></div></div></div></div>

          <p>I have seen a significant uptick of people posting or joining the forums and using belligerent language, making unilateral demands and insulting the process that is open source software. “The fact you haven’t done x is stupid”. “How can you write a piece of software that doesn’t do y?”. “It’s 2021 and you still can’t make a program do z, how pathetic”. Not exact words, but accurate sentiments.</p>
<p>Please don’t do this. Please be nice.</p>
<p>The Signal team, as with any open-source team, are not infinite resources to pour down the drain. Every hour they spend on their job working for Signal, every hour they spend after work helping out, every hour a volunteer puts into forum support and bug investigation, is an hour consumed. To receive insults and vitriol in return is corrosive. It is unfair and it is not in the spirit of giving, of making something and offering it for free.</p>
<p>You’re receiving this for free, this great software which is made by people who <em>literally care</em> about your privacy. They don’t know you, and they sure don’t know what you talk about on Signal, and yet they put in a lot of effort for this. Not to make wads of cash. Not to sell you to advertisers for your social life to be analysed and abused.</p>
<p>The developer for the Mastodon software Fedilab recently <a href="https://framagit.org/tom79/fedilab/-/issues/498" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">revealed he has been burnt out</a> and I’ve read elsewhere it was because people were screaming hate at him for a principle he upheld - which was that his software would not censor people screaming hate at each other. I’m sure you can appreciate the painful irony here. (Please note that his stepping down seems to be for real, the specific reasons I’ve gave are speculation). I, for one, chose his software specifically because it did not censor, because whilst I believe a service can censor if it chooses, software must remain neutral. (If you wish to discuss this, perhaps let’s do that on another thread).</p>
<p>Don’t be that person. Don’t jump on issues making demands. Don’t pile on forum threads that make some users’ opinions very clear as it is, and throw your bellicose howling in there too. Don’t insult the developers or their priorities, their choices. They are real people who have a finite capacity for work and for abuse. Add a thumbs up to an issue, add a heart to a forum request. Post only if you can materially add to the discussion, else use a reaction. Post in the spirit and the letter of the <a href="https://community.signalusers.org/guidelines">community guidelines</a>.</p>

          <p>We as old community members should also be reminded to be nice even when other people are not nice.<br>
I can talk of myself (and think many other here feel the same) that sometimes when a wave of people hits and behave bad I am angry and I should be nicer to other people.</p>
<p>So to us, even when we have people misbehave and maybe even spaming or other stuff we should still try to be serious and nice to each other :)</p>
<p>Have a nice day all!</p>

        <p>Taking a risk of offending people is not a means to push your opinion. There is no law against it, but there are community guidelines against it.<br>
Pushing the buttons of other people, you full well know that sooner or later you will push a button that triggers something. That’s why we don’t push each others buttons in the first place. you can always make your point without being rude.</p>

<p>This is not cool, and you have kind of missed the point entirely.</p>
<p>As the post says, the people behind the non-profit app are spending time out of their days to help everyone get the best out of the app. Of late, with the influx of users requesting (and demanding!) features akin to WhatsApp and the other monstrosities, it’s likely to take its toll.</p>
<p>I appreciate what you are saying, to a degree. I also don’t think your post should be ‘hidden’ as it’s been reported by the Cancel-Culture-Community. I firmly believe that if you say something, you own that! As you will expect, people are entitled to reply to that to support or rebut. That’s called a conversation. So you shouldn’t be denied that. That said, the Community Guidelines are what they are. And if we disagree, we can chose not to participate.</p>
<p>In summary, the bottom line is being aware of the unkindness towards those trying to help. Berating developers for not having something featured isn’t likely to inspire ‘will’. Neither is your post. But then you have every right to say what you have said and others have the right to reply to it accordingly. In my opinion, anyway.</p>

          <p>Firstly. Thank you to Signal Devs. I think you’re all doing an amazing job and I will be signing up to donate, even if it is a small amount.</p>
<p>One thing I want to say to the Signal Dev Team. I bet that 99% of your user base appreciate all the hard work you are doing and want to support you in any way they can, myself included, even if just morally. Please don’t let that 1% of intolerant users discourage you from all the great input you have.</p>
<p>I am a great supporter of free speech even if something is “offensive” but posters must also realize the difference between <strong>“saying something offensive”</strong> and <strong>"hate speech"</strong></p>

<p>You might have the right to say what you want, but free speech isn’t about interrupting a conversation about football yelling about zebras. Free speech is about tolerance, about a productive and focused conversation –that’s why there’re guidelines, and why guidelines are there to be tolerated.</p>

<p>I was one of the flaggers. I am fine with someone disagreeing with me and refuting or rebutting what I’ve said. I even tolerate them doing so rudely if their points are salient. (A few hours later I usually come back and +1 their post with begrudging flouncing) If their first post on a forum is flaming someone without addressing a single one of their points in a coherent or sensible way, misrepresenting the letter and spirit of the conversation and acting generally in bad-faith, then I will flag that as it’s not a conversation, it’s just pointless screaming. If they also break the rules then they’re definitely getting a flag.</p>
<p>Flagging/reporting a post is not cancel culture at all. Flagging a rude, abusive or entirely unconstructive post is doing your bit as a member of the community to weed out bad behaviour and bad actors. I urge everyone to flag anyone posting in bad faith, or breaking the rules. Flag it all and let the pages written by people who detract from the conversation burn.</p>

<article>
    <p>Everyone knows good code is easy to maintain, but that also means anyone can maintain it. That’s no bueno for the individual developer who wants a little job security. Writing overly complex code that nobody else can maintain let alone read, will ensure your company holds onto you, and will give you more bargaining power come raise time.</p>
<p>We’re going to work with a simplified example for the rest of this article. Imagine your boss has asked you to write a program that will count from 1 to 9 and print out the number, along with if it is even. A valid output would be as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">1 is even: False
2 is even: True
3 is even: False
4 is even: True
5 is even: False
6 is even: True
7 is even: False
8 is even: True
9 is even: False
</code></pre></div><p>Your boss might’ve said this would be part of the test suite for the NPM package <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-even">is-even</a> but you stopped listening about halfway through to figure out how many story points this would be on the next sprint.</p>
<p>Oh well, sounds easy enough right? Any developer worth their salt knows a simple for loop could solve this problem.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (int i = 1; i &lt; 10; i++) {
  Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {i % 2 == 0}");
}
</code></pre></div><p>But as correct as this solution might be, it doesn’t guarantee us job security which is after all the most important principle of good code.</p>
<p>Time to add a little complexity to ensure no one else will dare touch the code, or try to understand it.</p>

<p>Just so we’re all on the same page, a for loop is comprised of a statement, and a body.</p>
<p>The statement is the portion which sits atop the loop and is within parenthesis. It’s divided into three parts. Each of which is separated by a semi-colon.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for(initializer; condition; iterator) {}
</code></pre></div><ol>
<li>initializer: The initializer is the first part, and usually instantiates a variable. Say <code>int i = 0;</code></li>
<li>condition: The condition is the middle portion and is checked each pass of the loop to ensure it’s true. When the condition tests false, the loop is exited.</li>
<li>iterator: The last portion is the iterator, this is typically used to increment the loop variable ex: <code>i++</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>All 3 parts of the statement are optional, and an empty for loop <code>for (; ;) { }</code> will act like an infinite while loop <code>while(1) { }</code>.</p>
<p>The body is the portion of the loop below the statement. Usually surrounded by curly braces, unless it’s one line (as they’re optional then). I should also mention that the body is optional too.</p>
<p>Let’s go ahead and start writing our <em>ahem</em> abomination.</p>

<p>First off we’ve got some domain logic operating inside the for loop body. The ternary that detects if the number is even: <code>i % 2 == 0</code>. Let’s go ahead and squeeze it into the for statement because after all that’s where it belongs.</p>
<p>We’re going to need an extra variable to hold a <code>isEven</code> flag. But, there’s a bit of a problem. C# only allows for defining multiple variables of the same type in one line. So while the following is perfectly valid:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for(int a = 0, b = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {}
</code></pre></div><p>This is not:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for(int a = 0, bool isEven = false; i &lt; 10; i++) {}
</code></pre></div><p>But that’s okay because we’ll slap it in a value tuple and deconstruct it.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for(var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i &lt; 10; i++) {}
</code></pre></div><p>Now that’s beautiful.</p>
<p>With the bool instantiated we just need to recalculate it each time in the iterator. Thankfully C# is cool with assigning multiple variables of different types on the same line.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i &lt; 10; i++, isEven = i % 2 == 0) { }
</code></pre></div><p>And now our for loop body has been devoided of any logic. It’s clean and concise.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i &lt; 10; i++, isEven = i % 2 == 0) { 
  Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}");
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>I’d argue <code>i &lt; 10</code> is too readable. Since the condition just needs to be a boolean we can substitute it with anything we please provided it evaluates to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. Which basically makes it a no-brainer to swap it out with a switch expression.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i switch { 10 =&gt; false, _ =&gt; true }; i++, isEven = i % 2 == 0) { 
  Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}");
}
</code></pre></div><p>The switch expression will still run our loop from 1 to 9 as intended. Each iteration of the loop it’ll see which case it matches i against. The underscore (or discard) is equivalent to the default case of a switch statement. Therefore while i is not 10 it’ll return true which means keep running the loop, and once it hits 10 the switch will return false saying it’s time to stop.</p>
<p>But we can take this a step further and add erroneous cases. As long as the switch never hits said cases it doesn’t mess with the logic.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i switch { 10 =&gt; false, 14 =&gt; true, 69 =&gt; false, 420 =&gt; true,_ =&gt; true }; i++, isEven = i % 2 == 0) { 
  Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}");
}
</code></pre></div><p>And on top of that they don’t even have to be in order. Also note that erroneous cases can return <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. This is extra important to add another layer of confusion.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i switch { 14 =&gt; false, 69 =&gt; true, 10 =&gt; false, 420 =&gt; true, _ =&gt; true }; i++, isEven = i % 2 == 0) { 
  Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}");
}
</code></pre></div><p>For the finishing touch let’s kick it up a notch. A switch case has to be a literal or constant, which removes the usages of methods, and the such but still leaves math on the table.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i switch { 14 * 4 =&gt; false, 69 * 250 / 84 =&gt; true, 10 =&gt; false, 420 =&gt; true, _ =&gt; true }; i++, isEven = i % 2 == 0) { 
  Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}");
}
</code></pre></div><p>I recommend leaving the math a fifth grade level. We want to give the reader a flash back to their day in grade school learning their multiplication tables.</p>
<p>Oh and did I mention we can add some math and more to the return values? After all they just need to be booleans.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i switch { 14 * 4 =&gt; false, 69 * 250 / 84 =&gt; 8 / 2 == 4, 10 =&gt; false, 420 =&gt; 7 * 6 == 92, _ =&gt; true }; i++, isEven = i % 2 == 0) { 
  Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}");
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>We’re not done yet. Our solution is optimal, but everyone knows that a 1 line solution is <strong>always</strong> better. Right now you’re either begging for mercy or thinking there’s no way it’s possible. Even if we removed the brackets it’s still 2 lines.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i switch { 14 * 4 =&gt; false, 69 * 250 / 84 =&gt; 8 / 2 == 4, 10 =&gt; false, 420 =&gt; 7 * 6 == 92, _ =&gt; true }; i++, isEven = i % 2 == 0)
  Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}");
</code></pre></div><p>But if there’s a will there’s a way.</p>
<p>Our next magic trick is going to involve a little inspiration from JavaScript. Have you ever heard of a self invoking function? It’s basically a function declaration that immediately executes itself.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">(function () {
  console.log("foo");
})();
// prints "foo" to the console
</code></pre></div><p>And while we may be in the .NET world, who’s to say we can’t borrow a little inspiration?</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">new Action(() =&gt; Console.WriteLine("foo"))();
// prints "foo" to the console
</code></pre></div><p>Let’s take our new found knowledge and replace the iterator of our loop. Because after all when all you’ve got is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i switch { 14 * 4 =&gt; false, 69 * 250 / 84 =&gt; 8 / 2 == 4, 10 =&gt; false, 420 =&gt; 7 * 6 == 92, _ =&gt; true }; (i, isEven) = new Func&lt;int, (int, bool)&gt;((i) =&gt; (i + 1, !(i % 2 == 0)))(i)) {
    Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}");
}
</code></pre></div><p>This is the little bit we added.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">new Func&lt;int, (int, bool)&gt;((i) =&gt; (i + 1, !(i % 2 == 0)))(i)
</code></pre></div><p>A Func&lt;&gt; is the same thing as an Action except it can have parameters, and a return value. In our instance, the function takes an int parameter, and returns a value tuple containing an int, and bool. Make sure you name your function parameters the same as the variable being passed in.</p>
<p>The real reason why we added in the self invoking function isn’t to make it more confusing. No. We just needed a new location to place our <code>Console.WriteLine()</code> call.</p>
<p>That my friends is how we can achieve our glorious one liner solution.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i switch { 14 * 4 =&gt; false, 69 * 250 / 84 =&gt; 8 / 2 == 4, 10 =&gt; false, 420 =&gt; 7 * 6 == 92, _ =&gt; true }; (i, isEven) = new Func&lt;int, (int, bool)&gt;((i) =&gt; { Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}"); return (i + 1, !(i % 2 == 0)); })(i));

</code></pre></div><p>Here’s the self invoking function for those who somehow have trouble reading our work of art.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">new Func&lt;int, (int, bool)&gt;((i) =&gt; { Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}"); return (i + 1, !(i % 2 == 0); }(i)
</code></pre></div>
<p>We could take things further, but before doing some I’d recommend assessing the rankings of your co-workers. If you work alongside a lot of junior devs, it’s probably sufficient, but if you work with more senior developers we could always break out a few more tricks. I’ll leave this as an exercise for the reader.</p>
<p>With everything coded up, and testing good, it’s time to commit your masterpiece and send off some requests for code reviews. Come to think of it it’s probably about time to head on home as this likely took most the day. Go home and enjoy some brews. Because tomorrow when your boss calls you into his office it’s gonna be for that promotion you’ve been wanting.</p>
<p>PS: If anyone is hiring an entry level code obfuscator please let me know.</p>

<p>Thank you Chris Cattano for pointing out I had a logic error in the code bits after switching to the self invoking function. The program was incorrectly reporting which numbers were odd. Turns out even I fell prey to the complexity.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>The Mac has always been very different from its close relative, iOS, especially when it comes to what a user is or is not allowed to run on their system. Even with the introduction of Apple Silicon, Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10686/?t=1161">has made it very clear</a> that the Mac is still the Mac, and is still <em>hackable</em>, even when running on the new architecture.</p><p>What this means for us developers is that, when targeting the Mac platform, we have choices: we can distribute our apps independently, outside the Mac App Store, through the Mac App Store exclusively, or through both at the same time.</p><p>This article is my brain dump on the subject. It is meant to be a guide on the things that you’ll need to know about when distributing a Mac app outside the App Store, rather than a how-to tutorial. My hope is that having everything listed here will help demystify the process for beginners, and the descriptions of my own process will be useful as starting points.</p><h2>App Store x Direct: pros and cons</h2><p>All of these choices come with their pros and cons, and depending on which type of Mac app you’re making, you might not be able to have it in the Mac App Store to begin with. An example of that is my app <a href="https://v2.airbuddy.app/">AirBuddy</a> which, in order to provide deep integration with Apple’s wireless devices, needs to run a system agent and use some private APIs, which would never be allowed in the App Store. The same goes for many other types of apps which simply wouldn’t work with the restrictions of the Mac’s sandbox.</p><p>For those who do have that choice, I’ve compiled a list of what I believe to be the pros and cons between shipping through the Mac App Store or shipping directly.</p><h3>Mac App Store pros</h3><ul><li>Apple handles the distribution, billing and licensing for you</li><li>The app is easier to find and install for most users</li><li>Potential to get featured by Apple and reach more customers</li><li>Can use features such as Sign in With Apple which are not available for apps distributed outside the Mac App Store</li></ul><h3>Mac App Store cons</h3><ul><li>Have to pay a 15% or 30% cut of all sales to Apple, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/">depending on how much you make in a year across all apps</a></li><li>Every single update, no matter how minor, has to go through App Review and has the potential of being rejected for arbitrary and random reasons</li><li>Can’t unlock the full potential of macOS because of the strict sandboxing requirements</li><li>Can’t do paid upgrades</li></ul><h3>Direct distribution pros</h3><ul><li>Ship updates whenever you want, no need to wait for them to be reviewed and no fear of random rejections</li><li>Unlock the full potential of macOS with system extensions, daemons, no sandboxing, private API, and more</li><li>Keep a higher percentage of your sales</li><li>Do paid upgrades or other business models which are not allowed in the App Store</li><li>Live without the constant fear that your app will suddenly become a problem for Apple and be threatened with removal from the App Store</li></ul><h3>Direct distribution cons</h3><ul><li>Have to handle licensing, distribution, and updates (it’s not that hard, you’ll see)</li><li>Not as easy to do consumable or non-consumable in-app purchases (no StoreKit)</li><li>Can’t use some Apple services such as Sign in With Apple (others such as CloudKit still work just fine)</li></ul><h2>A note on Catalyst and SwiftUI</h2><p>With the introduction of Catalyst, we’re now seeing many new Mac apps being released, since it’s a lot easier to take an existing iPad app and turn it into a Mac app. Apps ported to macOS through Catalyst are not required to be released in the App Store, even if their counterpart on iOS is.</p><p>Additionally, there is currently no TestFlight for macOS (one of my wishes for 2021), so if you’d like to distribute beta builds of a Catalyst app, you’ll have to do that outside the Mac App Store, and it is not that different from distributing a production app.</p><p>A lot of what I’m presenting here will also apply for Catalyst apps — they’re Mac apps, after all — but some might require additional hacking in order to work around the fact that Apple doesn’t want you to use the entirety of AppKit directly from within a Catalyst app. With a bit of work though, you can make a Catalyst app very Mac-capable, including <a href="https://www.highcaffeinecontent.com/blog/20190607-Beyond-the-Checkbox-with-Catalyst-and-AppKit">support for AppleScript</a> and other features.</p><p>For SwiftUI apps targeting the Mac, there should be no major differences with the distribution process, since you can use all features of the macOS API in a SwiftUI app without requiring a lot of hacking like it does for Catalyst apps.</p><h2>Distribution</h2><p>Distribution of an app involves two parts: actually uploading, storing and serving the app binary and its updates somewhere, and also producing the right package that will work for your users.</p><h3>Hosting</h3><p>The first major step with getting your Mac app in the hands of users without the App Store is to figure out how to distribute its binary. No App Store means that you’ll have to host your app’s binaries and updates somewhere on the internet and provide a link for your users to download it.</p><p>There are several ways you can go about this. For an open-source app, you can use Github releases and even host your app’s update feed in the Github repo. That’s how I distribute the <a href="https://github.com/insidegui/WWDC/releases">WWDC app for macOS</a>.</p><p>For my commercial apps, I’ve been using <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html">Backblaze B2</a> for storage of both the app binaries, delta updates and update feed, and proxying all requests through <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> so that I can have a custom domain for the downloads/updates and also add filtering, caching and logic on the server if needed.</p><p>B2 is an extremely affordable provider (I rarely pay over US$1 in a month). Most Mac apps are not that large in size, so even if your app is downloaded a lot, it’s unlikely that you’ll end up having to pay a lot of money for storage/bandwidth. Another popular option is using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> buckets, but their control panel gives me nightmares so I prefer to use B2 which is a lot simpler (and less expensive).</p><p>I haven’t automated the publishing step for my app releases as of yet, so to upload a new release I just use <a href="https://panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a> as a client for my B2 buckets. Speaking of that, before we even get to upload a release to whatever provider we’ve chosen, there’s a very important step: getting the right file to put out there.</p><h3>Notarization and packaging</h3><p>When exporting an archived app from within Xcode, we get two main options for distribution: App Store Connect and Developer ID. To distribute apps without the App Store, you’re going to be using Developer ID.</p><p>The same developer account you use for distributing apps to the Mac App Store can be used to sign your apps for Developer ID distribution. The certificate itself is different, but Xcode will auto-generate and install one for you during the process of exporting the archive if you haven’t done so yet.</p><p>Since macOS Catalina, all apps distributed directly to users must be notarized by Apple, otherwise they won’t launch by default. This process uploads your app to Apple, which will then run automated malware checks and “staple” your binary with a special signature that will allow it to run. This is not App Review, it’s an automated check to prevent malware from being distributed through this method, and it is also a way for Apple to flag a single binary for malware, instead of a developer’s entire account, should it become compromised at some point.</p><p>Whether or not you notarize the binary directly from within the Xcode organizer will depend on which packaging method you’ll be using to distribute your app. We can’t just upload a <code>.app</code> directory to a server and let users download that, we have to turn it into a flat file. The simple way to do that is to just zip the app and distribute it as a zip file, but I’ve found through experience that distributing the app as a DMG file reduces support requests by quite a bit.</p><p>You’ve probably seen DMGs before when downloading Mac apps. They’re disk images that are mounted by macOS when double-clicked in Finder, and they can also provide some artwork instructing the user to drag the app into their Applications folder. This makes it easy for a user to figure out what to do, and it also reduces the chances that a given user will be running your app from their Downloads folder or some other random place like that.</p><p>If you’re going to be distributing your app as a DMG, you should just export it using the Developer ID option in Xcode, without notarization, then notarize the DMG itself. There’s no option in Xcode to export a DMG, so you’ll have to use a third-party tool. The one I like to use is <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/create-dmg">create-dmg</a>. I’ve also created and open-sourced <a href="https://github.com/insidegui/dmgdist">dmgdist</a>, a tool that automates the process of creating, uploading and stapling the DMG so that you can get the image ready to be distributed by running a single command.</p><p>To distribute the app as a zip file, the process is simpler: pick the upload option from Xcode after selecting “Developer ID” and it’ll produce a notarized version of your app, which you can then zip up and distribute directly.</p><h2>App updates</h2><p>Another aspect of the App Store is that it also handles app updates. Whenever we upload a new version to App Store Connect and it gets approved, users receive the update in the App Store. For apps distributed directly, we need to replicate that somehow.</p><p>The best way to do that — and the most common — is to use <a href="https://sparkle-project.org/">Sparkle</a>. It’s been around for many many years and is pretty much the official way to distribute updates for Mac apps distributed outside the Mac App Store.</p><p>Sparkle is currently living a double life of sorts. You can either use the “legacy” version of Sparkle or use a more modern “v2” branch which includes many improvements such as the ability to update sandboxed apps. I still use the “legacy” version because it’s the one that I’m familiar with and I find that integrating the more modern version is still a bit more complicated. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.</p><p>The process of generating an app update usually goes as follows: ensure that with every update you increase the app’s version (of course), produce the package as described before (Sparkle can handle zips, DMGs and installer packages), then use the <code>generate_appcast</code> tool to update the feed. After doing that, upload the deltas, the package for the new version, and the updated AppCast …</p></div></article></div>

                <div>
                    <p>Over one year ago, I decided to quit my data science job and pursue my <a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/">bootstrapped data science side-project</a> full time. It was a hard decision to make, but once I quit and was freed from the corporate nine to five, my life turned to complete bliss.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>That bliss lasted about two weeks before it reverted back to the mean. Honeymoons exist in all facets of life, and bootstrapping a business does not make you impervious to Mondays. Rather every day just became a Thursday. But more on that later...</p><p>I wanted to reflect on this past year plus of bootstrapping and add in some frameworks for why anyone reading this on the fence of quitting their job for their side-hustle should do so. Quitting was one of the hardest decisions that I had to make, but the best one I went through with. It's also a decision that many people should not do. </p><p>But for the small percentage of the people out there, bootstrapping a startup can be an awesome thing. You resign yourself to make trades. </p><p>You trade a steady stream of work and meetings for flexibility in your own time and hours. You trade your current monthly salary now for no income but with future options of money. And you trade office externalities and politics for taking full control of how your career might turn out. </p><p>And ultimately if those trades and values are worth it, then quitting your job can make sense in a very real way. </p><h2 id="how-it-got-started">How it got started</h2><p>On November 1st 2019, I officially quit my job as a data scientist at Nextdoor after working there for exactly a year. I had started a side project called Interview Query with my co-founder, Shane, six months prior. </p><p>Interview Query started out as an email newsletter that each day sent a user a data science interview question, and then the solution the next day if the user upgraded to premium. Over the past year we’ve built the product into a fully-fledged data science course, questions database, and became the de-facto data science interview prep resource.<br></p><figure><img src="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-18.png" alt="Interview Query SQL" srcset="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-18.png 600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/image-18.png 1000w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-18.png 1364w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>An example of a SQL interview question we would send out. If you paid for premium, we would send a detailed explanation + solution the next day.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The first time someone purchased a subscription in June of 2019, my co-founder Shane was convinced it was a stolen credit card. It took five more customers before he truly believed that we were not just a test platform for fraudsters. And we watched in fascination as our newsletter grew from $60/mo in revenue to $3,000/mo in revenue. <br></p><figure><img src="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-19.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-19.png 600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/image-19.png 1000w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-19.png 1258w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>And while $3K/mo was a lot of money, it still wasn’t enough to constitute quitting our jobs. Shane was working part-time on it while also working a software engineering job. And I was also a pretty senior data scientist making <a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/blog-data-science-salaries">$160K/year</a>. So an apples to apples comparison of going from to $14K/month to $1.5K/month didn’t really seem worth it. </p><p>But direct income &nbsp;isn’t the only comparison you have to make. </p><h2 id="opportunity-cost">Opportunity Cost</h2><p>The hardest jump to make is almost always on money. Money has always had significance to me. I was born and raised as a Chinese American which meant money was and still is an intrinsic part of my identity. The comedian <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_KpLrHCAx0">Ronnie Chieng does a funny bit</a> on what money means to Chinese people.</p><blockquote>“Do you know what the direct translation of <em>Happy New Year</em> in Mandarin is? Hope - you - get - rich. <strong>That's not Happy New Year!</strong>"</blockquote><p>To my Chinese parents, they could have added an addendum of - <em>Hope you get rich while working a stable job with low risk.</em> For with all monetary pursuits, the equation that works best within typical Chinese American families is:</p><p><em>Current income * very stable job * years of working = <strong>Best Possible Outcome Ever</strong></em></p><p>It’s a pretty linear expectation of wealth that requires a normal day to day grind and the advantages of compound interest. But the equation never really took into account tweaking the risk factor. What happens when your current income drops and risk tolerance increases? </p><p>This was the pivotal question that made it difficult for me to quit. But a month before I ended up leaving, I met up with my old startup boss at a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/08/monster-snaps-up-tinder-for-jobs-app-jobr/">company where we exited into an acquisition</a>. I told him about the dilemma I was in, and he illustrated a newer way of looking at it. </p><blockquote>If you have a product that’s making $3K/month and you can grow that into $5K/month in a few months by working full time on it, you have to realize that the <strong>actual added value of growing your business</strong> is turning it from $36K/year in revenue to $60K/year in revenue.<br></blockquote><p>This realization helped me understand the <strong>value investment of full-time work. </strong>Money and finances can be traded for time and investment in a business in ways that you can't when you work a job. Work your ass off for a year at any FAANG type of tech company and your boss will reward you with a 15% raise. Work hard on your business and double your monthly revenue after a year, <strong>well your business also just doubled in value. </strong></p><p>So the opportunity cost of trading a job that made me $160K/year didn’t seem that bad anymore if I could at least <strong>forecast a rate of growth that would be worth my time and investment</strong> as if I was working another full time job. </p><p>And at least on my own business, I’d enjoy the work. </p><h2 id="flexibility-and-values">Flexibility and Values</h2><p>Everything gets destroyed when you bulldoze a building. The walls, the appliances, even parts of the foundation. And while throwing a wrecking ball into the corporate 9-5 felt gratifying, picking up the pieces to rebuild <strong>exactly how I would work</strong> took just as much careful planning and thought. </p><p>Balancing structure and life is important when bootstrapping. A lifestyle business allows you flexibility in how you would like to run your business. Before I quit my job, I talked to a career coach (ironically employed by the company) who encouraged me to figure out my values - and try to see if quitting allowed me to prioritize them accordingly.</p><p>Eventually I realized it did when I wanted to re-prioritize my activity list from:</p><ol><li><em>Data science job</em></li><li><em>Surfing</em></li><li><em>Side-Hustle (Interview Query)</em></li><li><em>Friends and Relationships</em></li><li><em>Random data projects</em></li></ol><p>to</p><ol><li><em>Surfing</em></li><li><em>Interview Query</em></li><li><em>Friends and Relationships</em></li><li><em>Random data projects</em></li><li><em>Things I don’t want to do but have to do to make money</em></li></ol><p>This clear order of change in my lifestyle made me realize that valuing flexibility was extremely important. It was also something I couldn't attain in my day job.</p><p>For example, when an amazing swell approaches Ocean Beach now, I reschedule meetings, log off, and go surfing. Shane and I both have trust that I'm going to finish the work that needs to get done. But if I were to receive a meeting at my old job that conflicted or I didn't want to attend - there was no way around it. </p><p>As controllers of our own fate, we make it a priority to cut down all the things we don’t want to do, and hire for those roles. If we need vacation time, then we take it.</p><p>But on that note of flexibility comes the other way - how flexible can we be while still working? And how much did we really want to work in general?</p><h2 id="financial-independence-of-sorts">Financial Independence of Sorts</h2><p>In February of 2020, Interview Query was churning out a consistent $9K/month in revenue. We tripled revenue by increasing our distribution and had transitioned from the email newsletter to building a very simple interface for viewing all of the interview questions and solutions. It was also enough to now cover my rent and general expenses.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-22.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-22.png 600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/image-22.png 1000w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/image-22.png 1600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w2400/2021/01/image-22.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/questions/bank-fraud-model">Our current interface - much improved from before</a></figcaption></figure><p>And better yet we still weren’t even working that much. I had taken a long vacation in New Zealand and Shane was still working part time. For a moment, it seemed like it was going to be a 4-hour work week kind of business that we could maintain without adding new product features. </p><p>But realistically, <strong>I had nothing else to work on</strong>. I still hadn’t gotten any of my other side-projects off the ground at the time. Surfing season was slowly ramping down. I looked around at what I was doing and realized that this project was the only one working and growing on its own. So why not invest to work on it?</p><p>One of my favorite ice breakers is asking people what they would do with their life if they received $10,000/month forever. Kind of like a basic<strong> </strong>(wealthy) income.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img alt="nRF9160 Feather Test CLI" src="https://www.jaredwolff.com/testing-hardware-using-rust/images/Screen_Shot_2021-01-06_at_10.30.55_AM.png" data-src="images/Screen_Shot_2021-01-06_at_10.30.55_AM.png"></p><p>Rust has grown on me over the past year. I consumed <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/" target="_blank">The Book</a> while on a plane ride in February of last year <em>right</em> before Covid hit. It has basically been all downhill since. 😅</p><p>Since then, i’ve designed a (very alpha) <a href="https://github.com/jaredwolff/eagle-plm" target="_blank">CLI based MRP system</a>, e-commerce backend for <a href="https://www.jaredwolff.com/store/" target="_blank">my static website</a>, CLI based tester and firmware for my nRF9160 Feather test fixture. Yea, all in Rust.</p><p>In this article, i’ll be sharing details about how I developed the CLI and ATSAMD based tester for the <a href="https://www.jaredwolff.com/store/nrf9160-feather/" target="_blank">nRF9160 Feather</a>. By the end this should give you confidence that you can also develop your own firmware and software 100% in Rust!</p><p>Let’s get started.</p><h2 id="sprinkle-some-rust-in-your-firmware">Sprinkle some Rust in your firmware</h2><p><img alt="nRF9160 Feather tester hardware render" src="https://www.jaredwolff.com/testing-hardware-using-rust/images/feather-tester_v14.png" data-src="images/feather-tester_v14.png"></p><p>As mentioned earlier, I designed my tester hardware (pictured above) to use an ATSAMD microcontroller. I had a few reasons why I chose the ATSAMD21:</p><ol><li>It has a <strong>ton</strong> of pins. (ATSAMD21J18A-MFT has 52 to be exact!) This was going to be important in order to connect to and control everything about the DUT (Device under test) in the tester.</li><li>SAMD21 series is also ubiquitous and plentiful elsewhere. It also happens to have great support in the form of the <code>atsamd-hal</code> crate. (<a href="https://github.com/atsamd-rs/atsamd" target="_blank">Link</a>)</li></ol><p>While there is some test firmware on the DUT itself, there’s a bunch of exciting stuff happening on the tester side. But before we do, let’s chat about the bootloader.</p><h3 id="first-thing-you-should-do">First thing you should do</h3><p>After lots of tinkering I realized that one of the first things you should do on any SAMD based project is get the UF2 bootloader loaded. Since loading it onto my test board <strong>I haven’t used my debug probe.</strong> (Rust makes this extremely easy since it eliminates 80% of the stupid mistakes i’d otherwise make in C)</p><p>Here’s a quick primer on how I got my board working:</p><ol><li><p>I cloned the UF2 repo:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">git clone https://github.com/microsoft/uf2-samdx1
</code></pre></div></li><li><p>Created a folder called <code>circuitdojo_feather_tester</code> within the <code>boards</code> directory.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">cd uf2-samdx1
mkdir boards/circuitdojo_feather_tester
</code></pre></div></li><li><p>I created <code>board.mk</code> and <code>board_config.h</code></p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">cd boards/circuitdojo_feather_tester
touch board.mk
touch board_config.h
</code></pre></div></li><li><p>Using the already existing boards in the <code>boards</code> folder, updated the contents of <code>http://board.mk</code> and <code>board_config.h</code>. First <code>board.mk</code> to define what chip I was targeting:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c">CHIP_FAMILY <span>=</span> samd21
CHIP_VARIANT <span>=</span> SAMD21J18A
</code></pre></div><p>Then <code>board_config.h</code> for all the configuration bits:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>#ifndef BOARD_CONFIG_H
</span><span>#define BOARD_CONFIG_H
</span><span></span>
<span>#define VENDOR_NAME "Circuit Dojo"
</span><span>#define PRODUCT_NAME "Feather Tester"
</span><span>#define VOLUME_LABEL "BOOT"
</span><span>#define INDEX_URL "https:</span><span>//www.jaredwolff.com/"
</span><span></span><span>#define BOARD_ID "SAMD21G18A-Feather-v0"
</span><span></span>
<span>#define USB_VID 0x16c0
</span><span>#define USB_PID 0x27dd
</span><span></span>
<span>#define LED_PIN PIN_PA22
</span><span></span>
<span>#endi
</span></code></pre></div></li><li><p>Then using the instructions in the Readme, build the code:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">make BOARD<span>=</span>circuitdojo_feather_tester
</code></pre></div><p>I used the toolchain that comes with NCS v1.4.1. I did have to make a change to the Makefile for everything to compile without borking. Turns out my toolchain was newer than expected. Fortunately adding <code>Wno-deprecated</code> inside the Makefile to the <code>WFLAGS</code> variable fixes this problem.</p></li><li><p>Once complete it will dump your binary/hex files to <code>build/&lt;your board name&gt;</code></p></li><li><p>Then I flashed the bootloader using <code>pyocd</code> like so:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">pyocd flash -t ATSAMD21J18A -f <span>4000000</span> bootloader-circuitdojo_feather_tester-v3.4.0-65-gdf89a1f-dirty.elf --format elf
</code></pre></div><p><code>pyocd</code> is just one of many ways to load firmware. The <a href="https://github.com/atsamd-rs/atsamd" target="_blank"><code>atsamd-rs</code> repo</a> has a ton more options.</p></li></ol><p>Once programmed, hit the reset button twice in quick succession to enable bootloader mode. (I believe this is consistent across all other boards using the UF2 bootloader. Correct me if i’m wrong!) This will cause the bootloader to remain active so you can transfer new firmware.</p><p>On a scale from easy to painful, this was defintiely on the easy side of the spectrum. The folks at Microsoft and contributors like Adafruit made this process <em>really simple.</em></p><h3 id="hey-my-name-is-hal">Hey, my name is HAL</h3><p><img alt="Compiling Rust firmware" src="https://www.jaredwolff.com/testing-hardware-using-rust/images/Screen_Shot_2021-01-10_at_12.37.34_PM.png" data-src="images/Screen_Shot_2021-01-10_at_12.37.34_PM.png"></p><p>As of this writing, every different hardware platform has some type of independently created HAL (hardware abstraction layer). Atmel’s SAMD differs slightly from nRF and that differs from the STM32s of the world. The nice thing is as long as they conform to the higher level APIs, you can use something like the <a href="https://github.com/mvirkkunen/usb-device" target="_blank">USB crate</a> which supports ATSAMD and STM32.</p><p>The fastest way to get started with your own ATSAMD based board to create your own board definition. You can find a <strong>ton</strong> of example in the <code>boards</code> directory. Many off the shelf boards are already supported which makes for one less thing you need to do!</p><p>If you do find yourself with a custom board, you can copy one of the already existing boards that is closest to yours. For instance I used <code>feather_m0</code> as the base for my tester board. I tweaked <code>memory.x</code> and <code>src/lib.rs</code> to my liking.</p><p>There’s even a cool way to define pins so you can easily access them later. For for instance if you have a pin named <code>FLASH_EN</code> and it’s mapped to pin port B, pin 8 you can simply reference it later on using the <code>Pins</code> struct like <code>pins.flash_en</code>. (More below..)</p><p>The ATSAMD repo is going through some slow and steady improvements. There are even some nice additions to the <a href="https://github.com/atsamd-rs/atsamd/pull/371" target="_blank">board support</a> area that i’m excited about and testing. While it’s mostly useable, it is rough in some areas (especially related to documentation).</p><p><em>Big shoutout to Bradley who has been spearheading these improvements. If I were to do any of this, i’d be surprised it would be working by then of it.</em> 😅</p><h3 id="dont-be-unsafe">Don’t be <code>unsafe</code></h3><p>When I first started developing the test firmware, I notice that I was using <code>unsafe</code> a lot. While in hardwareland using <code>unsafe</code> is not uncommon, from a readability and risk for increased errors perspective, it can get hairy.</p><p>There is a cool solution around this and that’s where <code>rtic</code> enters the picture. <code>rtic</code> is a new spin on how to write firmware in Rust. Instead of having the familiar <code>main</code> function, it works differently. Here’s the features from <a href="https://github.com/rtic-rs/cortex-m-rtic" target="_blank">the Github page</a>:</p><ul><li><strong>Tasks</strong>&nbsp;as the unit of concurrency [^1]. Tasks can be&nbsp;<em>event triggered</em>&nbsp;(fired in response to asynchronous stimuli) or spawned by the application on demand.</li><li><strong>Message passing</strong>&nbsp;between tasks. Specifically, messages can be passed to software tasks at spawn time.</li><li><strong>A timer queue</strong>&nbsp;[^2]. Software tasks can be scheduled to run at some time in the future. This feature can be used to implement periodic tasks.</li><li>Support for prioritization of tasks and, thus,&nbsp;<strong>preemptive multitasking</strong>.</li><li><strong>Efficient and data race free memory sharing</strong>&nbsp;through fine grained&nbsp;<em>priority based</em>&nbsp;critical sections [^1].</li><li><strong>Deadlock free execution</strong>&nbsp;guaranteed at compile time. This is an stronger guarantee than what’s provided by&nbsp;<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html" target="_blank">the standard&nbsp;<code>Mutex</code>abstraction</a>.</li><li><strong>Minimal scheduling overhead</strong>. The task scheduler has minimal software footprint; the hardware does the bulk of the scheduling.</li><li><strong>Highly efficient memory usage</strong>: All the tasks share a single call stack and there’s no hard dependency on a dynamic memory allocator.</li><li><strong>All Cortex-M devices are fully supported</strong>.</li><li>This task model is amenable to known WCET (Worst Case Execution Time) analysis and scheduling analysis techniques. (Though we haven’t yet developed Rust friendly tooling for that.)</li></ul><p>While all these features and capabilities seem great, so what gives?</p><p>Well, for starters there’s no <code>main</code> function. 🙀</p><p>Here’s what a basic blinky app looks like using some of the new BSP (Board support packages) I mentioned earlier:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>#![deny(unsafe_code)]</span>

        }

</code></pre></div><p>The <code>init</code> function is where you would normally put anything you’d normally put in an Arduino <code>setup</code> function. We’re setting up pins and peripherals. If you want to use them later on though, you’ll need to create an entry in <code>Resources</code>. This is also where you store any type of static mutable data structures that you need elsewhere in your firmware.</p><p>The <code>idle</code> function is similar to the <code>loop</code> function in Arduino. It’s important though that if you want a loop, you have to implement it. Here’s the warning in the <a href="https://rtic.rs/0.5/book/en/by-example/app.html?highlight=loop#idle" target="_blank"><code>rtic</code> documentation</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Unlike init, idle will run with interrupts enabled and it’s not allowed to return so it must run forever.</p></blockquote><p>You don’t <strong>need</strong> to use an <code>idle</code> function though. If you don’t, your microcontroller will go to sleep. This is ideal for battery powered applications that need to sleep as much as possible.</p><p>In <code>rtic</code> every work function gets a <code>Context</code> variable. It allow you to access resources that are pertinent to that function’s purpose. Access is only granted though when you add a resource like below:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>#[idle(resources=[led_pass, delay]</span>)]
</code></pre></div><p>If <code>resources</code> was not set like above, I would not be able to use <code>led_pass</code> or <code>delay</code> within the function!</p><p>While this is a simple example, when you start using static resources like fixed size vectors you’ll be happy you chose to use <code>rtic</code>. The <a href="https://github.com/japaric/heapless" target="_blank"><code>heapless</code></a> crate has been extremely useful for setting size contrained elements that you’d normally be able to use with Rust’s <code>std</code> lib.</p><p>While <code>heapless</code> implements a few very handy types, the <code>Vec</code> and <code>spsc</code> imlementation have been <em>extremely</em> useful. If you’re looking for <code>std</code> conventions for embedded, no need to look further. Get started with <code>heapless</code> with their great documentation <a href="https://japaric.github.io/heapless/heapless/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h3 id="the-confusion-ensues">The confusion ensues</h3><p>One thing that may be confusing …</p></div></div>

<p>Open Source Security, Inc is proud to announce its funding of a full-time and 
public development effort of a <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a> front-end for <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>.
In this blog post, we'll detail the motivations for our involvement and the benefits the public will reap
as a result of this effort.</p>

<h2>A Security Need</h2>

<p>In July of last year, shortly after my virtual <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Kza6fdkSU">presentation</a> at the Linux Security Summit 
North America entitled <a href="https://grsecurity.net/10_years_of_linux_security.pdf">"10 Years of Linux Security - A Report Card"</a>, we put out a 
<a href="https://twitter.com/spendergrsec/status/1283005179135221761">call</a> to other 
companies interested in funding a GCC front-end for Rust.

The motivation for this arose
from outreach from Nick Desaulniers of Google on <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAKwvOdmuYc8rW_H4aQG4DsJzho=F+djd68fp7mzmBp3-wY--Uw@mail.gmail.com/T/">LKML</a> 
to discuss the possibility of Rust support in the Linux kernel at the upcoming Linux 
Plumbers Conference.  One obvious hurdle mentioned immediately was that the kernel is most 
commonly compiled with GCC, while Rust currently requires rustc/LLVM.  According to reports of
the resulting discussion, kernel 
developers were open to the idea of allowing the kernel to be built with GCC and the Rust 
portions with LLVM, as long as the two were ABI compatible.</p>

<p>Such discussions appeared to sidestep a more fundamental issue however: the security 
viability of a mixed assembly/C/Rust execution environment and how cohesive security 
functionality could be provided while mixing different compilers with different 
implementations/availability of said functionality.  The importance of this topic, though apparent 
on reflection, was formalized just recently in a paper by Michalis Papaevripides and Elias 
Athanasopoulos of the University of Cyprus entitled <a href="https://www.cs.ucy.ac.cy/~eliasathan/papers/tops20.pdf">"Exploiting Mixed 
Binaries"</a>.  In it, they detail how the overall security of an execution 
environment can be reduced by the introduction of code written in Rust or that of another 
language where the same binary-level security is not provided by the compiler.  An excerpt from page 3 of the paper makes the impact clear:</p>

<blockquote>
"We experimentally show that CFI can be bypassed using Rust/Go code for developing clearly 
more straight-forward exploits than current state-of-the-art CFI bypasses [57, 70]. Our 
exploits do not rely on respecting the statically computed Control-flow Graph (CFG) for 
bypassing the enforced CFI and are much simpler to implement. [ ... ]
Again, we stress here that in the absence of the safe part (Rust/Go code), the unsafe part 
cannot be trivially exploited."
</blockquote>

<p>
The same exact scenario above was one of the motivations for Microsoft to recently push for their
<a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/08/17/control-flow-guard-for-clang-llvm-and-rust/">Control Flow Guard (CFG) support</a>
in Clang and Rust (see the heading of "Rust linked with C/C++").
</p>

<p>As the source of the GCC plugin infrastructure in the Linux kernel and nearly all of the GCC plugins adapted
for inclusion in the upstream Linux kernel, we too immediately spotted the importance of this problem and set out
to ensure both those plugins as well as the security features built-in to GCC itself are able to instrument code
from all languages supported by the Linux kernel with compatible and consistent security properties.</p>

<h2>Funding Process</h2>

<p>So despite not expecting Rust code to land in the Linux kernel in the near future, we reached out to other 
companies as mentioned above to pull together funding for the GCC front-end effort.  None of the leads 
came to fruition, so we as a company decided to bootstrap the process, in the hopes that as progress in the work
is observed, others would join in.  Further, we wanted to offer funding under the same terms we would want as developers, 
across the entire spectrum: stability, salary, benefits, ownership, etc -- not token compensation or bounties 
that treat those working on free/open source software for the public as somehow <em>less</em> than 
developers of proprietary code.  To that end, we decided to fund the first year of a full-time
developer for the work ourselves.</p>

<p>If the failed experiment of the Core Infrastructure Initiative (<a href="https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/">CII</a>) taught us anything, it's that
one finds dedicated and competent developers for some work not among whoever happens to apply, but 
among those already involved in the work as a passion project.  This led us to reach out 
to <a href="https://thephilbert.io/">Philip Herron</a>, who we noticed was <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs">already working</a> on a GCC front-end for Rust with involvement
of external contributors.  We were extremely pleased to hear Philip was interested in performing the work 
full-time.</p>

<p>News of our outreach eventually extended to the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/steering.html">GCC Steering 
Committee</a>, who contacted us to coordinate efforts.  They were very helpful in recommending to us <a href="https://www.embecosm.com/">Embecosm</a>, a UK-based company with deep experience and involvement in 
GCC/LLVM development, among many other areas.  Embecosm graciously offered to contribute to the effort by 
handling Philip's employment and, at no cost to us, providing project management services to help ensure the project's success.  
The location, expertise, and sharing of our vision of doing right by the developer couldn't have been a 
better match.</p>

<h2>Vendor-Neutral, Developed in the Open</h2>

<p>To make sure the project remains vendor-neutral and in the public interest, Open Source Security, Inc. will not own any of the copyright over the code developed through its funding.
All relevant GCC code for the project is GPLv3-licensed and copyright is assigned, as required for upstream GCC inclusion, to the Free Software Foundation (FSF).  The work is being performed in the open, with Philip providing public monthly status updates on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/Reporting">https://github.com/Rust-GCC/Reporting</a>.  Reports are already available for the months of November and December.
</p>

<h2>Get Involved</h2>

<p>For more information about the "how" of this effort, Embecosm has prepared a 
blog at <a href="https://www.embecosm.com/2021/01/12/gcc-rust-how-it-can-be-achieved/">https://www.embecosm.com/2021/01/12/gcc-rust-how-it-can-be-achieved/</a> that we encourage 
all those interested to read.  To get involved in contributing technical work to the 
effort, Philip can be found on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/the_philbert">@the_philbert</a> or committing to the project's Github repository at <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs">https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-w-id="9dfc6912-3fe0-bf1a-3d6f-bb95ffba0a17"><p>The <a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod">SOLID principles</a> are Object Oriented Programming (OOP) principles designed for writing Clean Code. According to Robert C. Martin’s “<a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">Clean Code</a>” book, in order to keep a good software development pace, it’s important for a team to write Clean Code. By implementing ugly code, you can surely come up with decent results quickly, but in the long run, your project will end up crashing into a wall.<br></p><p>It is known that a software dies when it’s no longer possible to understand it or add new features to it in a reasonable period of time. Keeping things clean is crucial to successfully convey any software project. This line of thought applies especially to machine learning projects that involve taking solutions from research or academic projects and implementing them into a production environment.<br></p><p>Research code is known to be dirty. Why? Because it’s often directed towards one goal only: making proofs of concept (POC) as quickly as possible. In this case, there’s not much incentive to keep one’s code clean. But if you plan on building a maintainable and scalable product, dirty code will not last long.</p><p>‍<br></p><p><strong>“SOLID”, you said? </strong><br></p><p>Here are the SOLID principles, in addition to the Tell Don't Ask (TDA) principle which is also relevant.<br></p><ul role="list"><li>S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).<br>	Every class has one responsibility only.</li><li>O: Open-Closed Principle (OCP). <br>	Classes are closed to modification and open to extension.</li><li>L: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP). <br>	Subtypes should be properly interchangeable with the base type.</li><li>I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP). <br>	Separate interfaces across your objects rather than implementing only a big one.</li><li>D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP). <br>	Depend on abstractions instead of concrete implementations.</li><li>Also: Tell Don’t Ask (TDA). <br> Don’t manage an object from the outside, rather tell it what to do.<br></li></ul><p>Let’s dive deeper into these concepts.</p><p><strong>S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</strong><br></p><p>This principle states that every class has one responsibility only. For instance, if you’re tempted to name a class SomethingAndSomethingElse, it’s a sign that the class should probably be split into two.<br></p><p>Separating classes to give them one responsibility each will ease things when time comes to change code. Not only it will be easier to implement changes, but the different parts will be more reusable and malleable. It‘s an easy and safe way to code successive prototypes. It also makes the test protocol smoother by allowing to test one thing at a time. So when an error pops up, you can easily pinpoint the problem.<br></p><p>In addition, when several developers work together on the same project, respecting the SRP reduces the chances of two developers stepping on each other’s toes (modifying the same object at the same time). Imagine that the SomethingAndSomethingElse class has the responsibility of doing two different tasks (the task Something and the task SomethingElse) and that these tasks need to be refactored. If two developers take care of one task each, they will find themselves modifying the same object at the same time, which will probably cause a conflict in the code when the time comes to merge the two solutions in the project. On the other hand, if SomethingAndSomethingElse is split into two classes in respect of SRP, the two developers can work on two different objects thus avoiding the conflict. Handling conflict in code is generally time consuming and very prone to bugs. This phenomenon should be avoided as much as possible.<br></p><p>Let’s apply SRP to a machine learning context. Suppose we have a class named MyNormalizerAndMyModel. This design pattern is most likely to be too rigid, too specific and not malleable. Here’s what could (and should) be done. First, a class named MyModel would be made. If you think it’s part of the job of MyModel to normalize data, a method named ‘’normalize’’ would be implemented inside of it. If not, another class named MyNormalizer (which would inherit from the same superclass as MyModel) should be implemented. This class would implement the method ‘’normalize’’. Another class named MyPredictor could then be implemented which would ingest data and one or more models to make predictions. MyPredictor would therefore represent what is called a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33091376/python-what-is-exactly-sklearn-pipeline-pipeline">Pipeline</a>. It could encapsulate objects of type MyNormalizer, MyModel, etc. Other models could be implemented and used in the pipeline by simply swapping MyModel with another class representing another model. This way, it is easy to reuse some objects in different contexts without having to duplicate code or modify an existing model (also see Open-Closed Principle - OCP).<br></p><p>Using a framework like <a href="https://github.com/Neuraxio/Neuraxle">Neuraxle</a> (which is open source) greatly facilitates the construction of pipelines.<br></p><p>This principle also applies to data loading. It’s better to give the responsibility of loading data to a class apart from our machine learning algorithm. You would want to pass already loaded and crunched data to a pipeline made of model instances, so that the source of the data and the way to load it (there can be a lot) would not matter for the pipeline. This is also closely related to the Dependency Inversion Principle - DIP.<br></p><p>Another example of properly respecting the SRP in Machine Learning pipelines is to let each step of a pipeline define its own way to initialize itself, to save itself, and to delete itself. This is especially important when implementing deep learning for instance. In that case, some of the pipeline steps might use GPUs as others might use CPUs (<a href="https://www.neuraxle.org/stable/scikit-learn_problems_solutions.html#problem-initializing-the-pipeline-and-deallocating-resources">Such resource management is handled by Neuraxle’s pipelines</a>). It’s therefore important for each step to be able to manage itself. Managing the specifics of each step of a pipeline from outside the pipeline would break not only the SRP but also the Tell Don’t Ask (TDA) principle.<br></p><div><p>Now, suppose that you’re trying to find the best hyperparameters for the different models of a pipeline (this process is called <a href="https://www.neuraxio.com/en/blog/automated-machine-learning-automl/2020/02/22/your-data-scientisti-is-a-mom-(seriously).html">Automated Machine Learning - AutoML</a>). In such a case, it is crucial for each object inside a pipeline to be able to manage its own loading, saving, initialization and deletion in order to effectively allocate and deallocate resources. It would be a nightmare to manage that process outside the model or worst, outside the pipeline. A major default of scikit-learn is its inability to manage this process. It’s also important to respect the SRP and OCP when serializing and saving machine learning pipelines containing code that can’t be saved natively by the python interpreter (e.g.: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41567895/will-scikit-learn-utilize-gpu">here</a> is how Neuraxle solves the issue of using GPU resources, making use of proper abstractions that respects SRP and OCP).</p></div><p><strong>O: Open-Closed Principle (OCP)</strong><br></p><p>This principle states that a class should be closed to modification, and open to extension. Which means that if a new functionality has to be added to a project, you shouldn’t have to go back to existing classes to edit stuff that is already working.<br></p><p>The most obvious example of not respecting this principle is to include long if/else statement chains (switch cases) in a single piece of code. Having too many if/else encapsulated in such a blob is called “poor man’s polymorphism”. Polymorphism is the ability for an object to inherit from others and take other forms in order to provide different functionalities. Rather than coding a lengthy if/else block at a particular point in a pipeline, it’s advised to implement an abstract class that is open to modifications (to polymorphism, in this case). All the different cases supposedly handled by an if/else block can then be incarnated by as many different sub-classes as needed, all inheriting from the previously built abstract class. Such a sub-class can then override certain methods of its parent abstract super-class as you see fit. By doing that, there’s no need to modify the abstract super-class or any of its sub-classes when implementing new functionalities. You would just implement a new sub-class inheriting from the same super-class, and inject it where you see fit (see the section about the DIP for more information about injection).<br></p><p>Let’s illustrate that principle with the example of loading data as a step of a machine learning pipeline. It’s certainly not a good idea to simply implement a function called “load_data” which would have a huge if/else block to cover all the possible cases like fetching data from a local repository, an external repository, an SQL table, a CSV file, an S3 bucket, etc. It would be better to implement an abstract class called DataLoader (or DataRepository). It would then be possible to implement as many concrete subclasses as needed to mimic the different ways of loading data. When the time comes to add a data loading step in a pipeline, the right sub-class (inheriting from DataLoader) suiting the context could be picked, so the pipeline doesn’t go through a useless chain of if/else statements to decide how to load data.<br></p><p>Here is another example to take this concept a step further. In compliance with OCP, it is possible to implement an effective strategy for choosing the right hyperparameters in a machine learning pipeline. Imagine that at a certain stage of a pipeline, you have to choose between the preprocessing method A and the preprocessing method B. The most tempting strategy (without considering OCP) would undoubtedly be to implement a full pipeline using method A and to implement another full pipeline using method B. We would then switch from one pipeline to another directly in the main file using a for loop. At first glance, this sounds like a good idea and it is the approach that most programmers and/or researchers in data science would recommend. The problem is that as new methods and models are to be implemented and tested, the main file must be modified to include a bigger and bigger polymorphism. This approach will therefore most likely generate a poor man's polymorphism directly in the main file. The main file is actually the worst place to implement this kind of polymorphism because it is outside the source project and its code is not …</p></div></div>

			<p>This is a tale of the intersection between thermal physics, cosmology, and a tiny
amount of computer science to answer a seemingly innocuous question: “How strong does
a password need to be for it to be physically impossible to brute-force, ever?”</p>
<p><a href="#conclusiontldr">TLDR</a> at the bottom.</p>
<p><em>Note: this post contains equations. Since none of the equations were long or
complex, I decided to just write them out in code blocks instead of using images or
MathML the way Wikipedia does.</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I realize that advice on password strength can get outdated. As supercomputers grow
more powerful, password strength recommendations need to be updated to resist
stronger brute-force attacks. Passwords that are strong today might be weak in the
future. <strong>How long should a password be in order for it to be physically impossible
to brute-force, ever?</strong></p>
<p>This question might not be especially practical, but it’s fun to analyze and offers
interesting perspective regarding sane upper-limits on password strength.</p>
<h2 id="asking-the-right-question">Asking the right question</h2>
<p>Instead of predicting what tomorrow’s computers may be able to do, let’s examine the
<em>biggest possible brute-force attack</em> that the laws of physics can allow.</p>
<p>A supercomputer is probably faster than your phone; however, given enough time, both
are capable of doing the same calculations. If time isn’t the bottleneck, energy
usage is. More efficient computers can flip more bits with a finite amount of energy.</p>
<p>In other words, energy efficiency and energy availability are the two fundamental
bottlenecks of computing. What happens when a computer with the highest theoretical
energy efficiency is limited only by the mass-energy of <em>the entire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe">observable
universe</a>?</em></p>
<p>Let’s call this absolute unit of an energy-efficient computer the MOAC (Mother of All
Computers). For all classical computers that are made of matter, do work to compute,
and are bound by the conservation of energy, the MOAC represents a finite yet
unreachable limit of computational power. And yes, it can play Solitaire with
<em>amazing</em> framerates.</p>
<p>How strong should your password be for it to be safe from a brute-force attack by the
MOAC?</p>
<h3 id="quantifying-password-strength">Quantifying password strength.</h3>
<p>A good measure of password strength is <strong>entropy bits.</strong> The entropy bits in a
password is a base-2 logarithm of the number of guesses required to brute-force
it.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>A brute-force attack that executes 2<sup>n</sup> guesses is certain to crack a
password with <em>n</em> entropy bits, and has a one-in-two chance of cracking a password
with <em>n</em>+1 entropy bits.</p>
<p>For scale, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES-256</a>
encryption is currently the industry standard for strong symmetric encryption. As the
name suggests, its keys have 256 bits of entropy; if your password has more than 256
entropy bits, then the AES-256 encryption algorithm is the bottleneck.</p>
<p>To calculate the entropy of a password, I recommend using a tool such as
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity16/technical-sessions/presentation/wheeler">zxcvbn</a>
or <a href="https://keepassxc.org/">KeePassXC</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>Define a function <code>P</code>. <code>P</code> determines the probability that MOAC will correctly guess
a password with <code>n</code> bits of entropy after using <code>e</code> energy:</p>
<pre><code>P(n, e)
</code></pre>
<p>If <code>P(n, e) ≥ 1</code>, the MOAC will certainly guess your password before running out of
energy. The lower <code>P(n, e)</code> is, the less likely it is for the MOAC to guess your
password.</p>
<h2 id="caveats-and-estimates">Caveats and estimates</h2>
<p>I don’t have a strong physics background.</p>
<p>When estimating, we’ll prefer higher estimates that increase the odds of it guessing
a password; after all, the point of this exercise is to establish an <em>upper</em> limit on
password strength. We’ll also simplify: for instance, the MOAC will not waste any
heat, and the only way it can guess a password is through brute-forcing. Focusing on
too many details would defeat the point of this thought experiment.</p>
<p>I won’t address any particular encryption algorithms; this is just a pure and simple
brute-force attack given precomputed password entropy. Furthermore, quantum computers
can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm">Grover’s algorithm</a> for
an exponential speed-up; to account for quantum computers using Grover’s algorithm,
calculate <code>P(n/2, e)</code> instead.</p>
<p>Obviously, I’m not taking into account future mathematical advances; my crystal ball
broke after I asked it if humanity would ever develop the technology to make anime
real.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s always a non-zero probability of a brute-force attack guessing a
password with a given entropy. Literal “immunity” is impossible. Lowering this
probability to statistical insignificance renders our password practically immune to
brute-force attacks.</p>
<h2 id="computation">Computation</h2>
<p>How much energy does MOAC use per guess during a brute-force attack? In the context
of this thought experiment, this number should be unrealistically low. I settled on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KT_(energy)"><code>kT</code></a>. <code>k</code> represents the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_constant">Boltzmann
Constant</a> (about
1.381×10<sup>-23</sup> J/K) and <code>T</code> represents the temperature of the system. Their
product corresponds to the amount of heat required to create a 1 nat increase in a
system’s entropy.</p>
<p>A more involved approach to picking a good value might utilize the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%E2%80%93Einstein_relation">Plank-Einstein
relation</a>.</p>
<p>It’s also probably a better idea to make this value an estimate for flipping a single
bit, and to estimate the average number of bit-flips it takes to make a single
password guess. If that bothers you, pick a number <code>b</code> you believe to be a good
estimate for a bit-flip-count and calculate <code>P(n-b, e)</code> instead of <code>P(n, e)</code>.</p>
<p>What’s the temperature of the system? Three pieces of information help us find out:</p>
<ol>
<li>The MOAC is located somewhere in the observable universe</li>
<li>The MOAC will be consuming the entire observable universe</li>
<li>The universe is mostly empty</li>
</ol>
<p>A good value for <code>T</code> would be the average temperature of the entire observable
universe. The universe is mostly empty; <code>T</code> is around the temperature of cosmic
background radiation in space. The lowest reasonable estimate for this temperature is
2.7 degrees Kelvin.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> A lower temperature means less energy usage, less energy
usage allows more computations, and more computations raises the upper limit on
password strength.</p>
<p>Every guess, the MOAC expends <code>kT</code> energy. Let <code>E</code> = the total amount of energy the
MOAC can use; let <code>B</code> = the maximum number of guesses the MOAC can execute before
running out of energy.</p>
<pre><code>B = E/(kT)
</code></pre>
<p>Now, given the maximum number of passwords the MOAC can guess <code>B</code> and the bits of
entropy in our password <code>n</code>, we have an equation for the probability that the MOAC
will guess our password:</p>
<pre><code>P(n,B) = B/2ⁿ
</code></pre>
<p>Plug in our expression for <code>B</code>:</p>
<pre><code>P(n,E) = E/(2ⁿkT)
</code></pre>
<h3 id="calculating-the-mass-energy-of-the-observable-universe">Calculating the mass-energy of the observable universe</h3>
<p>The MOAC can use the entire mass-energy of the observable universe.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Simply stuff
the observable universe into the attached 100% efficient furnace, turn on the burner,
and generate power for the computer. You might need to ask a friend for help.</p>
<p>Just how much energy is that? The mass-energy equivalence formula is quite simple:</p>
<pre><code>E = mc²
</code></pre>
<p>We’re trying to find <code>E</code> and we know <code>c</code>, the speed of light, is 299,792,458 m/s.
That leaves <code>m</code>. What’s the mass of the observable universe?</p>
<h3 id="calculating-the-critical-density-of-the-observable-universe">Calculating the critical density of the observable universe</h3>
<p>Critical density is smallest average density of matter required to <em>almost</em> slow the
expansion of the universe to a stop. Any more dense, and expansion will stop; any
less, and expansion will never stop.</p>
<p>Let <code>D</code> = critical density of the observable universe and <code>V</code> = volume of the
observable universe. Mass is the product of density and volume:</p>
<pre><code>m = DV
</code></pre>
<p>We can derive the value of D by solving for it in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann_equations">Friedman
equations</a>:</p>
<pre><code>D = 3Hₒ²/(8πG)
</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>G</code> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant">Gravitational
Constant</a> and <code>Hₒ</code> is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law">Hubble Constant</a>. <code>Hₒd</code> is the rate of
expansion at proper distance <code>d</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s assume the observable universe is a sphere, expanding at the speed of light
ever since the Big Bang.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> The volume <code>V</code> of our spherical universe when given its
radius <code>r</code> is:</p>
<pre><code>V = (4/3)πr³
</code></pre>
<p>To find the radius of the observable universe <code>r</code>, we can use the age of the universe
<code>t</code>:</p>
<pre><code>r = ct
</code></pre>
<p>Hubble’s Law estimates the age of the universe to be around <code>1/Hₒ</code></p>
<h3 id="solving-for-e">Solving for E</h3>
<p>Let’s plug in all the derived values into our original equation for the mass of the
observable universe <code>m</code>:</p>
<pre><code>m = DV
</code></pre>
<p>Remember when I opened the article by saying that none of the equations would be long
or complex?</p>
<p>I lied.</p>
<pre><code>m = (3Hₒ²/(8πG))(4/3)π(ct)³
m = c³/(2GHₒ)

E = mc²
E = c⁵/(2GHₒ)
</code></pre>
<p>Yay, we found an expression for the total energy the MOAC can consume!</p>
<h2 id="final-solution">Final Solution</h2>
<pre><code>P(n,E) = E/(2ⁿkT)
P(n, c⁵/(2GHₒ)) = c⁵/(2GHₒ*2ⁿkT)
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s copy and paste the values for those constants from Wikipedia and Wolfram Alpha:</p>
<ul>
<li>c = 299,792,458 m/s</li>
<li>G ≈ 6.67408×10<sup>-11</sup> m³/kg/s²</li>
<li>Hₒ ≈ 2.2×10<sup>-18</sup> Hz (uncertain; look up the Hubble tension)</li>
<li>T ≈ 2.7 K</li>
<li>k ≈ 1.3806503×10<sup>-23</sup> J/K</li>
</ul>
<p>Plugging those in and simplifying:</p>
<p><strong>P(n) ≈ 2.21×10<sup>92</sup> / 2<sup>n</sup></strong></p>
<p>Here are some sample outputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>P(256) ≈ 1.9×10<sup>15</sup> (password certainly cracked after burning 1.9
quadrillionth of the mass-energy of the observable universe).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>P(306.76) ≈ 1 (password certainly cracked after burning the mass-energy of the
observable universe)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>P(310) ≈ 0.11 (about one in ten)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>P(326.6) ≈ 1.1×10<sup>-6</sup> (about one in a million)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If your threat model is a bit smaller, simulate putting a smaller object into the
MOAC’s furnace. For example, the Earth has a mass of 5.972×10²⁴ kg; this gives the
MOAC a one-in-ten-trillion chance of cracking a password with 256 entropy bits and a
100% chance of cracking a 213-bit password.</p>
<h2 id="sample-unbreakable-passwords">Sample unbreakable passwords</h2>
<p>According to KeePassXC’s password generator, each of the following passwords has an
entropy between 330 and 340 bits.</p>
<p>Using the extended-ASCII character set:</p>
<pre><code>¦=¦FVõ)Çb^ÄwÎ¡=,°m°B9®;&gt;3[°r:t®Ú"$3CG¨/Bq-y\;

<p>Using the characters on a standard US QWERTY layout:</p>
<pre><code>%nUzL2XR&amp;Tz5hJfp2tiYBoBBX^vWo3`g6H#JSC#N6gWm#hVdD~ziD$YHW

<p>Using only alphanumeric characters:</p>

<p>An excerpt from a religious text with a trailing space:</p>
<pre><code>I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, 
</code></pre>
<p>Don’t use actual excerpts from pre-existing works as your password.</p>
<h2 id="conclusiontldr">Conclusion/TLDR</h2>
<p>Question: How much entropy should a password have to ensure it will <em>never</em> be
vulnerable to a brute-force attack? Can an impossibly efficient computer–the
MOAC–crack your password?</p></section></article></div>

He was further banned from, or severely restricted from communicating by: <a href="https://www.axios.com/platforms-social-media-ban-restrict-trump-d9e44f3c-8366-4ba9-a8a1-7f3114f920f1.html">Reddit, Twitch, Shopify (??), Snapchat, TikTok, and Stripe.</a> Within 24 hours, amidst a chorus of “it’s just the free market, losers, if you don’t like it build your own app,” Google and Apple worked in concert to remove Parler, the “free speech” alternative social media app popular on the political right, from their app stores. Amazon followed the move with the equivalent of tech industry napalm, taking the extraordinary step of suspending Parler from using Amazon Web Services, effectively shutting the company down. The loosely-framed charge against both Trump and Parler was incitement of violence and insurrection. There were no trials. There was no evidence presented for any crime formally argued. This is law in the age of corporate oligarchy. It is purposefully ambiguous, it is uncompromising, and when you run afoul of the powers that be, there is no recourse. Not even for the “most powerful man in the world.” </p><p>This of course begs the question: who is actually in charge right now? </p><p>Today, the internet is a life-critical layer of our world. In some sense, what happens on the internet —&nbsp;from payments to communication —&nbsp;is all that matters, as without it few things of significance in the “real world” are possible. You would be forgiven for not remembering that Trump was impeached last year, as it meant practically nothing. But erasing him from the internet? If this sticks, and Trump can no longer communicate or raise funds at scale, a small handful of unelected tech executives just ended a president’s political career. In theory, they can legally do this to anyone, which means they are effectively the most powerful people alive. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-should-we-address-the-growing-power-shift-from-washington-to-silicon-valley/2018/11/19/1470eb9a-e9e4-11e8-bbdb-72fdbf9d4fed_story.html">Silicon Valley is our nation’s shadow capital, argues Katherine Boyle,</a> and welcome to the shadow state. It is not a democracy. </p><p>The immediate arguments both in favor and against Trump’s censorship were equally ridiculous. From the camp against, we were told the technology industry’s actions were comparable to Chinese-style censorship. This is not even close to true. The Chinese Communist Party executes political dissidents, and while our nation is not immune to such governance, and many Americans do perversely seem to want CCP-style censorship, such dystopia has not yet descended on our country. As Dan Primack correctly notes: &nbsp;</p><p>From the camp in favor of vanishing Trump — people who have warned us of some ambiguous corporate overreach for decades, which I suppose in hindsight only ever meant “money people bad” —&nbsp;we were told this is simply what a free market looks like. Free speech cannot be constitutionally guaranteed where private corporations are concerned, as it infringes on the owner of a company’s rights to free association and speech (again, an interesting point of concern from the “business is always wrong” corner of the commentariat). If you don’t want to be vanished, we’re told, build your own sprawling, multibillion-dollar, duopolistic communications platform. But legally speaking, this is in the first place not straightforward. </p><p>In <em>Pruneyard Shopping Center Vs. Robins</em>, <a href="https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/583/pruneyard-shopping-center-v-robins#:~:text=Robins%20(1980)&amp;text=In%20PruneYard%20Shopping%20Center%20v,afoul%20of%20the%20Fifth%20Amendment">the Supreme Court ruled California could protect political protesters from being evicted from private property.</a> This case built on a body of law that flourished throughout the 60s and 70s, and included such cases as <em>Marsh v. Alabama</em> (1946), <em>Lloyd Corporation Ltd. v. Tanner</em> (1972), and <em>Amalgamated Food Employees Union Local 590 v. Logan Valley Plaza</em> (1968). We haven’t even touched the <em>Sherman Antitrust Act</em>, or the much-discussed <em>Section 230</em>, and this is already complicated. In any case, the notion one should simply build a competitor platform if he isn’t happy with his Twitter ban has never really been serious, as everyone who works in tech is well aware it isn’t possible to build such a platform absent ideological submission to the shadow state. This was plainly evidenced by Parler’s fate last week. </p><p>If a natural right can’t meaningfully be exercised, can it really be said to exist? David Sacks has been absolute fire on this question all week:</p><p>The American Bill of Rights was written at the time of the printing press, a machine that anyone could buy, the street corner, on which anyone could sell a paper, a system of public roads and walks for distribution, and thousands of small businesses that comprised the “market,” any one of which, absolutely, could refuse to sell a paper, but no one or two (or five in obvious collusion) were capable of censoring a single voice out of public existence. Today, the internet is the gateway through which almost our entire democracy is conducted. It is where we go to learn about the world, almost without exception. It is our contemporary printing press, our street corner, our public roads and walks, and our market, all combined and dominated by a small handful of giants from the same class, of roughly the same politics, and from mostly the same region. </p><p>Should this tiny, unelected group of people so-empowered be allowed to vanish any voice from public, for any reason? Is this truly in keeping with the spirit of the Constitution? Separate from the legal questions: is this the kind of country you want to live in? </p><p>We are in danger, here —&nbsp;clearly, come on,<em> you know that this is true</em> —&nbsp;of something very dark. </p><p><strong>Ok but insurrection though.</strong> I recently spoke with a tech executive who supported Trump’s ban from public existence. He asked what theoretical action I would think worthy of such incredible censorship from the industry. A coup? Insurrection? What about incitement of violence? Herein lies tech’s only reasonable defense of itself, and the most popular argument in favor of Trump’s purge from the internet: he was hurting people. Isn’t that enough to act? The problem is the evidence here is ambiguous, and the argument lends itself to valid accusations of hypocrisy, as all of these things have been perpetrated by other political leaders, both at home and abroad, and often in a manner not ambiguous at all. The position is also somewhat naively oblivious of a political leader’s role, which is —&nbsp;I hate to break it to you, folks —&nbsp;violence. This is not to say violence is okay. This is not to excuse any of Trump’s deeply unhelpful ambiguity. This is only to say the logical consequence of the technology industry’s extraordinary actions last week must necessarily be massive, global censorship. Let’s set aside for a moment the question of whether or not censorship of this kind would be healthy. Is it really what our shadow state is planning? Because if dramatically accelerated speech crackdowns aren’t on the menu, tech’s actions sum only to narrow, draconian, partisan censorship. </p><p>It should go without saying I’m against activist political violence, and think everyone who participated in last week’s riot at the capitol should be tried and, when convicted, jailed. But I’ve said it anyway, repeatedly, both specifically in the context of the capitol riot and consistently, in every other context we’ve seen such behavior, throughout most of our batshit crazy 2020. I have felt compelled to speak about this issue as often as I have because what took place in Washington last week was not an outlier event. </p><p>The capitol riot was the latest in a string of unacceptably violent outbursts for which media personalities, activists, and politicians have spent the last year apologizing, and in many cases, by the standards to which we are now holding Trump —&nbsp;“dog whistles,” contributions to a “culture of hate” or “violence” —&nbsp;actively encouraging. Some cases have been less ambiguous. “Non-violence is an important tool for protests,” wrote Slate magazine this summer amidst a kind of chaos we have not seen on American streets for over half a century, <a href="https://twitter.com/Slate/status/1268415955937513473?s=20">“but so is violence.”</a> People were killed at the capitol, and property, both public and private, was destroyed. A federal building was invaded. All of these things are insane, and wrong, and intolerable. They are also illegal. Again: <em>these people should be tried, and when convicted sent to prison</em>. But have we so soon forgotten <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/goodbye-summer-of-love-11607898398">our summer of love in the CHAZ</a>? Or do we simply believe the MAGA Viking more likely to succeed in “insurrection” than the unhinged Stalinist baristas in Seattle explicitly calling for revolution? </p><p>I’ve been told repeatedly this week, while raising questions about a scale of censorship we have literally never before seen, that at least one of the capitol rioters was planning an assassination. This is chilling. If proven true, it will unfortunately also not be unique. Have we already memory-holed the Republican Congressional baseball shooting, where Congressman Steve Scalise and three of his colleagues were nearly killed by an unhinged Bernie Sanders stan? And how do we think this would-be assassin was radicalized? Carrier pigeon? No, the internet appears to be catalyzing significant political radicalization. The problem is deep, and broad. It is also by the way something <a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/tether-part-i">I write about not infrequently.</a> I’m glad the industry is finally concerned with the phenomenon, but is Jack Dorsey really prepared to own the issue? Because I’m sorry, but the problem isn’t Trump’s Twitter account, no matter how easy that would make this —&nbsp;in a sense, the problem appears to be Twitter. I’m pretty sure it’s driving us insane. </p><p>Gather round, friends. Have I told you yet about the time (this Christmas Eve) when a wildly-popular Marxist podcaster expressed a desire to see me dead in direct response to a piece I wrote about his fiancé’s boss, my San Francisco district supervisor? What about the time, immediately after, when his followers asked for my address, presumably to kill me? Do yourself a favor and keyword search the word “guillotine,” or the hammer and sickle emoji (which, while we’re on the topic, why the fuck does that exist?). Here’s …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-3d5c50e8=""><p data-v-3d5c50e8="">This article introduces an approach to structure FastAPI applications with multiple services in mind. The proposed structure decomposes the individual services into packages and modules, following principles of abstraction and separation of concerns. The code discussed below can also be studied in its entirety in a dedicated companion GitHub repository.</p>

<h2 id="fastapi--building-high-performing-python-apis" data-v-3d5c50e8="">FastAPI – Building High-performing Python APIs</h2>
<p data-v-3d5c50e8=""><a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-3d5c50e8="">FastAPI</a> is a fast, highly intuitive and well-documented API framework based on <a href="https://www.starlette.io/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-3d5c50e8="">Starlette</a>. Despite being relatively new, it's gaining <a href="https://star-history.t9t.io/#tiangolo/fastapi" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-3d5c50e8="">strong adoption</a> by the developer community – it is even already being adopted in production by corporates like <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/introducing-dispatch-da4b8a2a8072" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-3d5c50e8="">Netflix</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/26" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-3d5c50e8="">Microsoft</a>.</p>
<p data-v-3d5c50e8="">Following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-3d5c50e8="">UNIX philosophy</a> of <em data-v-3d5c50e8="">"doing one thing, and doing it well"</em>, separating parts of the application according to their task improves code readability and maintainability; ultimately reducing complexity. The main benefits of structuring applications in this way:</p>
<p data-v-3d5c50e8=""><strong data-v-3d5c50e8="">Separation of concerns</strong> – Decomposing the application into modules performing a single job. This allows accepting requests (top down: controller → service → data access) and returning responses (bottom up: data access → service → controller) with a clear separation of what particular functionality should be implemented in which particular module, reducing cognitive load for development.</p>
<div data-v-220acfa8="" data-v-3d5c50e8=""><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6c6e6d1a9a2252c24c72049f74382abee765095c/9408a/_nuxt/img/request-response.df4b985.jpg" width="100%" height="" alt="Request-Response Flow across Application Layers" data-v-220acfa8=""></p><p data-v-220acfa8="">Request-Response Flow across Application Layers</p></div>
<p data-v-3d5c50e8=""><strong data-v-3d5c50e8="">Abstraction</strong> — Components of the application are designed in a reusable way. For instance, <code data-v-3d5c50e8="">ServiceResult</code> is implemented as a generic outcome of a service operation (which may be successful and return a response, or unsuccessful and raise an exception) able to be used by all services of the app, keeping code <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-3d5c50e8="">DRY</a>.</p>
<div data-v-220acfa8="" data-v-3d5c50e8=""><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/fc6bd09df8db15e783bd11117eba8003350f04cc/465f4/_nuxt/img/directory-structure.0c63d71.jpg" width="100%" height="" alt="Directory Structure Overview" data-v-220acfa8=""></p><p data-v-220acfa8="">Directory Structure Overview</p></div>
<p data-v-3d5c50e8="">The granular nature of namespacing allow to distinguish parts of the application, e.g., routes versus business logic belonging to a particular service – grouping similar tasks together, while keeping distinct parts separated. Four principal packages are needed. For each service, one module is added to these four packages. For instance, a service called <em data-v-3d5c50e8="">"Foo"</em> requires the following modules (discussed in detail below):</p>
<div data-v-3d5c50e8=""><pre data-v-3d5c50e8=""><code data-v-3d5c50e8=""><span data-v-3d5c50e8=""><span data-v-3d5c50e8="">./routers/  foo.py </span><span data-v-3d5c50e8=""># Router instance and routes</span></span>
<span data-v-3d5c50e8=""><span data-v-3d5c50e8="">./services/ foo.py </span><span data-v-3d5c50e8=""># Business logic (including CRUD helpers)</span></span>
<span data-v-3d5c50e8=""><span data-v-3d5c50e8="">./schemas/  foo.py </span><span data-v-3d5c50e8=""># Data "schemas" (e.g., Pydantic models)</span></span>
<span data-v-3d5c50e8=""><span data-v-3d5c50e8="">./models/   foo.py </span><span data-v-3d5c50e8=""># Database models (e.g., SQLAlchemy models)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p data-v-3d5c50e8="">The four principal packages are complemented by two generic packages which contain application-specific (and not service-specific) functionality, such as configuration or utility functions.</p>
<h2 id="controller-layer--routes" data-v-3d5c50e8="">Controller Layer – Routes</h2>
<p data-v-3d5c50e8="">Within <code data-v-3d5c50e8="">main</code>, the application is instantiated and all routers are included. Additionally, middlewares and/or exception handlers are implemented. The example application discussed below is based on a service called <code data-v-3d5c50e8="">Foo</code>, which requires a number of routes. To handle custom exceptions occurring at the service layer, as instances of class <code data-v-3d5c50e8="">AppExceptionCase</code>, a respective exception handler is added to the application.</p>
<div data-v-3d5c50e8=""><pre data-v-3d5c50e8=""><code data-v-3d5c50e8=""><span data-v-3d5c50e8=""><span data-v-3d5c50e8="">1</span><span data-v-3d5c50e8=""># ...</span></span>

<p data-v-3d5c50e8="">Routers and their routes are defined in modules within the <code data-v-3d5c50e8="">routers</code> package.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Up until the publication of this post, if you went to the front page of <a href="https://ziglang.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://ziglang.org</a>, you would be greeted with a multi-page explanation about how Zig improves over the systems programming toolchains that today we take for granted.</p>
<p>If you have done enough of that kind of programming, you’ll immediately see how Zig is tackling relevant problems, but if you don’t have such experience, then the front page could very easily look like a never-ending list of things you don’t have an opinion about.</p>

<p>When the Zig project started, its audience was almost exclusively people with a lot of relevant experience, since those would be the only ones able to evaluate the promise and limits of the newborn language.</p>
<p>Today we’re at a point where Zig is becoming increasingly compelling for people coming from all layers of the stack. People have written <a href="https://github.com/Hejsil/mecha" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">parser combinators</a>, <a href="https://github.com/prime31/zig-gamekit" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">2d game rendering libraries</a>, <a href="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/futureproof/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a live editor for GPU shaders</a>, and much more. </p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong: all these projects have been developed by early adopters who wanted to try <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/buggy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a new and exciting</a> ecosystem. Zig is not yet stable, and won’t be for a while, but we’re getting there, and in the meantime Zig is already delivering big time on at least one promise: <strong>making it possible to learn more about programming without having to first buy into vast amounts of accidental complexity</strong>.</p>
<p>This redesign had two main goals and, as always, a few practical constraints. When it comes to constraints, it’s mostly my web design and project management skills, and the scope that can be addressed in no more than a couple of months, since we needed a new website <em>now</em> and not one year from now. Let’s now take a look at the goals.</p>
<h2 id="a-friendlier-first-impression"><a href="#a-friendlier-first-impression" aria-label="a friendlier first impression permalink"></a>A friendlier first impression</h2>
<p>The first goal addressed stems directly from the introduction of this blog post: we wanted to make the website more appealing to people that are looking at Zig as an opportunity to learn more about programming. For this reason, the lengthy breakdown has been moved to the Learn section and, in its place, we now have three short paragraphs that highlight some of Zig’s major features, followed by a code sample that gives you a first taste of the syntax. </p>
<p>Above the main introduction we still have the same slogan as before:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zig is a general-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining <strong>robust</strong>, <strong>optimal</strong>, and <strong>reusable</strong> software.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andrew did an outstanding job at formulating it and I believe it’s the one bit of the entire website that should probably never change.</p>
<p>Next to the slogan there’s a new cluster of buttons. This is where I wanted to come up with an interesting compromise: we follow the popular trend of putting a big call to action for new users, but we also use that block of space to create a single hotspot where regulars can get access to critical information. </p>

<p>My hope is for the big button to make new visitors become aware of that block and that, over time, checking there for docs and new releases just becomes muscle memory. That said, I know we’ll have to tweak the design once the auto-generated docs for the standard library become good enough for the front page.</p>
<p>Below everything I just described, we introduce the community and the Zig Software Foundation. The Zig project has grown to a point where governance matters and we want to show we’re doing everything the right way, up to the point of having formed a <a href="https://ziglang.org/zsf/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">nonprofit organization with a clear scope and mission statement</a>.</p>
<h2 id="internationalization"><a href="#internationalization" aria-label="internationalization permalink"></a>Internationalization</h2>
<p>The second goal of this redesign was to open the door to hosting multiple translations of the website. Having an i18n-enabled website is beneficial for multiple reasons: it helps with the first goal (i.e. help a wider range of programmers get started with Zig), it’s a good way of getting more use out of the informative materials we’ll progressively add to the website, and it’s also well aligned with the mission of the Zig Software Foundation. Lastly, I’m personally invested in the idea that we must ensure we don’t leave it to third parties to be the sole owners of all content available in a given language, as we’ve already seen bad actors exploit their position to implement a form of cultural arbitrage.</p>
<p>We’re well aware that keeping up with translations to multiple languages can quickly become an effort black hole. For this reason, I’ve tried to make sure the tooling would help in making the process as smooth as possible (more on that later), and I’ve also made sure to clarify in the design how translations are community-provided and thus best-effort.</p>

<p>At the moment of publication, the website can only offer <a href="https://ziglang.org/translations/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">an Italian translation</a> written by me. Italian was chosen out of necessity (i.e. it’s the only other language I speak), but it served the purpose of making me try out the ergonomics of producing a translation, and it can also act as documentation for others.</p>
<p>Finally, I should point out that there are some parts of the website we don’t plan to translate, like the News section, for example. This is another choice made out of necessity: we want to restrict translations to content with a long shelf life to reduce the amount of effort, but I don’t exclude that one day we might have enough resources to get rid of this compromise.</p>
<h2 id="implementation-details"><a href="#implementation-details" aria-label="implementation details permalink"></a>Implementation details</h2>
<p>The new website is statically generated by <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Hugo</a>. I also considered <a href="https://www.getzola.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Zola</a>, but its i18n support is not complete yet. The website lists a number of Zig code snippets, with relative output. Andrew originally implemented a program to produce release notes and language reference. That program takes in code samples, applies syntax highlighting, runs the code, and reports the output as HTML (it even retains colors from the terminal). I took the original code and packaged it as a tool with a more general interface. I called it <a href="https://github.com/kristoff-it/zig-doctest" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">zig-doctest</a> and it can be easily integrated with all kinds of static content generation tools.</p>
<p>Now a successful CI build of the <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ziglang/zig</a> repository triggers a build of the website, allowing us to catch outdated code examples much more easily. This addresses concerns raised in the past by people that would occasionally stumble upon a broken code sample.</p>
<p>Testing all code snippets is not instant as some tests include running the executable and capturing its output, so I made sure to integrate with Hugo’s caching system. I also noticed that Hugo processes tags sequentially within the same page, so I also <a href="https://github.com/kristoff-it/hugo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">added to it</a> a warmup routine that makes sure to parallelize the testing when loading the development server the first time.</p>
<p>The result is a very enjoyable development experience that only depends on Zig and two additional executables (Hugo and doctest) to be able to develop the Zig website locally, resulting in an acceptable experience for potential contributors. </p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="conclusion permalink"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope this post explains adequately the intent of this work and the practical limits of its execution. There’s still more work to do, but this seems a reasonable milestone for a first release, so I’m looking forward to working alongside the community to improve and add translations to the website.</p>
<p>For the next iteration I’ll work on improving accessibility, but first I have to focus on <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/track/zig_programming_language/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">FOSDEM, since we have a Zig dev room</a> and I have a bunch of duties to attend to. </p>
<p>When I first discovered Zig, I saw it as a way for me to learn more about all the aspects of programming I missed when working with interpreted and/or garbage-collected languages. Turns out I got to learn that <a href="https://ziglang.org/news/announcing-zig-software-foundation/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">and much more</a>, and I can’t tell you how excited I am about what’s to come. Despite everything, 2020 was a great year for Zig, and I fully expect 2021 to be even better.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3 id="introduction"><a href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h3><p>As I was browsing the web and catching up on some sites I visit periodically, I found a cool article from <a href="https://tomhayden3.com/2013/12/27/chess-mr-job/">Tom Hayden</a> about using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/">Amazon Elastic Map Reduce</a> (EMR) and <a href="https://github.com/Yelp/mrjob">mrjob</a> in order to compute some statistics on win/loss ratios for chess games he downloaded from the <a href="https://www.top-5000.nl/pgn.htm">millionbase archive</a>, and generally have fun with EMR. Since the data volume was only about 1.75GB containing around 2 million chess games, I was skeptical of using Hadoop for the task, but I can understand his goal of learning and having fun with mrjob and EMR. Since the problem is basically just to look at the result lines of each file and aggregate the different results, it seems ideally suited to stream processing with shell commands. I tried this out, and for the same amount of data I was able to use my laptop to get the results in about 12 seconds (processing speed of about 270MB/sec), while the Hadoop processing took about 26 minutes (processing speed of about 1.14MB/sec).</p><p>After reporting that the time required to process the data with 7 c1.medium machine in the cluster took 26 minutes, Tom remarks</p><blockquote><p>This is probably better than it would take to run serially on my machine but probably not as good as if I did some kind of clever multi-threaded application locally.</p></blockquote><p>This is absolutely correct, although even serial processing may beat 26 minutes. Although Tom was doing the project for fun, often people use Hadoop and other so-called <em>Big Data (tm)</em> tools for real-world processing and analysis jobs that can be done faster with simpler tools and different techniques.</p><p>One especially under-used approach for data processing is using standard shell tools and commands. The benefits of this approach can be massive, since creating a data pipeline out of shell commands means that all the processing steps can be done in parallel. This is basically like having your own <a href="https://storm-project.net/">Storm</a> cluster on your local machine. Even the concepts of Spouts, Bolts, and Sinks transfer to shell pipes and the commands between them. You can pretty easily construct a stream processing pipeline with basic commands that will have extremely good performance compared to many modern <em>Big Data (tm)</em> tools.</p><p>An additional point is the batch versus streaming analysis approach. Tom mentions in the beginning of the piece that after loading 10000 games and doing the analysis locally, that he gets a bit short on memory. This is because all game data is loaded into RAM for the analysis. However, considering the problem for a bit, it can be easily solved with streaming analysis that requires basically no memory at all. The resulting stream processing pipeline we will create will be over 235 times faster than the Hadoop implementation and use virtually no memory.</p><h3 id="learn-about-the-data"><a href="#learn-about-the-data">Learn about the data</a></h3><p>The first step in the pipeline is to get the data out of the PGN files. Since I had no idea what kind of format this was, I checked it out on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation">Wikipedia</a>.</p><pre><code>[Event "F/S Return Match"]
[Site "Belgrade, Serbia Yugoslavia|JUG"]
[Date "1992.11.04"]
[Round "29"]
[White "Fischer, Robert J."]
[Black "Spassky, Boris V."]
[Result "1/2-1/2"]
(moves from the game follow...)
</code></pre><p>We are only interested in the results of the game, which only have 3 real outcomes. The 1-0 case means that white won, the 0-1 case means that black won, and the 1/2-1/2 case means the game was a draw. There is also a <em>-</em> case meaning the game is ongoing or cannot be scored, but we ignore that for our purposes.</p><h3 id="acquire-sample-data"><a href="#acquire-sample-data">Acquire sample data</a></h3><p>The first thing to do is get a lot of game data. This proved more difficult than I thought it would be, but after some looking around online I found a git repository on GitHub from <a href="https://github.com/rozim/ChessData">rozim</a> that had plenty of games. I used this to compile a set of 3.46GB of data, which is about twice what Tom used in his test. The next step is to get all that data into our pipeline.</p><h3 id="build-a-processing-pipeline"><a href="#build-a-processing-pipeline">Build a processing pipeline</a></h3><p><em>If you are following along and timing your processing, don’t forget to clear your OS page cache as otherwise you won’t get valid processing times.</em></p><p>Shell commands are great for data processing pipelines because you get parallelism for free. For proof, try a simple example in your terminal.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">sleep <span>3</span> | <span>echo</span> <span>"Hello world."</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Intuitively it may seem that the above will sleep for 3 seconds and then print <code>Hello world</code> but in fact both steps are done at the same time. This basic fact is what can offer such great speedups for simple non-IO-bound processing systems capable of running on a single machine.</p><p>Before starting the analysis pipeline, it is good to get a reference for how fast it could be and for this we can simply dump the data to <code>/dev/null</code>.</p><p>In this case, it takes about 13 seconds to go through the 3.46GB, which is about 272MB/sec. This would be a kind of upper-bound on how quickly data could be processed on this system due to IO constraints.</p><p>Now we can start on the analysis pipeline, the first step of which is using <code>cat</code> to generate the stream of data.</p><p>Since only the result lines in the files are interesting, we can simply scan through all the data files, and pick out the lines containing ‘Results’ with <code>grep</code>.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">cat *.pgn | grep <span>"Result"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This will give us only the <code>Result</code> lines from the files. Now if we want, we can simply use the <code>sort</code> and <code>uniq</code> commands in order to get a list of all the unique items in the file along with their counts.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">cat *.pgn | grep <span>"Result"</span> | sort | uniq -c
</code></pre></div><p>This is a very straightforward analysis pipeline, and gives us the results in about 70 seconds. While we can certainly do better, assuming linear scaling this would have taken the Hadoop cluster approximately 52 minutes to process.</p><p>In order to reduce the speed further, we can take out the <code>sort | uniq</code> steps from the pipeline, and replace them with AWK, which is a wonderful tool/language for event-based data processing.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">cat *.pgn | grep <span>"Result"</span> | awk <span>'{ split($0, a, "-"); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++;} END { print white+black+draw, white, black, draw }'</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This will take each result record, split it on the hyphen, and take the character immediately to the left, which will be a 0 in the case of a win for black, a 1 in the case of a win for white, or a 2 in the case of a draw. Note that <code>$0</code> is a built-in variable that represents the entire record.</p><p>This reduces the running time to approximately 65 seconds, and since we’re processing twice as much data this is a speedup of around 47 times.</p><p>So even at this point we already have a speedup of around 47 with a naive local solution. Additionally, the memory usage is effectively zero since the only data stored is the actual counts, and incrementing 3 integers is almost free in memory space terms. However, looking at <code>htop</code> while this is running shows that <code>grep</code> is currently the bottleneck with full usage of a single CPU core.</p><h3 id="parallelize-the-bottlenecks"><a href="#parallelize-the-bottlenecks">Parallelize the bottlenecks</a></h3><p>This problem of unused cores can be fixed with the wonderful <code>xargs</code> command, which will allow us to parallelize the <code>grep</code>. Since <code>xargs</code> expects input in a certain way, it is safer and easier to use <code>find</code> with the <code>-print0</code> argument in order to make sure that each file name being passed to <code>xargs</code> is null-terminated. The corresponding <code>-0</code> tells <code>xargs</code> to expected null-terminated input. Additionally, the <code>-n</code> how many inputs to give each process and the <code>-P</code> indicates the number of processes to run in parallel. Also important to be aware of is that such a parallel pipeline doesn’t guarantee delivery order, but this isn’t a problem if you are used to dealing with distributed processing systems. The <code>-F</code> for <code>grep</code> indicates that we are only matching on fixed strings and not doing any fancy regex, and can offer a small speedup, which I did not notice in my testing.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">find . -type f -name <span>'*.pgn'</span> -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 -P4 grep -F <span>"Result"</span> | gawk <span>'{ split($0, a, "-"); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++;} END { print NR, white, black, draw }'</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This results in a run time of about 38 seconds, which is an additional 40% or so reduction in processing time from parallelizing the <code>grep</code> step in our pipeline. This gets us up to approximately 77 times faster than the Hadoop implementation.</p><p>Although we have improved the performance dramatically by parallelizing the <code>grep</code> step in our pipeline, we can actually remove this entirely by having <code>awk</code> filter the input records (lines in this case) and only operate on those containing the string “Result”.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">find . -type f -name <span>'*.pgn'</span> -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 -P4 awk <span>'/Result/ { split($0, a, "-"); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++;} END { print white+black+draw, white, black, draw }'</span>

This past weekend, on January 9th, we celebrated 10 years since <a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/commit/337c3f2d569a42ebd5fcab6fef18c5e012f9be5b">the first commit to the Elixir repository</a>. While I personally don’t consider <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> to be 10 years old yet - the language that became what Elixir is today <a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/commit/6052352b6281752b905b30eb5b08fac0f51f68cd">surfaced only 14 months later</a> - a decade is a mark to celebrate!</p>
<p>
The goal of this post is to focus on the current state of some projects in the ecosystem and then briefly highlight a few of the exciting efforts coming over the next months.</p>
<h2>
Recap: The language goals</h2>
<p>
When I started working on Elixir, I personally had the ambition of using it for building scalable and robust web applications. However, I didn’t want Elixir to be tied to the web. My goal was to design an <em>extensible</em> language with a diverse ecosystem. Elixir aims to be a general purpose language and allows developers to extend it to new domains.</p>
<p>
Given Elixir is built on top of Erlang and Erlang is used for networking and distributed systems, Elixir would naturally be a good fit in those domains too, as long as I didn’t screw things up. The Erlang VM is essential to everything we do in Elixir, which is why <em>compatibility</em> has become a language goal too.</p>
<p>
I also wanted the language to be <em>productive</em>, especially by focusing on the tooling. Learning a functional programming language is a new endeavor for most developers. Consequently their first experiences getting started with the language, setting up a new project, searching for documentation, and debugging should go as smoothly as possible.</p>
<p>
Extensibility, compatibility, and productivity are the goals we built the language upon.</p>
<h2>
Recap: Elixir in production</h2>
<p>
Last year we started <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/cases.html">a series of articles on companies using Elixir in production on the official website</a>. As of today, we have 7 production cases listed with more coming this year! Overall it is very exciting to see many different companies using a variety of business models and industries running Elixir in production.</p>
<p>
Companies like <a href="https://www.brex.com/">Brex</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/06/23/growing-with-elixir-at-brex/">case</a>), <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/08/real-time-communication-at-scale-with-elixir-at-discord/">case</a>), <a href="https://getdivvy.com/">Divvy</a>, <a href="https://www.podium.com/">Podium</a>, and <a href="https://salesloft.com/">SalesLoft</a> have reached <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn_(finance)">“unicorn status”</a> and rely heavily on Elixir. Startups like <a href="https://www.joinblvd.com/">Boulevard</a> (<a href="https://soundcloud.com/elixirtalk/episode-166-feat-sean-stavropoulos">podcast</a>), <a href="https://community.com/">Community</a>, <a href="https://duffel.com/">Duffel</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/12/10/integrating-travel-with-elixir-at-duffel/">case</a>), <a href="https://www.ockam.io/">Ockam</a>, <a href="https://www.mux.com/">Mux</a>, <a href="https://ramp.com/">Ramp</a>, <a href="https://remote.com/">Remote</a>, and <a href="https://www.v7labs.com/">V7</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2021/01/13/orchestrating-computer-vision-with-elixir/">case</a>) also use Elixir and have received funding in the last year or two. Elixir is also used within known brands and enterprises such as <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/">Bleacher Report</a>, <a href="https://www.change.org/">Change.org</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/27/delivering-social-change-with-elixir-at-change.org/">case</a>), <a href="https://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/09/24/paas-with-elixir-at-Heroku/">case</a>), <a href="https://www.pagerduty.com/">PagerDuty</a>, <a href="https://www.pepsico.com/">PepsiCo</a>, and <a href="https://www.therealreal.com/">TheRealReal</a>.</p>
<p>
There is also a special category of startups that run Elixir alonside an open source model, such as <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible Analytics</a>, <a href="https://app.supabase.io/">Supabase</a>, <a href="https://logflare.app/">Logflare</a> (<a href="https://runninginproduction.com/podcast/11-logflare-is-a-log-management-and-event-analytics-platform">podcast</a>), and <a href="https://hex.pm/">Hex.pm</a> (<a href="https://runninginproduction.com/podcast/19-hexpm-is-elixirs-official-package-manager">podcast</a>) itself. Still on the open source front, you will find projects like <a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</a> and <a href="https://changelog.com/">Changelog</a>. There also many small scale and hobby projects that use Elixir for a productive and joyful development experience.</p>
<h2>
Recap: Diverse ecosystem</h2>
<p>
Today, Elixir has a diverse ecosystem that works on a wide range of domains and industries. Let’s take a look at some examples.</p>
<h3>
Web</h3>
<p>
Most developers are familiar with using Elixir for web development thanks to <a href="https://phoenixframework.org/">the Phoenix web framework</a>. Phoenix gained traction in the ecosystem because it was the first to fully leverage the language and the platform for building real-time applications besides the usual MVC (Model-View-Controller) offering.</p>
<p>
It all started with Phoenix Channels, as a bi-directional communication between clients and servers, and Phoenix PubSub, which uses Erlang’s distributed compatibilities to broadcast messages across nodes. As far as I know, Phoenix was the first major web framework to provide a multi-node web real-time solution completely out-of-the-box. Regardless if you are using one node or ten nodes, everything just works, with minimal configuration and dependencies.</p>
<p>
Phoenix has matured a lot since its first stable release. Phoenix v1.2 included <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Presence.html">Phoenix Presence</a>, that allows developers to track which users, IoT devices, etc are connected to your cluster right now. No databases or external dependencies required! This is one of the problems that look deceptively simple at first, but once you outline all scalability, performance, and fault-tolerance requirements, it <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/11/17/real-time-collaboration-with-elixir-at-slab/">becomes quite complex</a>. Luckily, Phoenix is running on a platform that excels at these problems, and I am not aware of any other framework that provides such a lean and elegant solution as part of its default stack.</p>
<p>
Most recently, <a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view">Phoenix LiveView</a> was released and brought new ways to build rich, real-time user experiences with server-rendered HTML, inspiring developers to attempt similar solutions for other languages and frameworks. You can read the <a href="https://dockyard.com/blog/2018/12/12/phoenix-liveview-interactive-real-time-apps-no-need-to-write-javascript">original announcement</a> or <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/build-a-real-time-twitter-clone-in-15-minutes-with-live-view-and-phoenix-1-5">learn how to build a real-time Twitter clone in 15 minutes</a>. As part of the <em>Live</em> family, we have also announced <a href="https://twitter.com/josevalim/status/1250846714665357315">Phoenix LiveDashboard</a>, making monitoring and instrumentation a first-class citizen for Phoenix applications.</p>
<h3>
Embedded and IoT</h3>
<p>
While I always expected Elixir to shine for building web applications, I was taken by surprise when I heard about the <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves platform</a> for creating high-end embedded applications. However, once I learned their premise, it all made sense: writing embedded systems <em>is</em> complicated. Reasoning about failures is hard. So what if we could leverage the decades of lessons learnt by Erlang/OTP to design embedded applications? What if a fault on the Wi-Fi driver could be fixed by having a supervisor simply restart it? After all, the first major use of Erlang/OTP was in an embedded system, the Ericsson AXD301 ATM switch.</p>
<p>
Nerves brings the Elixir ecosystem and the battle-tested Erlang VM to edge computing, providing a rich developer experience using proven technology. Nerves started as a one step process for turning an Elixir project into a complete software image for common hardware devices. Today, Nerves is being used in production in industrial automation, machine learning, consumer electronics and more, with <a href="https://farm.bot/">Farmbot</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/08/20/embedded-elixir-at-farmbot/">case</a>) and <a href="https://www.rosepoint.com/">Rose Point Navigation</a> being two of the most notable examples.</p>
<p>
The Nerves team also created <a href="https://www.nerves-hub.org/">NervesHub</a>, a fully open-source device management system. Combining all these technologies makes Elixir a comprehensive language for building end-to-end IoT platforms.</p>
<h3>
Data ingestion and pipelines</h3>
<p>
Shortly after Elixir v1.0 was released, the Elixir Core Team and I started looking into abstractions for tackling data ingestions and data pipelines in Elixir. We ran through a couple designs until we eventually <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2016/07/14/announcing-genstage/">landed on GenStage</a>: a behaviour for exchanging data with back-pressure between Elixir processes and external systems. For an introduction, make sure to check out <a href="https://youtu.be/srtMWzyqdp8?t=242">my keynote introducing both GenStage and Flow</a>.</p>
<p>
Today, almost 5 years later, GenStage has been used by many industries and has become one of the factors driving Elixir adoption. For example, you can read how both <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/08/real-time-communication-at-scale-with-elixir-at-discord/">Discord</a> and <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/27/delivering-social-change-with-elixir-at-change.org/">Change.org</a> have built systems on Elixir and GenStage that handle spikes and run at massive scale.</p>
<p>
However, GenStage was just the beginning. In 2019, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOExnT1PYjs">we announced Broadway</a>, which is a higher-level abstraction on top of GenStage that makes building data ingestion pipelines a breeze. We originally released with Amazon SQS support. Nowadays, RabbitMQ, Google Cloud PubSub, Apache Kafka, and other sources (known as producers in Broadway terms) are also available.</p>
<h3>
Audio/Video streaming</h3>
<p>
Since the Erlang VM was designed for scalable network processing, one can expect to also be an excellent platform for audio and video streaming. However, if you also wanted to process and transform those streams on the fly, the situation becomes much more complicated as you likely have to integrate with native code.</p>
<p>
Luckily, the tables have turned when Erlang/OTP 20 was released a couple years ago with the so-called Dirty NIFs. The Erlang VM always had the ability to invoke native code, but this native code could not run for long, as to not interfere with the preemptive features of the Erlang runtime. Dirty NIFs allow developers to tag native code either as IO or CPU bound, which runs on specific threads. Between ports (I/O based), NIFs, Dirty NIFs, and remote nodes, developers now have many options to interface with native code with different performance and reliability guarantees. That’s exactly the foundation the <a href="http://www.membraneframework.org/">Membrane Framework</a> builds on top of.</p>
<p>
Membrane was extracted from RadioKit, a startup aiming at disrupting the radio broadcasting industry. Originally it focused on processing and mixing audio. Later, <a href="https://www.swmansion.com/">Software Mansion</a> acquired the framework and provided stable funding and a solid team to help it grow into a full-scale framework. Currently, it allows developers to process, transmit, broadcast, and transform audio and videos streams on the fly. Whether you are building a Twitch clone, a VOD application or a video conferencing system, Membrane provides a growing set of high-level abstractions and pre-made modules so you don’t have to dive into idiosyncrasies of particular codecs, protocols, and formats. </p>
<h2>
Looking ahead: what is coming in 2021</h2>
<p>
The year of 2021 looks very exciting for the Erlang Ecosystem and the Elixir community. In this section, we are going to mention some of the things we expect to see in 2021.</p>
<h3>
Erlang/OTP 24 with JIT</h3>
<p>
In September 2020, <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/2745">Lukas Larsson and the Erlang/OTP team</a> announced a JIT compiler for the Erlang VM called BeamAsm. How faster the JIT will be in practice depends on your application but the results posted in the announcement are promising. To quote Lukas:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
If we run the JSON benchmarks found in the <a href="https://github.com/devinus/poison/tree/master/bench">Poison</a> or <a href="https://github.com/michalmuskala/jason/tree/master/bench">Jason</a>, BeamAsm achieves anything from 30% to 130% increase (average at about 70%) in the number of iterations per second for all Erlang/Elixir implementations. For some benchmarks, BeamAsm is even faster than the pure C implementation <a href="https://github.com/davisp/jiffy">jiffy</a>.  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>
More complex applications tend to see a more moderate performance increase, for instance, RabbitMQ is able to handle 30% to 50% more messages per second depending on the scenario.  </p>
</blockquote>

        <!-- <h1 class="post-title">My Rules for Writing Well</h1> -->

        <section>
            <p>I’ve learned the hard way that writing is… hard. But anyone can become a great writer by following a few rules.</p>

<p>This post is a collection of guidelines I’ve adopted while writing four technical books, publishing countless blogs, and enduring the wrath of frontpage Hacker News commentary. Many of these rules were imparted by the great mentors I’ve had over the years, such as <a href="https://twitter.com/bphogan">Brian Hogan</a> (Pragmatic Bookshelf editor) and <a href="https://twitter.com/jonmountjoy">Jon Mountjoy</a> (creator of Heroku’s DevCenter).</p>

<h4 id="be-concise">Be concise</h4>
<p>Make every word count.</p>

<h4 id="write-with-the-door-closed-rewrite-with-the-door-open">Write with the door closed, rewrite with the door open</h4>
<p>Writing requires concentration, but editing requires feedback. When it’s time to write, close the door, turn off alerts, and remove distractions. When your first draft is complete, share it with people–friends, colleagues, reviewers–and listen to what they say.</p>

<h4 id="use-the-right-word">Use the right word</h4>
<p>Richard Feynman once told a story about a group of physicists explaining “acoustic reverberations” to a confused non-scientist. Feynman interjected, saying “it’s an echo”.</p>

<p>Precise word choice is important, but longer isn’t always better. Unusual vocabulary words and technical jargon distract readers from your point. In general:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Don’t “utilize” something when you can “use” it.</li>
  <li>Don’t “procure” something when you can “buy” it</li>
  <li>Don’t “ascertain” something when you can “learn” it</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="show-it-dont-say-it">Show it, don’t say it</h4>
<p>Avoid the word “easy” in your writing. If something is easy it will go without saying. More importantly, if readers find something difficult, you may alienate them by calling it easy. Avoid “simple” or “straightforward”, too.</p>

<h4 id="cut-and-paste">Cut and paste</h4>
<p>When you write, you’re telling a story. When you rewrite, you’re removing all the parts that are not the story. Be ruthless as you edit. Cut and move sections like Victor Frankenstein piecing together his creature.</p>

<h4 id="bring-your-reader-with-you">Bring your reader with you</h4>
<p>Some pronouns will engage your readers, while others distance you from them.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Don’t say “I find it important to”, when you mean “You should”</li>
  <li>Don’t say “It is widely believed”, when you mean “I think”</li>
  <li>Don’t say “I’ll show you how”, when you mean “We’ll see how”</li>
</ul>

<p>I use you/your in this post because I want <em>you</em> to adopt these rules. But if I were writing a tutorial and guiding you on a journey, I might use we/us/ours to indicate that I’m in it with you. It’s sometimes acceptable to switch between we/us/our and you/your in a single piece of writing, but in general you want to pick a voice and stick with those pronouns.</p>

<h4 id="throw-the-first-one-away">Throw the first one away</h4>
<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month">The Mythical Man Month</a>, Fred Brooks warns software developers that their first version of code will have bugs, run slowly, and lack features. You’ll likely need to rewrite it. The same caution applies when writing prose. Plan to throw your first draft away. You’re going to make mistakes; might as well make them quickly and get on to the second draft.</p>

<h4 id="write-write-write">Write, write, write</h4>
<p>Writing is a muscle. Practice your writing, share it with people, and learn from their feedback. Like going to the gym, it’s not easy. You’ll need to create a writing schedule and set goals. Will you publish one blog post a month? Will you write a post this year that gets one-thousand views? Aim high.</p>

<p>Writing is a craft, which means there’s always more to learn. There are many more rules I could have included in this post, like “prefer the active voice”, “avoid noun stacks”, “use action verbs”, and “use puncuation effectively”. But then I’d be writing a fifth book. Instead, I encourage you to read some of the wonderful resources I’ve used over the years:</p>

<p>Writing isn’t a science. There’s a time to break the rules, but do so cautiously.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Four years ago, when <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/28d4e100-2a6d-11e7-bc4b-5528796fe35c" data-trackable="link">Ant Group’s premier money market fund</a> was racing to a peak of more than $260bn worth of assets under management, many of China’s state-owned banks and their regulators started to get agitated. In a series of calls and meetings with Jack Ma, Ant’s founder, bank executives and regulatory officials demanded that its Yu’E Bao fund be <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7f9deba0-51e1-3c8e-9f1c-1d71a384028d" data-trackable="link">reined in</a>.</p>
<p>“Yu’E Bao was pulling a lot of money from the banks,” says one person familiar with the discussions. “The banks were worried about the impact on liquidity and wanted Ant to take measures to minimise the impact. The conversations were pretty tense.”</p>
<p>In the end, Mr Ma had to back down and Yu’E Bao imposed caps on how much people could deposit. Between March and December of 2018, its funds under management <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/35bbbef6-20a8-11e9-b126-46fc3ad87c65" data-trackable="link">fell by a third</a> to $168bn and stood at $183bn last September.</p>
<p>The showdown would prove to be a prelude to the much bigger confrontation that now pits the Chinese Communist party and President Xi Jinping <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3d2f174d-aa73-44fc-8c90-45c2a554e97b" data-trackable="link">against not just Ant but also Alibaba</a>, the ecommerce group founded by Mr Ma. </p>
<p>The stand-off, which has sparked <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b3a94f55-5e44-417f-a869-a542d0527fe7" data-trackable="link">rampant speculation about Mr Ma’s whereabouts</a>, could become a defining moment for the future of private business in Mr Xi’s China.</p>
<p>On December 24, China’s market regulator announced it was launching an <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/bdcc073f-3b70-4411-92d7-ee36973a8b7a" data-trackable="link">antitrust probe into Alibaba</a> and sent investigators to its headquarters in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, Mr Ma’s hometown. The announcement came just two weeks after the party’s politburo said it would target monopoly businesses to prevent the “disorderly expansion of capital”.</p>

<p>The move on Alibaba also came two months after financial regulators dramatically cancelled Ant’s planned $37bn initial public offering, which would have been the world’s largest.</p>
<p>Taken together, the measures amount to an <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/84d57797-4211-4658-ac54-ebdcb5146151" data-trackable="link">unprecedented squeeze on a business empire</a> whose ubiquitous services are central to the functioning of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c636a22e-dd3f-403e-a72d-c3ffb375459c" data-trackable="link">China’s pioneering online economy</a>. Ant says Alipay, its payment app, is regularly used by 700m people — half of China’s total population — and 80m merchants, processing payments worth Rmb118tn ($18.2tn) in the group’s last financial year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alibaba’s shares have fallen by almost 30 per cent since the regulatory showdown began in late October, putting a big dent in the net worth of Mr Ma, who has not been seen in public since then. Over the same period his fortune has declined from $62bn to $49bn, according to Bloomberg data. The Hurun China Rich List estimated that Mr Ma had been the country’s richest man as recently as October 20 but would now rank fourth, his top slot taken by a bottled water tycoon, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e09bd3a4-29e3-47ac-bad2-19d29b47d777" data-trackable="link">Zhong Shanshan</a>.</p>
<p>The results of the showdown will say a lot about the sort of economy that China is developing. If Ant and Alibaba are crippled by regulators — or its founder is personally targeted by investigators — it will go down as a landmark moment in the party’s fickle relationship with China’s private sector even though Mr Ma is, ironically, a party member himself.</p>
<p>Since Deng Xiaoping launched the “reform and opening” era 40 years ago, the party has become ever more dependent on private sector companies for economic growth, job creation and tax revenues. But the party’s fixation with control, especially since Mr Xi came to power almost a decade ago, also triggers periodic crackdowns on the sector and prominent entrepreneurs. </p>
<div>
<figure><picture><source media="screen and (max-width: 490px)" srcset="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd6c748xw2pzm8.cloudfront.net%2Fprod%2F447c1530-0fb2-11eb-8965-eb99f552cea7-mobile.png?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=490" data-id="https://api.ft.com/content/b85f190e-e69f-4767-b253-b9355fa0f700" data-original-image-width="301" data-original-image-height="401"><img src="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd6c748xw2pzm8.cloudfront.net%2Fprod%2F447c1530-0fb2-11eb-8965-eb99f552cea7-standard.png?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=700" data-id="https://api.ft.com/content/3a63d780-65bf-4baf-896f-210d3475c482" data-image-type="graphic" data-original-image-width="700" data-original-image-height="500" alt="Ant Group’s revenue breakdown"></picture></figure>
</div>
<p>Yet there is another potential outcome that would indicate a less fraught relationship between the party-state and business. The investigations into Ant and Alibaba could lead to the sort of settlements that are not dissimilar to those pursued in the US and EU against large finance and technology groups. That would leave Mr Ma’s two flagship companies humbled but still formidable and highly profitable national champions. Even then, a strong political message would have been sent.</p>
<p>“Chinese internet magnates can still enjoy thriving businesses and enormous fortunes if they are able to convince the top leadership of their loyalty,” says Chen Long at Plenum, a Beijing-based consultancy. “The top leadership wants to ensure that neither Ma nor anyone else ever crosses the red line of trying to exert personal influence over government policies again — at least not publicly. The government will support them on the condition that they serve the national interest first.” </p>
<h2>Fintech revolution</h2>
<p>Mr Ma has not appeared in public since October 24, when he gave a high-profile speech critical of the same state-owned banks he clashed with over Yu’E Bao’s rapid growth, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/843b3f60-292b-431f-a94c-93c78bc72bae" data-trackable="link">as well as regulators</a> who he said often sacrifice innovation on the altar of stability. According to people involved in the listing, the speech angered Mr Xi, who made the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/87883923-e321-4632-a1cb-dc2663a00456" data-trackable="link">final decision</a> to halt the Ant IPO. </p>



<p>“To innovate without taking risks is to strangle innovation,” Mr Ma said. “There is no such thing as riskless innovation in the world. Very often, an attempt to minimise risk to zero is the biggest risk itself.”</p>
<p>He was speaking at the same forum where Wang Qishan, Mr Xi’s powerful vice-president and former <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d82964ba-6d42-11e7-bfeb-33fe0c5b7eaa" data-trackable="link">anti-corruption tsar</a>, had earlier emphasised the paramount importance of financial system stability. “Efforts should be made to prevent and lower financial risks . . . security always ranks first,” Mr Wang said. “While new financial technologies have improved efficiency and brought convenience, financial risks have been heightened.”</p>
<p>In an unprecedented public rebuke of Ant two months later, on December 26 China’s central bank <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/96b0bc5f-c02c-41de-be90-fd4a3f56fd2f" data-trackable="link">criticised Ant for being too cavalier about financial risk</a> and taking advantage of regulatory loopholes. But as frustrated as regulators are with Ant, they cannot ignore the beneficial effects of the financial revolution it has led in China.</p>
<p>“Ant Group,” People’s Bank of China vice-governor Pan Gongsheng admitted in his otherwise critical comments, “has played an innovative role in developing financial technology and improving the efficiency and inclusiveness of financial services”. The central bank, he added in a nod to jittery entrepreneurs, was also “unshakeable” in its commitment to “protect property rights and promote entrepreneurship”.</p>

<p>Mr Ma has long enjoyed support from officials in a range of State Council ministries, as well as the lead financial regulators, who appreciate the contributions of Ant, Alibaba and their rivals, all of whom have transformed China’s economy and made its online services sector a global leader. When his status as a party member was <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4b6e5f9a-f233-11e8-9623-d7f9881e729f" data-trackable="link">first confirmed</a> only two years ago, it was in the context of an award he was receiving from the party’s Central Committee for “making China a leading player in the international ecommerce industry, internet finance and cloud computing”.</p>
<p>Alibaba and Ant’s ecommerce and online payment services were even more critical at the height of China’s successful battle to contain coronavirus, providing <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ed316d4c-141c-487f-afb4-cd4c92e823fd" data-trackable="link">essential services</a> to the hundreds of millions of people caught in <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/82574e3d-1633-48ad-8afb-71ebb3fe3dee" data-trackable="link">draconian lockdowns</a>.</p>
<p>“There are different lines of thought within the regulators,” Mr Chen says. “Until Jack Ma’s speech the pro-growth people had the upper hand. But Xi thought the speech was too much and a second [risk-averse] group took the lead. If his speech hadn’t happened, everything would have been fine.” </p>
<p>Disappearing acts are unusual for Mr Ma, who also missed the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a91dfeae-da1e-4348-8212-bbfbe94d93bd" data-trackable="link">November finale</a> of his African reality TV show — <em>Africa’s Business Heroes</em>. He routinely gives <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/308e46a8-6189-11e3-916e-00144feabdc0" data-trackable="link">flamboyant musical performances</a> at Alibaba events and hobnobs with heads of state and government leaders.</p>



<p>As China’s most successful private entrepreneur, Mr Ma enjoys unique status in China — and overseas. His fluent English has made him a huge celebrity on the international conference circuit, with a star quality unmatched by any of his private or state-sector peers. </p>
<p>When Mr Xi hosted the G20 leaders summit in Hangzhou in 2016, some of his guests also visited Mr Ma — something that irked the Chinese president, according to one diplomat involved and other people familiar with the matter. Mr Ma’s VIP callers included Indonesian president Joko Widodo, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and the then Italian premier, Matteo Renzi. Foreign leaders were offered limited time slots and the Chinese foreign ministry was mostly cut out of the process.</p>
<p>Over the past week rumours about Mr Ma’s whereabouts have abounded on China’s carefully monitored social media channels, while domestic media outlets have received <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/62fe82c5-b058-4dd0-bb15-e9428593f078" data-trackable="link">strict instructions</a> from censors about the stories they can and cannot run on Ant and Alibaba’s regulatory troubles. </p>
<p>Many of Mr Ma’s friends and colleagues strongly dispute suggestions that he is personally in any sort of legal jeopardy, let alone on the run. “He is in China and not travelling because of Covid, not anything else. He’s lying low,” says one friend of Mr Ma.</p>

<p>Another friend who communicates with Mr Ma regularly adds: “Everyone is asking me if he’s in danger, but he’s doing fine. He responds [to messages and calls] quickly and seems like he’s in good spirits. Discussions with regulators are still very much in process so he just has to stay quiet until they are resolved.”</p>
<h2>Leadership missteps</h2>
<p>Friends add that while Mr Ma may now regret the consequences of his October 24 speech, he meant what he said and still believes passionately in what he sees as Ant’s mission to transform the provision of financial services in the world’s second-largest economy.</p>
<p>Yu’E Bao, which translates as “account balance treasure”, was started in 2013 and allowed anyone in China, from restaurant staff to the urban yuppies they serve, to deposit as little as Rmb1 ($0.15) in a money-market fund and earn more interest than they could in a Chinese savings deposit account. Just four years later it became the world’s <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/28d4e100-2a6d-11e7-bc4b-5528796fe35c" data-trackable="link">largest money market fund</a>, surpassing JPMorgan’s US government money market fund. </p>

<h3><strong>Introduction to Computer Science and Programming</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course will introduce you to computer science and programming from a theoretical view. It is very important for every beginner to have a visual representation in its mind about most of the concepts of computer science and programming. That way, it can understand their complexity and unlock its imagination and creativity and use the full power of computer science and programming while respecting their laws. Here we recommend you this video:</p>

<h3><strong>Intro to Python Programming</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course is an introduction to Python programming. Easily one of the most popular programming languages in the world, <a href="http://laconicml.com/implement-bayesian-regression-python/">Python</a> is widely used by many people who work in some sort of IT-related field. It is easy to understand, use has tons of libraries and it has huge community support. It is used in Web Development (Django, Flask), Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas, TensorFlow), etc. You are going to use Python a lot, so for this course, we are going to keep it simple by recommending only one video:</p>
<div><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rfscVS0vtbw" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>





<h2><strong>Semester 2</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Calculus part 2</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is the second part of the Calculus. Here you are going to learn about integrals, series, tests, polar coordinates, polar graphs, etc. For this course, we are going to recommend you this playlist of 64 videos. It looks like a lot, but the videos are well explained and are quite short, so you feel like you’ve covered a lot of material.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-gb0E4MII1OxI-BbNkEhuwPHcKxuPSg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Calculus part 2 playlist</a></li>

<li>
<h3><strong>Discrete Mathematics part 2</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course will introduce you to matrices, graphs, searching algorithms, sorting algorithms, algorithms complexity, introduction to probability, combinatorics, variations, and permutations.</p>
<p>This is the second part of the Discrete Mathematics, and as we’ve mentioned in the first part, we are going to use the same playlist of 60 videos, but here we are going to watch starting from the 35th up to the 60th video.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-gb0E4MII28GykmtuBXNUNoej-vY5Rz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discrete Math playlist (videos: 35-60)</a></li>

<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong>Introduction to C++ and Object-Oriented Programming</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course will introduce me to C++, starting from the basics, up to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). OOP is one of the main programming paradigms, and probably the most used.</p>
<p>Most of the applications that you have on your mobile phone or access from the browser are programmed following this paradigm.</p>
<p>It is the pillar of every program you will write in the future, so you will want to give this course more time. For this course, we will recommend you a video playlist of 29 videos.</p>
<p>However, we recommend you to watch them up to the 13th because the rest of them are beyond OOP and if you are new to this, might be complex and difficult to understand.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGLfVvz_LVvQ9S8YSV0iDsuEU8v11yP9M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">C++ tutorial playlist (videos: 1-13)</a></li>

<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>This project is a favorite of mine and so I wanted to share a glimpse of what we've been up to with <a href="https://openai.com/" rel="noopener">OpenAI's amazing GPT-3 language model</a>. Today I'll be sharing a couple of straightforward results with basic prompts only. There are more advanced avenues we're exploring for our use of GPT-3, such as fine-tuning (custom pre-training for specific datasets); you'll hear none of that today, but if you're interested in this topic, follow this blog for updates.</p>
<!--more-->

<h2>Our goal</h2>
<p>I believe the future of monitoring has to include autonomous root cause tools. Deployment frequency and complexity make the "new" issue the driver of Mean-Time-To-Resolve (MTTR) today. You may always know when something breaks, but you won't always know what. Problem is, root cause often hides in log files... but since the volume of logs has grown enormous and it's not always clear what to search for when a new issue arises, we saw a need for a smarter tool to help with root cause.</p>

<h2>Our approach in a nutshell</h2>
<p>If you structure logs really well (we do this with machine learning), including free-text logs, even when there are only one or two examples for a given event type, you can start talking confidently about a "rare" event. Severity lets you talk about a "bad" event. So, you can imagine one log stream expressing a "rare" event, and then another log stream expressing an event that is both "rare" and "bad". A simple point process model lets us talk naively about how likely it is that such a pair of events should show up as close together in time or closer, given patterns of "rare" and "rare"+"bad" events in those two streams. Watching the data for a while will let you estimate parameters for this model, and you can start picking out bouts of such event pairs. Zebrium takes such a bout, and generates an incident report from it. The results we are seeing…</p>

<h2>The plain language challenge</h2>
<p>Our approach works really well at generating root cause reports: if there's a root cause indicator in the logs, it will almost always make its way into a concise root cause report. Our approach has proven robust to different kinds of applications and logs; it requires no training or rules, pre-built or otherwise.</p>

<p>However, there's a big challenge remaining here. The last mile of delivering the benefits of autonomous Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is translating even the concise reports we generate into something the user can understand. The user who needs the quick RCA is not always the person who can understand the oblique root cause indicators in a technical log file. Who is to consume these reports, and what composes them?</p>

<p>This challenge is even more stark for an Managed Service Provider (MSP) or enterprise. At a small company, engineers may be responsible for front-line triage. At a large company or MSP, there will be a front-line, typically junior person who needs a quick RCA; they can't be expected to know all the different intricacies of application logs and what those logs mean. To bring value over the last mile to them, we need plain-language.</p>

<h2>Enter GPT-3</h2>
<p>Now that I've set the stage, let me show you a couple of examples that I think make it clear how transformational GPT-3 can be in the context of our problem. I think you'll agree with me that autonomous RCA seems a lot more real when it's translated into plain-language, and surely a lot more accessible by a lot of users.</p>

<p>GPT-3 is a state-of-the-art bidirectional autoregressive transformer model, with parameters in the hundreds of billions. It is produced, trained, and maintained by OpenAI, and it has really brought start-of-the art, deep NLP to developers’ fingertips.</p>

<p>The most basic procedure for using GPT-3 looks like this -</p>

<p>1) Construct a “prompt” for the model – this is a sort of open-ended document that leaves the model to “continue the story”, as it were; the continuation or response is called a “completion”. For the below two-line examples, I used the following simple prompt construction:</p>

<p>An expert examined the logs for the incident.</p>
<p>The first log message was: &lt;first_line_goes_here&gt;</p>
<p>The last log message was: &lt;second_line_goes_here&gt;</p>
<p>The expert described what had happened, in plain English:</p>

<p>2) Select model (I used davinci) and parameters - for the below examples, I used the following parameters to the davinci GPT-3 model:</p>

<p>{</p>
<p>"max_tokens": 128,</p>
<p>"temperature": 1,</p>
<p>"top_p": 0.05,</p>
<p>"presence_penalty": 0.3,</p>
<p>"frequency_penalty": 0.3,</p>
<p>"best_of": 10</p>
<p>}</p>

<p>3) Call the API; post-process completion for dangling or repeated phrases, to-taste. Serve warm.</p>

<h2>Example one: Database shutdown</h2>
<p>We shut down the Postgres database backing our Atlassian stack. Thousands of events, largely errors, ensued in the logs. Zebrium dutifully generates a root cause report, based on an ML-driven auto-detection. The report looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=1039&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png" alt="postgres incident" width="1039" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=520&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 520w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=1039&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 1039w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=1559&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 1559w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=2078&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 2078w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=2598&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 2598w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=3117&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 3117w" sizes="(max-width: 1039px) 100vw, 1039px"></p>

<p>As you can see, Zebrium pulled about a dozen log events into the report; the first 9 are shown in the image. You’ll notice that the first event is colored green and the last event purple; these are the “FIRST” and the “WORST”, and we use these to characterize the incident in the incidents list. Here’s what that looks like:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=1039&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png" alt="postgres incident summary" width="1039" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=520&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 520w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=1039&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 1039w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=1559&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 1559w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=2078&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 2078w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=2598&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 2598w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=3117&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 3117w" sizes="(max-width: 1039px) 100vw, 1039px"></p>

<p>OK, so Zebrium did a pretty good job here. It autonomously picked these two log events out of thousands to display to the user on the list page. Often, the “FIRST” event reflects root cause and the “WORST” reflects follow-on problems; you’ll note here that the first is not even an error, but it’s rare, and happens too close to other incident events, according to our model, to be a coincidence.</p>

<p>Now in this case, it’s pretty clear to someone who has looked at a log file before that the database was shut down by the administrator. You’ll also notice, though, above the log events, a field called “DESCRIPTION”: this was generated by GPT-3. It says:</p>

<p>“The database server was stopped by the administrator.”</p>

<h2>Why this summary is also amazing</h2>
<p>We passed in the “FIRST” and “WORST” events, as described above, to GPT-3. Notice that the first line says that the “PostgreSQL RDBMS” was “Stopped”. The second line says that there was a “PSQLException” indicating that a connection was “terminating due to administrator command”.</p>

<p>The word “administrator” appears on a different line than the word “PostgreSQL”, and nowhere in the log messages are the words “database” or “server” to be found at all.</p>

<p>The algorithm is doing the following:</p>

<p>1.) Inferring that the statements on the two lines are related</p>
<p>2.) Inferring that they are both speaking about a “database server”</p>
<p>3.) Putting the two statements together: “stopped by the administrator”</p>

<p>Essentially, this is the sort of summary someone would put into a ticketing system; here, it’s being done automatically, thanks to an appropriately selected pair of log messages coupled with a language model.</p>

<h2><span>Example two: Out of memory</span><span></span></h2>
<p>In this case, and using the same parameters as were used in the previous example, we take a root cause report for what turns out to be an out-of-memory issue to GPT-3 and see what sort of summary it gives us.</p>

<p>This particular report was generated in response to a signal from a monitoring tool that saw endpoint latencies spike too high. The system was configured with Zebrium to provide root cause observability across the stack. Here is the report Zebrium ML generated:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=1039&amp;name=oom_incident.png" alt="oom_incident" width="1039" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=520&amp;name=oom_incident.png 520w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=1039&amp;name=oom_incident.png 1039w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=1559&amp;name=oom_incident.png 1559w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=2078&amp;name=oom_incident.png 2078w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=2598&amp;name=oom_incident.png 2598w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=3117&amp;name=oom_incident.png 3117w" sizes="(max-width: 1039px) 100vw, 1039px"></p>

<p>As you can see, Zebrium pulled about a dozen log events into the report; the first 9 are shown in the image. You’ll notice that the first event is colored green and the last event purple; these are the “FIRST” and the “WORST”, and we use these to characterize the incident in the incidents list. Here’s what that looks like:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=908&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png" alt="oom_incident_summary" width="908" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=454&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 454w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=908&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 908w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=1362&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 1362w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=1816&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 1816w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=2270&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 2270w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=2724&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 2724w" sizes="(max-width: 908px) 100vw, 908px"></p>

<p>In this case, it’s not so clear that the problem is due to an out-of-memory issue, unless the reader is familiar with Linux and the OOM killer facility. There are a lot of technical parameters in these events as well, obscuring what was really at the heart of the problem.</p>

<p>Taking a look above the log messages again, in the “DESCRIPTION” field, let’s see what GPT-3 gave us:</p>

<p>“The memcached process was killed by the OOM killer</p>
<p>because it was consuming too much memory. The OOM killer</p>
<p>is a Linux kernel feature that allows the system to kill</p>
<p>a process when <strong><u>the system is running out of memory</u></strong>.”</p>

<h2>Why this summary is also amazing</h2>
<p>What this summary tells us explicitly in plain-language is that the system was running out of memory. This is in fact the root cause of the original incident, tallying up a successful root cause summary.</p>

<p>For an L1 or L2, the Zebrium root cause summary may not be enough. That person won’t necessarily know that OOM means out-of-memory, or that the “FIRST” message isn’t talking about an application issue entirely within memcached.</p>

<h2>What more I wanted here</h2>
<p>In the second example, I would have liked to have seen some recognition that the first line implies that the system was out-of-memory, and therefore the second line was due to related problems (in fact, the application server was paged out). It’s a lot to ask, but I think it might be possible, given some combination of more expressive prompts, finetuning, and presenting GPT-3 with other select data from the report (in this case, the report also included metrics anomalies showing a plunge in swap free).</p>

<h2><span>A cool direction</span></h2>
<p>You may have noticed that GPT-3 gave us a lot of extra detail about the Linux OOM killer than was mentioned in the log messages themselves. I believe it was able to provide this context in the same way it knew that PSQL referred to a database server: it was trained on the internet. There is likely enough information in the public domain that, as GPT-3 was being trained, it picked up enough cursory knowledge of these sorts of systems to add additional value.</p>

<p>To test my hypothesis, I spent some time fiddling quite unscientifically with the prompt and model parameters, trying to get it to expound on the OOM example as describe above. I also gave the model a much larger budget of response tokens. Eventually, I teased out this response:</p>

<p>The root cause of the …</p></span></p></div></div>

<p>Man, 2021 escalated quickly! With the increased concerns and distrust of public platforms owned by big companies, “something’s gotta give”. That “something” will probably be hallmark Web 3.0 features which have been in the works for a while, as well as some Web 2.0 applications that lost popularity because people didn’t want to (or in some cases could not afford to) pay money, at least until now. But what is “Web 3.0”? Since it is difficult to define the entirety of Web 3.0 before it becomes mainstream, here are some elements I’m expecting to come from it.</p>



<p>The first thing to expect is an explosion of self-hosted solutions for the <a href="https://joshuaaust.in/blog/2020/08/11/open-web/">Open Web</a>, such as <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, and many others. While that explosion may cool off as quickly as that explosion became hot, it is the first knee-jerk reaction to expect from the distrustful, the censored, as well as for those who wish for a quieter, more thoughtful experience. The hosting has become cheaper as of late – one can self-host a fairly secure WordPress site for as little as $5 a month if they are technically minded, or have someone take care of the technical side for them for as little as $12-15 a month if they are not so technically minded.</p>



<p>The next “big thing” I expect to happen is for <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/">Ethereum</a> (or at least its underlying concept of decentralized applications) to start becoming more mainstream, as the underlying technology is resistant to even government-level censorship, though currently at the cost of comparatively slow page-loading times.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>At its core, decentralization will be the name of the game for Web 3.0</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>At its core, decentralization will be the name of the game for Web 3.0, and will give companies like Facebook a run for their money. This is why Twitter is already researching how it could potentially morph into a decentralized system in the years ahead.</p>



<p>This will enable both good and bad.</p>



<p>Let’s start with the bad – to be certain, bad people ranging from human traffickers to fake news vendors and everybody in between will harness this to their advantage. This won’t render catching the criminals impossible, it’ll just mean they can’t be easily censored and catching them via the Internet will require a change in strategy.</p>



<p>However, this also opens up the potential for many good things! Soon we may be able to transmit money digitally without the need (or the trust) of a third party vendor, and with increased security measures. As of right now, you can donate the Ether cryptocurrency directly to my decentralized domain name, codextypes.eth, without the need for entrusting PayPal or Venmo’s data warehouses to protect your sensitive financial data. For a transaction fee, I can convert this into fiat currencies where it is legal. In the US, for example, it is currently allowed provided I report any capital gains.</p>



<p>This will also enable religious freedom in new and exciting ways, such as Christian communities being able to archive and share digital copies of the Scriptures in their local languages, both text and audio, without censorship from persecuting governments.</p>



<p>This also has the potential to enable people who previously couldn’t afford a WordPress subscription or hosting plan to have a place where they can share their thoughts and beliefs with full control over their data.</p>



<p>Every major iteration of the Internet won’t help or solve the human condition, but it will attempt to improve upon the technical pain points that came with the previous iteration of the Internet, and that’s something to be excited about!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>The promise of free software is a near-future utopia, built on democratized technology. This future is just and it is beautiful, full of opportunity and fulfillment for everyone everywhere. We can create the things we dream about when we let our minds wander into the places they want to. We can be with the people we want and need to be, when we want and need to.</p>
<p>This is currently possible with the technology we have today, but it’s availability is limited by the reality of the world we live in – the injustice, the inequity, the inequality. Technology runs the world, but it does not serve the interests of most of us. In order to create a better world, our technology must be transparent, accountable, trustworthy. It must be just. It must be free.</p>
<p>The job of the free software movement is to demonstrate that this world is possible by living its values now: justice, equity, equality. We build them into our technology, and we build technology that make it possible for these values to exist in the world.</p>
<p>At the Free Software Foundation, we liked to say that we used all free software because it was important to show that we could. <i>You can do anything with free software</i>, so we did everything with it. We demonstrated the importance of unions for tech workers and non-profit workers by having one. We organized collectively and protected our rights for the sake of ourselves and one another. We had non-negotiable salaries, based on responsibility level and position. That didn’t mean we worked in an office free from the systemic problems that plague workplaces everywhere, but we were able to think about them differently.</p>
<p>Things were this way because of Richard Stallman – but I view his influence on these things as negative rather than positive. He was a cause that forced these outcomes, rather than being supportive of the desires and needs of others. Rather than indulge in gossip or stories, I would like to jump to the idea that he was supposed to have been deplatformed in October 2019. In resigning from his position as president of the FSF, he certainly lost some of his ability to reach audiences. However, Richard still gives talks. The FSF continues to use his image and rhetoric in their own messaging and materials. They gave him time to speak at their annual conference in 2020. He maintains leadership in the GNU project and otherwise within the FSF sphere. The people who empowered him for so many years are still in charge.</p>
<p>Richard, and the continued respect and space he is given, is not the only problem. It represents a bigger problem. Sexism and racism (among others) run rampant in the community. This happens because of bad actors and, more significantly, by the complacency of organizations, projects, and individuals afraid of losing contributors, respect, or funding. In a sector that has so much money and so many resources, women are still being paid less than men; we deny people opportunities to learn and grow in the name of immediate results; people who aren’t men, who aren’t white, are abused and harassed; people are mentally and emotionally taken advantage of, and we are coerced into burn out and giving up our lives for these companies and projects and we are paid for tolerating all of this by being told we’re doing a good job or making a difference.</p>
<p>But we’re not making a difference. We’re perpetuating the worst of the status quo that we should be fighting against. We must not continue. We cannot. We need to live our ideals as they are, and take the natural next steps in their evolution. We cannot have a world of just technology when we live in a world of exclusion; we cannot have free software if we continue to allow, tolerate, and laud the worst of us. I’ve been in and around free software for seventeen years. Nearly every part of it I’ve participated in has members and leadership that benefit from allowing and encouraging the continuation of maleficence and systemic oppression.</p>
<p>We must purge ourselves of these things – of sexism, racism, injustice, and the people who continue and enable it. There is no space to argue over whether a comment was transphobic – if it hurt a trans person then it is transphobic and it is unacceptable. Racism is a global problem and we must be anti-racist or we are complicit. Sexism is present and all men benefit from it, even if they don’t want to. These are free software issues. These are things that plague software, and these are things software reinforces within our societies.</p>
<p>If a technology is exclusionary, it does not work. If a community is exclusionary, it must be fixed or thrown away. There is no middle ground here. There is no compromise. Without doing this, without taking the hard, painful steps to actually live the promise of user freedom and everything it requires and entails, our work is pointless and free software will fail.</p>
<p>I don’t think it’s too late for there to be a radical change – the radical change – that allows us to create the utopia we want to see in the world. We must do that by acknowledging that just technology leads to a just society, and that a just society allows us to make just technology. We must do that by living within the principles that guide this future now.</p>
<p>I don’t know what will happen if things don’t change soon. I recently saw someone comment that change doesn’t happens unless one person is willing to sacrifice everything to make that change, to lead and inspire others to play small parts. This is unreasonable to ask of or expect from someone. I’ve been burning myself out to meet other people’s expectations for seventeen years, and I can’t keep doing it. Of course I am not alone, and I am not the only one working on and occupied by these problems. More people must step up, not just for my sake, but for the sake of all of us, the work free software needs to do, and the future I dream about.</p>

	<p>It will span some 170 kilometers, have no cars—and yet promises a 20-minute commute to work. That’s the vision for an ambitious linear city to be built in Saudi Arabia called, fittingly, The Line.</p>
<p>Announced by Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince, the development aims to be entirely powered by renewable energy, made more efficient through the use of AI and big data, and producing zero carbon emissions.</p>
<p>The belt of “hyper-connected future communities” will stretch from the Red Sea coast inland through the 26,500-square-kilometer NEOM giga project in northwest Saudi Arabia, according to a press statement.</p>
<p>Plans show a top “pedestrian layer” with no cars or roads, with an infrastructure “service layer” beneath, and a “spine layer” below that with AI-powered transport and freight operations.
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Welcome to the new future.<br>

<p>The aim is to have schools, clinics, and leisure facilities within a five-minute walk of people’s homes, with no commute longer than 20 minutes. With construction set to start this quarter, the city is expected to be home to a million people.</p>
<p>“After the Industrial Revolution, cities prioritized machines, cars and factories over people. In cities that are viewed as the world’s most advanced, people spend years of their lives commuting,” said Crown Prince Mohammed.</p>
<p>“Why should seven million people die every year because of pollution? Why should we lose one million people every year due to traffic accidents? And why should we accept wasting years of our lives commuting?</p>
<p>“We need to transform the concept of a conventional city into that of a futuristic one.”</p>
<p>Big data and AI will be harnessed to boost the efficiency of services at the new development, according to NEOM. “An estimated 90 percent of available data will be harnessed to enhance infrastructure capabilities far beyond the 1 percent typically utilized in existing smart cities,” it said. “Communities empowered by AI will learn and predict ways to make life easier to save time for residents and businesses.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h3>Background: Why I had to pivot</h3><p>Almost 3 years ago I incorporated Kinesis Inc, the corporate entity behind <a href="https://xkit.co/">Xkit</a>. But at the time I was building a non-custodial cryptocurrency exchange. After going through Y Combinator and raising $3.5M from some great investors and building a product I was really proud of, I made the hard decision to <a href="https://sparkswap.com/">shut it down</a> nearly a year ago. We hadn't found an audience that would provide venture scale growth, so it was back to the drawing board.</p><p>I started working on an idea in FinTech, trying to help a friend's company solve a problem with SMB customers not paying on time (or at all) for their services. As I talked to prospective customers about the problem, one thing became abundantly clear: in the time that I had spent away from the SaaS world toiling in the Bitcoin mines, expectations around how SaaS tools work together had radically shifted. It was no longer a "bonus" that you worked with some of their other tools, it was an outright necessity. For the product I was exploring I would be building integrations with Quickbooks, Xero, Stripe, and a few others.</p><p>I asked around if anyone had any good tools to accelerate this process, but the responses I got back were pretty disappointing. Nearly every tool was focused on <em>consumers</em> of SaaS software plugging together the services that they used. Not nearly as much was out there for <em>producers</em> of SaaS software trying to build native integrations to the other tools their customers use. Not only that, but the ones that did exist tried to pretend that we live in a world where powerful integrations are easy to design and maintain with a GUI. While I'm a fan of no-code and low-code solutions, the fact remains that for some tasks, leaning on a software development lifecycle is still the most effective and efficient way to build it.</p><p>In the meantime, the US blew up with COVID, throwing the financial markets (which my new FinTech project was heavily dependent on) into turmoil. So like any good (read: desperate) startup founder, I scrapped the FinTech project and started building the tool that I wish had existed to help me build integrations to my prospective customers' other SaaS apps. And despite never having touched the language, I decided to build it in Elixir.</p><h3>Choosing Elixir</h3><p>I've spent most of my career as a software engineer writing in Javascript and Ruby. I've long been intrigued by the concepts behind functional programming (years ago I wrote a small toy to try to achieve immutability on the web, like a centralized IPFS), and a friend introduced me to Elixir, which incorporated some Ruby syntax, making it a bit friendlier to get started with.</p><p>The concepts behind Erlang/OTP/Elixir make it a great fit for a tool like the one I was building. I knew it would be heavily dependent on outside services, meaning it had to be robust to crashes and other unforeseen events. And I knew high concurrency and low latency would be important features as a piece of developer infrastructure. I also wanted to test out <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/pypar.html">Paul Graham's theory of hiring programmers</a>: choose a good language and great programmers will always want to work for you. And finally, I'd be lying if I said there wasn't a part of me that just wanted to try something new. I had spent the past two years working an idea I had to shut down, my "big pivot" was a non-starter, I had laid off nearly the entire team, and for product development it was just me in my bedroom. So I liked the idea of learning something new while working on my second pivot in 3 months.</p><h3>Learning Elixir</h3><p>I read through <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html">Elixir's fabulous language guide</a>. I mean I really read it, cover to cover, and did pretty much all the examples as they came up. Then I read through a handful of pages in the Phoenix (the most popular web framework for Elixir) guides before I said "f*** it" and started building what became Xkit. My first commit was on May 14, 2020. Commit message: "Initial install with platforms".</p><p>The first week was rough. I wasn't used to moving this slowly, but not only was a learning a new language with features pretty unfamiliar to me like pattern-matching, I was learning a new paradigm. Javascript is whatever you want it to be, which means I had some exposure to FP incidentally, but almost everything I've spent significant time on has had a pretty object-oriented flavor to it, even dating back to when I first got started with PHP. Not to mention the entire ethos of OTP to "fail fast and noisily" which ran counter to so many experiences which focused on avoiding failure at all costs (yes, I've seen some pretty large try/catch blocks in my day). I got pretty discouraged at the pace I was moving, and somewhere about 10 days in I was really regretting not just using Node/Express, a stack I was so familiar with it felt like I could write the app in my sleep.</p><p>But I kept at it (probably more out of pride than anything else) and a few days later I felt things start to shift. I still wasn't moving fast, but I could tell I was improving. Things that only a few days ago had felt foreign and impossible to grasp started to make sense. From that point on I started accelerating, and on June 1st, I sent one of my investors <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dJi3sAsHM0">this video</a> showing the first version of what became Xkit.</p><figure id="w-node-f920538a9a16-bd98eff4"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7dJi3sAsHM0"></iframe></p></figure><h3>Shortcomings of Elixir and Phoenix</h3><p>I started off trying to use a pure Phoenix stack including their new real-time front-end, <a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view">LiveView</a>. I'll be honest, although I really like Elixir and Phoenix, using Phoenix for the front-end brought me back a bit to my Rails days, and not in a good way. Building a modern web application with those tools felt like I'd be working against the tide. I also am pretty partial to <a href="https://evergreen.segment.com/">Evergreen</a>, the React UI kit by Segment, and I was bearing down on the 6 week timeline I'd set for myself to launch this product. So I ripped out the Phoenix front-end and converted it to be a back-end only application and built a new front-end in React and Evergreen. I did end up using Phoenix's websocket implementation which was a big help integrating the two, although some pieces are not very well documented.</p><p>When I finally getting close to launching, I ran up against the greatest weakness of my choice to use Elixir: deployment. While the world has moved towards a serverless paradigm, Elixir/Erlang/OTP thrive by handling a lot of the same things that "serverless" promises. That means that to really take advantage of all it has to offer, you're better off deploying it on as close to bare metal as you can. That, in addition to some of the architecture choices I made with Xkit (specifically to provision a custom subdomain for every user), made deployment quite a challenge. Failing to find any good documentation about how to deploy a Phoenix application on AWS, I ended up <a href="https://xkit.co/post/deploying-phoenix-for-elixir-on-aws-ec2">writing a blog post about our process</a>.</p><p>You might think it's overkill for a one-person development team to have a one-command deploy process, but I assure you, based on my past experience, it's well worth the effort. You don't want critical DevOps knowledge in one person's head, or worse, on some inscrutable AWS GUI. I want it all in code. Even today, you can take the entire Xkit stack, move it to a new AWS account and have it up and running with a single command in around 30 minutes.</p><h3>Launching Xkit</h3><p>The delays I hit caused me to miss my six week launch goal by two weeks: I launched to some fellow YC founders on July 12 with ~15 connectors and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MqwQ3Czejs">this video</a>. Two weeks after that I launched on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/xkit">Product Hunt</a> and shortly after that on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24121290">Hacker News</a> with over 25 connectors. Since then we've worked with some really great early customers who have helped us refine the product, and I've been able to hire a few friends to help grow the business.</p><figure id="w-node-9133d12a636d-bd98eff4"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7MqwQ3Czejs"></iframe></p></figure><p>We're well over 50 connectors at this point (almost entirely driven by customer requests) and we add so many that we no longer track it as a metric. And while I'm still contributing code, I can safely say that the majority of the coding that I will do for Xkit is now likely behind me. But the process of building Xkit (and learning Elixir in the process) has been incredibly rewarding, and hopefully we're just getting started.</p><p>‍</p><p>PS - In case you're wondering about the answer to PG's theory about language being a good hiring tool - my early results indicate that it is. From a single post on <a href="https://elixirforum.com/">Elixir Forum</a> I met one of the best engineers I've seen, and a few weeks later he recruited one of the best engineers he'd worked with to join the team.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Live chat (Slack, Teams, etc.) sucks for important discussions.</p>



<p>Thinking one line at a time lowers the quality of the <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/01/08/discussion-topics-for-development-teams/">discussion</a>. Knee jerk rapid fire responses become the norm.</p>



<p>Conversations that last weeks or even days get lost and context gets fuzzy. Threads scroll up into the past and are never seen again.</p>



<p>Despite the “asychronous” claim, you have to <a href="https://critter.blog/2019/09/05/the-chatodoro-breaking-the-group-chat-addiction/">keep a steady eye on it</a> and reply in realtime or the conversation will move on without you. Anyone who takes the time to ponder and respond thoughtfully with context and explanation will find that they’re too late. </p>



<p>If you go on vacation or even take a few hours of <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/13/heads-down-tuesday/">focused time for deep work</a>, you come back to hundreds or thousands of messages. Often your only option is to declare chat room <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/24/declare-bankruptcy-and-dont-be-ashamed-of-it/">bankruptcy</a> which means missing out on important discussions and big decisions.</p>



<p>I’m not saying live chat is useless. It’s great at some things:</p>



<ul><li>Quick answers to quick questions</li><li><a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/15/good-teams-are-noisy/">Low-stakes status updates</a></li><li>Swarming around <a href="https://critter.blog/2016/10/14/making-the-most-of-post-mortems/">red alerts or outages</a></li><li><a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/08/the-key-to-happiness-is-to-stop-getting-upset-all-the-dang-time/">Fun and belonging</a> (especially for remote workers)</li></ul>



<p>In other words, <strong>live chat is for the things that can get lost.</strong> </p>



<p><a href="https://critter.blog/2021/01/07/a-simple-process-beats-a-perfect-process/">Rule of thumb</a>: <em>If a discussion will matter after today, don’t have it in a chat room.</em> Check out <a href="https://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a>, <a href="https://twist.com/">Twist</a>, <a href="https://carrot.io/">Carrot</a>, <a href="https://threads.com/">Threads</a>, <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>, <a href="https://flarum.org/">Flarum</a>, or heck even GitHub issues. These tools exist for a reason. They solve a real problem.</p>



<ul><li>They encourage longer form responses rather than quick one liner replies. </li><li>They show you a list of threads <em>with titles</em> for maximum <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/05/guerrilla-productivity-tactics/">skim-ability</a>. </li><li>They let you sort (by last comment, for example) and filter threads or archive them once a decision has been reached. </li><li>They don’t show online/offline indicators or timezone notifications or “XYZ is typing…” because nobody expects a quick response anyway.</li><li>Some of them even support multi-level (Reddit-style) threading, which can help if a lot of people are involved.</li></ul>



<p>Try it as <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/12/stop-changing-start-experimenting/">an experiment</a>. For one sprint, ask if your team will put anything that matters after today in a discussion tool instead of a chat room. Then see if they want to switch back after the sprint ends.</p>

      <p>Rumors have been swirling around which stores and spaces will be repurposed as COVID vaccination sites, from Whole Foods&nbsp;to London nightclubs. And this morning, we learned that people might be lining up for their vaccines at the Apple Genius Bar. CBS News reported that Apple will make a big announcement tomorrow, January 13. According to CBS, the forthcoming announcement is not product-related and will&nbsp;have a major impact on the general public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People have been speculating that Apple Stores will be used to administer COVID vaccinations, and, according to our data, they're perfectly positioned for the task.</p>

<p>On the above map, the shaded regions represent areas with&nbsp;large percentages of people with COVID symptoms. The yellow dots are Apple stores. Store locations are largely concentrated where COVID symptoms&nbsp;have been reaching record highs— the northeast, southeast, upper midwest, California. The United States has woefully underperformed its vaccination targets so far. Only about 9 million Americans have received the vaccination thus far, underperforming the CDC's target to have 20 million people vaccinated by the end of 2020. President-elect Joe Biden has announced a drive to have 100 million Americans vaccinated during his first 100 days in office, which will require dozens of new sites to be opened around the country.</p>
<p>If Apple stores do indeed become vaccination centers, that would likely have a positive impact on what has been one of the biggest blockers so far in the distribution chain — getting the vaccine from freezers into peoples' arms.</p>
<p><em>CBS This Morning</em> teased&nbsp;the interview with Tim Cook, which&nbsp;<span>Gayle King</span>&nbsp;conducted at an Apple Store. "What we're going to tell you about tomorrow, it's very exciting news,"&nbsp;King says. "[Cook is] a&nbsp;very strong business leader who deeply cares about this country ... and wants to do good." Watch the full clip below.</p>

      <h3>About the Data:</h3>
      <p>
        Thinknum tracks companies using the information they post online, jobs, social and web traffic, product sales, and app ratings, and creates data sets that measure factors like hiring, revenue, and foot traffic. Data sets may not be fully comprehensive (they only account for what is available on the web), but they can be used to gauge performance factors like staffing and sales.

<![CDATA[Replicated Object Notation]]>

January 12, 2021 | http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/ron.sm | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/ron.sm">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
<p>Replicated Object Notation (RON) is a format for <em>distributed live data</em>. It guarantees continuous <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/ronc.sm">bitwise</a> convergence of replicated data structures in a network of arbitrary <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/network.sm">topology</a>. That makes it a good fit for collaborative software, data synchronization on mobile devices, and broadly defined decentralized apps.
RON was specifically designed for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">CRDTs</a> (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types).
For example, this page is a versioned/collaborative <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/ron.sm?@ront">CRDT object</a> containing some CommonMark <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/ron.sm?@text">wikitext</a>.
RON can express non-CRDT data too.</p>
<p>RON is op-based, so it expresses objects, patches and separate ops with equal ease. It can work in real-time, it can work offline. Still, it tries very hard to look like your regular notation of the day.
Here is a simple <a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a> object:</p>
<pre><code>    {   "_id":      "0-2dE-Wares",
        "type":     "apples",
        "quantity": 4,
        "color":    "red"           }
</code></pre>
<p>This is how it may look in RON:</p>
<pre><code>    @0-2dE-Wares :struct,
        type        apples,
        quantity    4,
        color       red;
</code></pre>
<p>This does not seem like a big difference.
Looks like RON is yet another notation, like <a href="http://yaml.org/">YAML</a> or something, right?
Key differences are three:</p>
<ol>
<li>RON is op-based, so every line here is an op.</li>
<li>Every op has a globally unique ID, like <code>0-2dE-Wares</code>;
we may skip those IDs when they go in incremental sequence.</li>
<li>RON is typed, e.g. this particular object is a <code>struct</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that RON ops, objects and versions are all addressable.
Every new op gets a unique <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamp">logical timestamp</a> ID.
That ID also serves as the ID of the version that op created
(in the context of our <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/oplog.sm">subjective order</a> of events).
The op that created the object gives its ID to the object itself,
e.g. <code>0-2dE-Wares</code>.</p>
<p>Now suppose you ate one apple. How do you convey that?
<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902">RFC6902</a> JSON patch may look like this:</p>
<pre><code> [ { "op":"replace", "path":"/quantity", "value":3 } ]
</code></pre>
<p>With RON, you add a new op that references the object.</p>
<pre><code>    @4-2dI-Wares :3-2dH-Wares quantity 3;
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the new op has an ID <code>4-2dI-Wares</code>.
Also, it references the version of the object it amends: <code>3-2dH-Wares</code>.
That was the id of the last op; the one that set <code>color</code> to <code>red</code>.</p>
<p>If you can point to a particular version of the object, why not
request a patch?</p>
<pre><code>    @patch :3-2dH-Wares? 
    @4-2dI-Wares :3-2dH-Wares quantity 3;
</code></pre>
<p>So far so good.</p>
<p>RON supports arbitrary data structures.
RON Struct is a simple and cheap one, it does not support nesting or complex values.
Although, values of a <code>struct</code> can be IDs referencing other objects, so that way you
can nest other data structures in it.
Still, RON Trie is the best one to represent arbitrary JSON.
Suppose, I list the contents of my shelf in JSON:</p>
<pre><code>{
    "shelf": {
        "jarA": {
            "content": "candies",
            "count": 20
        },
        "jarB": {
            "content": "vitamins",
            "count": 100
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>A <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/rdt/trie.sm">RON Trie</a> is like a regular <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/ron.sm?@ront">trie</a>, except it consists of
tuples of RON atoms, not strings of chars.
For our shelf JSON, a <code>trie</code> looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>@0-3d-Wares :trie,
    shelf   jarA    content candies,
    ~       ~       count   20,
    ~       jarB    content vitamins,
    ~       ~       count   100;
</code></pre>
<p>Here, RON shows its tabular nature.
Still, you may also see the trie, defined as a set of tuples/paths.</p>
<p>The directory/file structure of this wiki is stored as a trie.
You may see the resulting <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/ron.sm?@trie:DW_ROOT">RON trie</a> or the
<a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/ron.sm?@ront:DW_ROOT">original RON trie</a> with all the history and metadata.
You may also see it as <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/ron.sm?@json:DW_ROOT">JSON</a>.</p>
<p>Now, let's take a look at
the crown jewel of the system: a type for collaboratively edited text.
Like the one you may find in Google Docs or a similar system. Those need a lot of
rocket science under the hood!
In a real-time collaboratively edited text, every letter is added or removed
by a separate op. That may produce a lot of overheads, so every serialization
of RON (<a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/'serial'/ront.sm">RONt</a>, RONv, RONp) optimizes that case in some way.
RONt uses <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/spreads.sm">spreads</a>: consecutively numbered single-char ops merge into a string. Here you see six formally-identical ways to render "Hello world!":</p>
<pre><code>@0-jG-test :text, ('Hello world!');
@0-jG-test :text, ('Hello world'), '!';
@0-jG-test :text, ('Hello world'), :B-jR-test '!';
@0-jG-test :text, 'H', ('ello world'), 
                            @C-jS-test :B-jR-test '!';
@0-jG-test :text, 'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ' ', 
                        'w', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd', '!';
</code></pre>
<p>The underlying CRDT data type is named a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">Causal Tree</a>.
All pages of this wiki are stored as causal tries.
See the <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/ron.sm?@ront">source RON</a> of this page for an extensive example of
a RONt coded versioned text.</p>
<p>The last but not the least, let's consider such a boring but
essential topic as tabular data.
For your average CSV data-dump cases, RON supports a simple
tabular type <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/rdt/tab.sm">RON Tab</a>. For a CSV like this:</p>
<pre><code>Jar;Content;Count
jarA;candies;20
jarB;vitamins;100
</code></pre>
<p>A <code>tab</code> object would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>   @0-dK2-data :tab  jar    content     count,
                     jarA   candies     20,
                     jarB   vitamins    100;
</code></pre>
<p><code>tab</code> is a cheap and simple type. It can not change the format
of a record; it can only append or remove whole records.</p>
<p>But suppose you need something more like Excel, a lot of action around
your data. Then, you may resort to the most general key-value RON type
named Dict. It maps any RON tuple to another tuple.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>    @0-X3n-data :dict,
        jarA   content   ~   candies,
        jarA   count     ~   20,
        jarB   content   ~   vitamins,
        jarB   count     ~   100;
</code></pre>
<p>A <code>dict</code> can store sparse or multidimensional tables,
as it can update, insert or delete columns, rows or separate cells.
Actually, <code>dict</code> can express a broad range of data structures,
including relational tables.</p>
<p>Now, it is probably the right time to introduce the formal rules of RON.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are four types of RON atoms:
<ol>
<li>UUID, a 128-bit <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/spec/uuid.sm">RON UUID</a> that can be of one of four <em>versions</em>:
NAME, TAG, LAMPORT, YOLO. The last two are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamp">logical timestamps</a>.</li>
<li>INT, a 64-bit signed integer,</li>
<li>STRING, a Unicode string,</li>
<li>FLOAT, an IEEE 754 float.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A RON tuple contains zero or more RON atoms, of any types.
Tuple size is limited to 1GB in the <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/%27serial%27/ronc.sm">RONc form</a>.</li>
<li>A RON op is a RON tuple that also has its own globally unique UUID
(of a logical timestamp kind) and references some pre-existing op by
its UUID. This reference attaches the new op to the existing graph
of data. That way, RON builds data structures out of ops.</li>
<li>One or more RON ops form a <em>frame</em>. A frame can be a FACT, a QUERY,
or a CLAIM. In RONt, these are denoted with <code>;</code> <code>?</code> and <code>!</code> terminating signs.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what RON is.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-swiftype-name="body" data-swiftype-type="text"><p>Confluent uses <a href="https://www.leadingagile.com/2018/04/step-by-step-toward-property-based-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">property-based testing</a> to test various aspects of Confluent Server’s <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/infinite-kafka-storage-in-confluent-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tiered Storage</a> feature. Tiered Storage shifts data from expensive local broker disks to cheaper, scalable object storage, thereby reducing storage costs, rebalancing times, and improving elasticity. However, if Tiered Storage is not implemented correctly, the result can be significant data loss.</p>
<p>Property-based testing is highly effective when used in combination with traditional testing techniques, such as example-based testing, integration testing, and so on. This post describes some of the property-based testing that Confluent performs on the log-orientated storage layer of Confluent Server and how we test the integration of Tiered Storage with Apache Kafka<sup>®</sup>’s traditional storage layer.</p>
<p>Property-based testing aims to test several key behaviors of the log to ensure the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data must never be prematurely deleted due to the different forms of retention or other log operations</li>
<li>Data must never be exposed incorrectly to follower brokers or consumers</li>
<li>We should not tier data that may potentially be truncated due to Apache Kafka’s replication protocol</li>
</ul>
<p>To implement a stateful property test for the log layer, we used <a href="https://www.scalacheck.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ScalaCheck’s</a> <a href="https://github.com/typelevel/scalacheck/blob/master/doc/UserGuide.md#stateful-testing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stateful testing functionality</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the relevant terms to know:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Log</strong>: the log that stores replica data for a partition</li>
<li><strong>System Under Test (SUT):</strong> the real system being modelled, which is a log in this case</li>
<li><strong>Log model:</strong> the modeled state for the system under test (SUT)</li>
<li><strong>Log segment:</strong> a unit of zero or more record batches; consists of a .log file and associated indices</li>
<li><strong>Active segment:</strong> the segment with the highest base offset and to which new appends will be written</li>
<li><strong>Retention:</strong> the process by which users control the size of a topic’s partitions by duration, size, or triggered deletions</li>
<li><strong>Log start offset:</strong> the inclusive lower bound offset for the log</li>
<li><strong>Log end offset:</strong> the exclusive upper bound offset for the log</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="initial-state-generator"><a id="initial-state-generator"></a>Initial state generator</h2>
<p>Every property test run must start with an initial state—in this case, a model of the log. To create this initial state, we define an initial state generator. The primary behavior that we are testing for is the correct behavior of retention logic. Two critical configurations for this behavior are <code><a href="https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/installation/configuration/topic-configs.html#retention.ms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">retention.ms</a></code> (retention according to time) and <code><a href="https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/installation/configuration/topic-configs.html#confluent.tier.local.hotset.ms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confluent.tier.local.hotset.ms</a></code> (hotset retention). See below for a visualization of how hotset retention causes a Tiered Storage based log to span the tiered set and the local hotset data. Our initial state generator will generate configurations for these settings and an initial state.<br>

<pre>Generator:
retentionMs &lt;- Gen.chooseNum[Long](0, 200)
hotsetRetentionMs &lt;- Gen.chooseNum[Long](0, 50) config = Map("retention.bytes" -&gt; Long.MaxValue,
             "retention.ms" -&gt; retentionMs,
             "confluent.tier.local.hotset.ms" -&gt; hotsetRetentionMs)

SUT:
log = new Log(generatedConfig)

Model state:
logStartOffset = 0
logEndOffset = 0
config = generatedConfig
segments = [SegmentState(baseOffset = 0, nextOffset = 0, maxTimestamps = None)]
deletedLocalSegments = []
tieredSegments = []
deletedTieredSegments = []
committedEndOffset = -1
</pre>
<h2 id="action-generator"><a id="action-generator"></a>Action generator</h2>
<p>The log property tests generate different sub-actions at various frequencies, ensuring that more common operations are performed more frequently in proportion to the number listed for each action. Descriptions of these actions will follow.</p>
<pre>Gen.frequency(
  (20, Append),
  (20, AdvanceHighWatermark),
  (20, Read),
  (10, AdvanceTime),
  (10, IncrementLogStartOffset),
  (10, TierUploadSegment),
  (10, RollSegment),
  (10, CommitTierState),
  (10, Retention),
  (10, TierRetention),
  (1, CloseAndReopen))
</pre>
<h2 id="append"><a id="append"></a><code>Append</code></h2>
<p><code>Append</code> generates a record batch of different record types, with a bounded range of timestamps and various compression choices. The generated record batch is then appended to the SUT log.<br>
The model state is updated to advance the log end offset and accumulate the records that have been appended.</p>
<pre>Action: Append(generatedRecords):

Generators:
CompressionType:
Gen.oneOf(CompressionType.NONE, CompressionType.SNAPPY, CompressionType.GZIP, CompressionType.LZ4)

Record:
timestamp &lt;- Gen.chooseNum[Long](baseTimestamp, minTimestamp)
key &lt;- Gen.oneOf(Gen.alphaNumStr.map(_.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)), Gen.const(null))
value &lt;- Gen.oneOf(Gen.alphaNumStr.map(_.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)), Gen.const(null))

RecordBatch:
magic &lt;- Gen.oneOf(RecordBatch.MAGIC_VALUE_V0, RecordBatch.MAGIC_VALUE_V1, RecordBatch.MAGIC_VALUE_V2)
records &lt;- Gen.nonEmptyListOf(Record)
compressionType &lt;- CompressionType

SUT action:
log.appendAsLeader(generatedRecordBatch)

Model action:
activeSegment.append(generatedRecordBatch)
records.add(generatedRecordBatch)
logEndOffset = logEndOffset :+ generatedRecordBatch.size
</pre>
<h2 id="advancehighwatermark"><code><a id="advancehighwatermark"></a>AdvanceHighWatermark</code></h2>
<p><code>AdvanceHighWatermark</code> simulates the movement of the high watermark (HWM). In Apache Kafka, high watermark increases occur as follower replicas fetch data from the leader.<br>
The high watermark affects several behaviors of the log. For example, it dictates the upper bounds of allowable retention, segments eligible for tiering, and log start offset movement resulting from <code>DeleteRecords</code> API calls.</p>
<p>Due to how Apache Kafka performs offset translation, we limit high watermark movements such that they align with record batch base offsets or the log end offset. The reason for this will be discussed later.</p>
<pre>Action: AdvanceHighwatermark(newHighwatermark):

SUT action:
log.updateHighWatermark(newHwm)

Model:
hwm = newHwm
</pre>
<h2 id="rollsegment"><code><a id="rollsegment"></a>RollSegment</code></h2>
<p><code>RollSegment</code> forces a segment roll on the SUT’s log. This is necessary because we set <code>segment.bytes</code> and <code>segment.ms</code> to their maximum possible values, given that this logic is currently unimplemented in the model. When it is implemented, this action will no longer be required.</p>
<pre>Action: RollSegment()

Log action:
Log.roll()

Model:
Create a new empty active segment if the existing active segment is empty
</pre>
<h2 id="tieruploadsegment"><code><a id="tieruploadsegment"></a>TierUploadSegment</code></h2>
<p><code>TierUploadSegment</code> checks whether any segments meet the necessary conditions for tiering and then simulates an upload of the segment to object storage. The candidate segment must meet the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The segment must not be the active segment</li>
<li>The segment end offset must be greater than the log start offset</li>
<li>The segment is the first tierable segment that has not otherwise been tiered</li>
<li>The segment end offset must be below the high watermark</li>
</ul>
<pre>Action: TierUploadSegment()

Log action:
simulateUpload(firstTierableSegment)

Model:
tieredSegments.add(firstTierableSegment)
</pre>
<h2 id="committierstate"><code><a id="committierstate"></a>CommitTierState</code></h2>
<p>Tiered logs contain local state consisting of metadata for tiered segments. Confluent Server achieves safety of the overall log by preventing deletion of any local segment covered by tiered segments until after this state has been safely committed (flushed).</p>
<pre>Action: CommitTierState()

Log action:
log.tierPartitionState.flush()

Model:
committedEndOffset = tieredSegments.last.endOffset
</pre>
<h2 id="incrementlogstartoffset"><code><a id="incrementlogstartoffset"></a>IncrementLogStartOffset</code></h2>
<p>The <code>IncrementLogStartOffset</code> action simulates two behaviors in Apache Kafka. The first is when an application or user uses the <code><a href="https://kafka.apache.org/22/javadoc/index.html?org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/AdminClient.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DeleteRecords</a></code>API to advance the log start offset. The second is when a leader has a higher log start offset than the follower, which will trigger the advance of the log start offset via the replication protocol.</p>
<pre>Action: IncrementLogStartOffset(newLogStartOffset: Long)
Generated:
newLogStartOffset &lt;- Gen.chooseNum(state.logStartOffset, state.highWatermark)

Log action:
log.maybeIncrementLogStartOffset(newLogStartOffset, ClientRecordDeletion)

Model:
logStartOffset = newLogStartOffset
</pre>
<h2 id="retention"><code><a id="retention"></a>Retention</code></h2>
<p><code>Retention</code> applies Apache Kafka’s local log retention to the SUT in the following order of application:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>retention.ms</code></li>
<li><code>retention.bytes</code></li>
<li>log start offset</li>
</ol>
<p>In the case of log start offset retention, any segments lower than the log start offset will be deleted. The retention action must be careful not to delete any local segments that are not deletable due to data that has been tiered. For example, if any tiered segments past the start offset are not deletable, then any following local segments will not be deletable.</p>
<pre>Action: Retention()

Log action:
log.deleteOldSegments()

Model:
Apply retention time retention
Advance the log start offset if any local segments have been deleted
Apply log start offset retention
Apply hotset time retention
</pre>
<h2 id="tierretention"><code><a id="tierretention"></a>TierRetention</code></h2>
<p>The <code>TierRetention</code> action performs retention for the tiered portion of the log. <code>TierRetention</code> is similar to normal log retention, except it is responsible for deletion of the section of the log that has been tiered.</p>
<pre>Action: TierRetention()

Log action:
log.tierDeleteOldSegments()

Model:
Delete the first tiered segment if it is below the log start offset or if maxTimestamp &lt; currentTimeMs - retention.ms
</pre>
<h2 id="closeandreopen"><code><a id="closeandreopen"></a>CloseAndReopen</code></h2>
<p><code>CloseAndReopen</code> closes the log and reopens it. It is important to test the opening of the log as it re-initializes critical variables and may perform log <code>recovery</code> if the log was not closed cleanly. If the generated recover variable is true, the log will be forced to perform log recovery from the beginning of the log as if it were not closed cleanly. This rebuilds in-memory epoch and producer states from local segments rather than restoring them from checkpointed states on disk.</p>
<pre>Action: CloseAndReopen(recover: Boolean)

Log action:
log.close()
new Log(recoveryOffset)

Model:
No action
</pre>
<h2 id="read"><code><a id="read"></a>Read</code></h2>
<p><code>Read</code> performs a read of the log starting at an offset under a particular isolation mode. The offset affects the starting point of the read, and isolation action affects the data that is allowed to be returned by the fetch. For example, for <code>FetchHighWatermark</code>, only records below the high watermark are allowed to be returned.</p>
<p><code>Read</code> is implemented here as an action rather than as a property check for two reasons. The first is that checking every potential combination of <code>fetchOffset</code> and <code>isolation</code> after every action will be expensive. Secondly, reads can affect the behavior of the log by advancing high watermarks, triggering values to be …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A writeup detailing the exposed employee records that Sakura Samurai managed to access during our security research through their vulnerability disclosure program.</p><p>Reading time: 3 minutes.</p><div>
      

<p>We noticed that The United Nations had a Vulnerability Disclosure Program and a Hall of Fame, therefore Sakura Samurai 桜の侍 our security research group, set out to look for vulnerabilities to report to the United Nations. During the research process Jackson Henry @JacksonHHax , Nick Sahler, John Jackson @johnjhacking and Aubrey Cottle @Kirtaner identified an endpoint that exposed Git Credentials. The credentials gave us the ability to download the Git Repositories, identifying a ton of user credentials and PII. In total, we identified over 100K+ private employee records. We also discovered multiple exposed .git directories on UN owned web servers [ilo.org], the .git contents could then be exfiltrated with various tools such as “git-dumper”.</p>

<p><strong>Travel Records [Two Documents: 102,000+ Records]</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/travel-records.png" alt=""><br>
Travel Records Included Employee ID Numbers, Names, Employee Groups, Travel Justification, Start and End Dates, Length of Stay, Approval Status, Destination and the Length of the stay.</p>
<p><strong>HR Nationality Demographics [Two Documents: 7,000+ Records]</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/nationality-records.png" alt=""><br>
Included Employee Name, Employee Group, Employee ID Numbers, Person’s Nationality, Person’s Gender, Employee Pay Grade, Organization Work Unit Identification Number and Organization Unit Text Tags.</p>
<p><strong>Generalized Employee Records [One document: 1,000+ Records]</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/hr-records.png" alt=""><br>
Index Numbers, Employee Names, Employee Emails, Employee Work Subareas and Employee Org Units. Note: The column with the “Red number 1” represent the Employee’s specific work department and was blurred as some of the sub-units are smaller.</p>
<p><strong>Project and Funding Source Records [One Document: 4,000+ Records]</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/project-funding.png" alt=""><br>
Included Project Identification Number, Affected Areas, Grant and Co-financing amounts, Implementing Agencies, Countries, Funding Sources, Period of the Project and if the Project/Concept was approved.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation Reports [One Document: 283 Projects]</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/eval-reports.png" alt=""><br>
Overall descriptions of the Evaluations and Reports, Periods Conducted and a link to the report on the project.</p>

<p>In addition, on the lesser side of severity, we managed to takeover a SQL Database and a Survey Management Platform belonging to the International Labour Organization - also in the UN’s VDP program scope. However, it was of note that the ILO vulnerabilities were of little prominence as the Database and Survey Management platform were fairly abandoned in nature and contained hardly anything of use. Nonetheless, a Database takeover and admin account takeover on a platform are still Critical vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>We had performed subdomain enumeration of all of the domains in scope for the VDP offered by the UN. During our research, we began to fuzz multiple endpoints with tooling and initially discovered that an ilo.org subdomain had an exposed .git contents. Utilizing git-dumper [<a href="https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper" title="https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper"><strong>https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper</strong></a>] we were able to dump the project folders hosted on the web application, resulting in the takeover of a MySQL database and of  survey management platform due to exposed credentials within the code.</p>
<p><strong>MySQL Credentials</strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/sql.png" alt=""><br>
Note:</strong> <em>We will not provide a picture of the survey platform due to the specific nature of the application.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>After we had taken over one of the International Labour Organization’s MySQL Databases and performed account takeover on the survey management platform, we began to enumerate other domains/subdomains.</p>
<p>Eventually, we found a subdomain on the United Nations Environment Programme that allowed us to discover github credentials after a bit of fuzzing.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/git.png" alt=""><br>
Ultimately, once we discovered the GitHub credentials, we were able to download a lot of private password-protected GitHub projects and within the projects we found multiple sets of database and application credentials for the UNEP production environment. In total, we found <strong>7 additional credential-pairs</strong> which could have resulted in unauthorized access of multiple databases. We decided to stop and report this vulnerability once we were able to access PII that was exposed via Database backups that were in the private projects.</p>

The pandemic pushed us to use the internet in new ways: digital doctor visits, first dates and family dinners over Zoom, grocery shopping via apps.</p>  <p>The pandemic has not only magnified the value of the internet, but also what's <em>wrong</em> with it. Newsfeeds that spread misinformation. Digital ads that track and target us. Algorithms that make opaque decisions about our credit ratings or our dating lives. Smart speakers that listen to —&nbsp;and store —&nbsp;our every word.&nbsp;</p>  <p>In short: the internet is indispensable&nbsp;— and imperfect.</p>  <p>At this fraught moment in our digital society, Canada has a major opportunity to address much of what's wrong online. Several weeks ago, Canadian legislators in the House of Commons introduced<a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/P9TMCG922fJDMJvSKIpFD?domain=parl.ca" target="_blank"> </a><a href="https://parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/43-2/bill/C-11/first-reading" target="_blank"><u>Bill C-11</u></a> to <a href="https://parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/43-2/bill/C-11/first-reading">enact the Consumer Privacy Protection Act</a>.</p>  <p>Bill C-11 embodies the principles of Canada's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/062.nsf/eng/00119.html" target="_blank"><u>Digital Charter</u></a>, which envisions the internet as a tool for both innovation <em>and</em> the public good. And it hints at an internet where individual Canadians, not big tech platforms, are in full control of their data.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Of course, Bill C-11 is just that —&nbsp;a bill, not yet a law. It holds a great deal of promise, but it needs serious improvements if it is to live up to the vision outlined in the Digital Charter.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Canada is at an inflection point. We can improve this law so that it truly protects and empowers Canadians, giving us control over our relationship with Big Tech, gig economy companies and retailers who constantly track us online. Or, we can pass a law that makes a show of protecting privacy, but leaves many of the worst problems with the internet —&nbsp;limited consumer agency, no accountability for Big Tech —&nbsp; unsolved and unchecked.&nbsp;</p>  <p>For C-11 to succeed, we need movement on three fronts.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5863224.1609951759!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/ap-poll-social-media-trust.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5863224.1609951759!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/ap-poll-social-media-trust.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5863224.1609951759!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/ap-poll-social-media-trust.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5863224.1609951759!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/ap-poll-social-media-trust.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5863224.1609951759!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/ap-poll-social-media-trust.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5863224.1609951759!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/ap-poll-social-media-trust.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Bill C-11 includes privacy-protection measures such as the right to opt out of having personal data collected by third parties.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Rick Bowmer/Associated Press)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>First, we need to make sure the new rights the bill offers Canadians are clear and actionable.</p>  <p>What the bill includes so far is quite promising, things like the right to an explanation of why an artificial intelligence (AI) made a decision about me, or the right to opt out of having my data collected in the first place.</p>  <p>These things may sound abstract, but could have huge benefits in our everyday lives. Imagine if you could press a button to understand why Amazon or an airline is giving you a different price today than it did yesterday (an AI did that!). Or if you could join a points program at a store and understand why you received certain promotions but not others.</p>    <p>For instance, grocery or retail points programs often tailor rewards to match the foods and products that members of the program purchase most often, meaning that different people receive different discounts based on the data that has been collected. While this might seem more efficient, it also creates inequality as people that do not use a program's app cannot access the same modest discounts on everyday essentials available to a member. Simply having better explanations available for why someone is receiving a discount offer, similar to Facebook's "Why am I seeing this ad?" feature, could be helpful.</p>  <p>The rights in C-11 have the potential to drive changes like these. Yet, as we have seen with similar laws in Europe, real change is hard to come by.</p>  <p>Clear lines in the law and public education about digital rights will be essential if Canadians are going to use and benefit from them.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.4915106.1542831393!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/online-shopping-534050776.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4915106.1542831393!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/online-shopping-534050776.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4915106.1542831393!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/online-shopping-534050776.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4915106.1542831393!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/online-shopping-534050776.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4915106.1542831393!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/online-shopping-534050776.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.4915106.1542831393!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/online-shopping-534050776.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>The new digital privacy protection legislation is vague about how enforcement will work.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Kite_rin/Shutterstock)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>The second front crucial to the bill's success? Strong enforcement and accountability.</p>  <p>This is another place where Bill C-11 is at once promising and worrying. While Bill C-11 provides new order-making powers to the Privacy Commissioner and allows fines up to $25 million or 5 per cent of a firm's gross revenue, it's vague about how all of this will work.</p>    <p>Looking again to Europe and laws such as the<a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/i2EfCK622TqXnqVS3Pmub?domain=gdpr-info.eu" target="_blank"> </a><a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/" target="_blank"><u>General Data Protection Regulation</u></a> (GDPR), we see that they only work if entities like the Privacy Commissioner are incredibly well resourced. And as a report from browser developer Brave demonstrated, European governments have&nbsp;<a href="https://brave.com/dpa-report-2020/" target="_blank"><u>not equipped their national authorities to enforce the GDPR</u></a>.</p>  <p>Canadian lawmakers must learn from this example and lay out a plan to invest&nbsp; accordingly. And they must resist the temptation to shift the enforcement burden to consumers —&nbsp;it is time to relieve us of reviewing the Terms and Conditions of every single app.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5149509.1610403451!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/laptop.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5149509.1610403451!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/laptop.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5149509.1610403451!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/laptop.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5149509.1610403451!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/laptop.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5149509.1610403451!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/laptop.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5149509.1610403451!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/laptop.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Unlike legislation in some other jurisdictions around the world, Canada's digital consumer privacy law lacks a mechanism for collective representation when there is an issue that affects a group of people. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Shutterstock/Dan74)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>The third front where we need progress is collective rights and intermediaries —&nbsp;giving Canadians the option to demand more from Big Tech collectively rather than on their own.</p>  <p>Just like pollution, abuse of data affects individuals <em>and</em> the collective.

<p>May 6<sup>th</sup>, 2020</p>
<p>The title is a bit of a lie. I think Python is a good, practical, language, and relatively easy to learn and to teach. Its vast collection of libraries let you slap together a program to do virtually anything you want. It doesn’t have the beauty of APL or lisp, and certainly nothing like the speed or expressive power of Julia, but it’s a tool anyone can use to make something that solves a real-world, non-trivial problem in a day or two. And if you’re programming the kind of website that uses forms and a database, it has the Django web framework, which alone might be a good enough reason to learn the language.</p>
<p>For me, what sometimes makes Python a pain in the neck is that it is an “object oriented” language. These are not the awesome message-passing objects as they were originally envisioned and implemented in Smalltalk. These “objects” are class based, and are attractively outfitted with multiple inheritance. As an individual programmer, you never need to write a single class. I certainly don’t. I use Python as a functional language. I create a program from many small, composable functions acting on lists, tuples, and dictionaries. This is not a criticism. Python was designed in the 1980s, when most people thought that classes were the way to go. They may still be the best choice for certain types of problems, but now there is growing regret directed at the need to live with and maintain large systems built from piles of classes all keeping secrets and inheriting from each other.</p>
<p>My beloved Django is a good example. If I want to customize its behavior, I need to wander though a maze of magical framework code, and end up littering my own code with opaque references to <em>this</em> and <em>that</em> and <em>super</em> and <em>meta</em>. I don’t bother any more, and just write my own code to replace the parts of Django that I want to be different, bypassing larger and larger parts of the framework. Despite all this, Django is such a mature and solid piece of engineering that I am loathe to abandon it.</p>
<p>As I said, the power of Python is the ability to leverage its libraries, including the ones added by so many people over the years. And here is the problem for the user of the language who might want to avoid the class-based paradigm and write functional code. The libraries are written by real Python programmers, which means that they are object oriented. They often don’t mesh well with code written in the functional style, are a pain to modify, and do things you might not expect.</p>
<p>Here is a little example that, I hope, shows you some of what I mean. I needed to write a program that reads, parses, and writes bibtex files. These are plain-text databases of publications familiar to anyone who uses the LaTeX document preparation system. The database stores the bibliographic information about some list of publications; you just mention its location in your LaTeX document, and you can get citations and a reference section typeset in any style you need. Naturally, there’s a Python library for parsing bibtex: it’s called <code>bibtexparser</code>. Did I mention that there is a library for everything? That’s why we’re using Python. This library can read the file and parse it into a special object, the BibDatabase. This object has a property called <code>entries</code>; the <code>entries</code> is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the bibliographic information for one publication, with keys like <em>author</em>, <em>title</em>, etc. There is a special key called <code>ID</code> that uniquely identifies each publication. It’s chosen by the author as a mnemonic tag for use in citations. The documentation of this library is, frankly, not very good, and I had to experiment to see just how it works. I found that I could modify the <code>entries</code>, or delete from or add to the list, and my alterations were reflected when writing the new bibtex file back to disk. So far, so good.</p>
<p>The BibDatabase object has another way to represent the data. It has an <code>entries_dict</code> property, too, which is a dictionary of dictionaries. Each publication appears as a dictionary with a key that is the publication’s <code>ID</code>. In other words, it’s almost the same as the <code>entries</code> list, but with the data arranged a little differently. Instead of a list of dictionaries, it’s a dictionary whose values are dictionaries and whose keys are the <code>ID</code>s. This makes sense, and is the most natural way to represent this data.</p>
<p>At some point in my program, it became convenient to use the <code>entries_dict</code> version of the data rather than the <code>entries</code> view of it. I found that I could alter the contents of any of the dictionaries, and the changes, again, were faithfully preserved when I converted the BibDatabase into a file on disk. But then I tried to add a new publication by adding an entry to the <code>entries_dict</code> dictionary. The new publication did <em>not</em> appear in the output file.</p>
<p>The documentation was no help. I started reading the source code, and, no surprise, it was based on classes. Not transparent functions transforming data structures, but opaque classes with super-secret methods for doing everything. When the user asks for the <code>entries</code> or the <code>entries_dict</code>, or adds items to them, private code is run behind the scenes, as is common in class-based systems. These secret methods and <code>properties</code> add a publication to the object when you append to its <code>entries</code>, but not when you enlarge its <code>entries_dict</code>. It was easy to modify my code to take this into account. But I wished I had known about it in advance and not wasted an hour or two puzzling over it.</p>
<p>This is a typical Python library, and this is why using Python can be so annoying. If you want to use the library in a way a little differently from how its creator intended, you may trip over surprising behavior, and will have to wade through a maze (sometimes—this library happens to be quite simple) of class-based source code to figure out what all the secret methods are doing. It may be a matter of taste, but I find that using and understanding libraries in Clojure or Julia to be a refreshing contrast.</p>

<p>Developers hate legacy code. It’s dirty, it’s crowded, it’s ugly, it’s messy, it’s… old. But we shouldn’t have a negative outlook on legacy or old code. It’s there for a reason, we just need to appreciate that reason.</p>



<p>When starting a new job and getting your first look at the legacy codebase, it’s easy to be frightened or disgusted. If the code has been around for a long time (in Internet years), it probably doesn’t meet modern style guides or follow modern practices. We can easily look at this code and deem it inferior to the code that is being written presently. To do so, though, is to disrespect the developers and the decisions that came before us.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“<em>Legacy code is established</em>“</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>We need to reframe our minds and stop hating and disrespecting legacy code and instead appreciate it for what it is: legacy code is established. The lines you’re judging are there for a reason; they have lasted the test of time; they have served a purpose. Most importantly of all, they have given you a job. Without those “old” or “ugly” lines of code, you would not have the job that you’re using now to put down that very code.</p>



<p>Programmers don’t set out with the intention of writing bad or ugly code. They don’t sit down and think of the most convoluted solution they can write. Code becomes complex, intertwined, and unpleasant over time. Each feature begins with a single typed character and builds from there. As the business grows and its needs change, so does the code. </p>



<p>A friend of mine once said that “bad” code is the product of not enough time, poorly defined requirements, or inexperience, not necessarily a bad programmer. Business moves fast and as developers, we’re constantly working against the clock to release features to draw in customers and make more money. It’s for these reasons that we must change how we think about and see legacy code – it is not something to be looked down upon, it is a legacy that was passed down to us that we must now carry forward for the next generation of programmers. When we are handed a legacy codebase, it becomes ours to shepherd forward.</p>



<p>Build and improve upon the legacy, but overall, respect it.</p>

<p>A Tesla Model Y Standard Range is spotted with the heated steering wheel option activated. This useful feature for the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/cold-weather/">cold weather</a> is not found in the earlier versions of the Model Ys delivered since last year. Tesla has not yet officially advertised this feature in the online configurator or via an official tweet. </p>



<p>But Tesla has got a large and vibrant community across the social media sphere news outlets like ours to publicize the hidden features and upgrades for the company.</p>



<p>The Kilowatts / Twitter seems to be the first Tesla owner finding out about the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-y/">Tesla Model Y</a> heated steering feature in a recently launched cheapest version of the  Model Y named <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2021/01/08/model-y-rwd-3rd-row-leaked-photos-model-3-compare/">Standard Range RWD</a>.</p>

<p>Interestingly, like Tesla always does, the feature was added to the vehicle for no extra cost or hiking the price of the existing variants. Tesla is one of the few companies in the world right now to implement the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/05/19/model-y-sandy-munro-verdict/#deming-cycle">continuous improvement cycle</a> on the factory floor in its true sense.</p>



<p>The following video shows how to turn the heated steering wheel ON or OFF by tapping the climate icon (the fan icon) on the center touchscreen. When the climate control menu pops up, you need to tap the squiggly lines icon on the left to bring up the seat and steering heater controls, now you can turn the heated steering by tapping the tab with the steering icon.</p>

</figure>



<p>The introduction of the heated steering wheel for the Model Y and even for the base variant might be a step taken to give Volkswagen ID.4 a more tough competition in the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/tesla-in-europe/">European</a> and US market. Tesla China has upgraded the locally made <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-3/">Tesla Model 3</a> with the heated steering wheel but we have yet to witness this on a Fremont made US Model 3.</p>



<p>It’s not clear though if Tesla is going to give existing owners the option for a heated steering wheel retrofit, we will soon find out and let you know.</p>



<p>To fight cold weather, Tesla also recently launched a <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/11/13/tesla-introduces-the-new-model-y-20-winter-wheels-and-tire-package/">winter tire and wheels package</a> for the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-y/">Tesla Model Y</a>.</p>



<p>On a side note, a large number of Tesla <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-s/">Model S</a>, 3, X, and Y cars are spotted at a rented parking lot in Dublin, California — seems Q1 2021 has started strongly for Tesla (TSLA) after the record Q4 2020.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>We love Hetzner ❤️. </p>



<p>They have a great offering with a lot of stability and great prices. Therefore we basically provide all our services from within one of the many german datacenters. Running our Kubernetes Cluster with them was no question and one year after our first experiments with Kubernetes, we can even see a tight integration with all the Hetzner Cloud Services.</p>



<p>Hetzner currently offers the following cloud services we want to make use of in our Clusters:</p>



<ul><li>Servers (obviously)</li><li>Volumes</li><li>Private Networks</li><li>Load Balancers</li><li>DNS API (not a part of the Cloud offering but important)</li></ul>



<p>Since we are already running multiple Clusters (production, staging &amp; testing) and expect to run even more in the future, as well as the ease of usage we have with it, we are using Rancher and the RKE K8s distribution.</p>



<p>How to setup a rancher instance is pretty well documented around the internet and our recommendation is to start off with a single node install using k3s/rke/microK8s which can then expanded as you go: <a href="https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/install-rancher-on-k8s/">https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/install-rancher-on-k8s/</a></p>



<p>After you have setup the rancher instance, the Hetzner fun begins. The expectation here is that you already are familiar with the Hetzner UI and where to find your API Token and all the features we are talking about. For this way of setting up Rancher and Clusters, we don’t need them to be in the same project. We are recommending one project per cluster you plan to spin up.</p>



<p>All instructions are written as of 12th January 2021 and user Rancher v2.5.</p>



<h2>Rancher Node Driver</h2>



<p>First of we need to give Rancher the ability to spin new nodes (Cloud Servers) up and down. For this we are going to use the <a href="https://github.com/JonasProgrammer/docker-machine-driver-hetzner">Hetzner Cloud Docker machine driver</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/mxschmitt/ui-driver-hetzner">custom UI plugin for Rancher</a>. <a href="https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/hcloud-install-rancher-single#step-4---setup-hetzner-cloud-node-driver">Set the Node Driver up in the Global Rancher View</a>, then go on to configure the first <a href="https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/user-settings/node-templates/">node templates</a> in your user profile. Here you need a API token from the project you want the cluster to be in.</p>



<p>Create a private network in the Hetzner Cloud UI and select it in the node template, but don’t select the private network to be used here in the UI, we will do that later.</p>



<p>We recommend one template for the Control Plane and etcd Servers with at least CX21 Servers and another template for the workers wich should realistically also at least be CX21. </p>



<p>Add a label to the worker node template which we will need later for the load balancer. We are using <code>mecodia.cloud/type=worker</code> but it doesn’t really matter. </p>



<p>Save the template and create your first cluster.</p>



<h2>Cluster Creation</h2>



<p>Create a cluster in Rancher. If you are using the cluster seriously start of with 3 management (Control Plane &amp; etcd) servers and 3 worker servers otherwise read up on the pros and cons of having less than 3 management servers.</p>



<p>Now we get to the juicy part of the cluster creation. In the form select cloud provider external and then change into the yaml edit view. Here we need to add some additional info for Rancher and RKE. We use the <code>addons</code> and <code>addones_include</code> directives to setup the <a href="https://github.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-cloud-controller-manager">Hetzner Cloud Controller Manager</a> after we have the nodes ready. </p>



<p>In theory we could also setup other <code>addons</code> here like cert-manager, but since <code>addons_include</code> are resolved and saved into etcd we can only save 1.5 MBytes of data, while cert-manager yamls alone consume 1.6 MBytes.</p>



<pre><code>rancher_kubernetes_engine_config:
  cloud_provider:
    name: external
  addons: |-
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: hcloud
      namespace: kube-system
    stringData:
      token: "API_TOKEN"
      network: "PRIVATE_NETWORK_ID"
  addons_include:
    - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mecodia/hetzner-rancher-cluster-base/main/hcloud-cloud-controller-manager.yaml
    - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mecodia/hetzner-rancher-cluster-base/main/hcloud-csi-driver.yaml</code></pre>



<p>You can find all files we use here and changed in our github repository: <a href="https://github.com/mecodia/hetzner-rancher-cluster-base">https://github.com/mecodia/hetzner-rancher-cluster-base</a></p>



<p>In difference to the yaml files provided by <a href="https://github.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-cloud-controller-manager">Hetzner Cloud Controller Manager</a> we use the <code>HCLOUD_NETWORK</code> environment variable which enabled the Cloud Controller to tell Kubernetes the internal IP of the Node without attaching the network, because we already did that on node setup or using it for inter pod communication, which we leave that up to our chosen network CNI plugin.</p>



<p>We also deploy the <a href="https://github.com/hetznercloud/csi-driver/">Hetzner CSI Driver</a> into our cluster as the default storage class for <code>PersistentVolumeStorage</code>. The difference to the original yaml is that we use the same secret for the Cloud Controller and the CSI Driver. With the CSI Driver installed we can make use of persistent volume claims in our statefullset deployments like databases or bucket storage.</p>



<p>After you are done, hit the create button at the bottom of the page and wait for the cluster to be ready. This will take a while (between 5 to 10 minutes) until the cluster is completely ready. In the meanwhile we can go back to the Hetzner Cloud UI and setup the Load Balancer.</p>



<h2>The Load Balancer</h2>



<p>To have access to our cluster we have to setup at least one load balancer. In the Hetzner Cloud UI create a new Load Balancer in the same project as the rest of the cluster. Select the same region as your servers and select the same private network. Create a new target by label and use the label you setup for your worker nodes in the node templates. Also select to use the private network.</p>

<p>Create two tcp services, one from and to port 80 (HTTP) and one from and to port 443 (HTTPS). In both cases activate the proxy protocol. Choose a algorithm and a name and hit the create button.</p>



<p>This way we have a single IP into our cluster while also having load balancing capabilities. SSL Termination happens on the ingress which allows us to run cert-manager and aquire LetsEncrypt Cerificates, but we loose the ability to have sticky sessions. You have to decide which tradeoff you want, but the setup works for 90% of cases.</p>



<h2>HTTPS Certificates for our Cluster wildcard certificates</h2>



<p>Speaking of HTTPS Certificates, we check if our cluster already is in a ready state and has finished setting up. If the cluster is ready we can install <a href="https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/">cert-manager</a> through one of the documented ways. After that we install the <a href="https://github.com/mecodia/cert-manager-webhook-hetzner">cert-manager-webhook-hetzner</a> in the same namespace. This is highly important and will possibly break the webhook if not done correctly.</p>



<p>After we have finished this setup we can setup our ClusterIssuers with Hetzner DNS for wildcard certificates or just simple certificates.</p>



<pre><code>apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1alpha3
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-production
spec:
  acme:
    email: YOU_MAIL_HERE
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    privateKeySecretRef:
      # Secret resource used to store the account's private key.
      name: acme-production-issuer-account-key
    solvers:
      - http01:
          ingress:
            class: nginx
      - dns01:
          webhook:
            groupName: dns.hetzner.cloud
            solverName: hetzner
            config:
              APIKey: HETZNER_DNS_API_TOKEN
---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1alpha3
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: selfsign
spec:
  selfSigned: {}
</code></pre>



<p>We also add a selfsigned certificate ClusterIssuer into the mix we can use to generate certificates for other internal services like Databases and others.</p>



<p>Now you can generate Certificates for <code>Ingress</code> resources and validate those either via <code>dns01</code> or <code>http01</code> challenges by using the annotations:</p>



<pre><code>annotations:
  cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-production</code></pre>



<h2>Wrapping up</h2>



<p>Now our basic Hetzner cluster setup is done and tightly integrated with all Hetzner services we want to use:</p>



<p><strong>Servers</strong> are deployed by Rancher with the docker-machine driver.</p>



<p><strong>Volumes</strong> are provisioned and managed by the CSI Driver</p>



<p>All our cluster internal traffic is routed through our <strong>private network</strong></p>



<p>The<strong> Load Balancer </strong>is the (web) entrance to our (auto-scaling) cluster and can also be used in ingress deployment by using <code>type: LoadBalancer</code></p>



<p>We provision LetsEncrypt Certificates to our ingresses with the help of the <strong>Hetzner DNS API</strong>.</p>



<p>There are some caveats to this setup, as the LoadBalancer deployed as ingress is not yet as finely tuned as other clouds load balancers and will just target all servers. The private network is only used for node communication with an overlay network for pod communication. Other than that, we are pretty happy with the setup and will probably have more than one cluster running with that setup.</p>

<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>We are experiencing some of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/days-with-most-us-catastrophe-deaths-16-this-year-2020-12" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>deadliest days</span></a> in American history, but the magnitude of the ongoing disaster defies human comprehension. As the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths climbed during 2020 and reached new heights in 2021, search volumes for Covid-related terms, specifically “cases” and “deaths,” have not followed suit. One might think that concern about the pandemic, measured through these metrics, would closely follow the severity of the disease. Instead, we are seeing just the opposite: people’s interest has, if anything, declined as the disease has intensified. Why is this and how might it be affecting our response to the pandemic?</p>
<!--more-->
<div><p>As the U.S. trudges through the deadliest period of the pandemic so far, The Factual set out to explore why Americans seemingly care less and less about a disease that is killing thousands prematurely every day. We reviewed 31 articles from 26 sources across the political spectrum to examine human responses to immense suffering and why American’s may be numb to the ongoing impacts of Covid-19.</p></div>

<p>These circles represent some of the deadliest days (from a single cause) in the last 100 years.</p>
<h4><strong><br>Declining Searches for “Cases” and “Deaths”</strong></h4>
<p>More than 370,000 Americans have died from Covid-19, with the daily death toll at its highest yet in recent days. On January 7 alone, 4,112 Americans died. That’s the equivalent of nearly 30 standard 737s crashing in a single day, each <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/09/why-minds-brains-cannot-make-sense-coronavirus-enormous-death-toll/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>loaded with 138 people</span></a>. It’s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/days-with-most-us-catastrophe-deaths-16-this-year-2020-12" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>more American deaths</span></a> than from D-Day in 1944 and more than from the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. No matter how we split up and conceptualize these numbers — a tactic journalists use to make impacts <a href="https://grist.org/climate/psychic-numbing-why-rising-covid-and-climate-change-death-tolls-no-longer-shock-us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>more tangible</span></a> — we fail to capture each of the individuals that these statistics include.</p>
<p>As thousands die, Americans are seemingly paying less attention. According to Google’s tracking mechanism for online searches, Google Trends, interest in “cases” and “deaths” <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=cases,deaths" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>peaked</span></a> the week of March 22, when cases were <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_totalandratecases" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>rapidly surpassing</span></a> the 100,000 mark but fewer than 50 Americans had died. (The search terms are closely linked, but not exclusive, to the Covid-19 pandemic.) Smaller peaks appear the week of June 21 and, to a lesser degree, in the weeks prior to Thanksgiving — times when warnings were abound about an impending spike in cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But in the subsequent peaks in Covid-19 deaths, and now, with more than 2,000 deaths every day for the last month, searches for these terms have failed to match the severity of the disease (note, however, that searches for “covid” generally have been consistent with trends in severity). For example, searches for "cases" and "deaths" are now at roughly a quarter of their March and April 2020 peaks, even as 10 times as many cases appear every day and twice as many people die.&nbsp;</p>
<div><p>This counterintuitive divergence seems to be explained by a combination of psychological, political, and demographic factors. However, at the very least, our inability to comprehend such widespread death continues to undermine our pandemic response.</p></div>

<div><p>Note: Searches are measured on a scale of 1 to 100 from January 12, 2020 to January 9, 2021. 100 represents the highest number of searches in a given week over the time period.<br>Source: <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2020-01-12%202021-01-09&amp;geo=US&amp;q=cases,deaths" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Google Trends</span></a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus/country/united-states?country=~USA" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Our World in Data</span></a></p></div>
<h4><strong>Psychological Factors</strong></h4>
<p>The most common explanations have to do with human psychology and the way we think about problems. For starters, humans have a hard time <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200630-what-makes-people-stop-caring" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>comprehending large numbers</span></a> and tend to downplay risk even as the numbers, and risk, increase exponentially. This inability to appreciate larger numbers plays out through “psychic numbing,” a phenomena which suggests that humans are far more impacted and attuned to first instances of danger but grow <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/12/21/covid-why-we-ignore-deaths/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">less worried</a> as the numbers increase and the threat is prolonged. For example, the difference between no one dying and one person dying is quite large, but the difference between the 100th and 101st death is far less impactful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As evidence, scientists have shown that focusing on individuals and personal suffering, rather than large numbers, is much more effective at attracting interest and attention. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/12/21/covid-why-we-ignore-deaths/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Popularly cited examples</span></a> come from experiments like those conducted by Paul Slovic, a professor at the University of Oregon, who identified that people are far more likely to donate to help a single starving child than to help successively larger groups of children. Human behavior is prone to connect to individuals and circumstances where we feel we can have an impact. Increasing the number of people dilutes our ability to connect and our perceived ability to make a difference. This effect can be seen elsewhere, such as with <a href="https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2020/08/why-dont-dead-matter/167840/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>wars</span></a> and genocides. Slovic’s work, for one, <a href="https://grist.org/climate/psychic-numbing-why-rising-covid-and-climate-change-death-tolls-no-longer-shock-us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>demonstrates</span></a> that in the aftermath of the 1994 Rwandan genocide “subjects were less willing to send the same amount of aid to a refugee camp of 250,000 than they were to a refugee camp of 11,000.” This mechanism helps to explain how each additional Covid case or death does not equate to an attendant increase in risk or concern, and may even give way to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200630-what-makes-people-stop-caring" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>complacency</span></a>.</p>
<div><p>Furthermore, humans are far more attuned to immediate and recognizable risk, such as an armed assailant or an acute natural disaster. It is far more difficult to comprehend the true magnitude of a complex web of <a href="https://grist.org/climate/psychic-numbing-why-rising-covid-and-climate-change-death-tolls-no-longer-shock-us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>seemingly low-risk events</span></a>, be it from a virus with a low mortality rate or from the incremental unseen changes of climate change. Both have effects that are spread over time and hard to capture in any single, concise event. This obscures the connection between human behavior and any positive or negative ramifications. Furthermore, as the symptoms repeat with increasing frequency — be it the 312,672nd death or yet another warmest year on record&nbsp;— each additional iteration tends to make less of an impact. As Melissa Funicane, a social scientist at the Rand Corporation, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200630-what-makes-people-stop-caring" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>put it</span></a>: “the average human who’s not a statistical analyst or epidemiologist, doesn’t have the tools you need at their fingertips to make judgements about something as vast and complex as the global pandemic.”</p></div>
<h4><strong>Political Factors</strong></h4>
<p>Another clear potential reason comes from the spurious narrative that many of these deaths are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-94-percent-covid-among-caus/fact-check-94-of-individuals-with-additional-causes-of-death-still-had-covid-19-idUSKBN25U2IO" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>not actually due to Covid-19</span></a>. A popular conspiracy even goes so far as to suggest that medical authorities are attributing deaths from a range of causes to Covid-19 in an effort to make the crisis more dire, spread fear, and permit stronger government action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These narratives have been <a href="https://undark.org/2020/11/10/covid-19-death-counts-conspiracy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>repeatedly</span></a> and <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2020/10/trump-baselessly-suggests-covid-19-deaths-inflated-for-profit/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>soundly</span></a> <a href="https://reason.com/2020/08/30/trump-promotes-the-outlandish-claim-that-covid-19-has-killed-a-minuscule-number-of-americans/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>rejected</span></a>, and many suspect the true toll to be <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/01/03/trump-claims-covid-deaths-are-exaggerated-as-us-surpasses-350000/?sh=10965bbc37b6" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>even higher</span></a> than the official figures. But whether or not people fully ascribe to the idea that deaths have been over-reported, it has played into doubt around the seriousness of the disease and whether official tallies and government warnings about its seriousness should be trusted. Arguments against the severity of Covid-19, such as that it is little different from the common flu, drive down concern about the virus, especially in more conservative populations. In December, Pew Research <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/12/03/intent-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine-rises-to-60-as-confidence-in-research-and-development-process-increases/#republicans-and-democrats-differ-over-outbreaks-threat-to-public-health" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>found</span></a> that just 43% of Republicans see Covid-19 as a major threat to public health, compared to 84% of Democrats. Though there is fixation on Covid-19’s low mortality rate, now <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/mortality-risk-covid?country=~USA" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>just below 2%</span></a> in the U.S., there is a larger failure to recognize the scope of human suffering that mortality rate delivers across millions of cases, let alone from the <a href="https://www.vox.com/22166236/long-term-side-effects-covid-19-symptoms-heart-fatigue" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>10% (or more) of patients</span></a> who exhibit <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-problem-of-long-haul-covid/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>long-term effects</span></a>. The severity of the disease, it seems, often fails to resonate until people are <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/12/12/coronavirus-deaths-highest-us-rural-republican-leaning-county/3828902001/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>personally, and often irreversibly</span></a>, affected, a dynamic that is <a href="https://grist.org/climate/psychic-numbing-why-rising-covid-and-climate-change-death-tolls-no-longer-shock-us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>not restricted</span></a> to the U.S. or the issue Covid-19.</p>
<div><p>In hyper-partisan conditions, it is no surprise that as the disease became politicized, certain populations may have begun to pay less attention. If one doesn’t believe that it is as deadly or widespread as is being reported, there’s little reason to monitor its progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div>
<h4><strong>Demographic Factors</strong></h4>
<p>A final set of potential factors relates to specific populations that society consistently undervalues. These populations have <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-viz-covid-19-deaths-in-illinois-20210101-etvvpateifbzbbjkf33maqdqme-htmlstory.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>suffered the worst impacts</span></a> but are also those most commonly pushed out of sight, be it the elderly locked away in nursing homes or minority groups relegated to impoverished and underserved communities.</p>
<p>For example, Covid-19’s impacts are particularly acute on the elderly, who account for <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/who-is-dying-from-covid-19-why-11601407258" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>roughly 8 in 10</span></a> of those who die. In a range of experiments, scientists have shown globally that people consistently <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/covid-death-toll-us-empathy-elderly/616379/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>undervalue the elderly</span></a> vis-à-vis others, generally falling back on the explanation that those with fewer years left to live are less valuable than those with many more productive years ahead. Even if each of these individuals may be a deeply loved parent, sibling, friend, or mentor, this implicit devaluation plays into an interpretation that the disease is one that specifically impacts the elderly and is therefore less of a concern.</p>
<div><p>The virus has had a similarly outsized impact on <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/12/14/946045921/how-do-we-grieve-300-000-lives-lost" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>minority communities</span></a>. Data suggests, for example, that Black, Latino, and Indigenous Americans are several times more likely than white Americans to both be hospitalized and die from Covid-19. In LA, the site of the country’s worst outbreak, Latinos <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article247434155.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>account for</span></a> 59% of cases and 48.5% of deaths, even though they only account for 40% of the population. Individuals from these communities make up many of the essential workers who continue to work in <a href="https://theconversation.com/black-and-latino-essential-workers-experience-greater-safety-concerns-than-their-white-counterparts-141180" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>dangerous conditions</span></a> and typically have less of a safety net to fall back on. In a country that has consistently underserved minority communities, especially in <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/09/23/914427907/as-pandemic-deaths-add-up-racial-disparities-persist-and-in-some-cases-worsen" rel="noopener" target="_blank">matters of public health</a>, it’s no wonder that these communities <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/covid-death-toll-us-empathy-elderly/616379/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>suffer disproportionately</span></a> and that the country as a whole — which is roughly 70% white — may be less attuned to the severity of the problem.</p></div>

<h4><strong>American Deaths Will Continue to Go Unseen</strong></h4>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>I was 12 years old when I first heard about SQL triggers. My brother, Jonathan, had just begun his software career at a startup. Jonathan came home one day frustrated by a database full of convoluted SQL triggers.</p><p>With my only programming experience being recreating my favorite video game in VB6, I had little consolation to offer.</p><p>Fast forward 16 years, and now I can see from my brother’s perspective. In the world of open source start-up style full-stack development (think Django, Rails, Javascript, PHP, MySQL, Postgres..), ORMs are very popular and features like SQL triggers are far less conventional.</p><p>But there is still value with SQL triggers. During my time working on custom ERP-like software, SQL triggers were an invaluable tool. When building highly data oriented software, especially when the data is of financial nature and accuracy is of high demand, you're more likely to see data being manipulated at a lower level, in a more direct way.</p><p>This article contains all the information I wish I could have shared with my brother on how to effectively use SQL triggers.</p><h3 id="table-of-contents">Table of contents</h3><ul><li><a href="#what-is-a-sql-trigger">What is a SQL Trigger?</a></li><li><a href="#how-to-create-a-sql-trigger-postgres-syntax">How to Create a SQL Trigger - Syntax</a></li><li><a href="#postgres-trigger-example-1-creating-a-time-clock">Postgres Trigger Example 1: Creating a Time Clock</a></li><li><a href="#postgres-trigger-example-2-creating-an-audit-table">Postgres Trigger Example 2: Creating an Audit Table</a></li><li><a href="#additional-considerations-for-triggers">Additional Considerations for Triggers</a></li></ul><h2 id="what-is-a-sql-trigger">What is a SQL Trigger?</h2><p>SQL Triggers, also called Database Triggers, allow you to tell your SQL engine (for these examples, Postgres) to run a piece of code when an event happens, or even before the event.</p><p>In Postgres, you delineate the code to run by creating a function whose return type is <code>trigger</code>. In some other engines like MySQL, the code block is a part of and inside the trigger.</p><p>Before I discuss what the different event types are and the specific syntax for creating a trigger, why would you want to use a database trigger? </p><h3 id="advantages-of-using-sql-triggers">Advantages of using SQL Triggers</h3><h5 id="maintaining-data-integrity">Maintaining data integrity</h5><p>Database triggers have a variety of uses and are an excellent tool to marshal strict data integrity. Alternate solutions like Django's model hooks may fail if you have other application servers or users accessing the database who aren't aware of the specific business logic coded in your application.</p><h5 id="separating-business-logic">Separating business logic</h5><p>Coding critical business logic within the application code also presents problems when the business logic is updated. If you had a business requirement to multiply an incoming number by 10, and you wanted to revise this logic to multiply the number by 20, changing the logic in SQL would guarantee that every piece of data from that exact deploy time on would be affected by the new logic.</p><p>The SQL server acts as a single point of truth. If the logic is implemented on multiple application servers, you can no longer expect a clean, definitive change in behavior.</p><h5 id="atomic-transactions">Atomic transactions</h5><p>Natural atomicity is another desirable feature bundled with triggers.

Here are some examples of different events that can activate a trigger:</p><ul><li>Changing data: <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, <code>DELETE</code></li></ul><p>A database trigger can also list more than one of these events.</p><p>If <code>UPDATE</code> was one of the listed events, you can pass in a list of columns that should activate the trigger. If you don't include this list, updating any column will activate it.</p><h3 id="trigger-before-or-after">Trigger <code>BEFORE</code> or <code>AFTER</code></h3><p>A trigger can run either <code>BEFORE</code> or <code>AFTER</code> an event.</p><p>If you want to block an event like an <code>INSERT</code>, you will want to run <code>BEFORE</code>. If you need to be sure the event actually is going to occur, <code>AFTER</code> is ideal.</p><h3 id="effect-of-the-trigger">Effect of the trigger</h3><p>A trigger can run either per row, or per statement. Let's say you run a single <code>UPDATE</code> statement that changes 5 rows in a table. </p><p>If you specify <code>FOR EACH ROW</code> in the trigger, then the trigger will run 5 times. If you specified <code>FOR EACH STATEMENT</code>, then it would only run once.</p><p>And of course we can't forget the actual code to run when the trigger is activated. In Postgres, is placed in a function and separated from the trigger. Separating the trigger from the code it runs creates cleaner code and allows multiple triggers to execute the same code.</p><h2 id="postgres-trigger-example-1-creating-a-time-clock">Postgres Trigger Example #1: Creating a Time Clock</h2><p>A time clock records when an employee comes and leaves from work and calculates his/her total hours worked.

  username varchar
);

create table time_punch (

join time_punch tp2
on tp2.id = (
	select tps.id
	from time_punch tps
	where tps.id &lt; tp1.id

where tp1.employee_id = 1
and tp1.is_out_punch</code></pre><pre><code>time_worked
-------------
 01:30:00
(1 row)</code></pre><p>In this query I select all the out punches, then I join them to the closest preceding "in" punch. Subtract the timestamps, and we get how many hours Bear worked for each shift! </p><p>One of the issues with this schema is that it is possible for you to insert several "in" or "out" punches in a row. With the query we’ve created, this would introduce ambiguities that could lead to inaccurate calculations and employees getting paid more or less than they should.</p><h3 id="sql-insert-before-trigger-example-preserving-data-integrity">SQL <code>INSERT BEFORE</code> trigger example - preserving data integrity</h3><p>We need something to prevent the in/out pattern from being interrupted. Unfortunately check constraints only look at the row being inserted or updated and cannot factor in data from other rows.</p><p>This is a perfect situation to use a database trigger!</p><p>Let's create a trigger to prevent an <code>INSERT</code> event that would break our pattern. First we'll create the "trigger function". This function is what the trigger will execute when the event type is detected. </p><p>A trigger function is created like a regular Postgres function, except that it returns a <code>trigger</code>.</p><pre><code>create or replace function fn_check_time_punch() returns trigger as $psql$
  begin
    if new.is_out_punch = (
      select tps.is_out_punch
      from time_punch tps
      where tps.employee_id = new.employee_id
      order by tps.id desc limit 1
    ) then
      return null;
    end if;
    return new;
  end;
$psql$ language plpgsql;
</code></pre><p>The <code>new</code> keyword represents the values of the row that is to be inserted. It also is the object you can return to allow the insert to continue. Alternatively, when <code>null</code> is returned this stops the insertion.</p><p>This query finds the <code>time_punch</code> before and ensures its in/out value is not the same as what's being inserted. If the values are the same, then the trigger returns <code>null</code> and the time_punch is not recorded. Otherwise, the trigger returns <code>new</code> and the <code>insert</code> statement is allowed to continue.</p><p>Now we'll link the function as a trigger to the <code>time_punch</code> table. <code>BEFORE</code> is crucial here. If we ran this trigger as an <code>AFTER</code> trigger it would run too late to stop the insertion.</p><pre><code>create trigger check_time_punch before insert on time_punch for each row execute procedure fn_check_time_punch();
</code></pre><p>Let's try to insert another "out" punch:</p><pre><code>insert into time_punch (employee_id, is_out_punch, punch_time)
values
(1, true, '2020-01-01 13:00:00');</code></pre><pre><code>Output:
INSERT 0 0</code></pre><p>We can see from the output that the trigger prevented the insertion of two subsequent out punches for the same employee.</p><p>It is also possible to raise an exception from the trigger so that your application (or person running the SQL query) receives a failure notice instead of the insert count simply being 0.</p><h2 id="postgres-trigger-example-2-creating-an-audit-table">Postgres Trigger Example #2: Creating an Audit Table</h2><p>Accurately storing employee punch data is critical for businesses.

<p>I recently mass refactored our production codebase at work. And I did so without the fear of breaking things. It was a full-stack refactor, and I did changes to our apps, test code and DevOps code. After finishing the mass refactor, I did zero manual testing. So, how did I do this? With the help of automated testing like this, of course:</p>

I will talk more about the product that I worked on more in a moment. I will also explain the tools and technologies that helped me in the process of mass refactoring.</p>

<h2 id="what-did-i-do">What Did I Do?</h2>
<p>I have refactored our large production codebase over the span of four months. I did this refactor module by module and product by product. I have probably touched our entire tech stack during this (hence the importance of being a full-stack engineer!). I made changes to our clients (mobile and desktop) in their UI and core code. I adapted our tests code to the changes that I’ve done to the product. I have also changed our DevOps code extensively, to accommodate the changes I’ve done to the product and test code. Following animation is from my method chaining article, which was partly inspired by the changes that I did to our test framework. If you want to check out the full article, it is in the resources section above.</p>

<video width="790" height="300" controls=""><source src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/media/method_chaining.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<p>Changes were mostly technical (i.e. swap one JSON library with another, adapt the code to new UI libs, use method chaining in test code etc.) so correctness of the changes from product management perspective was not entirely relevant. However, verifying that functionality remained the same, and everything continued to work in production as-is was #1 priority. Further code level changes that I’ve done is not the point of this article so I won’t dig deeper. I did most of my refactors using IntelliJ IDEA, which supports all the programming languages we use and has enormous refactoring capabilities. We also have a ton of static code analyzers, linters, and code reformatters built into our continuous-integration process, which was also very helpful in detecting defects at code level early on. Finally, our code peer-review process using pull-requests has the most important code quality assurance factor.</p>

<p>After I was done with the refactors, I made zero manual testing on our products. Neither did I have any fear of breaking things during this mass refactor. And oh boy, did break things! So why was I not fearful of breaking things? Because I knew that I could identify and fix what I broke during the refactoring process. I will talk more about our quality assurance tech in a moment.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-our-product">What is Our Product?</h2>
<p>Our product is a large enterprise VPN software. It has been under development by a large team for the last 5+ years, so it has a considerably complex codebase. It has key hardware integrations, so reliability is quite important. When you integrate software and hardware features, you get a large surface area for bugs. Testing the hardware integrations is incredibly daunting since you need to get the hardware in test to the right state to test things correctly every time. In addition, we have clients for all major desktop and mobile OSes, and a vast DevOps infrastructure to automate the assembly of these clients. I want to leave a bit of mystery here, as I will write a separate article on what I do in my day-to-day work.</p>

<h2 id="why-was-i-so-confident">Why Was I So Confident?</h2>
<p>As a senior engineer, it is my duty to initiate and take on riskier projects. When done right, a large refactor and a refresh of the codebase can make working with the products a joy again. While initiating this mass refactor project, I was fully confident that I would not end up destroying our products, as I knew that a considerable number of automated end-to-end tests that I implemented over long years got my back. Also, I have recently created a mobile device farm, extending our end-to-end testing coverage to mobile devices. As you can see in the following photo, I have Android devices on the left and iOS devices on the right, and a MacBook as the host. All the connected devices are controller by the host machine:</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/how-i-mass-refactored-our-production-codebase-without-fear/media/device_farm.jpg" alt="My Device Farm Implementation"></p>

<p>Mass end-to-end testing like this, also known as acceptance testing, makes mass refactoring a less worrisome task. However, you still have to trigger tests every time you complete a part of your refactor and make sure to fix any broken tests or features. Depending on the test suite size and availability of automation hardware, this might take days. Of course, to verify the full correctness of my refactors, I had the run the entire test suite, and not just the end-to-end tests. Our unit and integration test coverage is also solid and they run on our CI servers as a part of our build process. Especially having integration tests that verify our software design decisions were invaluable, including our API endpoints and other 3rd party software integrations. Especially when dealing with our software’s modules written in scripting languages (JavaScript, Python, etc.), our unit tests came in quite handy. I depend on those unit tests to verify that I broke none of the expected input/output types, as the compiler cannot do it for me in a dynamic programming languages</p>

<p>Before going into device farms, let me briefly mention automated testing.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-automated-testing">What is Automated Testing?</h2>
<p>In summary, automated testing has three main parts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Unit testing. Unit testing tests the smallest sections of your code, which is mostly going to be your functions. You can even have multiple tests per function based on the behavior of your functions. And there are some great frameworks for it like NUnit, JUnit, Mocha, etc. which will help you organize your tests better.</li>
  <li>Integration testing. As the name suggests, integration testing tests the integration of your software components. For instance, one integration test can test the integration of multiple functions, classes, or even modules. You can use the same unit testing frameworks that I mentioned above for integration testing too.</li>
  <li>End-to-end (acceptance) testing. This is the endgame. End-to-end testing is where you test your product just like an end-user would do. You simulate real user interactions with your product using end-to-end testing frameworks like Selenium, Appium, etc. More on this in the next section.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have a complete video on software quality assurance where I describe how software companies test their products, starting with unit tests and going all the way to end-to-end (acceptance) testing level. If you want to see it, link to it is in the resources section above.</p>

<h2 id="device-farms-and-test-labs">Device Farms and Test Labs</h2>
<p>Now comes the fun part. This is where you get to play with your products on real devices. Of course, you don’t want to play with the devices indefinitely; you want to automate that process. For my device farm implementation for our products, I used Appium, which uses Selenium’s WebDriver protocol for all clients. Appium can control both web apps and native apps. It can even control hybrid web UI + native core apps (i.e. Electron apps). A single Appium server instance running in a host machine can control all the connected devices, and the apps and browsers installed on those devices:</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/how-i-mass-refactored-our-production-codebase-without-fear/media/appium_architecture_diagram.png" alt="Appium Architecture Diagram"></p>

<p>In my implementation, I connected all our mobile devices to a single host machine via a USB hub, and the host machine is controller by Appium:</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/how-i-mass-refactored-our-production-codebase-without-fear/media/device_farm_usb_hub.jpg" alt="Device Farm With USB Hub"></p>

<p>Now let’s watch my device farm implementation in live-action in our office:</p>

<video width="790" height="300" controls=""><source src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/media/device_farm.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<p>As you can see, I have both Android and iOS devices connected to a single MacBook. Everything except for one power-hungry tablet is going through the USB hub. It is a little messy, but it has been working great. When someone triggers an automated test run, one of the devices is selected at random for the given platform. Then the entire test suit runs on that device, and the test results are collected. There is quite a bit of room for improvement, but this, along with our similar setup for desktop clients, enabled me to make extensive changes to our sensitive production codebase with confidence.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize that automated testing on real devices is substantially better than manual testing in the long run. You will save a ton of time via automation like this, and you can keep expending your testing coverage for your optimum quality assurance needs. You really don’t need to take the route that I took and implement all these yourself. You can utilize ready-to-use device farms provided by Google Firebase Test Lab, Amazon Device Farm, etc.:</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/how-i-mass-refactored-our-production-codebase-without-fear/media/firebase_test_lab.png" alt="Firebase Test Lab"></p>

<p>However, if you choose to implement your own device farm, remember that a lot of the publicly available device farms were born from internal implementations as I did. So you can always provide parts of your infrastructure as a service if you ever decide to go IaaS/SaaS route.</p>

<p>As a bonus in my implementation, people can RDP into the main test machine and control the phones remotely for manual testing when needed. Also, there are …</p></section></div></div>

<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>This project is a favorite of mine and so I wanted to share a glimpse of what we've been up to with <a href="https://openai.com/" rel="noopener">OpenAI's amazing GPT-3 language model</a>. Today I'll be sharing a couple of straightforward results with basic prompts only. There are more advanced avenues we're exploring for our use of GPT-3, such as fine-tuning (custom pre-training for specific datasets); you'll hear none of that today, but if you're interested in this topic, follow this blog for updates.</p>
<!--more-->

<h2>Our goal</h2>
<p>I believe the future of monitoring has to include autonomous root cause tools. Deployment frequency and complexity make the "new" issue the driver of Mean-Time-To-Resolve (MTTR) today. You may always know when something breaks, but you won't always know what. Problem is, root cause often hides in log files... but since the volume of logs has grown enormous and it's not always clear what to search for when a new issue arises, we saw a need for a smarter tool to help with root cause.</p>

<h2>Our approach in a nutshell</h2>
<p>If you structure logs really well (we do this with machine learning), including free-text logs, even when there are only one or two examples for a given event type, you can start talking confidently about a "rare" event. Severity lets you talk about a "bad" event. So, you can imagine one log stream expressing a "rare" event, and then another log stream expressing an event that is both "rare" and "bad". A simple point process model lets us talk naively about how likely it is that such a pair of events should show up as close together in time or closer, given patterns of "rare" and "rare"+"bad" events in those two streams. Watching the data for a while will let you estimate parameters for this model, and you can start picking out bouts of such event pairs. Zebrium takes such a bout, and generates an incident report from it. The results we are seeing…</p>

<h2>The plain language challenge</h2>
<p>Our approach works really well at generating root cause reports: if there's a root cause indicator in the logs, it will almost always make its way into a concise root cause report. Our approach has proven robust to different kinds of applications and logs; it requires no training or rules, pre-built or otherwise.</p>

<p>However, there's a big challenge remaining here. The last mile of delivering the benefits of autonomous Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is translating even the concise reports we generate into something the user can understand. The user who needs the quick RCA is not always the person who can understand the oblique root cause indicators in a technical log file. Who is to consume these reports, and what composes them?</p>

<p>This challenge is even more stark for an Managed Service Provider (MSP) or enterprise. At a small company, engineers may be responsible for front-line triage. At a large company or MSP, there will be a front-line, typically junior person who needs a quick RCA; they can't be expected to know all the different intricacies of application logs and what those logs mean. To bring value over the last mile to them, we need plain-language.</p>

<h2>Enter GPT-3</h2>
<p>Now that I've set the stage, let me show you a couple of examples that I think make it clear how transformational GPT-3 can be in the context of our problem. I think you'll agree with me that autonomous RCA seems a lot more real when it's translated into plain-language, and surely a lot more accessible by a lot of users.</p>

<p>GPT-3 is a state-of-the-art bidirectional autoregressive transformer model, with parameters in the hundreds of billions. It is produced, trained, and maintained by OpenAI, and it has really brought start-of-the art, deep NLP to developers’ fingertips.</p>

<p>The most basic procedure for using GPT-3 looks like this -</p>

<p>1) Construct a “prompt” for the model – this is a sort of open-ended document that leaves the model to “continue the story”, as it were; the continuation or response is called a “completion”. For the below two-line examples, I used the following simple prompt construction:</p>

<p>An expert examined the logs for the incident.</p>
<p>The first log message was: &lt;first_line_goes_here&gt;</p>
<p>The last log message was: &lt;second_line_goes_here&gt;</p>
<p>The expert described what had happened, in plain English:</p>

<p>2) Select model (I used davinci) and parameters - for the below examples, I used the following parameters to the davinci GPT-3 model:</p>

<p>{</p>
<p>"max_tokens": 128,</p>
<p>"temperature": 1,</p>
<p>"top_p": 0.05,</p>
<p>"presence_penalty": 0.3,</p>
<p>"frequency_penalty": 0.3,</p>
<p>"best_of": 10</p>
<p>}</p>

<p>3) Call the API; post-process completion for dangling or repeated phrases, to-taste. Serve warm.</p>

<h2>Example one: Database shutdown</h2>
<p>We shut down the Postgres database backing our Atlassian stack. Thousands of events, largely errors, ensued in the logs. Zebrium dutifully generates a root cause report, based on an ML-driven auto-detection. The report looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=1039&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png" alt="postgres incident" width="1039" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=520&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 520w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=1039&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 1039w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=1559&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 1559w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=2078&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 2078w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=2598&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 2598w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=3117&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 3117w" sizes="(max-width: 1039px) 100vw, 1039px"></p>

<p>As you can see, Zebrium pulled about a dozen log events into the report; the first 9 are shown in the image. You’ll notice that the first event is colored green and the last event purple; these are the “FIRST” and the “WORST”, and we use these to characterize the incident in the incidents list. Here’s what that looks like:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=1039&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png" alt="postgres incident summary" width="1039" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=520&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 520w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=1039&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 1039w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=1559&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 1559w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=2078&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 2078w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=2598&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 2598w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=3117&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 3117w" sizes="(max-width: 1039px) 100vw, 1039px"></p>

<p>OK, so Zebrium did a pretty good job here. It autonomously picked these two log events out of thousands to display to the user on the list page. Often, the “FIRST” event reflects root cause and the “WORST” reflects follow-on problems; you’ll note here that the first is not even an error, but it’s rare, and happens too close to other incident events, according to our model, to be a coincidence.</p>

<p>Now in this case, it’s pretty clear to someone who has looked at a log file before that the database was shut down by the administrator. You’ll also notice, though, above the log events, a field called “DESCRIPTION”: this was generated by GPT-3. It says:</p>

<p>“The database server was stopped by the administrator.”</p>

<h2>Why this summary is also amazing</h2>
<p>We passed in the “FIRST” and “WORST” events, as described above, to GPT-3. Notice that the first line says that the “PostgreSQL RDBMS” was “Stopped”. The second line says that there was a “PSQLException” indicating that a connection was “terminating due to administrator command”.</p>

<p>The word “administrator” appears on a different line than the word “PostgreSQL”, and nowhere in the log messages are the words “database” or “server” to be found at all.</p>

<p>The algorithm is doing the following:</p>

<p>1.) Inferring that the statements on the two lines are related</p>
<p>2.) Inferring that they are both speaking about a “database server”</p>
<p>3.) Putting the two statements together: “stopped by the administrator”</p>

<p>Essentially, this is the sort of summary someone would put into a ticketing system; here, it’s being done automatically, thanks to an appropriately selected pair of log messages coupled with a language model.</p>

<h2><span>Example two: Out of memory</span><span></span></h2>
<p>In this case, and using the same parameters as were used in the previous example, we take a root cause report for what turns out to be an out-of-memory issue to GPT-3 and see what sort of summary it gives us.</p>

<p>This particular report was generated in response to a signal from a monitoring tool that saw endpoint latencies spike too high. The system was configured with Zebrium to provide root cause observability across the stack. Here is the report Zebrium ML generated:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=1039&amp;name=oom_incident.png" alt="oom_incident" width="1039" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=520&amp;name=oom_incident.png 520w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=1039&amp;name=oom_incident.png 1039w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=1559&amp;name=oom_incident.png 1559w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=2078&amp;name=oom_incident.png 2078w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=2598&amp;name=oom_incident.png 2598w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=3117&amp;name=oom_incident.png 3117w" sizes="(max-width: 1039px) 100vw, 1039px"></p>

<p>As you can see, Zebrium pulled about a dozen log events into the report; the first 9 are shown in the image. You’ll notice that the first event is colored green and the last event purple; these are the “FIRST” and the “WORST”, and we use these to characterize the incident in the incidents list. Here’s what that looks like:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=908&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png" alt="oom_incident_summary" width="908" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=454&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 454w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=908&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 908w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=1362&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 1362w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=1816&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 1816w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=2270&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 2270w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=2724&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 2724w" sizes="(max-width: 908px) 100vw, 908px"></p>

<p>In this case, it’s not so clear that the problem is due to an out-of-memory issue, unless the reader is familiar with Linux and the OOM killer facility. There are a lot of technical parameters in these events as well, obscuring what was really at the heart of the problem.</p>

<p>Taking a look above the log messages again, in the “DESCRIPTION” field, let’s see what GPT-3 gave us:</p>

<p>“The memcached process was killed by the OOM killer</p>
<p>because it was consuming too much memory. The OOM killer</p>
<p>is a Linux kernel feature that allows the system to kill</p>
<p>a process when <strong><u>the system is running out of memory</u></strong>.”</p>

<h2>Why this summary is also amazing</h2>
<p>What this summary tells us explicitly in plain-language is that the system was running out of memory. This is in fact the root cause of the original incident, tallying up a successful root cause summary.</p>

<p>For an L1 or L2, the Zebrium root cause summary may not be enough. That person won’t necessarily know that OOM means out-of-memory, or that the “FIRST” message isn’t talking about an application issue entirely within memcached.</p>

<h2>What more I wanted here</h2>
<p>In the second example, I would have liked to have seen some recognition that the first line implies that the system was out-of-memory, and therefore the second line was due to related problems (in fact, the application server was paged out). It’s a lot to ask, but I think it might be possible, given some combination of more expressive prompts, finetuning, and presenting GPT-3 with other select data from the report (in this case, the report also included metrics anomalies showing a plunge in swap free).</p>

<h2><span>A cool direction</span></h2>
<p>You may have noticed that GPT-3 gave us a lot of extra detail about the Linux OOM killer than was mentioned in the log messages themselves. I believe it was able to provide this context in the same way it knew that PSQL referred to a database server: it was trained on the internet. There is likely enough information in the public domain that, as GPT-3 was being trained, it picked up enough cursory knowledge of these sorts of systems to add additional value.</p>

<p>To test my hypothesis, I spent some time fiddling quite unscientifically with the prompt and model parameters, trying to get it to expound on the OOM example as describe above. I also gave the model a much larger budget of response tokens. Eventually, I teased out this response:</p>

<p>The root cause of the …</p></span></p></div></div>

<p>ExaGear is a dynamic binary translation layer to run x86_32 and x86_64 applications on Arm 64-bit Linux systems.</p>



<p>You can download it <a href="https://mirrors.huaweicloud.com/kunpeng/archive/ExaGear/ExaGear_V100R002C00.tar.gz">here</a>. On an RPM-based distribution, just unpack the archive and install.</p>



<p>A CentOS 7 rootfs is shipped, you might want to install vte-profile afterwards.</p>



<h4>Hardware requirements</h4>



<p>A 64-bit Arm CPU with floating point and SIMD extensions. If it can run a conventional Linux distribution, it’ll be able to run this.</p>



<h4>Kernel requirements</h4>



<p>You’ll have to install the p64k variant for systems with a 64KB page size set up (which ships with the x86_64 -&gt; arm64 translator only, not the x86_32 to arm64 one). Some applications might not work on such a system.</p>



<p>You’ll also need a kernel with 48-bit VA space, 39-bit of VA space kernel configurations are not compatible with ExaGear.</p>



<h4>Memory model</h4>



<p>ExaGear does not follow TSO completely by default, using heuristics instead. This can be configured through /etc/exagear-x86_64.conf.</p>



<p>SMO_MODE=fbase is the default, with SMO_SEVERITY=smart. For full compliance, you can run those commands:</p>



<pre><code>sudo sed -i -e '/EXAGEAR_SMO_MODE="/s/fbase"/all"/' /etc/exagear-x86_32.conf
sudo sed -i -e '/EXAGEAR_SMO_MODE="/s/fbase"/all"/' /etc/exagear-x86_64.conf</code></pre>



<p>On Tegra K1 64-bit and Tegra Xavier, you’ll want to set SMO_MODE=none, as their CPU implements sequential consistency as the memory model. This setting provides a free performance boost with no downsides on that hardware.</p>



<h4>Performance</h4>



<p>For running your Docker containers or whatever on an Apple Silicon Mac too, this is a much faster solution than qemu-user.</p>



<p>Some performance numbers on Tegra Xavier: <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/compare/4206324?baseline=4206183">https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/compare/4206324?baseline=4206183</a>. (Geekbench arm64 Android compared to x86_64 Linux Geekbench results on the same hardware)</p>



<p>Because ExaGear doesn’t implement the AES instructions, the scores for those is an outlier. Apart from that case, the results are pretty good.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Data has gone from being a sparse resource to a commodity. Many companies try to collect as much data as possible, leading to questions about the best way to keep data.</p><p><strong>Data warehouses allow companies to keep their data in one, unified place. Data warehouses are capable of storing large amounts of data at an affordable rate.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Data warehousing has become an increasingly common tool in digital companies. But we already have databases capable of storing large amounts of data. So why are data warehouses such a big deal?&nbsp;</p><h3>The problem with datasets<br></h3><p>Before data warehouses became popular, datasets were stored in separate places. Some datasets were incompatible with other datasets and couldn’t be used for the same analysis. In other cases, datasets were owned by third-party providers, who offered only limited interaction with the data.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Why did this happen? Data originates from different places. For example, you may keep a database with all the information related to your product such as account credentials, profile information, product information, etc. But you also have a database for keeping track of the interaction users have with your product. On top of that, you could be gathering information on business-related topics such as financials, emails with leads, marketing clicks, and so on. At the moment of creation, one database seems to have no relation to another database.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Eventually, companies started to notice that interacting with each dataset individually was too clunky. Companies wanted the ability to maintain this information in one, unified place. This is exactly what data warehouses were created to do. When all your data is in one place and in the same format, you may synthesize data from various levels of organization and conduct a holistic analysis. Data warehouses have fundamentally changed the way companies gather and analyze data.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>How to leverage data warehouses?</h3><p>Once you have a data warehouse, there are two main avenues for analysis:</p><ul role="list"><li>Business Intelligence tools &amp; SQL queries</li><li>Automated Analytics &amp; Business Analysis tools</li></ul><p>‍</p><h4>Business Intelligence &amp; SQL queries</h4><p>In order to answer specific business questions with a data warehouse, you need to know SQL. SQL gives you the flexibility of querying the data in virtually any way but with the drawback of requiring coding skills.&nbsp;</p><p>Most popular Business Intelligence tools are <a href="https://chartio.com/">Chartio</a>, <a href="https://mode.com/">Mode</a>, <a href="https://looker.com/">Looker</a>, <a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a>, <a href="https://datastudio.google.com/">Google Data Studio</a>. At Lantern, we particularly like new players such as <a href="https://www.metabase.com/">Metabase</a> and <a href="https://popsql.com/">PopSQL</a>.<br></p><p>In order to let non-technical roles gain insight from data, companies traditionally rely on data analysts. However, as more and more roles need frequent access to company data, data analysts have become a bottleneck.</p><h4>Automated Analysis tools<br></h4><p>This increasing reliance on data insights by non-technical roles has created a space for a new breed of products: automated data analysis tools. <a href="https://www.lantern.so/">Lantern</a> is a part of this group. Data warehouses offer easy and structured access to all the data of the company, which is a perfect setup for automated tools to offer simple answers on specific topics.<br></p><p>Automated tools do not require SQL or a data analyst to answer your questions. This combination returns control to both technical or non-technical data consumers alike.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The category of automated analysis tools is relatively new and has been well-received by companies. Besides Lantern, which focuses on serving startup product teams, other automated analysis tools target various teams in larger enterprises such as <a href="https://www.anodot.com/">Anodot</a>, <a href="https://sisudata.com/">Sisu</a>, and <a href="https://outlier.ai/">Outlier</a>.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Warehouses have transformed the way modern companies use data. You can now afford to track all your data in the same place. This unlocks a whole new level of analysis, allowing you to put data together from various points or perform a more holistic analysis.<br></p><p>A key win enabled by data warehouses has been the emergence of a new breed: automated analysis tools, which pro-actively send you insights about changes in your data.<br></p><p>If you are interested in giving a try to such an automated analysis tool for user behavior and product usage, you can access Lantern's early access program <a href="https://www.lantern.so/">here</a>.<br></p></div></div><div><div><div><p>Subscribe to our newsletter</p><div><div><p>Thank you!

The woman then punches her mother in the face, leaving her bloodied.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The woman who threw the punch identified herself online as Ashanti. On GoFundMe, she said she was fired from her job and is facing criminal charges for defending herself from a group of Trump supporters who she says hurled racial slurs at her, and tried to steal her phone, keys and mask.</p>  <p>"I think the woman thought she was in danger, rightfully so, and reacted accordingly," Duke said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The online fundraiser garnered more than $75,000 US in donations as of Monday evening.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Duke identified her mother as Therese Duke, who, according to LinkedIn, was an employee at UMass Memorial Health Care in Worcester, Mass.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The health-care provider has since <a href="https://twitter.com/umassmemorial/status/1347664055121686528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1347664055121686528%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.boston.com%2Fnews%2Flocal-news-2%2F2021%2F01%2F10%2Ftherese-duke-umass-memorial-capitol-siege"><u>issued a statement on Twitter</u></a>, which reads: "Over the past 24 hours we have received numerous expressions of concern through social media regarding a UMass Memorial caregiver who may have been involved in this week's violent events at the nation's capitol.

And it was unsettling seeing how quickly she had changed to a radically right ideology," Duke said.</p>  <p>"The things that she was saying really didn't make sense. A lot of them were conspiracy theories, almost a delusional kind of mindset.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>This is the third annual release of my “<a href="https://summitroute.com/downloads/aws_security_maturity_roadmap-Summit_Route.pdf">AWS Security Maturity Roadmap</a>” to give companies a series or actionable steps to improve the security of their AWS environments. Each year I update this with the latest features of AWS, along with improvements based on my discussions with clients, other consultants, and more who have gone through some of these activities or encountered challenges, or have mentioned new ideas.  This includes companies of all sizes, risk tolerances, and integration (from lift and shift to completely serverless).</p>

<p>Changes include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Added that your root email addresses should be under your company domain and on email distribution lists as I’ve found many accounts during assessments that were associated with old aol.com emails and other personal accounts. This is how AWS communicates with you and is an important part of account recovery.</li>
  <li>Added <a href="https://summitroute.com/blog/2021/01/06/opting_out_of_aws_ai_data_usage/">opting out</a> of the AI services from sending your data outside of the regions you put it in.</li>
  <li>Added budget alarms to Stage 1. Although less likely to provide as much value for larger enterprises, these are very important for individuals and small businesses. Also mentioned <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws-cost-management/preview-anomaly-detection-and-alerting-now-available-in-aws-cost-management/">Cost Anomaly Detection</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws-cost-management/get-started-with-aws-budgets-actions/">Budget Actions</a>.</li>
  <li>Mentioned that you should consider using GuardDuty’s <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/identify-unintended-resource-access-with-aws-identity-and-access-management-iam-access-analyzer/">S3 monitoring</a>, which for monitoring, is as an alternative to Macie.</li>
  <li>Mentioned the use of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-use-aws-cloudformation-stacksets-for-multiple-accounts-in-an-aws-organization/">CloudFormation StackSets with Organizations</a> which is an Organization feature that deploys a CloudFormation StackSet whenever a new account is created to ensure it is initialized with your baseline.</li>
  <li>Discussed using a ticketing system for alerts, as I’ve found the ways in which companies receive alerts to vary in maturity which impacts their ability to properly monitor and respond to incidents.</li>
  <li>Discussed turning on more log sources, such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/log-your-vpc-dns-queries-with-route-53-resolver-query-logs/">VPC DNS queries</a>, VPC Flow Logs, S3 access logs, etc. and linked to a post by <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewdfuller">Matt Fuller</a> for a list of log sources on AWS: <a href="https://matthewdf10.medium.com/how-to-enable-logging-on-every-aws-service-in-existence-circa-2021-5b9105b87c9">How to Enable Logging on Every AWS Service in Existence (Circa 2021)</a>.</li>
  <li>Mentioned that IAM user access keys, when required, should ideally be put in a single account and assume roles into other accounts as it makes detection of compromise easier.</li>
  <li>Mentioned that Access Advisor now shows the use of s3:ListAllMyBuckets, so you should use that to remove that specific privilege when not needed.</li>
  <li>Discussed the need to plan how accounts will be connected, as the security boundaries of separate accounts can become blurred due to trust relationships of resource policies, network connections, and other mechanisms.</li>
  <li>Expanded on the discussion of using SCPs to mention how exceptions can be made for specific roles, and SCPs can vary between accounts. Therefore, you can initialize an account by configuring it’s network configuration in advance and restricting changes via SCPs, such that a dev account may be restricted from making any resources public. Also listed possible SCPs to deploy, which are described in my post <a href="https://summitroute.com/blog/2020/03/25/aws_scp_best_practices/">AWS SCP Best Practices</a>.</li>
  <li>Mentioned <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/accelerate-infrastructure-as-code-development-with-open-source-former2/">former2</a> for helping transition to IaC (Infrastructure as Code).</li>
  <li>Mentioned that IaC scanning tools can be used, referencing <a href="https://twitter.com/christophetd">Christophe’s</a> post <a href="https://blog.christophetd.fr/shifting-cloud-security-left-scanning-infrastructure-as-code-for-security-issues/">Shifting Cloud Security Left — Scanning Infrastructure as Code for Security Issues</a>.</li>
  <li>Removed mention of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-use-tag-policies-to-manage-tags-across-multiple-aws-accounts/">Tag Policies</a> as this service is limited in various ways that make it not worth bothering with.</li>
  <li>Merged “Stage 8: Enhance detection” and “Stage 9: Auto-remediation and privilege refinement” into one stage. Mostly because I wanted this to be 10 stages. :)</li>
  <li>Mentioned Client Side Monitoring as part of the least privilege improvements, and linked to the cloudonaut article <a href="https://cloudonaut.io/record-aws-api-calls-to-improve-iam-policies/">Record AWS API calls to improve IAM Policies</a>.</li>
  <li>Mentioned the AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/">Network Firewall</a> as a solution for monitoring and protecting your networks.</li>
  <li>Mentioned the use of microservices to access resources instead of direct access so that better monitoring, restrictions, and rate limiting can be performed.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>Building a startup is like climbing a mountain. Except this mountain has no trails, so you can only use your best guess to reach the summit. Every startup will have a different set of peaks to climb, but planning and strategizing are important to reaching the top, no matter the specific goal.</span></p>

<p><span>In planning your 2021 goals, start by answering three questions:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Where do you want to be in 12 months?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>What are the metric(s) of success?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>How do you get there?&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>

<p><span>To get the most value out of goal setting for your startup, be flexible, measure along the way, and check in on your progress at clear intervals.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b>Create Anti-Goals</b></p>
<p><a href="https://www.biznews.com/thought-leaders/1986/06/13/charlie-mungers-speech-to-the-harvard-school-june-1986" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>“Invert. Always Invert” - Charlie Munger</span></a></p>
<p><span>Startups face a hazy, treacherous path from the start. Most of the time, it can feel like we are struggling to see only a few days or weeks ahead, let alone 12 months. Because early-stage companies cannot be sure of what the coming months will look like, it can sometimes be more practical to approach goal setting by developing anti-goals.</span></p>
<p><span>By inverting the problem of long-term goal setting, your team will mark out where they </span><b><i>don’t</i></b><span> want to be and work backwards.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>Some anti-goals may include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Not having a product in the market by EOY</span></li>
<li><span>Not having closed any sales</span></li>
<li><span>Having fewer customers than you have today</span></li>
<li><span>Failing to raise your next round</span></li>
<li><span>Losing a key employee(s)</span></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Mark out clear initiatives that prevent you from ending up where you don’t want to be. It could be something like setting as many prospecting calls as possible over the first few weeks of the year. Or, maybe it's breaking down all the product features needed to get you to an MVP and entering them into your project management software. Or perhaps it's having thoughtful 1-1s each week with your key reports and getting it on the calendar today.</span></p>
<p><span>With a sense of what needs to be done, next establish a cadence and system to keep you in check.</span></p>

<p><b>1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 1 quarter, 1 year.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>Using time segments to establish goals forces you to be realistic. Annual revenue goals follow from quarterly revenue goals, which in turn follow from monthly prospect appointment goals. If you have a plan to increase your revenue by $2,000,000, set a quarterly revenue goal of $500,000. To achieve that quarterly goal, back into how many sales meetings will need to be set per month. Using these time-based stair-steps, create secondary checkpoint goals to evaluate success along the way to your annual goals.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Melanie Perkins, CEO and co-founder of Canva, has a </span><a href="https://www.33voices.com/posts/how-to-set-and-achieve-your-startup-goals" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>weekly goal setting meeting with her leadership team</span></a><span>. This helps set targets for the current week based on the goals for the&nbsp; quarter or year. Using this idea, schedule a weekly meeting with stakeholders to course correct from the previous week. Similarly, schedule a monthly review meeting to zoom out and ensure you are on target.</span></p>

<p><b>Use a Compass.</b></p>
<p><span>Travel certain trails in the Adirondacks, and you will notice colored markers nailed to trees every 200 feet. These markers help you correct course as you hike. To have the same for your startup, l</span><span>ay out the markers to success before you begin your journey.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To ensure success on our journey, first formalize what KPIs are tracked to evaluate success and then set recurring monthly (or weekly) meetings to review with the broader team. If you're still determining which KPIs might be right, look through some of the </span><a href="https://www.notion.so/Startup-KPIs-to-Track-bd38b695c93b444ebc1e819143c543ec" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>examples we put together.</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At each meeting, evaluate and adjust your path. If you set a goal of 40 customer development meetings this month and blew past it, maybe it’s time to revise your year end goals upward.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b>As you work towards your annual goals throughout the coming year, keep in mind that </b><a href="https://fs.blog/2015/11/map-and-territory/" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><b>the map is not the territory</b></a><span>. Even the best laid plans are merely abstractions of the reality they are intended to represent. Be vigilant in constant re-evaluation of the goals set for yourself and your team. In your meetings, constantly question your assumptions to ensure you don’t look back in 12 months and ask yourself how you missed your goals by so much. Armed with this process to navigate your journey, you will be prepared to start the climb to the peak.&nbsp;</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>Data is a valuable currency in the modern digital economy. However, it is still a challenge to keep pace with the rapid changes in enterprise data and the growing demand for information; thereby, providing the raison d’etre for the movement of data from legacy mainframe server-type infrastructures to the cloud to scale data-driven decision-making.</span></p><p><span>Experts agree that cloud-based technologies are integral to ensuring data security, management, process compliance, and privacy across the entire enterprise data spectrum. However, there is one ongoing conundrum or debate, and that is how to process data faster with particular reference to streaming data versus batch data.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Consequently, let’s open this discussion with a brief definition of, and comparison between, streaming data and batch data.</span></p><h2><b>Differences Between Streaming Data and Batch Data</b></h2><h3><span>1. Batch data</span></h3><p><span>Succinctly stated, batch data processing is the processing of large data volumes in batches or groups. This data typically consists of millions of daily records, accumulated and stored in a central location before being processed.</span></p><p><span>In other words, as explained by the</span> <a href="https://www.upsolver.com/blog/etl-process-flow-batch-etl-vs-streaming-etl"><span>Upsolver.com team</span></a><span>, batch processing is the mechanism used by users to “</span><i><span>collect and store data in batches during a batch window. This can save time and improves the efficiency of processing the data and helps organizations and companies in managing large amounts of data and processing it quickly</span></i><span>.”</span></p><p><span>Ergo, it is a highly effective method of processing sequential records collected over time in a non-stop, sequential order.</span></p><h3><span>2. Streaming data</span></h3><p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The counterbalance to batch data is streaming data. It is the mechanism by which data is analyzed almost instantaneously or continuously. This analysis occurs as the data flows through the system with no time limitations on the output. It is highly effective and beneficial if the events that produce this data occur frequently and occur at short intervals.</span></p><p><span>The Upsolver.com article quoted above adds value to the “what is streaming data” discussion by stating the following.</span></p><p><span>“</span><i><span>Streaming allows you to stream events from any source, and it helps you make changes to the data while you’re on the run</span></i><span>.”</span></p><h2><span>The SQL WINDOW function and its advantages over traditional SQL aggregation functions</span></h2><p><span>A</span> <a href="https://learnsql.com/blog/why-should-i-learn-sql-window-functions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>SQL WINDOW function</span></a><span> is an aggregate function that performs a calculation across a set of table rows related to the current row. This is similar to the traditional aggregate function where according to the Microsoft Transact SQL documentation,</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“</span><i><span>An aggregate function performs a calculation on a set of values and returns a single value. Aggregate functions are often used with the GROUP BY clause of the SELECT statement</span></i><span>.”</span></p><p><span>However, the SQL WINDOW function takes the basic aggregate function further in that it does not group rows into a single output row. The rows retain their separate identities. It is also worth noting that the WINDOW function and the SQL aggregation function cannot simultaneously be used in the same SQL query.</span></p><p><span>By way of expanding on this definition, let’s look at the difference between the aggregate and WINDOW function, using the following FOREX data on currency exchange rates.</span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><span>CurrencyPair</span></td><td><span>DateTime</span></td><td><span>Close</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>GBPUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:00:00</span></td><td><span>1.24438</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>GBPUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:01:00</span></td><td><span>1.24454</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>GBPUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:02:00</span></td><td><span>1.24455</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>GBPUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:03:00</span></td><td><span>1.24461</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>GBPUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:04:00</span></td><td><span>1.24487</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>GBPUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:05:00</span></td><td><span>1.2448</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>EURUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:00:00</span></td><td><span>1.11633</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>EURUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:01:00</span></td><td><span>1.11617</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>EURUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:02:00</span></td><td><span>1.11627</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>EURUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:03:00</span></td><td><span>1.11636</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>EURUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:04:00</span></td><td><span>1.1163</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>EURUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:05:00</span></td><td><span>1.1162</span></td></tr></tbody></table><p><span> This table contains the closing prices for the currency pairs, GBP/USD, and EUR/USD.

The SQL code is simpler and easier to maintain, and it is much simpler to assign a value to a current row from a previous or successive row. This is a faster option than creating cursors and subqueries.</span></p><p><span>However, its most important benefit is found in its fundamental difference. Ergo, the primary difference between the aggregation function and the WINDOW function is that the rows in the WINDOW function’s result set are not collapsed. This construct is beneficial as information because it displays both the aggregated information and the single rows simultaneously.</span></p><h2><span>Breaking the traditional mold: The SQL WINDOW function in stream analytics</span></h2><p><span>The SQL WINDOW function has been adopted by data streaming experts to provide similar information. It is very useful for streaming data analytics.</span></p><p><span>Nonetheless, the principle is more complicated. Let’s look at a step-by-step guide to creating and implementing this function on streamed data.</span></p><p><span>Note: Data stream-driven architecture produces individual records known as events. Users can subscribe to the events in a particular service and will receive the analytical information as soon as it is available. And, because every service has near-real-time access to the data streamed events, they do not have to wait for ETL processes to finish.</span></p><p><span>Because streams are by definition unbounded, creating aggregated views is challenging without introducing boundaries.</span></p><p><span>Enter windowing: a mechanism to group the streamed events based on common event attributes. As an aside, the most common characteristic used to group events into windows is time. Also, a single event might be assigned to multiple windows. For instance, the output of event counts based on overlapping windows will differ from the output of event counts based on distinct windows.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;There are four different, commonly used</span> <a href="https://dev.to/frosnerd/window-functions-in-stream-analytics-1m6c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>window functions</span></a><span>.</span></p><h3><span>1. The Tumbling Window</span><span>&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span>Each tumbling window has a fixed length and is placed consequently in a row on a time axis. Tumbling windows do not overlay each other. In other words, each event is only assigned to one window, and each window fits on the time axis one after the other.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Tumbling windows are designed using one attribute: time. Consequently, each window only contains a single event, providing a robust use case for simple reporting. For instance, tumbling windows produce useful results when asked to aggregate all the number of website clicks, based on the visitor’s country of origin, and grouped in a 20-second tumbling window.</span></p><p><span>The SQL code is as follows.</span></p><pre data-enlighter-language="generic">SELECT Country, Count (*) AS VisitorCount
FROM ClickStream TIMESTAMP BY CreatedAt
GROUP BY Country, TumblingWindow(second, 20);
</pre><h3><span>2. The Hopping Window</span></h3><p><span>The hopping window also has a fixed length. However, it has two configuration parameters (the time s and the hop size h) instead of just one (s) as with the tumbling window. Thus, instead of moving the window forward by s, it is driven forward by h.</span></p><p><span>Actually, tumbling windows are a form of hopping windows where s = h. And the challenge is that if s &gt; h (overlapping windows) and if s &lt; h, some events might not be assigned to a window. This is a point to take note of when implementing the hopping window construct. The most common use case for hopping windows is to calculate moving averages.</span></p><p><span>Let’s reuse the example cited in the tumbling window; except, we want to see the moving average of the number of website clicks, based on the visitor’s country of origin, grouped in a 20-second window hopping 2 seconds.</span></p><pre data-enlighter-language="generic">SELECT Country, AVG (*) AS Average_Clicks
FROM ClickStream TIMESTAMP BY CreatedAt
GROUP BY Country, HoppingWindow(second, 20, 2);
</pre><h3><span>3. The Sliding Window</span></h3><p><span>Sliding windows are hopping windows, where h 0. In other words, this window does not hop by a time interval; it slides along. It moves along the time axis as the tumbling window does, but it groups together events within the window length s. In other words, the input stream is discrete, but the subsequent, aggregated stream is not. Because the data points are discrete, it is possible to implement a sliding window based on actual events rather than continuous time. The next window is constructed whenever an event enters or exits in the forward-moving sliding window.</span></p><p><span>As with hopping windows, sliding windows are used to compute moving averages. Their uniqueness is that they provide a resolution based on the event time pattern in the data stream. If the event density increases, the moving average will increase. Juxtapositionally, if no new events are entering the sliding window, the moving average stays the same.</span></p><p><span>This SQL statement is similar to the hopping window’s SQL statement.</span></p><pre data-enlighter-language="generic">SELECT Country, AVG (*) AS Average_Clicks
FROM ClickStream TIMESTAMP BY CreatedAt
GROUP BY Country, SlidingWindow(second, 20);</pre><h3><span>4. The Session Window</span></h3><p><span>The session window function is the only window that is not a fixed length; it is an ever-changing length. Therefore, when using this function, you must enumerate the maximum time threshold between successive events. This window can be implemented by keeping current events in a buffer and adding new events as long as they are within the session interval. …</span></p></div></div>

        <section>
            <div><p>About 18 months ago <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/faas-containerd-serverless-without-kubernetes/">I started a project</a> which developed directly against containerd. This presented a problem which I'd not really encountered before - <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> on my Mac were no longer enough, I needed a Linux environment.</p>
<p>To begin with I just used an old 2016 model Dell XPS which gave me everyting I needed, but when others started to contribute, they were using Macs and so we had a problem. <a href="https://multipass.run/">Multipass</a> was the answer to our woes and we were pleasantly surprised by it and wondered why more people weren't using it every day.</p>
<p>I want to tell you a bit about our experience in the <a href="http://github.com/openfaas/">OpenFaaS community</a> developing <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd</a> - a portable FaaS framework, just like OpenFaaS, but without the complexity and overheads of a Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<h2 id="whatscontainerdeverdoneforus">What's containerd ever done for us?</h2>
<p>Some time ago the original version of Docker was actually written in Python, and then morphed over time into a Go re-write. The Go version was seen as monolithic by some consumers, particularly the Kubernetes community.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Docker did many things, and at one point clustering and multi-node orchestration was even added to that list (think Docker Swarm and Docker EE)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the codebase was refactored two projects emmerged: containerd and runc.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc">runc</a> was a tiny Go binary that had one job: run a container based upon a spec. runc was also the driver for the <a href="https://opencontainers.org/">OCI specification</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd">containerd</a>'s job was to get things ready for runc - such as pulling images and defining specs</li>
</ul>
<p>Docker then remained as a thiner layer on top of both of these tools to bring a user-friendly developer-experience, networking, high-level API and CLI.</p>
<p>Over time containerd has shifted into the lime-light and in Kubernetes 1.20, it will take over duties for running containers in Kubernetes clusters. Now not a lot changes, because containerd was always there along with runc, we just skip a few levels of indirection.</p>
<p>containerd doesn't provide networking out of the box, and that was one of the hardest challenges.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not because it's technically complex, but there was a severe lack of documentation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/containernetworking/cni">Container Network Initiative (CNI)</a> filled a gap for us and enabled us to build a network between our containers.</p>
<p>When you squint at faasd, you see something that looks a lot like a single-node Kubernetes cluster, using the same projects you'd find on most nodes: containerd, runc and CNI.</p>
<h2 id="whywouldyoudevelopwithcontainerd">Why would you develop with containerd?</h2>
<p>There were two main reasons for creating "faasd" - the first was that we were hearing from users that they didn't want to run an entire Kubernetes cluster just to run a handful of functions, APIS or webpages. The second was that I fancied doing some learning and low-level coding.</p>
<p>Whilst containerd has a socket available, and can be mounted or forwarded, it doesn't work as you would expect. The containerd client tries to run containers on the host it's executing on and just synchronises state with the containerd socket. I found that very confusing, but was reassured that is the way it was designed to work.</p>
<p>You can see our code which has developed into two main services shipped in a single binary.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/blob/master/cmd/up.go">faasd</a> - starts all the core services for OpenFaaS: the gateway, NATS, Prometheus and our queue worker. <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/blob/master/docker-compose.yaml">A docker-compose file</a> is used to define versions of images, and the dependency graph for starting up services.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/tree/master/pkg/provider">faasd-provider</a> - a HTTP interface that performs invoke and CRUD for functions and secrets</li>
</ul>
<p>Both are installed with systemd unit files, it was refreshing to lean on the host system for once, instead of using abstractions.</p>
<h3 id="theshortversion">The short-version</h3>
<p><a href="https://multipass.run/">multipass</a> is a <a href="https://canonical.com/">Canonical</a> and its open source components and usage instructions are <a href="https://github.com/canonical/multipass">available on GitHub</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Multipass is a lightweight VM manager for Linux, Windows and macOS. It's designed for developers who want a fresh Ubuntu environment with a single command.</p>
<p>Since it supports metadata for cloud-init, you can simulate a small cloud deployment on your laptop or workstation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On MacOS it is currently using hyperkit to run VMs, which is another thing we can thank Docker for building. On Windows and Linux it uses different virtualization technology, but has the same simple user-experience which means we get to write one tutorial and to be done with it. As a busy maintainer, I see that as a big win.</p>
<p>Here's how you get a VM launched with the latest version of Ubuntu Server:</p>
<pre><code>multipass launch --name faasd
</code></pre>
<p>Shell into the VM:</p>
<pre><code>multipass exec faasd /bin/bash
</code></pre>
<p>We then realised that multipass supported cloud-init, so morphed our README to the following:</p>
<pre><code>curl -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openfaas/faasd/master/cloud-config.txt
multipass launch --cloud-init cloud-config.txt  --name faasd
</code></pre>
<p>I had the pleasure of speaking to the engineering manager and PM for multipass on Zoom today and they told me you can even pass the cloud-init file as a URL, so our tutorial becomes even simpler:</p>
<pre><code>multipass launch --cloud-init https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openfaas/faasd/master/cloud-config.txt  --name faasd
</code></pre>
<p>From there, you have a full Linux system with a working version of containerd and Container Network Initiative (CNI) plugins running, and most importantly faasd is up and running.</p>
<pre><code>faas-cli list
faas-cli store deploy figlet
faas-cli invoke figlet &lt;&lt;&lt; "faasd"
</code></pre>
<p>Whilst I've not used it yet, I'm told you can also mount folders from your base system to synchronise your GOPATH. So you could write code using VSCode and have the built-in terminal pane running "multipass exec /bin/bash" or an ssh session.</p>
<p>I recently wrote a post on <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/memory-lane-raspberry-pi-zero/">One last trip down memory lane with the Raspberry Pi Zero</a> where I tried to port faasd to a Raspberry Pi Zero. The Go build for faasd was taking so long that I gave up, opened multipass and cross-compiled it. That whole process was quicker than waiting for the poor little armv6 service to finish its work.</p>
<h3 id="multipassforkubernetes">multipass for Kubernetes</h3>
<p>You can also use multipass to run other workloads, I tried to deploy Kubernetes with microk8s, but ran into some issues with the default limits.</p>
<p>First of all: there was not enough RAM alloacted, then there was not enough disk, finally there were not enough vCPUs. After working all that out I came up with the following:</p>
<pre><code>multipass launch --name microk8s -m 8G -c 2 -d 80G
</code></pre>
<p>Now it's not that much of a surprise that we never ran into that issue, because faasd is designed to be ridicuously lean. It even runs on a Raspberry Pi 3 which only has 1GB of RAM.</p>
<h2 id="wrappingup">Wrapping up</h2>
<p>multipass has been useful for us whenever we need to access a Linux VM from a Mac. It could even be used for running a Kubernetes cluster, but I would usually prefer to deploy Kubernetes in a Docker container using either <a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/">KinD</a> or <a href="https://github.com/rancher/k3d">k3d</a> for the sheer speed and efficiency of it.</p>
<p>multipass is a much leaner alternative to tooling like VirtualBox and Vagrant. The team are looking for feedback and are already planning for a way to launch custom images. Think: <code>multipass launch openfaas</code> or <code>multipass launch gitlab</code> for instance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We see multipass being an important part of enabling collaboration with users from all-over the world, whether they use Linux, MacOS or Windows on their desktop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Around 20 people have contributed to faasd directly, and many more indirectly. It worked very well for us and we believe that multipass deserves more attention.</p>
<p>Go and try it out, let them know what works for you and where it can be improved for your workflow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Users have already suggested using <a href="https://github.com/canonical/multipass/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+qemu">qemu on MacOS</a>, and the new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization">Virtualization.Framework</a> introduced in Big Sur could also have some impact on the future roadmap and M1 support.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://multipass.run/">multipass.run</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="whataboutfaasdvsopenfaasonkubernetes">what about faasd vs. OpenFaaS on Kubernetes?</h3>
<p>faasd now fills a nice gap where Docker Swarm used to live in the OpenFaaS ecosystem. If you're working your way up to production with Kubernetes, or already have experience then you may benefit from a cluster and installing OpenFaaS to it.</p>
<p>If you're wanting to run a few functions, start small, keep costs down, then faasd may be a better fit. Managing and keeping up with Kubernetes versions can be its own challenge. So if you want to deploy code for a customer and barely give it another thought, then package faasd as a VM or cloud-init script and be done with it.</p>
<p>faasd can be run for 5-10 USD on a cloud VPS, or on your Raspberry Pi for free using <a href="https://docs.inlets.dev/">an inlets tunnel</a> to get it a public IP address.</p>

<p>Russia is a large market with incredible potential. This is understood by technology giants (for example, the Russian market is one of the main ones for Apple pay) and small startups from neighbouring countries.</p>



<p>If you want to enter this market and become part of a startup ecosystem, you need to understand its structure. We have collected the most important things to start this acquaintance with.</p>



<p>In 2020, 2.8 million enterprises and 6.7 individual entrepreneurs worked in Russia (a type of entrepreneurial activity in which an individual conducts commercial activity with some restrictions and tax benefits). The entire business generated $2.4 trillion in revenue in 11 months of 2020. </p>



<p>This is one of the highest percentages of entrepreneurial activity in Eastern Europe – 7.9% of the economically active population is in business.</p>



<p>Among 9.5M entrepreneurs, 450K are involved in the startup economy of the country (provide services to startups, work in a startup or plan to launch a startup in the next 6 months). Since the last survey (аugust 2019), the audience has grown by 50K members.</p>



<blockquote><p>The male/female ratio shifted towards the former. The audience of women increased slightly (by 3K), mainly due to the audience of 45+. There are almost 50K more men.</p></blockquote>



<p>The average participant in a startup ecosystem is a 35-44 year old male (23.7%). </p>



<p>More than half of the people involved in the startup ecosystem (52%) are located in Moscow. In second place – St. Petersburg (8%), both of these cities added, after the last report, by one percent.</p>



<p>In your pocket – except for a Samsung phone with a mobile operator MTS or Megafon. Also a Tinkoff or Raiffeisenbank card.</p>



<p>Political views can be said to be moderate (certainly not liberal). They enjoy reading the blog of Sobyanin (the current mayor of Moscow) and Prokhorov.</p>



<p>Read regional Russian-language blogs <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://vc.ru/" target="_blank">vc.ru</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.sostav.ru/" target="_blank">Sostav</a>, <a href="https://www.cossa.ru/">Cossa</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hbr.org/" target="_blank">HBR</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://rb.ru/" target="_blank">RB</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://secretmag.ru/" target="_blank">Secret Firmy</a>.</p>



<p>Many designated Internet media can easily be entered with a press release under the heading “guest post” and get the attention of the target audience.</p>



<p>They can be seen in the DO coworking spaces, Flacon and the Skolkovo Technopark. </p>



<blockquote><p>Use the data received from Panoptic Insights in order to better understand the audience of the Russian startup market. We hope that this data will help you decide whether to enter this rich market or not.</p></blockquote>

You pick up your phone to check the time or your to-do list, and the first thing you see is that you've received 9 messages from 4 different people, who are waiting for your response. Let’s start with an assessment.</p><h2>What is the state of play with notifications?</h2><h3>They capture our attention</h3><p>In 2015, researchers from Florida State University published <a href="https://www.fsu.edu/indexTOFStory.html?lead.distraction" target="_blank">this study</a> on attention and phone notifications. Participants worked on an attention-demanding task on a computer, during which some received automated call or text alerts on their personal phones. As it turns out, those who received text notifications performed poorly compared to participants who didn’t. Those who received call notifications performed even worse than those who got text messages. Here’s the most interesting part: simply knowing that you have received a text or missed a call might impact your attention as much as actually using your phone. That’s because some of your focus is now allocated to remembering this notification that’s waiting for you.</p><h3>They get in our way</h3><p>Fast-forward to the 20’s. Today, push notifications may be the most obvious form of interruptions because they pop up on or slide into our screens ; but they’re not the only ones that cut off our flow. For instance, I would love to have Discord open, or to use Twitter, without having the constant reminder that I have things to catch up on. The notification badge, with or without count, disrupts our focus. If you open Twitter because you want to message someone, the badge immediately calls for your attention instead of letting you pursue the task you had in mind.</p><p>An alternative design could be one that lets you check your notifications whenever it suits you, making it a deliberate choice, by removing their constant presence on the homepage and keeping them contained to a dedicated zone. Dr. Richard Davidson, founder and director of the Center for Healthy Minds, and professor of psychology and psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, uses <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/11/28/18102745/cellphone-distraction-brain-health-screens-kids" target="_blank">this expressive comparison</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Our attention is being captured by devices rather than being voluntarily regulated. We are like a sailor without a rudder on the ocean — pushed and pulled by the digital stimuli to which we are exposed rather than by the intentional direction of our own mind.”</em></p></blockquote><h3>What’s with the red?</h3><p>There’s also the issue of the colour. Many notification badges are <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/why-apples-notification-bubbles-are-so-stressful-65a544e51f10" target="_blank">red by default</a>. Red is the colour that stands out the most in our daily life. Whether in a city, in nature, or at home, this hue contrasts the best against any background. As a result, red is also consistently used to alert us of important signals, including in the physical world. By important, I mean “that which could have strongly negative consequences if we miss them”. The stop sign, the red light, the no-crossing light, the stove, the train’s emergency window breaker, the car dashboard’s red lights, and more, use red as a signifier.</p><p>So not only is red more striking, but we’re also conditioned to be particularly attentive to red signals. Now, I ask you: is the content you’re alerted about with notification badges important enough to use red? I’m curious where your mind is at. I created a poll on Twitter, and you can vote below or <a href="https://twitter.com/This2ShallGrow/status/1348978819189927937">over there</a>.</p></div></div><div data-block-json="{&quot;cache_age&quot;:&quot;3153600000&quot;,&quot;authorUrl&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/This2ShallGrow&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:550,&quot;height&quot;:null,&quot;hSize&quot;:null,&quot;resolveObject&quot;:&quot;Tweet&quot;,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;<blockquote class=\&quot;twitter-tweet\&quot;><p dir=\&quot;ltr\&quot; lang=\&quot;en\&quot;>Let's talk about notification badges.<br>They're often red to better call for our attention.<br><br>I'm curious about your opinion: is the content you\u2019re alerted about with notification badges important enough to use red?</p>\u2014 This Too Shall Grow \uD83C\uDF31 (@This2ShallGrow) <a href=\&quot;https://twitter.com/This2ShallGrow/status/1348978819189927937?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\&quot;>January 12, 2021</a></blockquote>\n<script async=\&quot;\&quot; src=\&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\&quot; charset=\&quot;utf-8\&quot;></script>&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/This2ShallGrow/status/1348978819189927937&quot;,&quot;resolvedBy&quot;:&quot;twitter&quot;,&quot;floatDir&quot;:null,&quot;authorName&quot;:&quot;This Too Shall Grow \uD83C\uDF31&quot;,&quot;version&quot;:&quot;1.0&quot;,&quot;resolved&quot;:true,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;rich&quot;,&quot;providerName&quot;:&quot;Twitter&quot;,&quot;providerUrl&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com&quot;}" data-block-type="22" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610456282977_18734"><div><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Let's talk about notification badges.<br>They're often red to better call for our attention.</p><p>I'm curious about your opinion: is the content you’re alerted about with notification badges important enough to use red?</p></div>— This Too Shall Grow 🌱 (@This2ShallGrow) <a href="https://twitter.com/This2ShallGrow/status/1348978819189927937?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2021</a></blockquote>

We’re constantly being summoned: we switch between tasks and different platforms without dedicating appropriate levels of attention to each. In the example I mentioned above, you 1) open twitter.com, but before completing the “send message to friend” task, you 2) are prompted by the notification badge. So you 3) open the notifications panel, switching to a “read notifications” task. Some of them require a reaction from you, where you 4) switch to “post reply” or “like tweet”. Once you’re done going through this list, you 5) can finally return to your original messaging task.</p><p>“I have strong willpower, I would stick to the original task without checking my notifications”, you say? That’s great! Though as we’ve seen above, the niggling awareness of new information waiting for you is enough to impede your focus.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610452215955_15957"><div>

Take emails: a promotional newsletter from The Fork, or the LinkedIn announcement that someone you don’t know started a new job, are given the same importance as an email from your client saying they accepted your budget. Gmail tabs and inbox filters can help with that, but most email providers don’t have that kind of feature enabled by default. John Herrman, tech and media reporter, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/magazine/red-dots-badge-phones-notification.html" target="_blank">eloquently written</a> about this topic:</p><blockquote><p>“<em>I’ve met dots that existed only to inform me of the existence of other dots, new dots, dots with almost no meaning at all; a dot on my Instagram app led me to another dot within it, which informed me that something had happened on Facebook: Someone I barely know had posted for the first time in a while</em>.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“<em>The same badge might lead to word that Grandma’s in the hospital or that, according to a prerecorded voice, the home-security system you don’t own is in urgent need of attention or that, for the 51st time today, someone has posted in the group chat. New and flourishing modes of socialization amount, in the most abstract terms, to the creation and reduction of dots, and the experience of their attendant joys and anxieties</em>.”</p></blockquote><p>Here are some examples of irrelevant notifications:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Other people - whom I don’t know - commented on a post I’ve commented on</p></li></ul></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610452215955_22192"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610452215955_30798"><div><p>Those are what Adrian Zumbrunnen calls “<a href="https://medium.com/s/story/the-rise-of-anti-notifications-6c92e355612b" target="_blank">anti-notifications</a>”: notifications that aren’t about you or meant for you, but are instead about others. None of the screenshots above concern me, yet LinkedIn decided on my behalf that having them in my feed wasn’t enough, but that I should also be notified of them.</p><h2>How are mindful notifications helpful?</h2><p>What are mindful notifications? Here’s my attempt at constructing a definition.</p><p>“Notifications are mindful when their mental cost and attention required are suitable to the information communicated to a given user. It enables them instead of hindering them. As much as possible, it’s signalling instead of interrupting.”</p><p>I asked people in the <a href="https://nesslabs.com/" target="_blank">Ness Labs community</a> to tell me about their relationship with notifications. Here’s what they shared:</p><blockquote><p>“<em>I've turned most notifications off, entirely, especially sounds but also quite a few badges. This has increased my productivity and my equanimity. I find myself no less informed as a result. I am experimenting with widgets on my iPhone to surface the information I want convenient access to” - </em><a href="https://twitter.com/manleywalker" target="_blank">Manley</a></p></blockquote><p>I also found <a href="https://twitter.com/_middlesister" target="_blank">Karin</a>’s approach interesting. She has a feature phone for personal use, and a smartphone for her professional life only. On her smartphone, everything is off by default - including badges and sound - and she only allows a few selected apps to notify her. This mindset of starting with a clean slate and only turning on the relevant alerts helps ensure that she makes her digital life work for her, and not the other way around.</p><p>Another member mentioned she has no social media, and that she keeps her phone free from work emails and news apps. She can still log in to her personal emails and calendar if needed, but she purposefully added friction to make it a difficult and deliberate act.</p><h2>Designing mindful notifications</h2><h3>Managing the level of attention</h3><p>Dear designer, what’s it going to be? A mobile and/or desktop push notification? An email? An SMS? An in-app notification only? A blinking LED? A sound? A badge? A vibration?

<p>A few weeks ago, Chip compared the state of real-time machine learning in China and US: While many Chinese companies have adopted real-time ML, US companies are still assessing its value. She also wrote about ML going real-time <a href="https://huyenchip.com/2020/12/27/real-time-machine-learning.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<div>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Talking to Internet companies in China gives me the impression that their MLOps infra is away ahead.</p><p>Many US Internet co. are still wondering if there's value in real-time ML. Chinese counterparts are already doing real-time inference + online training.</p><p>Are my samples biased?</p></div>— Chip Huyen (@chipro) <a href="https://twitter.com/chipro/status/1337077324936663040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2020</a></blockquote> 
</div>
<p>This post continues the thread and shares <strong>how real-time ML looks in practice</strong>. Drawing from my experience and industry papers/blogs, weâ€™ll discuss <strong>real-time recommendations</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>When does real-time recommendation make sense? When does it not?</li>
<li>How have China and US companies implemented real-time recommenders?</li>
<li>How can we design and implement a simple MVP?</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: This discussion assumes basic knowledge of recommendation systems, such as the difference between item-to-item and user-to-item, and the candidate generation &amp; ranking paradigm. Fret not if those terms are unfamiliar. Weâ€™ll have two primers to help you get up to speed. Click on the ðŸ‘‰ below to start with the first.</p>
<details><summary id="primer-i">Primer I: Collaboration vs. Content-based, item-to-item vs. user-to-item</summary>
<div>
<p>If you understand the difference between collaboration vs. content-based recommendations, and item-to-item vs. user-to-item, feel free to skip this section.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration-based recommendations are based on user behavior</strong>. Assume I like movie <code><span>X</span></code> and dislike movie <code><span>Y</span></code>. To recommend movies to me, we first find users similar to me (i.e., like <code><span>X</span></code>, dislike <code><span>Y</span></code>). Then, from those users, what are movies they liked, but Iâ€™ve not watched? Those movies are then recommended to me. With user behavioral data, users can â€œcollaborateâ€� to create recommendations for each other. Collaborative filtering is probably the most well-known approach.</p>
<p><strong>Content-based recommendations are based on item metadata</strong>. Given the movies Iâ€™ve watched (and enjoyed), content-based recommenders suggest movies of similar genre, time period, director, etc. Relative to collaboration-based recommenders, content-based recommenders tend to be more effective when the movie is new and we donâ€™t have enough user behavioral data about it yet (i.e., cold-start problem)</p>
<p><strong>In item-to-item (i2i) recommendations, given an item, we recommend other items</strong>. Hereâ€™s an example of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116629/" target="_blank">i2i recommendations on IMDB</a>, under the â€œMore Like Thisâ€� widget. This works well in scenarios where the focus is the item (e.g., item detail page).</p>
<p><img src="https://eugeneyan.com/assets/mlt.jpg" loading="lazy" title="More like Independence Day on IMDB" alt="More like Independence Day on IMDB"></p><p>More like Independence Day on IMDB</p>
<p><strong>In user-to-item (u2i), given a user, we recommend items</strong>. We see this on the home page of Netflix, Amazon, Taobao, sometimes with the name of â€œRecommended For Youâ€�. Our social media feeds (e.g., Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook) are u2i recommendations too. In such scenarios, the user (and their historical preferences) is the focus.</p>
<p><img src="https://eugeneyan.com/assets/rfy.jpg" loading="lazy" title="Recommended For You on Amazon" alt="Recommended For You on Amazon"></p><p>Recommended For You on Amazon</p>
<p>Taken together, i2i and u2i recommendations provide coverage for the bulk of user traffic via detail pages and home pages.</p>
</div>
</details>
<h2 id="when-not-to-use-real-time-recommendations">When <em>(not)</em> to use real-time recommendations?</h2>
<p>Before we get too excited, let me first say that <strong>most use cases wonâ€™t need real-time recommendations</strong>; batch recommendations are good enough.</p>
<p>Relative to real-time recommendations, batch recommendations are computationally cheaper. They are usually generated once a day and benefit from batch processingâ€™s economies of scale. The recommendations are then loaded into a key-value store (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB) and served via a key-value lookup.</p>
<p>Batch recommendations are also simpler ops-wise. By caching pre-computed recommendations (in our key-value store), we decouple computation from serving. Thus, even if the compute step fails, thereâ€™s no customer-facing impact; we continue to serve the previous batch of (slightly stale) recommendations. The cache provides a buffer and ensures almost 100% uptime, reducing ops burden on the team (e.g., on-call, complaints).</p>
<p><img src="https://eugeneyan.com/assets/batch-vs-stream.jpg" loading="lazy" title="Batch vs. streaming in the case of analytics" alt="Batch vs. streaming in the case of analytics"></p>
<p>Batch vs. streaming in the case of analytics (<a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/11/09/converged-data-platform-unifying-streaming-data-using-mapr/" target="_blank">source</a>)</p>
<p>In contrast, real-time recommendations usually require more computation. For example, we might aggregate streamed events (e.g., click, like, purchase) and generate new recommendations on-demand, based on user interactions. (In comparison, batch recommendations only compute a single set daily.) Furthermore, such computation is done individually and does not benefit from economies of scale. (Nonetheless, we save on not generating recommendations for customers who donâ€™t visit our app).</p>
<p>Operating real-time recommendations in production is also far tricker. Instead of using ephemeral Spark clusters (for compute) and a DynamoDB (for serving), weâ€™ll need low-latency high-throughput APIs with 24/7 uptime. In the strictest scenario, we wonâ€™t have our key-value store as a buffer. The line between compute and serving disappears. Ops burden will increase (read: weâ€™ll be paged in the middle of the night for an outage in another timezone ðŸš¨).</p>
<p><strong>Why real-time recommendations then?</strong> Theyâ€™re useful when the customer journey is mission-centric and depends on the context. Such missions are often time-sensitive. Real-time demand fades quickly; demand could be met (on a competitor site) or the user might lose interest. Weâ€™ll examine this in two examples: shopping and watching a movie.</p>
<p>Shopping is a <strong>mission-centric activity</strong>. Though a customer might predominately purchase a category of products, their shopping behavior is often punctuated with tangential missions. For example, if I usually shop for clothes, my u2i recommendations will mostly be fashion recommendations. However, if I need a new wide-screen monitor and start browsing for one, my u2i recommendations should update ASAP to help me quickly fulfill my mission (lest I go to a competing app).</p>
<p>In this scenario, batch recommendations donâ€™t react fast enough. And even when the recommendations are updated, due to the data imbalance, such mission-related needs are not met (More in Section 2.1 of this <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3240323.3240372" target="_blank">Netflix paper</a>).</p>
<p>The movies we watch <strong>depend on context</strong> (though our long-term preferences are fairly stable). For example, we might watch different movies depending on whether weâ€™re alone, with friends, with a romantic interest, or with children. It might also depend on our mood, as well as the time of day. Similar to shopping, daily batch recommendations face the same challenges here.</p>
<p>Other than the examples above, real-time recommendations are also handy in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Travel (our vacation destinations are often changing)</li>
<li>YouTube (we watch videos for coding, yoga, and recipes within the same day)</li>
<li>Serving ads (our interest is time-sensitive; our attention spans are shrinking)</li>
</ul>
<p>Real-time recommendations are also useful when the majority of our customers are new (i.e., cold-start). This happens when weâ€™re in the customer acquisition stage, such as when weâ€™ve just launched a new product or entered a new market (e.g., e-commerce in Southeast Asia in 2013 - 2015).</p>
<p>Imagine youâ€™ve just downloaded an e-commerce app. Since weâ€™re uncertain of your gender, the home page will have a mix of categories catering to each gender, from dresses to menâ€™s shirts, from GPUs to makeup. If you click on a dress, we can immediately build a persona (that youâ€™re female) and personalize your shopping experience. In this case, the u2i recommendations on your home page will tilt towards female products.</p>
<p>Given that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/31/nearly-1-in-4-people-abandon-mobile-apps-after-only-one-use/" target="_blank">1 in 4 users abandon mobile apps</a> <em>after only one use</em>, quickly responding to customer needsâ€”from the very first touchpointâ€”helps with acquisition and retention.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did you miss the first primer (collaborative vs. content-based, item-to-item vs. user-to-item)? Click on the ðŸ‘‰ <a href="#primer-i">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most modern recommenders have two key components: candidate generation and ranking.</p>
<p>Candidate generation is a fastâ€”but coarseâ€”approach to get (hundreds of) item candidates from millions of items. We trade off precision for efficiency to reduce the search space (e.g., from 100 million to 1,000 candidates, a 99.999% reduction). This is usually done via metadata-based filters (e.g., category, brand) or k-nearest neighbors.</p>
<p>Ranking is a slowerâ€”but more preciseâ€”approach to sort and select top recommendation candidates. We have leeway to include features that might not have been feasible in the candidate generation step. Such features include user persona (e.g., demographics, price propensity), item metadata (e.g., attributes, engagement statistics), cross features (e.g., interaction between each feature pair), and media embeddings.</p>
<p>Ranking can be framed as either a classification or learning to rank problem. As a classification problem, we can score candidates based on probability of click or purchase. Logistic regression with crossed features is simple to implement and a difficult baseline to beat. Decision trees are also commonly used. As a learning to rank problem, commonly used algorithms include <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/ranking-boosting-and-model-adaptation/" target="_blank">LambdaMart</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02754" target="_blank">XGBoost</a>, and <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2017/hash/6449f44a102fde848669bdd9eb6b76fa-Abstract.html" target="_blank">LightGBM</a>. Neural networks are also gaining adoption, thanks to <a href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/notes-from-sparkai-summit-application-agnostic/#scaling-up-deep-learning-by-scaling-down-24th-june" target="_blank">gains in model efficiency</a> via distillation, pruning, quantization, etc.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://blog.csdn.net/xwd18280820053/article/details/90316416" target="_blank">general reference</a> sheds light on recommendation systems from a Chinese perspective. Itâ€™s organized based on the paradigm discussed, with sections for candidate generation (â€œMatchâ€�) and ranking (â€œRankâ€�). It also discusses two other components: profile (building user preferences) and post-processing (e.g., excluding previously purchased goods, item-deduplication across recommendation sets).</p>
<p><strong>To see how recommendations can be incrementally updated</strong>, weâ€™ll discuss two algorithms: the humble collaborative filtering (CF) and Alibabaâ€™s Swing algorithm that improves on CF.</p>
<p>Collaborative filtering (for i2i recommendations) is implemented via the three formulas below. Letâ€™s try to understand what they do and the intuition behind them.</p><p></p></div></div>

<p>Developers and software teams already know that one of the biggest challenges of their job is <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/how-to-scope-software-projects">accurately scoping work</a>, and being able to consistently and predictably deliver results to clients within the promised timeline.</p>



<p>Yet another challenge is finding ways to streamline workflows so <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/healthier-work-systems">missed deadlines due to inaccurate scoping</a> become 100 percent a thing of the past. Lead time, cycle time, and takt time are just a few metrics that software teams can track and optimize to boost their efficiency and productivity —&nbsp;but these are also metrics that are often confused with one another.</p>



<p>Each one of them —&nbsp;lead time, cycle time, and takt time — is an individual metric that helps developers monitor, track, and evaluate <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/autonomy-software-teams">how efficiently your team completes projects</a>. Optimizing each of them for better efficiency doesn’t only boost client satisfaction; it also makes your team better, faster, and stronger.</p>







<p>But doing that requires understanding what each metric is, how to calculate it, and the role it plays in the overall project scope. By understanding the differences between lead time, cycle time, and takt time — and how and when to use each metric —&nbsp;developers can discover paths to better scoping and increased productivity.</p>



<h2>Lead Time vs Cycle Time vs Takt Time: What Are They</h2>



<p>Lead time, cycle time, and takt time all come from Kanban, a workflow management method that was originally created to help streamline manufacturing processes. Many of the principles of Kanban translate well to the process of software development, so it’s become a common practice for managing workflows for software teams, as well.</p>



<p>Lead time, cycle time, and takt time are all metrics used to track, measure, and evaluate efficiency at different parts of the production process. If that doesn’t make sense just yet, don’t worry —&nbsp;we’ll explain each one in better detail down below.</p>



<h3>What Is Lead Time?</h3>



<p>Lead time is the total amount of time between when a new task or project enters your workflow, and when it leaves your workflow. In other words, it’s the total time from when your team agrees to take on a project, to when you deliver it to the client.</p>



<h4>How Is Lead Time Calculated?</h4>



<p>The formula for lead time in a manufacturing setting is:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="264" src="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-1024x264.jpg" alt="How Is Lead Time Calculated" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-1024x264.jpg 1024w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-300x77.jpg 300w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-768x198.jpg 768w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-1536x396.jpg 1536w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-2048x528.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>In the context of a software team, that might look like this:</p>



<ul><li>After the client makes a request that includes three deliverables, it takes your team two days to process it.</li><li>Then, it takes four months (~120 days) to complete the project.</li><li>Once the project is finished on your end, the client takes two weeks (14 days) to review it and make the final payment.</li></ul>



<p><strong>In this case, the lead time would equal 2 days + 120 days + 14 days, or 136 days.</strong></p>



<h4>Why Is Lead Time Important for Software Teams?</h4>



<p>Lead time provides you with a good overview of how long a project takes from start to finish. You can compare your lead time to your cycle time to determine some insights about your team’s productivity and customer satisfaction, but more on that in a minute.</p>



<h3>What Is Cycle Time?</h3>



<p>Cycle time is how you can measure how long it takes your team to complete work on a project. In manufacturing, cycle time means the amount of time it takes to complete a production cycle from beginning to end. For software teams, that usually translates to the amount of time from when your team starts coding, to when the software is released.</p>



<p>Cycle time differs from lead time in that it measures <em>only</em> the time your team spends in production. Lead time takes that measurement, then combines it with the time it takes your team to receive and process requests, deliver them to the client, and receive approval and payment.</p>



<h4>How Is Cycle Time Calculated?</h4>



<p>The formula for calculating cycle time is:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="264" src="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-1024x264.jpg" alt="How Is Cycle Time Calculated" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-1024x264.jpg 1024w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-300x77.jpg 300w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-768x198.jpg 768w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-1536x396.jpg 1536w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-2048x528.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Let’s take the same example from above, and calculate the team’s cycle time.</p>



<p>It took the team 120 hours to complete the three deliverables the client requested. So cycle time could be calculated in two different ways.</p>



<ul><li>120 hours divided by three deliverables = 40 hours of cycle time per deliverable; or</li><li>120 hours divided by one project for the client = 120 hours of cycle time</li></ul>



<h4>Why Is Cycle Time Important for Software teams?</h4>



<p>Cycle time is one of the most important metrics you can compare to your lead time, and how those two differ can tell you quite a bit about your team’s efficiency.</p>



<p>For example, if your cycle time is much lower than your lead time, it shows that your team is either taking a long time to process requests and begin projects, or projects are lingering in the approval phase. This could mean your team is leaving loose ends and not moving through the entire workflow efficiently.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if your cycle time is equal to your lead time, it could be because you’re allowing processing and approval times on projects to overlap. While this might be an efficient use of your software team’s time, it may also lower the quality of the customer service you deliver.</p>



<h3>What Is Takt Time?</h3>



<p>And now, let’s look at time measurements from a different angle with takt time. Takt time is a measurement of how quickly or efficiently your team is able to meet the needs of your client or production schedule. “Takt” comes from the German word for “pulse,” and that’s a good way of looking at it —&nbsp;this measurement finds your team’s ideal “pulse” of work, that allows you to deliver projects as needed without underworking or overworking the team.</p>



<h4>How Is Takt Time Calculated?</h4>



<p>The formula for calculating takt time is:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="264" src="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-1024x264.jpg" alt="How Is Takt Time Calculated" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-1024x264.jpg 1024w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-300x77.jpg 300w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-768x198.jpg 768w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-1536x396.jpg 1536w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-2048x528.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>This can be a little trickier to apply to work like software development (though that doesn’t make it a less useful metric!).&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the example we’ve been using above, we can take those three deliverables the client needs, and divide them into the 120 hours your team has available for the project. In that case:</p>



<p>Takt time = 120 / 3 = 40 hours per deliverable.</p>



<p>But we know software development isn’t always that easy to segment. So, to look at this another way, let’s say your team has scoped the client’s project and determined there are 6 smaller goals you need to achieve during your sprints. So in this case:</p>



<p>Takt time = 120 / 6 = 20 hours per sprint. That means your team can plan on completing two sprints per week to hit their optimal pulse, or takt, for this project.</p>



<h4>Why Is Takt Time Important for Software Teams?</h4>



<p>Takt time tells you whether your team is overworked and unable to keep up with demand, or underworked and not being as productive as it could be.</p>



<p>For example, if you calculate your takt time to be 120 hours per project, but your team’s cycle time is 150 hours, your team won’t be able to deliver on the deadlines it’s scoping.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if your takt time is 120 hours and your cycle time is 100 hours, you’re leaving 20 hours per project in your scope as wasted time.</p>



<h2>How Can You Measure Lead Time, Cycle Time, and Takt Time?</h2>



<p>We know time tracking <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/timekeeping-is-not-toxix">isn’t a favorite topic among developers</a>. But for getting the valuable insights that lead time, cycle time, and takt time can provide, it’s 100 percent necessary.</p>



<p>So why not use a time tracking tool that’s built into your existing systems, but stays in the background, out of your way while you do the job you’re here to do? <a href="https://www.7pace.com/">7pace Timetracker</a> is just that — it’s a time tracking tool built for developers, by developers who use it themselves. It integrates directly into Azure DevOps, Azure Boards, and <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/7pace-for-github-announcement">GitHub</a>, so no matter where and how you work, it’s always where you need it to be —&nbsp;tracking time so you don’t have to worry about it.</p>



<p>But we know we’re not going to sell you on a time tracking tool unless there’s real value your team can gain. That’s why it’s not so important <em>how</em> you track different time metrics —&nbsp;what matters is <em>why</em> you track them (and how you use the insights they give you).</p>



<h3>Why Should You Track All These Time Metrics?</h3>



<p>Tracking time metrics like lead time, cycle time, and takt time comes with a whole pile of potential benefits for your team. These metrics can:</p>



<ul><li>Help your team identify bottlenecks in your workflow;</li><li>Give you a better understanding of your team’s capacity for work;</li><li>Help you more accurately scope new projects.</li></ul>



<p>The most important takeaway here is that tracking different time metrics gives you a complete view of how your team is spending time. That allows you to identify any workflow problems, and identifying them is the first step toward eliminating them — and getting as close as possible to maximum productivity with your team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is important to note and recognize that time metrics will be constantly changing, so this isn’t a one-and-done kind of assessment. In order to keep getting the maximum value out of tracking time metrics, you’ll have to continue to track and analyze them over time, on all your projects —&nbsp;and adjust your workflow accordingly. Sometimes changes you put into place based on one set of time metrics will end up getting reversed later based on a newer set of time metrics — software teams are made up of people, after all, and not robots.</p>



<p>It takes some time and effort to constantly track time metrics, but we think the value of the insights you can gather makes the endeavor well worth it. If you’re ready to start tracking your team’s time metrics —&nbsp;from lead time to cycle time to takt time and even more — you need the time tracker that will automate the most tedious parts of the process.

<p>
From the Snowden revelations we learned not only about NSA data collection projects, but also about many software tools that are used to analyze and search those data. These programs run on secure computer networks, isolated from the public internet. Here we will provide an overview of these networks that are used by the US military and US intelligence agencies.</p><p>

Besides computer networks, they also use a number of dedicated telephone networks, but gradually these are transferred from traditional circuit-switched networks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP" target="_blank">Voice over IP</a> (VoIP). This makes it possible to have only one IP packet-switched network for both computer and phone services. It seems that for example NSA's <a href="http://electrospaces.blogspot.com/2014/02/nsa-director-alexanders-phones.html#nsts">NSTS</a> phone system is now fully IP-based.</p><p><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hfFQW77nKhY/VPUo9x2bk3I/AAAAAAAACOc/MvGIApP5UE0/s1600/nsa-nsoc2006.jpg" imageanchor="1" target="_blank"><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hfFQW77nKhY/VPUo9x2bk3I/AAAAAAAACOc/MvGIApP5UE0/s1600/nsa-nsoc2006.jpg" width="450"></a><br>

The main US military and intelligence computer networks are (of course) only accessible for authorized personnel from the United States. Special security measures are in place to prevent interception by foreign intelligence agencies. Most of the tools and programs used by NSA run on JWICS and NSANet, but here we only mention them when this is confirmed by  documents. </p><blockquote>

These various military and intelligence networks run on a world-wide physical infrastructure that is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Information_Systems_Network" target="_blank">Defense Information Systems Network</a> (DISN), which is maintained by the <a href="http://www.disa.mil/" target="_blank">Defense Information Systems Agency</a> (DISA) and consists of landline, mobile, radio and satellite communication links.</p><p>

Most of these communication links are not connected to the public internet, but because radio and satellite transmissions can easily be intercepted by foreign countries, the security of these networks is assured by encryption. This encryption can also be used to run higher classified traffic over communication links with a lower classification level through Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnels.</p><p>

Classified communications have to be protected by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_Suite_A_Cryptography" target="_blank">Suite A Cryptography</a>, which contains very strong and classified encryption algorithms. On most networks this is implemented by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_1_product" target="_blank">Type 1</a> certified <a href="http://www.gdc4s.com/products/secure-voice-and-data-products-catergory-listing/network-encryption.html?taxonomyCat=326" target="_blank">TACLANE</a> (KG-175A/D) in-line network encryptors made by General Dynamics:</p><p><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-x4T0EMTWJlI/VP_kSFDBEDI/AAAAAAAACQ0/b3HG2jTkZqg/s1600/taclane_interop_2011.jpg" imageanchor="1" target="_blank"><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-x4T0EMTWJlI/VP_kSFDBEDI/AAAAAAAACQ0/b3HG2jTkZqg/s1600/taclane_interop_2011.jpg" width="400"></a><br>

</p>
<p>

As long there's the appropriate strong link encryption, only the end points with the computer terminals (where data are processed before they are encrypted) need strict physical and digital security requirements in order to prevent any kind of eavesdropping or interception by foreign adversaries.</p><p>

Most American military bases are connected to the SIPRNET backbone, but for tactical users in the field, the SIPRNet and JWICS networks can extend to mobile sites through Satellite Communications (SATCOM) links, like for example <a href="http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/TROJAN_SPIRIT" target="_blank">TROJAN SPIRIT</a> and TROJAN SPIRIT LITE, which consist of a satellite terminal that can be on a pallet, in a shelter, on a trailer or even connected to a transit case.</p><p>

Finally, there's the <b>Capitol Network</b> (CapNet, formerly known as Intelink-P), which provides Congressional intelligence consumers with connectivity to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelink" target="_blank">Intelink-TS</a> and <a href="http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/CIASource" target="_blank">CIASource</a>, the latter being the CIA's primary dissemination vehicle for both finished and unfinished intelligence reports.</p><p><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-h488Ajw2pV8/VrA6r26xQsI/AAAAAAAAC_s/ZqEaJoXWiCw/s1600/homeland-security-networks.jpg" imageanchor="1" target="_blank"><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-h488Ajw2pV8/VrA6r26xQsI/AAAAAAAAC_s/ZqEaJoXWiCw/s1600/homeland-security-networks.jpg" title="Major US Homeland Security computer networks" width="450"></a><br>

Besides the aforementioned networks that are only accessible for authorized military and intelligence personnel from the United States, there are also computer networks set up by the US for multinational coalitions, and which therefore can also be used by officials from partner countries. </p><p>

The group of countries that have access to such coalition networks is often denoted by a number of "Eyes" corresponding with the number of countries that participate.</p>

    <p><img src="https://techaid24.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Switch-Case-In-Python.jpg" alt="Python Switch Case"></p>

<p>The <em>switch</em> is a statement that evaluates the accuracy or similarity of the value of a certain input.
But isn’t that the same thing that the <em>if</em> statement does?
Let’s see this statement starting with <strong>bash</strong> scripting language.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>case</span> EXPRESSION in

  PATTERN_1<span>)</span>
    STATEMENTS
    <span>;;</span>

  PATTERN_2<span>)</span>
    STATEMENTS
    <span>;;</span>

  PATTERN_N<span>)</span>
    STATEMENTS
    <span>;;</span>

  *<span>)</span>
    STATEMENTS
    <span>;;</span>
<span>esac</span>
</code></pre></div><p><em>EXPRESSION</em> is an expression (command) or a variable. <em>PATTERN_N</em>, is a value that is expected from <em>EXPRESSION</em>. <em>*</em> is default value.</p>
<p>So given an <strong>EXPRESSION</strong>, I evaluate the <strong>PATTERN</strong> cases and if they don’t fit into the latter, the default <strong>*</strong> comes into play. Simple. Let’s see her at work.</p>
<h2 id="switch-work">Switch, work!</h2>
<p>Which fruit do you want?</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>echo</span> -n <span>"Enter the name of a fruit "</span>
<span>read</span> FRUIT

<span>echo</span> -n <span>"The </span><span>$FRUIT</span><span> is "</span>

    <span>echo</span> -n <span>"apple"</span>

<span>esac</span>
</code></pre></div><p>In bash everything is very simple and clear. Let’s see what happens in other languages.</p>
<h2 id="switch-in-other-languages">Switch in other languages</h2>
<p>In other languages such as Java and .NET C#, the switch case is a bit more complicated. However, compared to the simplicity of the bash case, the purpose is clear.

<h2 id="but-in-python">But in python?</h2>
<p>Python does not have any <em>switch</em> statements.
A <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3103/">PEP 3103</a> has been evaluated and created, but the conclusion is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the mean time, Python is fine without a switch statement, and perhaps those who claim it would be a mistake to add one are right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I was reflecting above, the switch case is very similar to the if statement.
An early form of switch in python could be given by <strong>if/elif/else</strong> statements.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>fruit</span> <span>=</span> <span>"banana"</span>
<span>if</span> <span>fruit</span> <span>==</span> <span>"apple"</span><span>:</span>

<span>else</span><span>:</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"The fruit is unknown"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This is simple to both read and understand. But it’s still not a switch statement. The switch evaluates the accuracy but also the similarity of a word.
There is an object in python which acts as a selector. Not for nothing have the two classes written in Java and C# above called “<em>Selector</em>”.</p>
<p>A selector evaluates an <strong>EXPRESSION</strong>, takes its value and checks the accuracy of the <strong>PATTERN</strong>, otherwise, it returns a default value (<strong>*</strong>).
The dictionary object is a kind of selector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A mapping object maps hashable values to arbitrary objects. Mappings are mutable objects. There is currently only one standard mapping type, the dictionary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being based on hash indexes, it is much faster in retrieving values. Let’s try to create our selector.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>myfruit</span> <span>=</span> <span>"banana"</span>
<span>fruits</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"apple"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is apple"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"banana"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is banana"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"blueberries"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is berries"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"raspberries"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is berries"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"blue currant"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is berries"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"currant"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is berries"</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>fruits</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>myfruit</span><span>,</span> <span>"The fruit is unknown"</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div><p>In this way, we made our switch selector, beautiful and “<em>pythonic</em>”. But still, the exactness but also the similarity of a word is not evaluated.</p>
<h2 id="can-it-be-improved">Can it be improved?</h2>
<p>Yes, of course!
Let’s now create a function that will act as a selector, as we’ve seen done in Java and C#.
There is a python builtin that applies filters. The function is called <em>filter</em>. Apply a function to an iterable. Functions such as terables are python objects and can be assigned as arguments to other functions. Also, our fruit selector (dictionary) is an iterable. We just need a function that evaluates the similarity of the keys.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>FruitSelector</span><span>(</span><span>fruit</span><span>):</span>
    <span>fruits</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>"apple"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is apple"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>"banana"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is banana"</span><span>,</span>

        <span>"raspberries"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is berries"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>"blue currant"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is berries"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>"currant"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is berries"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>"default"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is unknown"</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>dict</span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>key</span><span>:</span> <span>fruit</span> <span>in</span> <span>key</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span> <span>fruits</span><span>.</span><span>items</span><span>()))</span>

<span>FruitSelector</span><span>(</span><span>'banana'</span><span>)</span>
<span>FruitSelector</span><span>(</span><span>'anana'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>In python, methods of classes and functions are objects of type <em>Callable</em>. Being objects, information can be stored in them.
We will transform our selector into a switch, with an added value: the cache of the last selected fruit.
In python everything is an object and therefore can be treated as such.
If we wanted to abstract our selector even more to make it become a switch in effect, that’s it:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>switch</span><span>(</span><span>match</span><span>,</span> <span>dictionary</span><span>,</span> <span>default</span><span>=</span><span>"no match"</span><span>):</span>

</code></pre></div><h2 id="a-callable-switch">A callable switch</h2>
<p>Also, since functions in python are objects, it is possible to replace string values of the dictionary with functions and return them if the keys match, in this way, can be called. A very simple example.
In effect, that’s it:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>switch</span><span>(</span><span>match</span><span>,</span> <span>dictionary</span><span>,</span> <span>default</span><span>=</span><span>"no match"</span><span>):</span>

<span>minus</span><span>(</span><span>6</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In fact, <strong>python</strong> doesn’t need a switch statement. Do other programming languages really need it? I believe that in simple languages like <strong>bash</strong>, there is a real need for this construct. In <strong>Java</strong> you could do the same thing I did in python via a map object and same thing in <strong>C#</strong>. Finally, I agree with the conclusions of PEP 3103: <em>“In the mean time, Python is fine without a switch statement, and perhaps those who claim it would be a mistake to add one are right."</em></p>

			<p><small>January 10, 2021
            </small></p><p><a href="https://ohmlang.github.io/">Ohm</a> is an open-source parsing toolkit for JavaScript which <a href="http://www.tinlizzie.org/~awarth/">Alex Warth</a> and I have been working on since 2014. You can use it to parse custom file formats or quickly build parsers, interpreters, and compilers for programming languages.</p>
<p>This article is not about Ohm itself, but about the <strong>Ohm visualizer</strong>, which I designed and built in 2015 while working on Alex’s team at CDG.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Later, the team expanded the visualizer into the <a href="https://ohmlang.github.io/editor/#30325d346a6e803cc35344ca218d8636">Ohm Editor</a>, which we continued to actively develop over the years. The editor itself has been <a href="https://ohmlang.github.io/pubs/live2016/">presented before</a>, so I’ll focus specifically on the visualization here.</p>
<p>Creating the visualization was one of the most difficult and interesting design challenges I’ve ever tackled — so it’s been rewarding to hear from people who have found it to be helpful:</p>
<blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hey, I used Ohm for the first time a couple days ago.</p><p>I used to have an irrational fear of writing parsers.</p><p>Your visualization cured it.<br>Thanks a lot!</p></div>— Anselm Eickhoff (@ae_play) <a href="https://twitter.com/ae_play/status/1347325515770826757?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2021</a></blockquote>


<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Ohm is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar">parsing expression grammars</a> (PEGs), which are a formal way of describing syntax, similar to regular expressions and context-free grammars. Like other PEG-based tools, it uses <em>packrat parsing</em>, a form of top-down parsing with unlimited lookahead.</p>
<p>One of Ohm’s main goals is ease-of-use —&nbsp;not only for the end users of languages, but also for grammar authors. And debugging grammars can be a notoriously painful. So I designed and built an interactive visualization that makes the entire execution of the parser visible and tangible. This lets grammar authors <em>follow the flow</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> rather than “playing computer” and trying to simulate the execution in their head.</p>
<p>When creating or debugging a grammar, there are a few things you might be interested in:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the parse succeeded…<ul>
<li>…what does the parse tree look like?</li>
<li>Did it parse the input the way I intended? If not, why not?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the parse failed, why did it fail?</li>
</ul>
<p>Initially, I explored two different design directions: one focused on the output (the parse tree), and another that focused on the algorithm execution. The big challenge was to come up with a design that could do both.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> You can try out all the examples here online in the <a href="https://ohmlang.github.io/editor/">Ohm Editor</a>.</em></p>
<h2>Visualizing Parse Trees</h2>
<p>To visualize the parse tree, I chose a variant of the icicle plot (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2685881?seq=1">Kruskal and Landwehr 1983</a>). Some people may be more familiar with the <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html">flame graphs</a> used in software profilers, which are basically inverted icicle plots.</p>
<p>Each node is represented by a <span>gray rectangle</span>, with its children directly below it. A <span>dashed bottom border</span> indicates a node with hidden children. You can click on a node to show or hide its children.</p>
<p>Unlike most icicle plots, the absolute width of a box is not meaningful — only its width and position relative to the input text. Nodes always sit directly below the input text they consumed.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> This is emphasized by highlighting the relevant portion of the input when the cursor is over the node:</p>
<p><img src="https://dubroy.com/blog/images/arithmetic-parse-tree-hover.png" width="320px"></p>
<p>This means that the node must be at least as wide as its consumed input. We also ensure that the nodes are always wide enough to display the full label. So unlike most hierarchicial visualizations, there’s no need to hover over a node to see its label.</p>
<p>To satisfy both of these width constraints, the layout algorithm will expand the letter spacing of the input text where required:</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Expanding and collapsing a node.<br><i>(click to replay)</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<h2>Visualizing the parser execution</h2>
<p>A parse tree visualization can help you understand what the parse tree looks like, but only if the parse succeeded. If the input failed to parse, or if the parse tree is not what you intended, you’ll want to understand <em>why</em>.</p>
<p>To answer this question, I designed the “explain parse” feature, which shows a visual explanation of the parser’s execution. This can be enabled via the option panel in the lower right corner:</p>
<p><img src="https://dubroy.com/blog/images/explain-parse-checkbox.png"></p>
<p>Like other PEG-based tools, Ohm uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser">recursive-descent parsing</a>. A useful property of recursive-descent parsing is that parser’s execution (e.g. as represented by a dynamic call graph) has a very similar structure to the parse tree. This made it possible to design a single visualization that serves both purposes.</p>
<p>Let’s take a simple grammar for parsing credit card expiry dates. The animation below shows a trace of the logical steps taken to parse the input “08/24”.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://dubroy.com/blog/images/explain-parse-expiry.gif">
<figcaption>Stepping through the parse of “08/24”.<br><i>(click to replay)</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You can see that the tree is built in a top-down, left-to-right manner. Each non-leaf node is visited twice: once on the way down, and again on the way up. This is the basic structure of recursive-descent parsing. </p>
<p>In this extremely simple example, every step taken by the parser succeeds. So the execution trace looks <em>exactly</em> like the parse tree. This is not usually the case. Let’s take a look at a more complex example:</p>
<p><img src="https://dubroy.com/blog/images/parse-tree-and-grammar.png"></p>
<p>In this example, several steps in the parsing failed to match any input (shown with <span>red labels</span>). This doesn’t mean something went wrong — this is just part of the way that a packrat parser works. The screenshot above shows two different types of match failure that can happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>Failed branches of an <a href="https://github.com/harc/ohm/blob/master/doc/syntax-reference.md#alternation">alternation expression</a>, as seen under <code>idFirst</code>. The parser first attempts to match an underscore (<code>"_"</code>), which fails, before successfully matching <code>letter</code> on the second branch.</li>
<li>The last child of an <a href="https://github.com/harc/ohm/blob/master/doc/syntax-reference.md#repetition-operators---">repetition expression</a>. The repetition expression <code>idRest*</code> means  to match <code>idRest</code> as many times as possible; the last attempt will always fail by definition.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://dubroy.com/blog/images/highlighted-failures.png"></p>
<h3>Backtracking</h3>
<p>Another challenge in designing the visualization was how to deal with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking">backtracking</a>. In a packrat parser, backtracking happens when a successful match is part of a larger expression which fails.</p>
<p>For example, many programming languages contain <em>keywords</em> (e.g. <code>function</code>) which can appear in the same position as a variable name. A common way to handle this is to use <a href="https://github.com/harc/ohm/blob/master/doc/syntax-reference.md#negative-lookahead-"><em>negative lookahead</em></a> to prevent incorrectly matching a keyword at the beginning of an identifier like “functional”.</p>
<p>Here is the same grammar from before, modified to include a <em>functionKeyword</em> rule. And here is the visual explanation of matching the the input “functional”:</p>
<p><img src="https://dubroy.com/blog/images/functional-parse-tree-and-grammar.png"></p>
<p>The nodes with a <span>pink background</span> are nodes which successfully matched some portion of the input, but were ultimately discarded during backtracking.</p>
<h3>Left recursion</h3>
<p>One thing in Ohm that’s different from many similar tools is its special support for <em>left recursion</em>. The <a href="https://ohmlang.github.io/editor/#30325d346a6e803cc35344ca218d8636">arithmetic grammar</a> included in the Ohm Editor has some examples of left-recursive rules:</p>
<pre><code>  AddExp
    = AddExp "+" MulExp  -- plus
    | AddExp "-" MulExp  -- minus
    | MulExp
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that the first two branches of <em>AddExp</em> begin with a recursive application of <em>AddExp</em> itself — that’s left recursion. In a typical recursive-descent parser, this would result in infinite recursion. However, since it’s so convenient to define left-associative operators this way, the Ohm parsing algorithm detects these rules and handles them specially.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Ohm handles left recursion by iteratively trying to expand the input consumed by the left-recursive rule, and stopping when it can’t be expanded any further. As a grammar author, you might sometimes wonder why it stopped when it did. To find out, you can look at the special <span>[Grow LR]</span> node that appears as the last child of any left-recursive rule application:</p>
<p><img src="https://dubroy.com/blog/images/grow-left-recursion.png"></p>
<h2>Single-stepping</h2>
<p>One other feature of the visual parse explanation is the ability to single-step through the parser’s execution. In terms of information content, it doesn’t show anything that’s not already visible in the full visualization — so in a sense, it’s not strictly necessary. However, I hoped that it might help new users learn how the visualization works.</p>
<p>Single-stepping can be controlled through the buttons in the option panel:</p>
<p><img src="https://dubroy.com/blog/images/step-controls.png"></p>
<p>You can also right-click on any node and choose “step into” or “step out”:</p>
<p><img src="https://dubroy.com/blog/images/step-into.png"></p>
<p>From there, you can use the arrow keys to step forwards (→) or backwards (←) through the logical steps of the parser execution:</p>
<figure>

</figure>



<p>As I explained at the beginning, my goal with the Ohm visualizer was <strong>to make entire execution of the parser visible and tangible</strong>. In the end, I think I was able to achieve that — but I’m sure there are also many aspects of the design that could be improved. If you have ideas, please feel free to get in touch!</p>

        <hr id="5022b494-4d62-4cdb-949e-71cde6598179">
        
        <hr id="70bf0a0b-e2be-4205-ab11-7380136e2a36">
        
        <p id="6595f0c7-f94b-4772-8c12-22b107c82c47">End-user databases are all the buzz these days — Notion, Airtable, Coda, Roam, etc. These products have made it possible for people to model information in a way that feels more natural and intuitive to the way we experience it in our daily lives.</p>
        <p id="69014b56-b04f-4baf-be70-2c0ba0ad30e9">I love building products like Notion, but building these kinds of products is hard. For two reasons:</p>
        <ol id="3c07bc59-4c8a-4b48-bdb0-1bf930336c2e" start="1">
          <li>Most people don't have the technical literacy about databases and information architecture to actually automate and organize their lives with these tools.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol id="d5625fcf-2e32-45ce-acc4-d73e1d38d037" start="2">
          <li>The databases we have today aren't well-suited for dynamic user-generated filters and sorts.</li>
        </ol>
        <p id="aa0edb68-c072-4214-acf9-8e6e243900dd">This second challenge is more technical and I will hide all of these programmer-related details behind a toggle so you don't have to read them if you'd like.</p>
        <ul id="33a92bec-cc3c-4881-9fda-d91198d3ffee">
          <li>
            <details>
              <summary>🤖 Technical Details</summary>
              <p id="64d9a82d-8237-4a9f-b83f-eb9eae786157">Underneath any end-user database is <em>another</em> database and so much complexity arises from the challenge of building a database inside a database. Solutions to this problem vary widely and make some sort of trade-off between scalability (performance) and complexity.</p>
              <p id="9dd2cc1a-1eb6-4af8-9c22-d486c3e9dc99">Some applications load the entire end-user database in-memory. This creates long initial load times, but really performant interactions once the application loads. There are obvious scalability issues with this approach, but it is fairly simple to implement.</p>
              <p id="e10696df-1d8a-47ff-9365-701d9ff58d00">Other applications resort to O(n) scans on the server to fetch data and filter/sort records in memory with a few caching and indexing optimizations when convenient. The problem here is that users can create their own columns and filters dynamically. If your cloud application is backed by a SQL database, for example, it’s worrisome to allow users to edit the database schema and create an unbounded number of tables and indexes. Thus, you must resort to filtering records in-memory.</p>
              <p id="30d92414-92a1-4469-99ba-643219826c94">If you're dedicated to O(log n) queries, you'll need to build indexes yourself (unless there's some amazing database I am unaware of). On every write, you can compute what indexes need to be updated and you write to a NoSQL database to incrementally update a cached query result. This can lead to a good solution, but it comes at the cost of consistency. Now that you're building your own indexes outside of the database, writes are no longer transactional and you lose the guarantee of being able to read your own write.</p>
              <p id="c04b352e-bd9a-44ad-ba88-17ac5cc502ff">Another solution is to have a separate database for every user and allow users to edit the schema of their own isolated database. This allows writes to be transactional, but creates other kinds of collision problems (i.e. dealing with merge conflict) when you want users to be able to collaborate. With separate databases for each user, you're also doing a lot more computing labor, especially if the same records are shared amongst many people.</p>
              <p id="7c45a3a9-7051-4386-a53f-d246c9ba7310">Long story short, existing databases are not great for building end-user databases.</p>
              
            </details>
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p id="f41a9378-fc1b-4ea2-a13a-cb918178cff3">I plan to address this first reason by giving you a mental model of what databases are and a first-principles understanding of how they work.</p>
        <p id="1d0ea7ea-6760-43cc-a728-4b3a1d7efe3b">I'll introduce databases as an abstract concept and then we'll work through a real-world example to explore how databases leverage sorting and filters to lookup information quickly.</p>
        <p id="088e64ab-1cbd-49c2-85e5-ac16a93efcfa">By the end, I hope to show you how these information architecture concepts are immensely powerful and totally approachable for non-technical people. </p>
        <p id="69cf1cd2-0e55-4a55-8d70-a407a8cba1e3">Lastly, I want to convince you that software based on these concepts will be far superior to anything we use today for end-user database applications. If these concepts are interesting to you, <a target="_blank" href="mailto:ccorcos@gmail.com">please reach out</a>! I love sharing ideas. 😁</p>
        
        <p id="a546e1c2-8a2d-4d3a-8d6b-0e74b0f867f0">Databases are filing cabinets.</p>
        <p id="437c4e5d-072f-4e2c-a690-f23c26fa06f4">Databases don't have to be so complicated. If you strip away all the fancy semantics, you end up with something simple and familiar.</p>

        <p id="aef2d2df-d75a-43cf-a023-943585a6f450">Dictionaries, calendars, and filing cabinets are particularly useful because they represent information in a sorted order, making it possible for us to retrieve information quickly and efficiently using a process called <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">binary search</a>. Databases are no different, they're also containers of sorted information.</p>

        <h2 id="b5562604-4d38-4feb-84bd-6f536aea58cc">What is sorted information?</h2>
        <p id="2238e190-e73f-43c3-96d3-44daa545e966">Alphabetical, numerical, compound, lexicographical Encodings.</p>
        <p id="e4db1ca2-03e3-4767-883b-83b12f484fd6">The simplest way to sort something is alphabetically (a.k.a <em>lexicographically</em>) and this is how words are sorted in the dictionary. But we often find ourselves sorting by more than one property. For example, a contact list is often sorted by last name, <em>then</em> first name. This is called a <strong>compound sort</strong>. </p>
        
        <p id="3f686c5c-6eed-4ad6-8eb3-73168fa60be6">For example, notice that "Thomas Robins" should come before "Charlie Robinson" when sorting this way and that a compound sort is fundamentally different from simply joining the words together and then sorting.</p><pre id="82947e67-674e-4edd-8b12-6d7a800dee7a"><code>// Compound Sort: Last, First
Robins, Thomas
Robinson, Charlie

// Joining the words, then sorting: Last + First
RobinsonCharlie
RobinsThomas</code></pre>
        
        <p id="c545d059-b2b0-4678-8fd4-40aa6d7bdafd">We do this kind of compound sorting all over the place. Dates, in particular, are compound sorted by year, <em>then</em> month, <em>then</em> day.</p><pre id="cc0fb85d-ab5f-4e44-8947-0a504713b758"><code>January 10, 2019
...
December 28, 2019
...
August 26, 2020
...</code></pre>
        <p id="ef7175d9-a258-4f95-afe7-0ce9b274df54">Notice that this kind of sorting isn't exactly alphabetical. The months in a year are definitely not sorted alphabetically — each month has an underlying order within a year. Even days of the month aren't alphabetically sorted — they're numerically sorted.</p>
        
        <p id="9d475882-2657-4dc0-a0d4-7e8456c1a201">Numerical sorting is different from alphabetical sorting because alphabetical sorting compares letter-by-letter. For example, if we sorted numbers alphabetically, then 10 would come before 2 because the first digit "1" is before "2".</p><pre id="e4876df9-d390-4c6e-b0a8-c3201a7e43fa"><code>// Alphabetical Sort
1
10
11
2
3
...
9

// Numerical sort
1
2
3
...
9
10
11</code></pre>
        <p id="934e9af4-eb81-43ab-8dd1-9d973c87eb93">A simple way to represent numbers in a way that can be sorted alphabetically is to put zeros at the beginning of the number. This works well for small numbers with a known maximum size such as the months in a year. </p><pre id="245e5864-d979-4b11-944c-eb6a46ade312"><code>// Zero-padded numbers representing months in a year.
01
02
03
...
09
10
11
12</code></pre>
        <p id="becf436f-03a3-4bad-a0f7-519f75156d75">And in fact, we can represent dates in a way that can be sorted alphabetically using <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601 date format</a>. </p><pre id="6c4b1b11-3f63-4789-b0d5-4e0145fc9750"><code>2019-01-10
...
2019-12-28
...
2020-08-26
...</code></pre>
        
        <p id="82017443-040f-4acf-9810-23cd870f9c5e">Representing dates this way is convenient because it doesn't require domain knowledge to understand how to sort them. There are an infinite number of things that can be sorted arbitrarily: a deck of cards, the status of a project, your rock collection—they are all just different types of things.</p>
        <p id="7ddb731a-5ae6-4745-8134-9dc166ec26f4">In general, lexicographical encodings are important because they allow databases to store arbitrary information in the correct order without needing additional knowledge about the type of information that is being sorted.</p>
        
        <ul id="9983c3de-f661-4eb5-82a0-54f7af61c590">

              <p id="5339e8c2-5d28-41fe-8f64-fca7f3df92c3">You've probably experienced frustration with this when looking at files in your filesystem. <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_sort_order">Natural sort</a> solves this problem elegantly by representing both alphabetical and numerical sort at the same time.</p>
              <p id="22c8cbba-c26b-4fb1-8f46-f50abce95449">Representing numbers as lexicographically sortable is another interesting challenge, particularly very large and very small numbers. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ealmansi/elen/blob/master/resources/elen.pdf">Elen</a> is an interesting approach for encoding floating precision numbers.</p>
              <p id="31067abe-ad6c-4491-b84a-825c02101577">Tuples can be represented as compound sortable by separating each item with null-byte (and escaping null-bytes inside each item).</p>

        <p id="e0f0bb9b-fa2a-4b90-9201-a13005754346">You can think of databases much in the same way you think of system filing cabinets. To explore this analogy further, let's imagine that you are in charge of administering a police department where you keep track of a variety of information about every police officer in your region — name, badge number, address, and precinct, among other details.</p>
        
        <p id="60068181-62be-45e4-979e-b7a04b4d0ed9">As the administrator of this information, you're responsible for making sure that everything is up to date and easily accessible.</p>
        
        <p id="244c9ed1-6e90-4a3b-a370-59fa67d0cd5f">To keep things simple, you start by keeping all officer information in a filing cabinet sorted by badge number. This makes it easy to retrieve information about any officer based on their badge number, for example when an officer gets promoted or moves to a new address.</p>
        
        <figure id="7b5ff822-3bb7-4db6-b9a1-3872565c69bb"><img src="https://ccorcos.github.io/filing-cabinets/assets/Filing_cabinets_8.png">

        <h2 id="c78d6501-da7f-4633-b2e4-4a429cfd0008">Read/Write Trade-off</h2>
        <p id="e6dfff08-0cd8-4af5-96b2-448a8a05302c">How we copy information into other cabinets.</p>
        <p id="47066dd1-5373-4fac-8a18-0a29a5703390">One day, the police chief asks you for the address of every officer in the 60th precinct.</p>
        <p id="46c18841-1de6-4cd9-a084-cb39b033b939">With all of this information in a single filing cabinet sorted by badge number, this is a painful request because you have to scan through every file and check if each officer is in the 60th precinct.</p>
        <p id="9fb77909-54eb-4ecb-9059-10642f19e8f1">Maybe this is just a one-time request so you can labor over it and be done with it, but the police chief says that every month he wants to mail a bonus check to every officer in the precinct with the most arrests. If you're going to have to do this every month, maybe it's worthwhile to make this job a bit faster.</p>
        
        <p id="da5b845b-2a98-48f0-a688-857dd844a990">To solve this problem, you create another filing cabinet where you sort all officers by precinct. To keep things simple, you photocopy all of the information in the <em>Badge #</em> cabinet over to the <em>Precinct</em> cabinet. Now when the chief asks you to get the address of every officer in a precinct, you can use this new filing cabinet to quickly retrieve …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>DarkMarket, the world's largest illegal marketplace on the dark web, has been taken offline in an international operation involving Germany, Australia, Denmark, Moldova, Ukraine, the United Kingdom (the National Crime Agency), and the USA (DEA, FBI, and IRS). Europol supported the takedown with specialist operational analysis and coordinated the cross-border collaborative effort of the countries involved.</p>
<h3>DarkMarket in figures:</h3>
<ul><li>almost <strong>500 000 users</strong>;</li>
<li>more than <strong>2 400 sellers</strong>;&nbsp;</li>
<li>over <strong>320 000 transactions</strong>;</li>
<li>more than <strong>4 650 bitcoin</strong> and <strong>12 800 monero transferred</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>At the current rate, this corresponds to a sum of more than <strong>€140 million</strong>. The vendors on the marketplace mainly traded all kinds of drugs and sold counterfeit money, stolen or counterfeit credit card details, anonymous SIM cards and malware.</p>
<h3>Germany takes the lead</h3>
<p>The Central Criminal Investigation Department in the German city of Oldenburg arrested an Australian citizen who is the alleged operator of DarkMarket near the German-Danish border over the weekend. The investigation, which was led by the cybercrime unit of the Koblenz Public Prosecutor's Office, allowed officers to locate and close the marketplace, switch off the servers and seize the criminal infrastructure – more than 20 servers in Moldova and Ukraine supported by the German Federal Criminal Police office (BKA). The stored data will give investigators new leads to further investigate moderators, sellers, and buyers.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Europol's involvement</h3>
<ul><li>Facilitated international information exchange.</li>
<li>Provided specialist operational support.</li>
<li>Provided advanced analytics that assisted the German authorities in identifying and tracking down the alleged administrator.</li>
<li>Supported Germany in coordinating the cross-border collaborative effort involving international partners.</li>
</ul><h3>Europol's Dark Web Team</h3>
<div><p>One of Europol's initiatives is to create a coordinated law enforcement approach to tackle crime on the dark web. This involves law enforcement agencies from across and outside the EU and other relevant partners and organisations, such as Eurojust.</p><p>
&nbsp;
To achieve this goal, Europol’s <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/about-europol/european-cybercrime-centre-ec3">European Cybercrime Centre (EC3)</a> has established a dedicated Dark Web Team to work together with EU partners and law enforcement across the globe to reduce the size of this underground illegal economy.&nbsp;</p></div>
<p>It will deliver a complete, coordinated approach:&nbsp;</p>
<ul><li>sharing information;</li>
<li>providing operational support and expertise in different crime areas;</li>
<li>developing tools, tactics and techniques to conduct dark web investigations;</li>
<li>identifying threats and targets.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>The team also aims to enhance joint technical and investigative actions, organise training and capacity-building initiatives, together with prevention and awareness-raising campaigns – a 360° strategy against criminality on the dark web.</p>
<p>A shared commitment across the law enforcement community worldwide and a coordinated approach by law enforcement agencies have once again proved their effectiveness. The scale of the operation at Europol demonstrates the global commitment to tackling the use of the dark web as a means to commit crime.&nbsp;</p>
<hr><p>Headquartered in The Hague, the Netherlands, Europol supports the 27 EU Member States in their fight against terrorism, cybercrime, and other serious and organized crime forms. Europol also works with many non-EU partner states and international organisations. From its various threat assessments to its intelligence-gathering and operational activities, Europol has the tools and resources it needs to do its part in making Europe safer.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p>Despite your expectations I’m going to support that cheesy header with a real
talk! Fraudsters will hate you.</p>
<p>We have this site with classified ads in Ukraine, <a href="https://vsevolod.net/antifraud/olx.ua">OLX</a> and it is
completely plagued with spam and fraud. I create an ad to sell something I don’t
need anymore, and within a couple of hours I have some stupid fraud in my
inbox. What baffles me is that it’s very easy and simple to fix, and they do
nothing.</p>
<p>Back in 2006 I was involved in one of the forks of an open source project
<a href="https://www.l2jserver.com/">L2J</a> (so-called “server emulator”), which was a
re-creation of the server part of then-popular game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineage_II">Lineage
II</a> of MMORPG genre.</p>
<p>A lot of the servers were plagued with bots (official servers too). There were
two variants for the bot software — a standalone one that communicated with a
server on its own, and another one that controlled an interface of an actual
client (in-game bot).</p>
<p>In-game bot required much more resources to run (basically, a separate computer
per bot), so the majority of the problems were created by standalones, you could
easily run ten of them from a regular computer.</p>
<p>We discussed this problem in a developer chat and had an idea — maybe these
standalone bots have some differences while talking to the server? We tried to
investigate that and indeed, the order of packets was completely different
between a standalone bot and a regular game client.</p>
<p>It was straightforward to detect and reject bots on connect, but then it would
be too obvious. So we started detecting them on connect, and disconnecting and
banning after some random time online, like 2..5 minutes.</p>
<p>Of course, generally bot developers aimed at official servers and couldn’t care
less about some anti-bot defense on free emulator servers, so we didn’t spend
too much brain activity on it. Nevertheless, it was committed into the
Subversion repository with a completely unsuspicious “small fix” message (open
source!).</p>
<p>It sounds a lot like security by obscurity, as I’m writing it now. I am not an
anti-fraud expert, however, it looks like it really is — we need to detect some
suspicious activities, and then stop them in a way that doesn’t immediately tell
fraudsters about it. Why? To make “debugging” around our defense a much harder
problem.</p>
<p>For example, if we needed to do better with those bots, one way to go was to
keep track of a cumulative bot time on a player’s account in a database and ban
it some time into the future. Maybe an hour or two, maybe a day, or even a week.</p>
<p>There is also a technique called “shadow ban”, that’s sometimes used on
forums. For a shadowbanned person everything looks the same, they can view
everything and post comments, just their responses are not visible to anyone
else (except moderators), so they’re not causing a stir on a forum, and do not
launch attacks onto it from other places, because they do not perceive it as an
attack on them.</p>
<p>We could have employed something akin to a shadow ban. Stop bots from interacting
with other users from time to time. Drop their packets a lot when they’re in a
battlefield, so they and their party-members end up being killed by mobs.</p>
<p>I don’t think it’s always possible to employ these delayed responses — anything
financial and we’re out of luck? I’m not familiar with that field, never worked
at a bank or a payment processor. Would be interesting to learn a bit about
that.</p>
<p>So, back to classified ads. They could raise their defenses a bit, and with a
clever shadow ban technique (mark messages as read when a recipient logs in,
etc) it would eliminate a lot of the fraudulent activity from the platform.</p>
<p>If a fraudster tries this and tries that and there is no apparent benefit and it
seems like everything works, but people just don’t fall for a scam — will they
continue to try more and more sophisticated attacks? To a certain extent, later
they’ll get bored with having no results.</p>
<p>We also need good anomaly detection mechanisms. It starts with good logging and
monitoring, and with user complaints, just like any other performance problem or
a bug. Of course, later you can start to employ different machine learning
techniques, but it shouldn’t be the first step, and you need to do it really
carefully.</p>
<p>It’s very maddening for legit users to fall prey to some stupid algorithm that
can be hard to fix. Gather more cases and re-train a model? Maybe employ
heuristics to fix some corner-cases? In any case, a model's decision should be
overridable by moderators.</p>
<p>Sometimes people will pierce through your defenses anyway, so you’ll have to
react quickly, identify new patterns, shadow ban them, etc.</p>
<p>Sometimes it can be fixed by a product change. For example, if there is some
kind of bonus system, make it so users can spend bonuses only on themselves,
ship products paid with bonuses to the existing address only (that has a history
of successful deliveries from a given account), etc.</p>
<p>Removing an incentive to fraud is the best strategy.</p>
<p>After running a service for some time you’ll get a grip on how these things are
done.</p>
<p>Even Twitter seemingly managed to remove that Bitcoin “ElonMuskque
giveaways”. What took them so long I don’t understand, but if even Twitter did
it — you can do it too.</p>
<p>Just do it.</p>

<p>Open Source Security, Inc is proud to announce its funding of a full-time and 
public development effort of a <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a> front-end for <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>.
In this blog post, we'll detail the motivations for our involvement and the benefits the public will reap
as a result of this effort.</p>

<h2>A Security Need</h2>

<p>In July of last year, shortly after my virtual <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Kza6fdkSU">presentation</a> at the Linux Security Summit 
North America entitled <a href="https://grsecurity.net/10_years_of_linux_security.pdf">"10 Years of Linux Security - A Report Card"</a>, we put out a 
<a href="https://twitter.com/spendergrsec/status/1283005179135221761">call</a> to other 
companies interested in funding a GCC front-end for Rust.

The motivation for this arose
from outreach from Nick Desaulniers of Google on <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAKwvOdmuYc8rW_H4aQG4DsJzho=F+djd68fp7mzmBp3-wY--Uw@mail.gmail.com/T/">LKML</a> 
to discuss the possibility of Rust support in the Linux kernel at the upcoming Linux 
Plumbers Conference.  One obvious hurdle mentioned immediately was that the kernel is most 
commonly compiled with GCC, while Rust currently requires rustc/LLVM.  According to reports of
the resulting discussion, kernel 
developers were open to the idea of allowing the kernel to be built with GCC and the Rust 
portions with LLVM, as long as the two were ABI compatible.</p>

<p>Such discussions appeared to sidestep a more fundamental issue however: the security 
viability of a mixed assembly/C/Rust execution environment and how cohesive security 
functionality could be provided while mixing different compilers with different 
implementations/availability of said functionality.  The importance of this topic, though apparent 
on reflection, was formalized just recently in a paper by Michalis Papaevripides and Elias 
Athanasopoulos of the University of Cyprus entitled <a href="https://www.cs.ucy.ac.cy/~eliasathan/papers/tops20.pdf">"Exploiting Mixed 
Binaries"</a>.  In it, they detail how the overall security of an execution 
environment can be reduced by the introduction of code written in Rust or that of another 
language where the same binary-level security is not provided by the compiler.  An excerpt from page 3 of the paper makes the impact clear:</p>

<blockquote>
"We experimentally show that CFI can be bypassed using Rust/Go code for developing clearly 
more straight-forward exploits than current state-of-the-art CFI bypasses [57, 70]. Our 
exploits do not rely on respecting the statically computed Control-flow Graph (CFG) for 
bypassing the enforced CFI and are much simpler to implement. [ ... ]
Again, we stress here that in the absence of the safe part (Rust/Go code), the unsafe part 
cannot be trivially exploited."
</blockquote>

<p>
The same exact scenario above was one of the motivations for Microsoft to recently push for their
<a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/08/17/control-flow-guard-for-clang-llvm-and-rust/">Control Flow Guard (CFG) support</a>
in Clang and Rust (see the heading of "Rust linked with C/C++").
</p>

<p>As the source of the GCC plugin infrastructure in the Linux kernel and nearly all of the GCC plugins adapted
for inclusion in the upstream Linux kernel, we too immediately spotted the importance of this problem and set out
to ensure both those plugins as well as the security features built-in to GCC itself are able to instrument code
from all languages supported by the Linux kernel with compatible and consistent security properties.</p>

<h2>Funding Process</h2>

<p>So despite not expecting Rust code to land in the Linux kernel in the near future, we reached out to other 
companies as mentioned above to pull together funding for the GCC front-end effort.  None of the leads 
came to fruition, so we as a company decided to bootstrap the process, in the hopes that as progress in the work
is observed, others would join in.  Further, we wanted to offer funding under the same terms we would want as developers, 
across the entire spectrum: stability, salary, benefits, ownership, etc -- not token compensation or bounties 
that treat those working on free/open source software for the public as somehow <em>less</em> than 
developers of proprietary code.  To that end, we decided to fund the first year of a full-time
developer for the work ourselves.</p>

<p>If the failed experiment of the Core Infrastructure Initiative (<a href="https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/">CII</a>) taught us anything, it's that
one finds dedicated and competent developers for some work not among whoever happens to apply, but 
among those already involved in the work as a passion project.  This led us to reach out 
to <a href="https://thephilbert.io/">Philip Herron</a>, who we noticed was <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs">already working</a> on a GCC front-end for Rust with involvement
of external contributors.  We were extremely pleased to hear Philip was interested in performing the work 
full-time.</p>

<p>News of our outreach eventually extended to the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/steering.html">GCC Steering 
Committee</a>, who contacted us to coordinate efforts.  They were very helpful in recommending to us <a href="https://www.embecosm.com/">Embecosm</a>, a UK-based company with deep experience and involvement in 
GCC/LLVM development, among many other areas.  Embecosm graciously offered to contribute to the effort by 
handling Philip's employment and, at no cost to us, providing project management services to help ensure the project's success.  
The location, expertise, and sharing of our vision of doing right by the developer couldn't have been a 
better match.</p>

<h2>Vendor-Neutral, Developed in the Open</h2>

<p>To make sure the project remains vendor-neutral and in the public interest, Open Source Security, Inc. will not own any of the copyright over the code developed through its funding.
All relevant GCC code for the project is GPLv3-licensed and copyright is assigned, as required for upstream GCC inclusion, to the Free Software Foundation (FSF).  The work is being performed in the open, with Philip providing public monthly status updates on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/Reporting">https://github.com/Rust-GCC/Reporting</a>.  Reports are already available for the months of November and December.
</p>

<h2>Get Involved</h2>

<p>For more information about the "how" of this effort, Embecosm has prepared a 
blog at <a href="https://www.embecosm.com/2021/01/12/gcc-rust-how-it-can-be-achieved/">https://www.embecosm.com/2021/01/12/gcc-rust-how-it-can-be-achieved/</a> that we encourage 
all those interested to read.  To get involved in contributing technical work to the 
effort, Philip can be found on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/the_philbert">@the_philbert</a> or committing to the project's Github repository at <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs">https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs</a>.

<![CDATA[Making VoIP Calls with Antique Rotary Phones]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>One of the worst parts of modern life is how <em>unsatisfying</em> it is to hang up on somebody. Tapping on the ‘End Call’ button on an iPhone or angrily clicking ‘Leave Meeting’ on Zoom just isn’t nearly as fun as slamming down the handset on a <em>real phone</em>.</p>
<p>This particular project was to breathe some life into the antique Northern Telecom phone from my grandparents’ house by attaching it to a modern VoIP system. This was surprisingly difficult, but very satisfying as the result is essentially a free ‘vintage’ landline for my home.</p>
<p><img src="https://nbailey.ca/images/nt500.jpg" alt="Northern Telecom model 500"></p>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-phone">The Phone</h3>
<p>The device in question is a NT analog phone, based on the classic Western Electric model 500. The models are very similar with only minor differences, for example the printing of the numbers on the dial is slightly different for models from Canada. Based on the stamp marks on the bottom, I believe this phone was manufactured in 1969 and installed shortly after, which does match up with when my grandparents would have purchased their first phone.</p>
<p>On its own, this telephone would not work with any modern telecom system. The ‘pulse dial’ that it produces is not compatible with modern telephone equipment and VoIP adapters alike.</p>
<p>I can’t get a good source on this, but most telephone exchanges in urban areas haven’t accepted pulse dial signals for decades. Some areas may still accept pulse signalling depending on the age of their equipment, but in 2021 I doubt there are many left. Seeing as how Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling">DTMF</a>) signalling has been the standard for over forty years, <em>nearly all</em> VoIP equipment was manufactured without support for old devices.</p>
<h3 id="pulse-dialling">Pulse Dialling</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.rfwireless-world.com/images/pulse-dialing.jpg" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.rfwireless-world.com/">Photo Source: RF Wireless World</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pulse dialing is very simple as it is derived from the mechanical rotation of the dial. As it turns from the dialed digit back to the resting position it toggles the local loop voltage to transmit the data to the FXO. In the old days, these voltage ‘ticks’ were used to rotate mechanical switches in the exchange stations to connect physical circuits needed to complete a call.</p>
<h3 id="dtmf-dialling">DTMF Dialling</h3>
<p>DTMF on the other hand is an in-band signalling method using eight different frequencies transmitted in pairs. To use the example from Wikipedia, to transmit a ‘1’ on a DTMF system it will transmit two tones, 1209Hz and 695Hz together:</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/MultiTone1.png" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling#/media/File:MultiTone1.png">Photo Source: Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These tones are the beeps we’re used to hearing when dialing. Even my cell phone creates these tones when you type on the on-screen keypad in the ‘Phone’ app, though it’s mostly for ‘cosmetic’ reasons. Theoretically one could use these tones to dial on a rotary phone if you held the speaker of the cell phone up to the microphone of the telephone while dialling, though I couldn’t get it to reliably work.</p>
<h3 id="converting-signalling">Converting signalling</h3>
<p>So, the first piece of equipment I needed was a pulse-tone converter. Indeed, such a device does exist to convert the ‘ticks’ produced by the rotary dial to the ‘beeps’ produced by most keypad phones. I was a little squeamish about tearing apart a working antique, so I opted to buy an external dial tone converter box from <a href="https://www.oldphoneworks.com/pulse-to-tone-converters/">OldPhoneWorks</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.oldphoneworks.com/images/D/small%202-212.jpg" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.oldphoneworks.com/pulse-to-tone-converter.html">Photo Source: OldPhoneWorks</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a very simple device which listens for the pulse tones and using tiny DSP chips converts them to DTMF tones. If your only goal was to use the old phone with a POTS landline this would be sufficient, but I want to connect this to VoIP.</p>
<h3 id="the-sip-ata-box">The SIP ATA box</h3>
<p>There are <em>heaps</em> of Analog Telephone Adapter (ATA) boxes on the market, but in the interest of keeping this project low-cost I opted to purchase a new-old-stock <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/csbpvga/pap2t/administration/guide/pap2t_user.pdf">Linksys PAP2T-NA</a> device from eBay. I wasn’t too worried about security since the device sits in the ‘enclave’ part of my home network isolated from personal devices, and won’t have any ports forwarded to it. I was initially worried that my custom <a href="https://nbailey.ca/post/linux-firewall-ids">Linux router</a> would cause issues with the UDP traffic RTP creates, but it handled it wonderfully.</p>
<p>Setup was fairly straightforward to begin with, entering my sub-account credentials and SIP proxy server. Without too much fuss the device was registered and communicating with my provider.</p>
<p>However, I did run into some strange issues after initially setting it up. First, the ring pattern was intermittent and sounded <em>strange</em>. After a couple test calls I also found that both sides of the conversation were quiet when using the vintage phone. With some fiddling, I rectified these by increasing power limits slightly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changed ring waveform to Sinusoid</li>
<li>Changed ring voltage to 90</li>
<li>Changed FXS port power limit -3 -&gt; 5</li>
<li>Changed FXS port input &amp; output gain -3 -&gt; 0</li>
</ul>
<p>I chalk these up to the mechanical nature of the ringer and the age of the mic/speaker. After all, there’s a lot more energy involved in moving a hammer around than powering a little beeper.</p>
<h3 id="making-calls">Making calls</h3>
<p>That night, I successfully ordered a pizza using an antique phone. Dialing was laborious, but novel for somebody my age, and honestly kind of fun.</p>
<p>Monthly costs are minimal, only $0.80 for the DID number and an additional $0.005 per minute. Calls are clear and sound great, and after nearly a month of use I can say that it’s reliable and solid as a ‘landline’ replacement. Plus, it makes a great conversation piece!</p>
<p>There are certainly improvements I would could make, for example adding SRTP to add another layer of security for my calls. It would also be nice to add additional handsets to my house to build an ‘intercom’ - that is if I can find more old phones.</p>

Today we share an interview exploring Joel’s more than four decades in the software industry.</h2><hr><h3>Let’s start at the beginning. What did you study in school?</h3><p>I started as a math major at UMBC with no thought of working with computers. A chess friend pushed me to take Intro to Computer Programming, and I reluctantly enrolled.</p><p>After struggling through the first half of this poorly taught Fortran class, it clicked and I was hooked. UMBC was too small to offer a CS major at the time. I took the three computer classes they offered, and then transferred to University of Michigan.</p><p>At that time there were three big players in mainframe computing: IBM, Univac, and Burrows. Michigan was an IBM school, so I learned IBM mainframe assembler, data structures, computer theory, and operating systems. Operating systems were tough. We wrote in IBM assembler adding paging and virtual memory to a fixed memory operating system.</p><h3>What was your first job out of school? What kind of technology were you using back then?</h3><p>I started my career working for the Detroit area school districts. COBOL was the lingua franca in 1975, although PL/1 and IBM assembler were occasionally used where I worked. Everything was batch processing, key punch cards, card readers, and flat files (which were mostly on tape because disk storage was so expensive). Online systems and databases had yet to hit the mainstream.</p><p>At my first job, I mainly supported batch COBOL applications for the school districts. We used Job Control Language (JCL)—a rather confusing “language” in its own right—to direct what programs to run, what files to read and write, and where to print the reams of output. We carried these JCL decks (to print, compile, and run) in our shirt pockets and always had rubber bands around our wrists.</p><p>The term “killing trees” was not an exaggeration! Computers didn’t have monitors. A single compile could generate 10 or more printed pages of 14″x11″ green bar paper, whereupon you’d find a typo in your program, re-punch a card, stick it in the deck and run it again. If the program compiled but blew up, you’d get a single error code and reams of hexadecimal core dump to decipher as you looked for your logic error.</p><h3>How did your early experiences shape your approach to programming?</h3><p>My very first assignment was to modify a complex statistical test scoring program in PL/1. The author, a PhD in statistics, fancied himself a programming wizard as measured by . . . brevity. Seriously!</p><p>This genius used one character variable names (a, b, c, etc..) or two if absolutely necessary (aa, ab, ac). He nested loops three-deep on one line. In a word, his code was undecipherable.</p><p>As I untangled his code, I vowed to myself I would never do that to anybody. I realized that we always write for the next person who will read our code. Code should be as clear and understandable as I can make it. This was before any standards or formalized methodologies existed. Today we call this idea “clean code” and it’s baked into the culture of BTI360.</p><h3>Can you summarize the changes you’ve seen over 4+ decades in this field?</h3><p>The technical changes are too vast to adequately describe: from punch cards and a “cutting edge” 16 MB IBM mainframe to Object-Oriented Programming, big data, and the internet of things. So many tools that we take for granted, like relational databases, did not exist when I started.</p><p>Corporate culture was also very different in my early career. Cigarette, cigar, and pipe smoking was rampant until the late 80s. I’d sit in smoke-filled meetings and come out wheezing, reeking of tobacco. Also, the dress was different. I was required to wear a conservative suit, tie, and leather shoes until around 2000 when business casual became popular (my employer waited until <em>after</em> IBM relaxed their dress code).</p><p><a href="http://3skoz1yr97849dum72v8p1rj-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JoelAndLes-captioned2.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="4297" data-permalink="https://www.bti360.com/interview-looking-back-on-4-decades-in-the-software-industry/joelandles-captioned2/" data-orig-file="https://www.bti360.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JoelAndLes-captioned2.jpg" data-orig-size="875,679" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="JoelAndLes-captioned2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://www.bti360.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JoelAndLes-captioned2-400x310.jpg" data-large-file="https://www.bti360.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JoelAndLes-captioned2.jpg" loading="lazy" src="https://3skoz1yr97849dum72v8p1rj-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JoelAndLes-captioned2.jpg" alt="" width="875" height="679" srcset="https://3skoz1yr97849dum72v8p1rj-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JoelAndLes-captioned2.jpg 875w, https://3skoz1yr97849dum72v8p1rj-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JoelAndLes-captioned2-400x310.jpg 400w, https://3skoz1yr97849dum72v8p1rj-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JoelAndLes-captioned2-768x596.jpg 768w, https://3skoz1yr97849dum72v8p1rj-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JoelAndLes-captioned2-564x438.jpg 564w" sizes="(max-width: 875px) 100vw, 875px"></a>Maybe more surprising is how my own perspective shifted over four decades. Initially, I was attracted to programming because of all the cool stuff you could do with technology. But as I think back on my career, I realize that my focus gradually shifted to the high-powered teams and great relationships you could build around technology.</p><h3>Tell us about your experience working with W. Edwards Deming.</h3><p>Sure, for those who don’t know, Deming was an engineer turned management consultant. He went to Japan and had an enormous impact on their manufacturing industry. Many credit him with sparking the miraculous Japanese post-war economic recovery in the 1950s.</p><p>I encountered Deming when I was working at GM. He was brought in to consult with the division I was working in. I attended meetings with Deming and somewhere I have a grainy, out-of-focus photo of us together.</p><p>Deming was ahead of his time. He had a lot of ideas that were quite provocative to American automakers in those days. Some of his best ideas for GM were around improving the systems in which their employees worked—creating an environment for success. Management was so obsessed with individual performance, that they could miss systemic factors that were holding everyone back.</p><p>Of course, Deming’s influence continues to this day. You see his ideas reflected in agile methodologies as well as in books like <em>Drive</em> by Daniel Pink.</p><h3>You worked for Ross Perot as well?</h3><p>Yes. In 1984 GM acquired Ross Perot’s software company, EDS. All of GM’s IT folks either transitioned to EDS or quit. Although Perot is best known nationally for his quirky presidential bid and debate performances, he was very effective in the contexts where I encountered him.</p><p>Perot had been the top-selling salesman at IBM. He wanted them to get into software services, and when they didn’t he founded EDS to fill the need himself. EDS grew to be a multi-billion dollar company. Perot had a folksy, charming manner. I can still picture him sitting on a table in the front of a meeting room, rather than using the podium.</p><p>Perot was known for being loyal to his people. The most famous example is when he sent a team of civilians to Iran to free two wrongfully imprisoned EDS employees who had been working in Tehran. Perot oversaw the mission personally from Turkey. It’s a wild story that was documented in a best-selling book, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Wings_of_Eagles">On Wings of Eagles</a></em>. I met one of the EDS employees who was rescued.</p><h3>What’s next for you in retirement?</h3><p>Plans?? I thought retirement was the time in my life I didn’t need to follow any plans! I certainly have a lot of interests and activities to keep me busy. I’ll continue to stay active with biking, running and swimming and do the occasional triathlon. I’ve always been intrigued by riding a unicycle. I plan to learn. I’d like also to get back into woodworking and photography.</p><p>My biggest near-term project is my retirement puppy, Cosmo, a little Havanese. I’m currently learning to be a dog owner and train a puppy. Eventually, I would like to train and certify him as a therapy dog and take him to comfort kids and the elderly in hospitals and long-term care facilities.</p><h3>Thanks so much for sharing these reflections with us, Joel.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Welcome to all our new subscribers! I write a weekly newsletter, sent out every Sunday, with curated quotes and one-line takeaways from material that I think is worth reading. Occasionally, I share my own thoughts, inspired by others’ writings, on Tuesdays. If you enjoy our newsletter, please share it with a few friends/colleagues or follow me on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/ButWhatForBlog">Twitter</a>.</em></p><p><em>As always, any suggested materials for our Sunday newsletter can be sent to social@butwhatfor.com. </em></p><p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shel_Silverstein">Shel Silverstein</a></strong> was an American writer, poet, cartoonist, songwriter, and playwright. He is known for his cartoons, songs, and children's books. His books have been translated into more than 30 languages and have sold more than 20 million copies, and he was the recipient of two&nbsp;Grammy Awards (“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZNZt5qVgvM">A Boy Named Sue</a>” as popularized by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZR5XGTpophI">Johnny Cash</a>, and a recording of his famous “<a href="https://amzn.to/35xJz6N">Where the Sidewalk Ends</a>”).</p><p>For her first Christmas, my parents got my niece Shel Silverstein’s <em>Where the Sidewalk Ends </em>(apparently expectations are high for the six-month mark). I grew up reading its collection of poems, over and over. I even - to the horror of some of my readers, I am sure - used colored pencils (because I didn’t yet appreciate the waxy beauty of crayons) to color in some of Silverstein’s famous illustrations. </p><p>The gift sent me down memory lane. Re-reading a selection of those poems from all those years ago, I was struck by just how much more there is to much of Silverstein’s writing than his characteristic style and funny words.</p><p>Take the namesake of that book - <em>Where the Sidewalk Ends</em> - for example. As a child, reading the poem brought to me images of running out into a grassy field somewhere. And that is what Silverstein is writing about. </p><p>But why didn’t I realize that the place “before the street begins” was so radiant? It is “soft and white,” burning “crimson bright,” with a mint-sweet smell in the air. What happens, once we arrive in the city, that changes nature into a place where the “smoke blows black” and the winding “dark streets” are pitted and cracked?  </p><p>Are the “asphalt flowers” supposed to be nature succumbing to industry? Or are we even talking about nature?</p><p>Maybe we are the flowers, trapped in cracks of a toiling modern life - meaning we never grow into what we were meant to be? Why is it that only the children see the “chalk-white arrows” and know they lead to “the place where the sidewalk ends,” while adults might have forgotten how to get there altogether?</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Where the Sidewalk Ends</strong></em></p><p>There is a place where the sidewalk ends<br>And before the street begins,<br>And there the grass grows soft and white,<br>And there the sun burns crimson bright,<br>And there the moon-bird rests from his flight<br>To cool in the peppermint wind.</p><p>Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black<br>And the dark street winds and bends.<br>Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow<br>We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow,<br>And watch where the chalk-white arrows go<br>To the place where the sidewalk ends.</p><p>Yes we’ll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,<br>And we’ll go where the chalk-white arrows go,<br>For the children, they mark, and the children, they know<br>The place where the sidewalk ends.</p></blockquote><p>And what about the unhappy crocodile with a toothache? Isn’t it true that we often run through life <a href="https://www.butwhatfor.com/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water/">not listening to other’s difficulties because of our preoccupation with solely our own lives</a>, meaning others have no option but to do the same?</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>The Crocodile's Toothache</strong></em></p><p>Oh the Crocodile<br>Went to the dentist<br>And sat down in the chair,<br>And the dentist said, 'Now tell me, sir,<br>Why does it hurt and where?'<br>And the Crocodile said, 'I'll tell you the truth.<br>I have a terrible ache in my tooth.'<br>And he opened his jaws so wide, so wide,<br>That the dentist he climbed right inside,<br>And the dentist laughed, 'Oh, isn't this fun?'<br>As he pulled the teeth out, one by one.<br>And the Crocodile cried, 'You're hurting me so!<br>Please put down your pliers and let me go.'<br>But the dentist just laughed with a Ho Ho Ho,<br>And he said, 'I still have twelve to go --<br>Oops, that's the wrong one, I confess.<br>But what's one crocodile's tooth, more or less?'<br>Then suddenly the jaws went snap,<br>And the dentist was gone right off the map.<br>And where he went one could only guess...<br>To North or South or East or West...<br>He left no forwarding address.<br>But what's one dentist more or less?</p></blockquote><p>And we all need to remember to not take ourselves too seriously because creativity doesn’t come without the chance of looking at least a little bit silly.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Put Something In</strong></em></p><p>Draw a crazy picture,<br>Write a nutty poem,<br>Sing a mumble-grumble song,<br>Whistle through your comb.<br>Do a loony-goony dance<br>'Cross the kitchen floor,<br>Put something silly in the world<br>That ain't been there before.</p></blockquote><p>But then I came across one of Silverstein’s works that I had not read before - thanks to the power of Google and the <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/02/12/the-missing-piece-meets-the-big-o-shel-silverstein/">endless curiosity of Maria Popova</a>. Flipping through the pages of <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2MS9KhT">The Missing Pieces Meets the Big O</a></em>, I landed on a little bit of a different takeaway than Maria did. </p><p>She is probably closer to correct, but I thought I would share the story and my own thoughts anyway - which is related to <a href="https://www.butwhatfor.com/charlie-munger/">Charlie Munger</a>’s ideas on dealing with adversity: “<a href="https://www.butwhatfor.com/dont-feel-like-a-victim-facing-adversity-with-charlie-munger/">If you just take the attitude that, however bad it is in any way,&nbsp;it’s always your fault and you just fix it as best you can&nbsp;– the so-called ‘iron prescription’ –&nbsp;I think that really works.</a>”</p><p>Pictures sourced from <a href="https://archive.org/stream/missingpiecemeet00silv">Open Library</a>.</p><p>We meet a lonely, pointy shape that wants nothing more than to be able to roll.

<p><span>L</span>ast year, as Russia faced a rising tide of coronavirus infections, Tatyana Bakalchuk stepped into the spotlight. Newly <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/02/20/wildberries-founder-becomes-russias-richest-woman-a69365">crowned</a> as the country’s richest woman, the owner of online retail giant Wildberries released <a href="https://cloud.mail.ru/public/3HAf/4TwvE8ZGU">a video statement</a> promising that digital merchants would rise to the challenge of lockdown.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sitting alone on a large sofa with her hands clasped firmly in her lap, Bakalchuk outlined a set of rules for pandemic-era internet trading before attacking shopping malls and stores for their irresponsible approach to safety, arguing they should instead be repurposed as collection points for online orders. “Stay at home, and we’ll take care of you and your loved ones,” pledged the founder. “We’re a great country that has more than once gotten out of the most difficult situations.”</p>



<p>Such public leadership was a departure for the poetry-writing former English teacher. In her 16 years in business, Bakalchuk typically avoided media scrutiny and claimed in an <a href="https://tass.ru/business-officials/8759963">interview last year</a> that she aspired to a “quiet life.” But as Wildberries consolidates its position as Russia’s biggest online retailer — its unmissable pink-and-purple branding can be found from the Baltic Sea to the Pacific Ocean — she has stepped out of the shadows. In recent years, Bakalchuk has, among other things, appeared at business conferences, held public meetings with ministers, and even attended celebrity events in an attempt to boost her public profile. A Wildberries spokesperson, however, declined to answer questions for this article.</p>



<p>Wildberries is comfortably ahead in the cutthroat race to become Russia’s Amazon. The company has underwritten its growth by catering to low-income consumers via offline collection points, free delivery, and rolling discounts. And the coronavirus pandemic has only strengthened its lead. With almost a million orders a day, Wildberries all but doubled its payroll last year and quadrupled the size of its supplier network to almost 80,000 firms and individuals. While real estate tycoon Elena Baturina officially reclaimed her title as Russia’s richest woman in 2020, <a href="https://www.forbes.ru/milliardery/414621-ocenka-sostoyaniya-vladelicy-wildberries-tatyany-bakalchuk-vyrosla-do-10-mlrd"><em>Forbes</em> magazine</a> has suggested that Bakalchuk’s personal fortune could be as much as $10 billion.</p>



<p>Bakalchuk has described how she set up the company a month after giving birth in 2004, while still suffering from postpartum depression. “I didn’t want to be known as just ‘someone with a child,’” she said in her first-ever video interview 14 years later. “I tried to return to what I was doing previously — I was a foreign-language tutor — but it didn’t work out because, of course, my child didn’t care about my schedule.” Instead, she invested $700 in a website that sold clothes, and a little more in online advertisements. When the first orders came in, she used her apartment as a makeshift warehouse and took public transport to deliver the packages herself. According to Bakalchuk, Wildberries has grown organically ever since.</p>



<p>This rags-to-riches origin story makes Bakalchuk highly unusual in Russia, where the state controls huge swathes of the economy, and the wealthy elite is almost entirely male. And it means Bakalchuk stands out from the country’s other billionaires, the majority of whom made their fortunes, directly or indirectly, from the extraction of mineral resources. Just like Wildberries’ name — chosen for its evocations of color and dynamism — Bakalchuk is seen as a breath of fresh air in Russia’s business world. Cultivating this persona has opened the doors of government ministers keen to cultivate homegrown business success and helped Bakalchuk win a following among members of the younger generation.</p>



<p>Despite its healthy lead in the e-commerce industry, Wildberries’ total dominance is far from guaranteed. The market in Russia is unusual because it consists almost entirely of local firms, including state-backed ventures, and is far more fragmented than its Western and Asian counterparts. Most experts believe the sector is on the brink of a turbulent period that will see the emergence of a few major players. “The market is moving toward consolidation because of rapid growth, not via mergers and acquisitions,” said Fedor Virin, co-founder of Russian e-commerce analysis firm Data Insight. Competition to come out on top is intense, pitting influential billionaires against state-owned financial behemoths.</p>

<p><strong>Wildberries has repeatedly</strong> denied ever receiving any significant outside investment, but many in the Russian e-commerce world are deeply skeptical of Bakalchuk’s “self-made” rhetoric, pointing to the company’s phenomenal growth and powerful friends as evidence. In 2019, year-on-year sales rose 88%, and analysts predict it will be over 100% in 2020, rising more than 2.5 times faster than the market as a whole. Even competitors with significant investments struggle to grow at these rates, fueling rumors of a secret investor or high-level state support. “There are concerns that a road is being cleared for Wildberries,” said retail sector analyst Aleksei Petrovsky.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company’s business tactics unquestionably play a major role in its popularity among Russia’s 95 million active internet users (the largest in Europe). Wildberries operates a huge network of over 14,700 collection centers in low-rent suburban areas that also function as mini-distribution points and provide customers with a place to try on their purchases. It provides free delivery and free returns and has historically focused on products with higher profit margins, like clothes and shoes, which, as of May 2020, accounted for over 50% of sales.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“The secret of successful online business in Russia is to be as little online as possible.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>A physical presence in towns and cities has, at least in the short term, helped Wildberries overcome the major hurdles facing other e-commerce companies in Russia: long delivery distances, scattered populations, a notoriously unreliable postal service, and a deep mistrust of upfront payment, a legacy of the turbulent transition from communism in the 1990s. </p>



<p>“The secret of successful online business in Russia is to be as little online as possible,” Dmitry Alekseev, co-owner of large electronics retailer DNS, told <em>The Bell</em> last May. “Wildberries has more offline outlets than we do.”</p>

<p>Wildberries’ success is also built in part on its 2014 decision to transition to an Amazon-style marketplace, in which suppliers are simply offered a platform to make sales. The company doesn’t have to sink its own money into products and is able to retain control of pricing, meaning it can pressure suppliers to offer big discounts. This policy has alienated some of the companies that work with Wildberries, which accuse the retail giant of forcing their hand. “If you only work with Wildberries, you can easily destroy the rest of the market for yourself,” said one supplier who requested anonymity.</p>



<p>Grabbing market share has long been the company’s overriding goal. “[They] were always compulsively drawn to growth. They sensed that if they were not developing rapidly, they would be caught, overtaken, and trampled into the ground,” recalled a former employee, who feared retaliation. Occasionally, growth was prioritized over profit. The decision to implement free deliveries, for example, initially hit the company’s bottom line.</p>



<p>As the company began to reach into households all over the country, and Bakalchuk attracted increasing interest from both the media and senior government officials, it was no longer possible to outright refuse interviews and dismiss the need for a PR department.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Around the start of 2018, Wildberries hired an external PR agency, which helped craft the tale of self-made female entrepreneurship, a narrative that Bakalchuk has since adopted as her origin story in interviews with top Russian media outlets. On the back of this carefully curated image of independence, however, the company has forged links in the heart of Moscow. One of Bakalchuk’s biggest cheerleaders is Trade and Industry Minister Denis Manturov, who has traveled with Bakalchuk on domestic business trips, announced major corporate decisions, and lobbied Wildberries’ interests abroad. And during the pandemic, Bakalchuk’s increasingly public reputation helped propel Wildberries to the top of Russia’s e-commerce sector.</p>

<hr>



<p><strong>Bakalchuk’s neatly packaged</strong> origin story downplays some key details. For starters, she is not the only decision-maker at Wildberries. Vladislav Bakalchuk, her husband — a soft-spoken man who reportedly owns 1% of Wildberries — was a successful businessman in the early 2000s and received a windfall when the internet provider he’d partly owned was sold in 2007. He and bodybuilder Sergei Anufriev occupy key positions in Wildberries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anufriev played an especially intriguing role in the early days of the company, brokering a large delivery of Adidas-branded goods for Wildberries in the late-2000s, after several other buyers declined, according to the former Wildberries employee. Back then, many Russian retailers were dependent on unwanted stock from major Western brands, a sizeable portion of which was shipped into the country using false customs declarations (the Russian Central Bank estimated in 2005 that these “gray imports” constituted as much as 20% of all imports).&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the extent of Anufriev’s influence today is unclear, the heavily discounted Adidas items were the backbone of Wildberries’ catalogue during a crucial growth period for the company. Several years later, reputable Russian media outlets <a href="https://retailer.ru/asos-vstretjat-po-odezhke/">repeatedly identified</a> Anufriev as a co-owner of Wildberries. And the former …</p></div></div>

									<p>All modern computers have the ability to play high-quality digital sound, thanks to the presence of a dedicated sound card or an audio chip on the motherboard. Today’s computers produce lifelike, realistic audio, enabling us to listen to digital music collections, watch online videos and play action-packed games. However, the audio capabilities of today’s computers are the culmination of decades of development, and it took a significant contribution from the computer game industry to get us here. Without that contribution, anyone who isn’t a professional musician might still be listening to little more than beeps on his or her computer today.<br>

<p>If you had an IBM PC computer or a 100-percent compatible clone between 1981-1988, you were most likely listening to — or cutting the wires of — your computer’s internal speaker. The PC speaker was solely a rudimentary tone generator. It played one note at a time, didn’t have different instruments for composers to choose from and even lacked volume control. As a result, music played on the PC speaker tended to sound tinny and grating. Composers could get around these problems by varying the pitch of a note slightly to create vibrato and playing fast arpeggios to simulate the sound of multiple notes being played simultaneously. By playing short “blips” between notes — short low-pitched sounds in the middle of a longer, high-pitched sound, for example — it was possible to simulate percussion. However, most PC speaker music didn’t have this much effort put into it; game music from this era often sounded rather monotonous. Through a clever hack, some computer games from the late ’80s actually played 6-bit digital sound through the PC speaker. However, this technology was used in few games because it was difficult to play digital sound through the speaker without sacrificing speed. When sound cards began to drop in price, the digital sound hack became irrelevant.</p>

<p>Hearing digital samples from an IBM-compatible computer before the release of the Sound Blaster was quite a novelty. Because of space limitations — <em>Space Racer</em>&nbsp;shipped on just one 5.25-inch floppy diskette — each sample is stored on the disk only once. The song is played by triggering the samples in a specific order.</p>

<h2>1984: IBM PCjr and Tandy 1000</h2>
</a><p><a name="2"></a><br>
<img loading="lazy" title="IBM PCjr" src="http://macgateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IBM-PCjr.gif" alt="IBM PCjr" width="250" height="212">The PCjr was released by IBM in 1984 as an attempt to provide better competition for Apple in the home computer market. The PCjr included features designed to appeal to home users, such as an infrared wireless keyboard, cartridge slots and expansion hardware that could be installed without opening the computer. More importantly, the PCjr featured enhanced graphics and a sound chip that could play three voices simultaneously rather than the one voice of the original IBM PC. IBM contacted the game company Sierra On-Line, asking them to design a game that would show off the enhanced graphics and sound of the PCjr. The result was <a title="King's Quest" href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/kings-quest" target="_blank">King’s Quest</a>. The game became an enormous hit, saving Sierra from a failed investment in cartridge-based games just before the <a title="Video Game Crash of 1983" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_video_game_crash_of_1983" target="_blank">video game crash of 1983</a>&nbsp;and spawning a series that lasted 14 years.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="Tandy 1000" src="http://macgateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Tandy-1000.jpg" alt="Tandy 1000" width="250" height="111">Some of IBM’s design decisions for the PCjr were poor ones, and the computer ultimately failed. However, Radio Shack’s Tandy 1000 — an IBM-compatible computer with the same video and sound capabilities as the PCjr — was a big seller. IBM still set the computing standard at that point, and since the PCjr wasn’t a success, not all games took advantage of the Tandy 1000’s advanced sound capabilities. Those that did provided a significantly better audio experience on the Tandy 1000 than they did on the IBM PC.</p>
<h3>Listen to the Tandy 1000</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="Silpheed Game Screenshot" src="http://macgateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Silpheed-Game-Screenshot.gif" alt="Silpheed Game Screenshot" width="320" height="200"><span><strong>Silpheed (1988)</strong></span></p>
<p>Although the sound chip of the Tandy 1000 lacked an effects channel for percussion, the three-voice polyphony made it possible to construct a full piece of music with melody, harmony and bass. The Tandy 1000 version of the <em>Silpheed</em>&nbsp;soundtrack was a significant improvement over the PC speaker version.</p>

<p><audio id="audio-3009-6" preload="none" controls="controls"><source type="audio/mpeg" src="http://macgateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Silpheed-Tandy-1000.mp3?_=6"><a href="http://macgateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Silpheed-Tandy-1000.mp3">http://macgateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Silpheed-Tandy-1000.mp3</a></audio></p>

<p>The Tandy 1000 version of the introduction piece for <em>Rendezvous With Rama</em>&nbsp;conveys the full effect of what the composer intended, while the PC speaker version could only “fake” it by switching from voice to voice. Because the quality of PC game music was generally rather low in the early ’80s, hearing such a complex piece at the beginning of a game was a real treat.</p>

<p>The PC speaker version of <em>Music Construction Set</em>&nbsp;was done so well that the difference between it and the Tandy 1000 version isn’t quite “night and day” as it is with some other games. However, because the Tandy 1000 could play multiple voices without tricks, the tones do sound less “fuzzy.”</p>

<p><em>Composed by Hibiki Godai. Developed by Game Arts and published by Sierra On-Line.</em></p>
<p><em>Thexder</em>, the pinnacle of PC action gaming in 1987. features an appropriately energetic soundtrack that makes use of arpeggios to suggest chord changes. If the music sounds familiar to you, it may have something to do with the fact that Hibiki Godai also contributed to the <em>Silpheed</em>&nbsp;soundtrack.</p>

<h2>1987: AdLib Music Synthesizer</h2>
</a><p><a name="3"></a><br>
<img loading="lazy" title="AdLib Music Synthesizer Card" src="http://macgateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/AdLib-Music-Synthesizer-Card.jpg" alt="AdLib Music Synthesizer Card" width="250" height="205">A few different sound cards were available to purchase in 1987, but few people other than professional musicians were aware of them. Sierra On-Line became a driving force in the evolution of computer sound again, approaching AdLib and Roland about putting together bundles of their products — the AdLib Music Synthesizer card and Roland MT-32 sound module — for Sierra to market. Sierra then hired&nbsp;professional musicians such as William Goldstein (<a title="Wikipedia: Fame" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fame_(1982_TV_series)" target="_blank">Fame</a>) and Bob Siebenberg (<a title="Supertramp" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supertramp" target="_blank">Supertramp</a>) to compose soundtracks supporting these devices for their upcoming games. Sierra also mailed&nbsp;<a title="A Letter From Ken Williams" href="http://queststudios.com/quest/music.html" target="_blank">letters</a> and demonstration cassettes to its customers&nbsp;to promote the AdLib and Roland MT-32, and the consumer sound card market was born.</p>
<p>Although the Roland MT-32 was a far better synthesizer, it was the AdLib Music Synthesizer card that would set the standard in PC audio for the next few years — mostly due to its lower price tag. The AdLib cost $200, making it far more affordable than the $550 MT-32 ($1,053 in 2012 dollars). The AdLib generated music with a&nbsp;Yamaha YM3812 chip, which produced sound through FM synthesis. The YM3812 was also known as the FM Operator Type-L 2 or OPL2&nbsp;chip; it could play up to nine voices simultaneously and produced tones by manipulating waveforms such as sine and half-sine waves. The sound quality was not unlike that of the inexpensive Japanese keyboards that many families had stashed under their couches in the late ’80s. The AdLib lacked the ability to produce true stereo audio or play digital sound samples of any kind. Nevertheless, it could produce rich, full sounds in the hands of skilled composers, as demonstrated by some of the samples below. Its primary shortcoming stemmed from the fact that many game music composers focused most of their efforts on high-end MIDI hardware such as the Roland MT-32 and Sound Canvas SC-55. In converting these soundtracks for the AdLib, little time was spent tweaking the music to highlight the AdLib’s strengths. Some of the best AdLib music was composed by <a title="Wikipedia: Demoscene" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene" target="_blank">demoscene</a> members and shareware game companies, …</p></div></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Learning a new programming language can be challenging. There’s frequently a load of novel code patterns, techniques, and features.</p><p>Elixir, in particular, is a bit odd. While its syntax looks easy, it can be surprising. Even more, the semantics – Elixir code can sometimes be a puzzle even if you are a functional programming veteran.</p><p>For this post, I have gone through all the basic Elixir constructs and collected a few tips that will help you write idiomatic Elixir code without hours of Googling. It should be useful when you attempt your first Elixir project or do <a href="https://exercism.io/">Exercism</a> exercises.</p><p>If you have already finished Exercism or done an Elixir course, you will know most of this already, but it might serve as a good refresher.</p><p>Now, let’s see what Elixir can offer us. 😉</p><h2 id="basic-syntax">Basic syntax</h2><p>Seriously, just watch this video. It’s amazingly well done:</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pBNOavRoNL0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Additionally, you can visit the <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/basic-types.html">Basic Types</a> and <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/basic-operators.html">Basic Operators</a> guides on Elixir’s webpage.</p><h2 id="pipes">Pipes</h2><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/kc/kcyxakor.pasted_image_0_(8).png" alt="Mario image that somehow ilustrates Elixir pipes" loading="lazy"></p><center><i>Hop into the pipes, and they take you weird places.</i></center><p>The pipe operator is the main operator for function composition in Elixir.</p><p>It takes the result of the expression before it and passes it as the first argument of the following expression. Pipes replace nested function calls like <code>foo(bar(baz))</code>with <code>foo |&gt; bar |&gt; baz</code> .</p><h3 id="example-of-pipes">Example of pipes</h3><p>For example, here’s a function that makes a string into an exclamation sentence.</p><pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>exclaim</span></span>(string) <span>do</span>
  string
    |&gt; String.trim()
    |&gt; String.capitalize()
    |&gt; Kernel.&lt;&gt;(<span>"!"</span>)
<span>end</span>
</code></pre><p>Here, we take a string and pass it through various string methods. Since Elixir functions return the result of the last evaluated value, we don’t have to return anything. Data and transformations applied to it are clearly delineated.</p><p>Pipes look even more incredible when you use them to compose higher-level functions. The whole program can easily be one large pipe, consisting of smaller pipes, which consist of even smaller pipes. Pipes all the way down!</p><h2 id="higher-order-functions">Higher-order functions</h2><p>Elixir, as a functional programming language, makes heavy use of higher-order functions.</p><p>Higher-order functions take in other functions as arguments. A few examples of HOFs are map, filter, and reduce.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/na/na14enxf.pasted_image_0_(9).png" alt="Higher-order functions" loading="lazy"></p><center><i>Source: <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2018/course/TDA452/lectures/HigherOrderFunctions.html">http://www.cse.chalmers.se/</a> </i></center><p>In Elixir, most of these functions live in the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enum.html">Enum</a> module of the standard library and operate on anything that is <em><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enumerable.html">Enumerable</a></em>: lists, maps, ranges, etc.</p><p>Using HOFs is a good substitute for loops: instead of a for-in, iterate over the elements of the list with <code>Enum.map</code>.</p><pre><code>iex(<span>1</span>)&gt; list = [<span>1</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>7</span>]
[<span>1</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>7</span>]

iex(<span>2</span>)&gt; Enum.map(list, <span>fn</span> x -&gt; x * x <span>end</span>)
[<span>1</span>, <span>9</span>, <span>25</span>, <span>49</span>]
</code></pre><p>In the function above, we provided the square function as <code>fn x -&gt; x * x end</code>. This is Elixir’s syntax for anonymous functions. There is also another way to provide functions, and that is through the <em><a href="https://dockyard.com/blog/2016/08/05/understand-capture-operator-in-elixir">capture operator</a></em>.</p><pre><code>iex(<span>3</span>)&gt; Enum.map(list, &amp;(&amp;<span>1</span> * &amp;<span>1</span>))
[<span>1</span>, <span>9</span>, <span>25</span>, <span>49</span>]
</code></pre><p>The <code>&amp;</code> initiates a new anonymous function, while the <code>&amp;1</code> denotes the first argument of that function. It’s debatable whether it makes it easier to read in this case. 😅</p><h3 id="example-of-higher-order-functions">Example of higher-order functions</h3><p>Let’s say we need to read a list of lines from a file, make them into exclamation sentences, and print them out to the console.</p><p>While we could usually do that with a loop, now we need another way. You can easily do it with a map function.</p><pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>exclaimify</span></span>(file) <span>do</span>
  file
    |&gt; File.read!()
    |&gt; String.split(<span>"\n"</span>, <span>trim:</span> <span>true</span>)
    |&gt; Enum.map(<span>fn</span> x -&gt; exclaim(x) <span>end</span>)
    |&gt; Enum.join(<span>"\n"</span>)
    |&gt; IO.puts()
<span>end</span>
</code></pre><p>Remember the capture operator we talked about? Here, you can use it to make it simpler to call <code>exclaim</code>. Just switch up the map function to <code>Enum.map(&amp;exclaim/1)</code>!</p><h2 id="pattern-matching">Pattern matching</h2><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/rr/rr7zgnre.pasted_image_0_(10).png" alt="Elixir pattern matching meme" loading="lazy"></p><center><i>Sneakily borrowed from <a href="https://www.ludu.co/course/discover-elixir-phoenix/pattern-matching">https://www.ludu.co</a></i></center><p>Pattern matching is one of the most powerful parts of Elixir. Any kind of control flow that you write, it’s a reasonable heuristic to check whether you can’t do it with pattern matching.</p><p>Basically, pattern matching works by providing some <em>pattern</em> you expect in the data and then checking whether this pattern <em>matches</em> the data.</p><p>It all starts with the match operator, <code>=</code>. Yup. In Elixir, we don’t assign variables; we <em>match</em> them.</p><pre><code>iex(<span>1</span>)&gt; x = <span>1</span>
<span>1</span>
</code></pre><p>What happens here is that Elixir checks whether the structure of both sides is the same. If it is, unassigned variables on the left side get assigned the values from the right side. If it is not, it will skip to the next match statement (or give you MatchError if the match wasn’t exhaustive).</p><p>We can play around with it in IEx.</p><pre><code>iex(<span>2</span>)&gt; <span>1</span> = <span>1</span>
<span>1</span>

iex(<span>3</span>)&gt; <span>1</span> = <span>2</span>
** (MatchError) no match of right hand side <span>value:</span> <span>2</span>

iex(<span>5</span>)&gt; x = <span>1</span>
<span>1</span>
</code></pre><p>It starts to get much more useful when the structures are more complex, enabling you to destructure tuples, lists, and nested maps quite easily.</p><p><strong>Tuples</strong></p><pre><code>iex(<span>1</span>)&gt; {x, y} = {<span>1</span>, <span>3</span>}

</code></pre><p>In the case of the code above, we can go even more idiomatic.</p><h3 id="multiple-function-clauses">Multiple function clauses</h3><p>Elixir supports pattern matching in function clauses. Therefore, instead of writing long-winded control flow statements, you can create multiple functions.</p><pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>get_andrews_age</span></span>(%{<span>name:</span> <span>"Andrew"</span>, <span>age:</span> x}), <span>do:</span> {<span>:ok</span>, x}
<span><span>def</span> <span>get_andrews_age</span></span>(%{<span>name:</span> _, <span>age:</span> _}), <span>do:</span> {<span>:error</span>, <span>:not_andrew</span>}
<span><span>def</span> <span>get_andrews_age</span></span>(_), <span>do:</span> {<span>:error</span>, <span>:not_person</span>}
</code></pre><p>Whoah! 🤯 If done correctly, this makes the code more extensible and easier to read.</p><h3 id="guards">Guards</h3><p>But there’s even more modularity incoming.</p><p>Let’s imagine we wanted to get the age only if Andrew is of legal age. We can easily accomplish this with a guard, an additional construction that augments pattern matching.</p><p>Guards consist of <code>when</code> and a boolean expression, and are added to the function clause. They support only a limited set of expressions, which you can check out in the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/guards.html">documentation</a>.</p><p>Here’s how our code would look with guards:</p><pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>get_andrews_age_if_legal</span></span>(%{<span>name:</span> <span>"Andrew"</span>, <span>age:</span> x}) <span>when</span> x &gt;= <span>18</span>, <span>do:</span> {<span>:ok</span>, x}
<span><span>def</span> <span>get_andrews_age_if_legal</span></span>(%{<span>name:</span> <span>"Andrew"</span>, <span>age:</span> x}) <span>when</span> x &lt; <span>18</span>, <span>do:</span> {<span>:error</span>, <span>:not_legal_age</span>}
<span><span>def</span> <span>get_andrews_age_if_legal</span></span>(%{<span>name:</span> _, <span>age:</span> _}), <span>do:</span> {<span>:error</span>, <span>:not_andrew</span>}
<span><span>def</span> <span>get_andrews_age_if_legal</span></span>(_), <span>do:</span> {<span>:error</span>, <span>:not_person</span>}
</code></pre><h3 id="overloading-functions">Overloading functions</h3><p>There’s this cool thing with Elixir functions where you can have functions with different argument counts, and they get counted as different functions even though they have the same name. In other words, you can overload functions via arity.</p><pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>add</span></span>(x,y), <span>do:</span> x + y
<span><span>def</span> <span>add</span></span>(x,y,z), <span>do:</span> x + y + z 
</code></pre><p>One of these functions in Elixir-speak is actually add/2, the other is add/3.</p><p>And, by using multiple functions and pattern matching, we can do a nice trick in our Elixir code that comes up quite often.</p><p>We can define an x-argument function that will serve as the outer shell of our function. Then, we use that x-argument function to launch an x+1-argument function that will track the state as an argument, not a variable.</p><p>It’s easier if you look at it in action. Here’s a function that reverses a list.</p><pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>reverse</span></span>(list), <span>do:</span> reverse(list, [])

<span><span>def</span> <span>reverse</span></span>([], list), <span>do:</span> 
<span><span>def</span> <span>reverse</span></span>([head | tail], reversed_list), <span>do:</span>
</code></pre><p>I have left the implementation details unfinished, and you might have a question or two about what is happening. Stay with me for a while. To fully explain it, we need to turn to recursive functions.</p><h2 id="recursive-functions">Recursive functions</h2><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/ko/kodpjcyk.pasted_image_0_(11).png" alt="XKCD tail recursion" loading="lazy"></p><center><i>Source: <a href="https://xkcd.com/1270/">xkcd</a></i></center><p>A recursive function is simply a function that can call itself.</p><p>One of the typical examples is calculating a certain Fibonacci number, a naive implementation of which in Elixir would be:</p><pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>fib</span></span>(0), <span>do:</span> 0
<span><span>def</span> <span>fib</span></span>(<span>1</span>), <span>do:</span> <span>1</span>
<span><span>def</span> <span>fib</span></span>(n), <span>do:</span> fib(n<span>-1</span>) + fib(n<span>-2</span>)
</code></pre><p>(Take note of our use of pattern matching covered above.)</p><p>We can find two things in each sane recursive piece of code: a base case and a recursive call.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Base case.</strong> This is the point where recursion terminates. It’s the result you want to achieve, and it will not call itself.</li>
<li><strong>Recursive call.</strong> This is where the program will do most of the computation. With it, you will reduce your task to a smaller one, and it will call itself.</li>
</ul><p>Basically, you can think of the base case as <em>the simplest possible example</em> of the task you want to solve and the recursive call as <em>a way to simplify</em> any given problem. In the example given, <code>fib(0)</code> and <code>fib(1)</code> are base cases, <code>fib(n)</code> is the recursive call.</p><h3 id="looping-with-recursion">Looping with recursion</h3><p>In Elixir, we use recursion much more frequently than you would in a non-FP language since we don’t have access to things like loops. Recursion mimics imperative behavior quite well.</p><p>For example, if we need to do something a set amount of times, we can create a recursive function with a number as an argument.</p><p>Let’s say that we want to duplicate a string any given number of times.</p><pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>repeat</span></span>(string, times), <span>do:</span> repeat(string, times, <span>""</span>)

<span><span>def</span> <span>repeat</span></span>(_string, 0, acc), <span>do:</span> acc
<span><span>def</span> <span>repeat</span></span>(string, times, acc), <span>do:</span> repeat(string, times - <span>1</span>, acc &lt;&gt; string)
</code></pre><p>Instead of initializing a variable in the function, we add one more argument to the function. Then we call it again and again, each time decreasing <code>times</code> and increasing <code>acc</code>.</p><p>In the end, we have achieved the same result as instantiating two variables – <code>i</code> and <code>acc</code> – and creating a while loop that decrements <code>i</code> until it is equal to 0 and adds <code>string</code> to <code>acc</code> on each iteration.</p><p>Now, I believe you will find it easy to complete the <code>reverse</code> example in the pattern matching section; it’s rather similar to <code>repeat</code> in structure.</p><h2 id="structs">Str…</h2></div></div>

      </section>
<p>2020 was a particular year for everyone, and Progressive Web Apps are no exception. In terms of innovation in the PWA space, it was the laziest of the last five years.</p>

<p>I will try to answer the most challenging question: <em>what's the market share of PWAs</em>? The only two companies with an accurate answer are Google and Samsung from their or WebAPK minting servers. Unfortunately, they are not sharing the data with us. Samsung disclosed a number at the end of 2019, but the company didn't update it since then. You can see it in the previous article <a href="https://firt.dev/pwa-2020">Progressive Web Apps in 2020</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A WebAPK minting server operates in the cloud and generates an APK (Android Package) -or delivers a cached version- every time you install a PWA when WebAPK is enabled. For Google Chrome, that's every time the browser is used to install a PWA that passes the PWA criteria, and for Samsung, it's every time Internet Browser is used in the same situation on a Samsung device. They have the data of how many unique manifest URLs -hence PWAs- are out there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite not having that information, we can extrapolate some data from different sources, including <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2020/pwa">HTTP Archive 2020 Almanac</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of 2020, approximately <em>1% of websites included a Service Worker, and 2.2% had an installable Web App Manifest file</em>. Remember that some platforms -such as Safari on iOS or Chrome on Android- do not require a Service Worker to have a standalone experience after installation. We can assume that 2.2% of websites are installable, and 1% may pass the PWA criteria on Android, 71% of which offer some offline experience.</p>
<p>If we extrapolate the HTTP Archive data, the 2019 data shared from Samsung and apply the growth from HTTP Archive; the numbers will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>~120,000 domains may host at least one PWA.</li>
<li>~1,500,000 websites may be installable on mobile home screens, offering an app experience.</li>
<li>~600,000 websites may be offline-capable.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can compare this with app stores stats:</p>
<ul>
<li>~800,000 publishers on both Play Store and AppStore.</li>
<li>~2,000,000 apps in the AppStore, ~3,000,000 in Play Store.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's quite tricky to get this data accurate without real information from browsers, but it's clear that <em>PWAs are still behind native apps in the store in quantity and downloads</em>. Also, having <em>x</em> amount of websites that are ready to be installed doesn't mean users are actually installing them or even that they are aware that they are installable.</p>
<p><em>UPDATE</em> After publishing the first version of this post, the Chrome team reached me on a <a href="https://twitter.com/b1tr0t/status/1347656636991590401?s=20">Twitter thread</a> to share some of the public data they have from the WebAPK Minting server:</p>
<ul>
<li>WebAPK Installations per months: <em>10s of millions installations</em> only on Chrome for Android (compared that with around 10 billion installations per month on stores, iOS, iPadOS and Android)</li>
<li><em>Number of origins with PWAs has grown 170% in 2020</em>, outperforming the trend line for prior years. This is for domains with a minimum number of installs (so they are not just tests or internal PWAs)</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, many solutions appear these days (low-code, no-code, CMS plugins) that will start creating a significant number of new PWAs. That situation is also possible on app stores with native apps, but each app needs an individual entry in the store, and app stores may limit similar apps. On the PWA side, you can create infinite different PWAs just by creating different manifest URLs, so it's always unfair to compare.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-pwas-in-the-stores%3F">What about PWAs in the stores? <a href="#what-about-pwas-in-the-stores%3F">#</a></h3>
<p>As with the rest of the data, it's challenging to find an answer here. First, TWA-based PWA launchers are still new in the Play Store, so they don't appear in the stats. The only thing that we can measure is how many hybrids are in the Play Store -apps using the WebView, including Cordova and Capacitor apps-.</p>
<p>Using data from <a href="https://www.appbrain.com/stats">AppBrain Stats</a> we can conclude that <em>12% of apps in the Play Store (around 360,000 apps) are using the Web View</em>. However, these apps are typically on the long tail as <em>they count as 2% of the downloads</em>.</p>
<p>While some of them may be using offline HTML content in the APK or using native plugins not available in the Web Platform, many are candidates to be replaced in the future with a Trusted Web Activity APK. We don't have data on AppStore, but we can assume that at least 50% of those apps in the Play Store are also available in the AppStore with the same codebase.</p>

<p>Check my latest course in 2021: <a href="https://firt.dev/publishing-pwa">Publishing Progressive Web Apps</a> for info and tips on how to publish a PWA to App Stores.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The data seems low, but when you look at browsing market share instead of quantity of apps, we can see that at 2021, <a href="https://www.chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/990">18% of page loads</a> have a Service Worker controlling them. It's also good to compare the platform's growth: <em>Service Workers' usage has increased 38% in the last year</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The platform is growing slowly, but it's not replacing the native world as some people were expecting a few years ago. Those of us in the Web space typically have a vision of PWAs not shared among the rest of the mobile app space. For example, Flutter had exponential growth in interest and usage last year, while PWA kept itself inside a niche.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Will it change during 2021? We'll see in the rest of the article.</p>
<h2 id="current-state-of-compatibility">Current State of Compatibility <a href="#current-state-of-compatibility">#</a></h2>
<p>I'm currently maintaining a full <a href="https://firt.dev/notes/pwa/">live document with PWA compatibility</a>, so I don't want to repeat myself here. Let's see a summary and what has changed in the past year.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Android</em>
<ul>
<li>Browser: Chrome (WebAPK), Samsung Internet (WebAPK on Samsung devices), Firefox, Edge, UCWeb, Opera, Baidu, Brave, Huawei</li>
<li>Play Store: Trusted Web Activities</li>
<li>Enterprise: Managed Play iframe</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>iOS and iPadOS</em>
<ul>
<li>Browser: Safari</li>
<li>AppStore: WKWebView with App-Bound Domains (14+)</li>
<li>Enterprise: Mobile Configuration</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Windows 10</em>
<ul>
<li>Browser: Chrome, Edge</li>
<li>Microsoft Store: EdgeHTML engine, Chromium engine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Windows 7 and 8.x</em>
<ul>
<li>Browser: Chrome, Edge</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>macOS</em>
<ul>
<li>Browser: Chrome, Edge</li>
<li>AppStore: WKWebView with App-Bound Domains (11+)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Linux</em>
<ul>
<li>Browser: Chrome 64 bits</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>ChromeOS</em>
<ul>
<li>Browser</li>
<li>Play Store: Trusted Web Activities</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="compatibility-in-numbers">Compatibility in numbers <a href="#compatibility-in-numbers">#</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of 2021, from users browsing the Web (data from <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/">Statcounter</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>95.1% support Service Worker</em></li>
<li><em>85.2% can install a PWA from their browser</em></li>
<li><em>76.3% can install a PWA from the store</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This data shows an increase of 2%－4% from a year ago.</p>
<p><em>Why isn't it 100%?</em> Let's see</p>
<ul>
<li>For Service Workers support, we still have some users browsing the Web on IE/Old Edge (1%), Chrome on iOS and iPadOS before 14 (1%), Android Browser (0.5%), older Safari on mac (0.5%) and a mix of other older browsers.</li>
<li>For browser installation (Add to the Homescreen/Install), we have Safari on macOS (4%), Firefox on Desktop (3.2%), Chrome on iOS and iPadOS on all versions (1.5%), IE/Old Edge (1%), Opera for Desktop and other browsers.</li>
<li>And the difference on store installation has to do mainly with macOS 10.x (7%), Windows 7 (6%), Windows 8.x (1.6%), and Windows XP (0.5%).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="compatibility-changes-during-2020">Compatibility changes during 2020 <a href="#compatibility-changes-during-2020">#</a></h3>
<p>In the past year, the changes in PWA compatibility were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Huawei Browser</li>
<li>AppStore: WKWebViews with App-Bound domains for iOS 14, iPadOS 14, and macOS 11 (Big Sur)</li>
<li>Play Store on ChromeOS: Trusted Web Activity</li>
<li>Microsoft Store: Chromium-based WebView</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="huawei-browser">Huawei Browser <a href="#huawei-browser">#</a></h4>
<p>The Huawei Browser is a Chromium-based browser that appeared in 2020 for HMS-based devices, without Google Services, such as the Huawei P40 series. That browser supports the installation of PWAs, probably because it was already written in the Chromium code but not because there was a conscious decision.</p>
<p>In fact, during 2020, Huawei launched the <a href="https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/huawei-quickApp/">Quick Apps project</a> with other Chinese vendors, a sort of web app that can be used without installation, so it seems their way to support web apps in the platform.</p>
<h4 id="app-store-and-wkwebviews">App Store and WKWebViews <a href="#app-store-and-wkwebviews">#</a></h4>
<p>I will cover WKWebViews later in the article, but for now, let's say that PWAs are officially possible on the AppStore now, thanks to a new feature known as App-Bound Domains. It's available from iOS and iPadOS 14 and macOS from Big Sur, and Apple shipped it without any official word about their usage for the App Store.</p>
<p>I'm covering more about it in my recently published course <a href="https://firt.dev/publishing-pwa">Publishing Progressive Web Apps.</a></p>
<h4 id="play-store-on-chromeos">Play Store on ChromeOS <a href="#play-store-on-chromeos">#</a></h4>
<p>From ChromeOS 86, Trusted Web Activities are supported, so PWA Launchers distributed in the Play Store can be using TWAs. BubbleWrap CLIs and PWABuilder support the creation of PWA Launcher APKs just for ChromeOS.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Check my latest course in 2021: <a href="https://firt.dev/publishing-pwa">Publishing Progressive Web Apps</a> for info and tips on how to use Trusted Web Activities.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="microsoft-store">Microsoft Store <a href="#microsoft-store">#</a></h4>
<p>At the end of 2020, Microsoft announced <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/">WebView2</a> and support from <a href="https://medium.com/pwabuilder/bringing-chromium-edge-pwas-progressive-web-apps-to-the-microsoft-store-c0bd07914ed9">PWABuilder to create PWA launchers</a> for the Microsoft Store that can use the Chromium-based engine instead of the old EdgeHTML engine. Apart from the modern engine, there are several advantages, including sharing storages with the Edge browser installed in that device.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that if you change your PWA engine, you will also lose access to the UWP APIs available in previous versions. These APIs let you create, for example, Live Tiles for the Start screen.</p>
<h2 id="more-pwas-from-companies%2C-in-silent-mode">More PWAs from Companies, in silent mode <a href="#more-pwas-from-companies%2C-in-silent-mode">#</a></h2>
<p>Many companies during 2020 launched new PWAs. Progressive Web App development is becoming a default for most companies, so they make it PWA …</p></section></div>

<p>
    Posted on January 11, 2021
    
        by Troels Henriksen
    
</p>

<p>I have written several posts on <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2019-12-18-design-flaws-in-futhark.html">things that we got wrong in Futhark</a>, <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2018-12-08-why-futhark-sometimes-goes-wrong.html">why the compiler goes wrong</a>, as well as posts about <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2020-03-15-futhark-0.15.1-released.html#size-types">complicated features</a> where it is still unclear whether the feature works well enough. However, there are also some parts of Futhark’s design that I feel pretty good about! This post will discuss some of them. I will focus on very concrete details, rather than grand observations such as “bulk-parallel functional programming is a good paradigm for numerical programming”. Such doctrinal statements are more of an entire <em>thesis</em>, and require much richer and more qualified answers than just “this turned out pretty well”. Everything to follow is what I don’t <em>regret</em>, so it is necessarily subjective, but maybe other language designers will find it useful or amusing.</p>
<h2 id="short-names"><a href="#short-names" id="short-names-link" title="short-names">Short names</a></h2>
<p>Naming things is one of the two most difficult problems in computer science, and in contrast to the other two (cache invalidation and off-by-one errors), there is no tooling or theory to tell you when you pick a bad name. Matters are even graver when it comes to names that are part of public interfaces. You may well receive acclaim for fixing a subtle cache invalidation bug in old and widely used code, but do not expect similar praise if you also change the naming convention of the public API from underscores to CamelCasing along the way.</p>
<p>Futhark exposes many names, both in its command line interface and its <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/docs/prelude/">built-in libraries</a>. Many of the names have been changed over the years. When we initially fleshed out the primitive type system, I agonised over how to name the new types. Should 32-bit signed integers be <code>Int32</code> as in Haskell, or <code>i32</code> as in Rust? I worried the latter was <em>too short</em>. Yet in the end, that was the scheme we went with: <code>i8</code>/<code>i16</code>/<code>i32</code>/<code>i64</code> for the signed types, <code>u8</code>/<code>u16</code>/<code>u32</code>/<code>u64</code> for the unsigned, and <code>f32</code>/<code>f64</code> for floats.</p>
<p>Incidentally, here is a piece of advice: if you are ever agonising over some design detail that is not core to what makes your language special, and all options seem equally reasonable, just go with whatever Rust does. Odds are that whatever Rust decided was preceded by significant debate, and that whatever they picked has few gotchas. Lexical syntax is one area where this is particularly good (and easy) advice to follow.</p>
<p>But back to naming things. The terse type names turned out to work fine. In fact, I realised that <em>I have never regretted making a name too short</em>. The names I still regret tend to be those that are too imprecise or <em>too long</em> - the <code>negate</code> function in the <code>f32</code> and <code>f64</code> modules should have been <code>neg</code>, for example. I am not quite sure why this is. When I code in Haskell, I have a preference for relatively verbose names for top-level definitions. In Futhark, short names just seem to fit better with the language aesthetics. Maybe that is just the nature of numerical code? I don’t know. But I definitely rely on this observation to guide future naming of things.</p>
<h2 id="file-orientation"><a href="#file-orientation" id="file-orientation-link" title="file-orientation">File orientation</a></h2>
<p>While Futhark is not designed for large programs, we still want to support multi-file programs. Code in a file <code>A</code> must be allowed to reference definitions in some other file <code>B</code>. Languages differ significantly in how they go about this. Futhark went for a particularly simple model: the declaration <code>import "foo"</code> allows access to the definitions in the file <code>foo.fut</code>, looked up relative to the importing file. That is all there is to it. If you know how a hierarchical file system works, then you know how Futhark looks up files. This is not textual inclusion as in C - each file still has to be syntactically valid on its own. We are not barbarians.</p>
<p><a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2018-06-18-designing-a-programming-language-for-the-desert.html">The philosophical background is spelled out here</a>, but the basic rationale is that <em>nobody enjoys learning about language import mechanics</em>, and in Futhark we can get away with doing something stupidly simple. Other languages, like Haskell and Java, put more effort into decoupling the notion of a “module” or “compilation unit” from that of a physical file. Even languages that reason in terms of files usually also provide support for a “search path”, where you provide the compiler with additional directories that are searched when including files.</p>
<p>The downside of this approach is that for larger programs with multiple directories of source files, a file has no unique way to be referenced (except for its absolute pathname, which is not practical), so you may need to use different relative paths in different files (e.g. <code>"../lib/foo"</code> and <code>"../../lib/foo"</code>). Another downside is that you cannot have a central repository of “system files” that are always checked (like <code>/usr/include</code> in Unix).</p>
<p>A <em>major</em> advantage of the design is that each file in a program can be processed as the “root”, without having to look for some kind of project definition file that contains necessary compiler directives such as include paths. This has allowed very lightweight zero-config tooling, such as a “go to definition” command in <a href="https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark-mode">futhark-mode</a> and showing the types of variables - something that most Emacs modes definitely do not have without additional configuration.</p>
<p>Clearly this solution wouldn’t work for all languages, but it has worked really well for Futhark. I was initially worried because this design is much more similar to <em>bad</em> languages (like shell script) than to <em>good</em> languages (like Haskell), but it hasn’t caused problems yet, and I don’t recall any Futhark programmers ever being confused about how <code>import</code> works. This is the right design for Futhark, and I don’t expect to regret it any time soon.</p>

<p><a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2017-10-10-block-comments-are-a-bad-idea.html">These remain a bad idea</a>. Emacs has <code>M-x comment-region</code> and inferior editors likely have something similar. No regrets. In fact, my experience writing more <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2019-08-31-beginning-a-collection-of-futhark-examples.html">semi-syntactic tooling</a> has only strengthened my conviction. Line comments are easy to parse in an ad-hoc way, and it is particularly nice that there is only one way of writing comments.</p>
<h2 id="explicit-binding"><a href="#explicit-binding" id="explicit-binding-link" title="explicit-binding">Explicit binding</a></h2>
<p>Suppose we have a record type:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>type</span> t = {foo: i32, bar: bool}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In a function definition we can bind variables <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> to the field contents as follows:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>let</span> f ({foo=a, bar=b}: t) = ...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And if we wish to bind variables with the same names as the fields, there is a shorthand syntax inspired by OCaml and Haskell:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>let</span> f ({foo, bar}: t) = ...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>These languages also support an even more concise form:</p>

<p>This implicitly binds variables with the same names as the record fields. Futhark does <em>not</em> support this. The reason is a philosophy of never bringing names into scope unless those names are actually syntactically present at the binding site in some form. There are many things I enjoy about programming, but guessing where some variable comes from is not among them. I find C++’s policy of implicitly bringing class fields into scope inside method bodies to be particularly confusing.</p>
<p>My distaste for complex binding structure goes further: Futhark requires that all definitions occur <em>before</em> their first use. Originally this was just for implementation simplicity, but I have come to enjoy the restriction. It’s nice not to worry so much about the best definition order, because the compiler already ruled out most options. OCaml and SML have similar restrictions, so this is not <em>just</em> Futhark aping some 70s Pascal dialect.</p>
<p>The one exception to this explicitness principle is the <code>open</code> statement, which brings names from another module into scope. While a plain <code>open</code> is rare, it is used implicitly by <code>import</code>. There are also <em>local open</em> expressions, which allow us to write e.g. <code>M.(x*y+z)</code> with the names in module <code>M</code> in scope within the parenthesised expression. This is <em>really</em> convenient when writing advanced modularised numerical code, as the alternative is the much more clumsy <code>x M.* y M.+ z</code>. I am not sure how to reconcile this with our general principle, but maybe you just can’t be a fundamentalist all the time.</p>
<h2 id="no-dependencies"><a href="#no-dependencies" id="no-dependencies-link" title="no-dependencies">No dependencies</a></h2>
<p>Futhark is written in Haskell, and all of its code dependencies are either pure Haskell libraries or embed small amounts of C code. This means that it is quite easy to build the Futhark compiler - all you need is a standard Haskell build tool like <code>stack</code> or <code>cabal</code>, which is supported and documented on most operating systems. I do not recall anyone having trouble installing the compiler itself. Difficulties tend to be more in the direction of setting up GPU drivers on Linux (yet another of the great unsolved problems in computer science).</p>
<p>This policy is not all upside. For many years, we lugged around a home-brewed implementation of algebraic simplification because we were averse to native code dependencies. We also generate C code (compiled with the system C compiler) rather than interacting directly with LLVM the way <a href="http://www.acceleratehs.org/">Accelerate</a> does it. This means that there are some things we cannot efficiently express in our generated code. On the other hand, Accelerate’s dependency on LLVM can make it tricky to install, unless your system happens to have the right version of LLVM installed (and HPC systems and servers running <em>mature</em> versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux tend not to). <a href="https://ispc.github.io/">ISPC</a> provides compiler binaries that embed a statically linked version of LLVM - this <em>may</em> be a direction we could go in, but I suspect statically linking LLVM with a Haskell program is more tricky than linking it with C++. And frankly, I think I already spend too much time hacking on build systems and CI setups.</p>
<p>We have gone quite far with this focus on installation simplicity. For example, the <a href="https://futhark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man/futhark-pkg.html">Futhark package manager</a> does not even use native code to download packages. Instead, it shells out to <code>curl</code>. This has allowed us to statically link the Futhark binary that we provide for releases, a well as not having to worry about certificate store configuration. If you can download with <code>curl</code> in the command line, then <code>futhark pkg</code> will work. And if your system requires you to configure a special proxy or whatnot, then whichever configuration files or environment variables that <code>curl</code> respects will also work for <code>futhark pkg</code>.</p>
<p>I was initially hesitant about this …</p></div></div>

    <p id="desc">Why pretrained machine learning models are often unusable and irreproducible — and
      what we can do about it.</p>
    <p id="by_who">By <a href="https://www.twitter.com/abidlabs/">Abubakar Abid</a></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      A useful approach to designing software is through <em>contracts</em>. For every function in your codebase, you
      start by writing its contract: clearly specifying what inputs are expected and valid for that function (the
      <em>precondition</em>), and what the function will do (the <em>postcondition</em>) when provided an appropriate input.
      This is often explicitly stated in the docstring of a function. Consider this example from the <strong>math</strong> module
      in Python (implemented in C):
    </p>
    

    <p>
      The contract in the docstring has two parts:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Precondition</strong>: input should be an integer between 2⁶² and 2⁶⁴</li>
      <li><strong>Postcondition</strong>: output is an integer within 1 of the square root of the input</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The contract is powerful because when the code is published, other developers <strong>do not need to test the function</strong> themselves, <strong>nor consider its internal implementation</strong>. They can read off the range of valid
      inputs for the function and start using it immediately. Conversely, they operate knowing that <em>if the
        precondition is not satisfied, then neither is the postcondition guaranteed</em>.
    </p>
    <p>Nowadays, <strong>pretrained machine learning models are increasingly being deployed as functions and APIs</strong>. They
      are part of companies’ internal codebases [1], released externally for use through APIs [2], and, in research,
      pretrained models are published as part of the review and reproducibility processes [3].</p>

    <p>
      A pretrained model is essentially a function: it takes in a particular input sample and makes a prediction as the
      output. And as users of these models, we need to know what data is valid to feed into the model, and which data
      can lead to unreliable predictions. <strong>It is usually infeasible to test the model ourselves with all possible
        data, and impossible to inspect the internal implementation</strong>, so if we are provided a contract with a clear
      specification of the valid input data, we can start using the model immediately and confidently. However,
      specifying “valid data” for machine learning models is much harder than it may sound. Let’s consider a few
      challenges, illustrated with examples of publicly released models, all taken from this year’s NeurIPS conference:


    </p><h3>1. When input data needs to be preprocessed in very specific ways</h3>
    <p><strong>Paper</strong>: SEVIR: A Storm Event Imagery Dataset for Deep Learning
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In this paper from MIT, the authors collect a rich dataset of satellite images of storm events recorded over time.
      Helpfully, the authors also release to the community several pretrained models on this dataset.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to use one of the pretrained <em>nowcasting</em> models (used to predict storm movement patterns over the
      next hour) by inputting satellite images from the author’s own dataset into the model, and <strong>started getting
        predictions that didn’t make any sense</strong>. Normalizing the images in different ways didn’t seem to help. I
      traced down the example jupyter notebook that the authors had provided and saw these lines of code:
    </p>

    

    <p>It turns out that <em>some</em> of the channels in the input images were supposed to be rescaled in a <em>very
        specific way</em> for the model to produce reasonable outputs. This information was not packaged in any way with
      the pretrained model, even though it is crucial for the model to work properly. In this case (and as is commonly
      the case), the model did not throw any errors even though the data was not scaled properly. It chugged along,
      making nonsensical predictions, and I was left to realize on my own that something was wrong.</p>

    <p>Information related to preprocessing of the input data should be included in the documentation of pretrained
      models; otherwise, we are left to figure out for ourselves on how to prepare data for inference. <strong>But it is at
        least conceivable that these preprocessing details <em>could</em> be included in technical documentation</strong>.
      Sometimes, it’s not just preprocessing…
    </p>
    <h3>2. When input data needs to come from a specific dataset</h3>
    <p>
      Paper: Object-Centric Learning with Slot Attention
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
      As we shall see, this third example is particularly problematic, in that it is extremely difficult to specify in
      advance what kind of images the model can accept and where it fails. The authors publish a state-of-the-art
      super-resolution model that takes in a low-resolution or standard-resolution of an image, and outputs a
      higher-resolution version. Here’s an example of the released pretrained model working beautifully:</p>
    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/68WpY48/DAN.png">
    <p>However, let’s try the same model with a different image:</p>

    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4800/1*XooM_r2OGcMOHfbNR65jcA.png">
    <p>
      How strange! I certainly was not expecting this blueish image as the output of a state-of-the-art super-resolution
      model. Certainly, this failure mode would not happen with a classical image processing algorithm for sharpening
      images. But with this machine learning model, we do not have any idea of the internal implementation, and because
      there is no contract, we do not know which images we can trust this model with!
    </p>

    <p>
      After spending hours wrangling with the model, I couldn’t figure out what images the model correctly resolves and
      which ones produce these strange blue outputs. Because the model is missing a contract, this is a significant
      waste of engineering effort: I spent a significant amount of time getting the model loaded and running locally
      only to realize that it won’t work for some of my data.
    </p>
    <h3>Conclusion — is there a solution?</h3>
    <p>
      We machine learning developers often assume that if we are able to get good performance on our test sets, our
      models are ready to deploy and release. <strong>We do not concern ourselves enough with how downstream users are using
        models with data that might look quite different from our training and test sets</strong>. However, this is happening
      more and more: as machine learning models are being released as APIs for general use, or are being deployed
      internally but data streams are changing over time, <strong>we can no longer assume that a model’s test performance is
        indicative of its performance in the real world</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We need to provide contracts that make it clear to users what input data are valid for our models. Otherwise,
      machine learning models will work properly until they don’t. Systems built on top of machine learning models will
      fail.
    </p>
    <p>At the same time, we’ve seen that specifying valid input data through explicit instructions is difficult. What
      can be done? I have two suggestions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>We develop better methods for determining whether a sample belongs to our model’s “valid data distribution.”
        Perhaps contracts can themselves be “contract functions,” which assess whether an input sample is valid if it is
        “similar” enough to our training distribution. Such methods for detecting in-distribution and
        out-of-distribution data are being developed [4], though there are caveats to using them in practice [5].</li>
      <li>We make it easier to test models so that model failures are identified easily and earlier in the model
        development process. This helps model creators know and communicate the preconditions of their library, and
        helps end users quickly know if a model is suitable for their use. This is the motivation behind our open-source
        <a href="https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio">gradio</a> library. In fact, the failure points identified in the
        models above were all easily done with the library.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      And of course, we can pursue both solutions at the same time — we make it easier to identify model failure points,
      but also invest in developing contract functions for machine learning models going forward.

      <section>
        <p>Something really interesting happens when you consume a boatload of information: your brain begins to pick out patterns from the mass of stories in your head. This is true regardless of whether it’s books that you’re reading, or podcasts, or even just research programs that you’re executing (I know friends who — on becoming a parent — go <em>deep</em> into child development research; the same thing probably happens for them once they cross a certain threshold of information consumption.)</p><p>I read 53 books last year, most of it as an alternative to therapy for pandemic-related burnout. If a stranger were to look at my list of books, it would look like a random grab bag of topics, authors, and ideas. But when <em>I</em> look at my list, I see books falling into clusters, each cluster representing a set of questions I want answered, and in some cases have been investigating for a number of years now.</p><p>I thought I’d start 2021 with one of the questions that leapt out at me over the course of 2020, along with the books (and external sources!) that I consumed in order to investigate it.</p><h2 id="uber-how-do-you-see-into-the-future">Uber: How Do You See Into The Future?</h2><p>I read Mike Isaac’s <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44573628-super-pumped">Super Pumped</a></em> and Brad Stone’s <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29905580-the-upstarts">The Upstarts</a></em> fairly late in the year last year, shortly before the Airbnb IPO, and two years after the Uber one.</p><p>The books are ostensibly about Uber’s rise to greatness (and in <em>Super Pumped</em>, Uber’s fall from greatness). Both authors spend some time on the structural and technological changes that led to the rise of the sharing economy, but the bulk of the book is focused on the narrative arc of the main actors. I sometimes read such business biographies and struggle to find useful, generalisable things that I can learn from them — you would think that in Uber’s case, the lessons might be “winning at any cost is often not worth it” or “<a href="https://stratechery.com/2017/the-uber-dilemma/">VCs might stab you in the back if you represent too large a size of their portfolio, because this turns things into a finite game</a> (vs an infinite one)” and “you really really <em>really</em> need to get lucky if you want to take advantage of a structural shift; nobody recognised the underlying reasons for the sharing economy until <em>after</em> the fact”. As with many business biographies, the lessons are often too specific to the story to matter; you read the narrative simply to add an extra business pattern to your head.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>But that last lesson — on the recognition of structural shifts — isn’t exactly true. While nobody could say that they understood the <em>full</em> opportunity in ride-hailing, I think there’s a plausible case that Uber board member and venture capitalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gurley">Bill Gurley</a> saw more than most. I spent three books and a couple of podcast episodes looking into it last year — mostly because I was interested in the kind of thinking that allowed Gurley to bet big on Uber. In other words: what did Bill Gurley <em>see</em>? What did he focus on in the fog of uncertainty around early ride-hailing? And how did he pick the right horse?</p><p>It’s easy to forget that in the early days of ride-hailing, it wasn’t at all clear that Uber would emerge as the winner. One of the dangers of reading business history is that everything seems pre-ordained — <em>of course</em> Uber would win; <em>of course</em> they would prevail against government regulation; <em>of course</em> Kalanick was a ridiculously effective combatant in the ride-hailing wars. But for a taste of what it must’ve felt like circa 2011, <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/what-uncertainty-feels-like/">recall how the fog of uncertainty felt in the early days of the pandemic last year</a>, or even the confusion one feels about the multitude of crypto projects today.</p><p>To hear Isaac and Stone tell it, Gurley met with <em>every</em> Uber-like startup in the 2010-2011 period, long before ride-hailing was on most peoples’s radars. He eventually backed Travis Kalanick and Uber. The story isn’t that straightforward, however: before he found Kalanick, he offered $8 million to Taxi Magic at a $32 million valuation (he was turned down), and tried to get into an early Cabulous financing round (the founder, John Wolpert, told him the round was ‘full’).</p><p>How did Gurley win? One — trite — answer is that Gurley got lucky. He had been searching for taxi-related marketplace startups for many months, and found Uber only after every other competitor had turned him down. It was thus a stroke of luck that the first — and last! — deal he made in the market turned out to be the winning one.</p><p>But that trite answer obscures another fact: when it comes to marketplace startups, Gurley has had a hell of a track record. He invested in GrubHub, Nextdoor, LiveOps, OpenTable, Stitch Fix, and Zillow, amongst others. And indeed, whenever I listen to Gurley talk about marketplaces or network effects on a podcast or at an interview, his comments tend to be a <em>lot</em> more nuanced when compared to his contemporaries. You get the feeling that he’s skimming from the surface of a very deep pond.</p><p>Take, for instance, this <a href="https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/12224182/gurley-all-things-business-and-investing">interview</a> with Patrick O’Shaughnessy:</p><blockquote><strong>Gurley:</strong> And I've come up with this phrase I use internally that I made up. So one day I'll have to write a definition of it, but I call it liquidity quality. And I tell entrepreneurs, “I care way more about that than I do how broad you are. We can use venture dollars and growth playbooks to go broad if the fires burning bright. And so how do you get this liquidity quality high?” And Jeremy <em>(the Yelp founder)</em>, being at those nightclubs in San Francisco and people being super passionate and their review frequency being high, that caused the quality of the experience, even though it was in a very small area.<p>And so I very frequently run into entrepreneurs who think they need to expand to 10 cities really quickly to raise their A or their B or whatever. And I'm like, “No, if you have like incredible unit economics and growth metrics in a single city where it's obvious that your playbook's working and things are spinning and things are getting better and you're basically having network effects, that's way more interesting.”</p><p><strong>O’Shaughnessy:</strong> Are there interesting markers of whether it's liquidity quality or the health of the network itself in a contained area that you find especially interesting?</p><p><strong>Gurley:</strong> I mean, I think that's exactly what you have to look for. The reason I can't say measure A, B and C is you have to know the system that you're looking at and then define what that is. But I think every company that's trying to build a marketplace, UGC <em>(user generated content) </em>and network effect, should have some definition of what quality looks like or liquidity threshold that matters and track it like crazy.</p></blockquote><p>Gurley’s conception of ‘liquidity quality’ made me sit up. If you spend enough time sniffing for <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-mental-model-faq/">tacit mental models</a>, you would learn to recognise signs of expert pattern recognition. Gurley’s inability to articulate ‘liquidity quality’ was likely due to the <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-tacit-knowledge-series/">tacit</a> nature of his recognition: that is, the LQ metric was different for every marketplace startup that Gurley had seen; he could — to paraphrase Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart — “know it when he saw it”. Later on in the podcast, for instance, Gurley explains:</p><blockquote><strong>Gurley:</strong> … Tinder, ironically did this with parties, not really a UGC, but kind of a UGC company in each city that they would launch in because you want to get the quality up to a certain high level. And Nextdoor, we did the craziest thing in the world. We said, "Until you get to 10 members, you can't open your neighbourhood." So intentionally restrictive because we didn't want ghost town experiences and we knew quality of the experience was a function of how many neighbours were in your system.<p>So we thought the anticipation of getting in was a better user experience than getting in and finding it poor. And so we'd encourage you to go find the other so you could unlock your neighbourhood, is almost like a game heuristic. And so every one of these you'll find there's somebody that understands that nuance and about how this is going to tip and have some type of growth playbook is what people would call it. But I find the number of entrepreneurs that are capable of successfully launching a UGC play is a very small fraction, maybe less than 1% of all entrepreneurs. And they just tend to have a nuanced feel for what it takes to make something come alive and the feature sets that matter and how much they care about quality, I keep going back to that word, but it's what makes the kind of fire burn and then makes it possible to grow into ever bigger circles.</p></blockquote><p>Think about the implication of that insight: Gurley and company restricted the growth of Nextdoor in order to optimise for ‘liquidity quality’ — that ineffable mix of user value and density; they only allowed it to spread to neighbourhoods that were <em>adjacent</em> to existing ones with high LQ. That way, when you signed up for Nextdoor, you would be able to search for reviews of local businesses and services, because it would have already been filled in by users in the adjacent neighbourhoods.</p><p>My point: Gurley appears to have thought <em>really deeply</em> about the nature of networked marketplaces, at a level above many of his peers. One reason for this might be that he started much earlier compared to everyone else:</p><blockquote><strong>Gurley:</strong> So between '93 and '96 I was working on Wall Street at Credit Suisse First Boston in the research department. And literally the first or second day fell into a friendship with Mike Mauboussin, who you've had on many times and who you know well. And Mike and I, even though he was the food analyst and I was the tech analyst, we started sharing ideas and books and whatnot and I actually don't remember which one of us, he might remember, had a book called Complexity by Mitchell Waldrop which was about the rise of the Santa Fe Institute. And in that book, Brian Arthur is one of the heroes, early professor at Santa Fe Institute and someone that had a lot of different radical ideas. And so we had read that book and I think visited Santa Fe and met Brian, but this notion of increasing returns that some company that got to a big level would find it even …</blockquote></section></div></div>

<p>On Tuesday, 15<sup>th</sup> of December, Ethiopian federal troops and Amhara militia approached the Mariam of Zion cathedral in the Tigrayan city of Aksum. It is possible that they thought that Tigrayan troops were sheltering in the church – taking advantage of the ancient right of sanctuary. According to a number of sources the church was full, with some saying that up to 1,000 people were in the building or the compound surrounding it.</p>
<p>The advancing soldiers caused consternation: a chapel in the compound is believed by Ethiopians to house the biblical Ark of the Covenant. Only a monk – appointed as its guardian – may see it. There was a huge commotion. Amhara soldiers are reported to have shouted that “the Ark belongs in Addis Ababa!” but this cannot be confirmed. Those inside the cathedral came out to try to defend the sacred object.</p>
<p>A confrontation ensued. Everyone in the compound was forced into the square outside the cathedral. As the crowd milled around, there was further shouting and the troops opened fire on the protesting crowd. As many as 750 people are reported to have been killed.</p>
<p>News of the massacre has only gradually reached the outside world. People walked over 200 kilometres to the regional capital, Mekelle, and from there the story gradually filtered out – despite the clamp-down on the media in Tigray.</p>

<p>News of the massacre follows confirmation by the Ethiopian authorities that one of the most sacred Islamic sites, the Nejashi Mosque in the town of Wukro, had been badly damaged in fighting.</p>
<p>It was <a href="https://www.omanobserver.om/the-untold-story-of-king-negash-and-the-al-nejashi-mosque/">built</a> in the 7th century by the companions of the Prophet Mohammad, some of whom are buried at the site.</p>
<p>The Ethiopian government accepts the damage took place, and promises to restore the building, which is one of the oldest mosques in the world.</p>
<p>The government say it was attacked after Tigrayan troops dug trenches around the mosque.</p>
<p>Independent journalists are being prevented from visiting the Tigray region – the site of a fierce conflict between Tigrayan fighters and Ethiopian and Eritrean troops, supported by Amhara militia.</p>

January 12, 2021 | https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2021/hausdorff/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2021/hausdorff/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>In this post, I want to briefly discuss the Hausdorff distance, its
uses, and its extensions. Prior to delving into this, we need to
understand our setting here. We are dealing with a metric space $(X,
\operatorname{d})$ and its subsets. A metric space is, in some sense,
one of the most fundamental mathematical objects that everyone is
working with, either consciously or unconsciously. It is defined as
a space, i.e. a set of points&nbsp;(or objects in general, but for the
sake of intuition, I will only refer to points), together with a distance
function $\operatorname{d}\colon X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$, the
eponymous <em>metric</em> of the space. This function must satisfy three
properties for all points $x, y, z \in X$:</p>
<ol>
<li>$\operatorname{d}(x, y) = 0$ if and only if $x = y$</li>
<li>$\operatorname{d}(x, y) = \operatorname{d}(y, x)$</li>
<li>$\operatorname{d}(x, z) \leq \operatorname{d}(x, y) + \operatorname{d}(y, z)$</li>
</ol>
<p>These properties are usually also known as the ‘identity of
indiscernibles’, ‘symmetric’, and the ‘triangle inequality’,
respectively. Property 1 just tells us that we can always distinguish
between points that are <em>not</em> the same—the metric is zero if and only
if the points are identical. Property 2 is a symmetry condition, telling
us that the order in which we evaluate the arguments of the function
does not matter. Finally, Property 3 indicates that the distance between
two points is never larger than adding a third point in-between. It is
called the <em>triangle inequality</em> because the sides of a triangle can be
seen to satisfy this. We can also reformulate it as stating that the sum
of the lengths of any two sides in a triangle must be greater than or
equal to the length of the last side.</p>
<p>The quintessential example of a metric space is the $d$-dimensional
Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$ with the usual Euclidean distance between
points, i.e. $\operatorname{d}(x, y) := \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^d(x_i - y_i)^2}$.
While there are all kinds of interesting relaxations of the three
aforementioned properties, leading to things such as pseudometrics,
I want to focus on a very simple question here: given two finite
subsets $X_1, X_2 \subset X$, possibly of different sizes, can we
measure their distance from each other?</p>
<p>It turns out that we can and this is where we need the Hausdorff
distance! Before giving definitions, let us look at an example and see
how we could define such a distance ourselves. To this end, assume that
these are our two subsets $X_1$&nbsp;(in red) and $X_2$&nbsp;(in blue):</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/point_clouds.svg" alt="An example of two sets in a metric space" height="128"> 
</figure>

</div>
<p>To motivate our first definition for the Hausdorff distance, note that
if $X_1 \subset X_2$&nbsp;(or vice versa), it would be easier to
calculate the distance, because we would only have to account for the
parts that are <em>not</em> part of the subset, and we would have to measure
how far it is to every other point of the smaller subset. With this in
hand, let’s <em>pretend</em> that $X_1$ and $X_2$ can be <em>turned</em> into subsets
of each other! To this end, we define the $\epsilon$-thickening for
$\epsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ as the space we obtain by replacing every
point $x$ in the sample by an $\epsilon$-ball, i.e. the set of all points in
the metric space $X$ that are at most $\epsilon$ units away from $x$.
This has the effect of ‘squinting’ at a subsample. Let’s illustrate this
for the circle:</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/circle_05.svg" alt="An $\epsilon$-thickening of a circle" height="128"> <figcaption>
            <p>An $\epsilon$-thickening for $\epsilon = 5$</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

</div>
<p>We can of course increase $\epsilon$ to ‘squint even more’:</p>

<p>How do we know when to <em>stop</em>, though? Well, we can stop once <em>both</em>
$X_1$ and $X_2$ are subsets of an $\epsilon$-thickening of the
respective other space!  Using the notation $X_1^{(\epsilon)}$ for the
$\epsilon$-thickening of $X_1$&nbsp;(and analogously for $X_2$), this
leads to our first definition of the Hausdorff distance as
$\operatorname{d}_{\mathrm{H}}(X_1, X_2) := \inf \left\{ \epsilon &gt; 0 \mid X_1
\subset X_2^{(\epsilon)} \text{ and } X_2 \subset X_1^{(\epsilon)}
\right\}$.</p>
<p>Let’s briefly disentangle this! We define the distance between $X_1$ and
$X_2$ as the <em>smallest</em> $\epsilon$ that we need such that both $X_1$ and
$X_2$ are subsets of an $\epsilon$-thickening of the other space. As
a simple example, consider thickening both $X_1$ and $X_2$ with
increasing values:</p>

<p>We can see that it takes large values of $\epsilon$ for $X_1
\subset X_2^{(\epsilon)} \text{ and } X_2 \subset X_1^{(\epsilon)}$ to
hold. Let’s take a look at an alternative definition. To this end,
assume that an adversary can place you on one point of one of the sets.
Your goal is to travel as quickly as possible to the <em>other</em> set. The
Hausdorff distance is now the <em>longest</em> distance the adversary
can force you to travel. We can formulate this as follows:</p>
<p>$$d_{\mathrm{H}}(X_1, X_2) := \max\left\{\sup_{x_1 \in X_1} \inf_{x_2 \in X_2} d(x_1, x_2), \sup_{x_2 \in X_2} \inf_{x_1 \in X_1} d(x_1,x_2)\right\}$$</p>
<p>Note the inherent symmetry of the two terms in the distance here. The
first one calculates the distance from the perspective of $X_1$, looking
for the point $x_1 \in X_1$ that <em>maximises</em> the <em>minimum</em> distance to
$X_2$. The second term works analogously.</p>
<p>The two definitions yield the same distance.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> This is intuitive
to see when you consider that if we follow the first definition, we end
up with a value for $\epsilon$ that is precisely the worst-case bound
for the distance one needs to travel to go from set to the other set. On
the other hand, following the second definition, we can construct the
$\epsilon$-thickening and it will be guaranteed—thanks to the
symmetry condition—that there is no point in either one of the sets to
lie outside the thickened space.</p>
<p>This covers the case for subsets from the <em>same</em> metric space $X$. But
what can we do if we have two <em>different</em> compact<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> metric spaces $X$ and $Y$&nbsp;(or subsets
thereof), each one with their own metric? To solve this case, we will
use a trick and use an intermediate space. This leads to the
Gromov–Hausdorff distance $d_\mathrm{GH}(X, Y)$, which is defined as
the <em>infimum</em> of all Hausdorff distances $d_\mathrm{H}\left(f(X), g(Y)\right)$,
where $f\colon X \to Z$ and $g\colon Y \to Z$ are <em>isometric embeddings</em>
into a shared metric space $Z$.</p>
<p>In other words: we are looking for two functions $f$ and $g$ that leave
the distances in $X$ and $Y$ intact—hence the term <em>isometric</em>—so
that we can measure the Hausdorff distance in the shared space $Z$
instead. As you can imagine from the definition, the
Gromov–Hausdorff distance is tough to calculate because finding an
appropriate $f$ and $g$ is not easy. Nevertheless, the Gromov–Hausdorff
distance has some fascinating properties and is one of the ‘workhorses’
in geometrical data analysis. If you want to learn more, I can highly
recommend reading the paper <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1057432.1057436">Comparing Point Clouds</a> by <a href="https://people.math.osu.edu/memolitechera.1">Facundo
Mémoli</a> and <a href="https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/guillermo-sapiro">Guillermo Sapiro</a>.</p>
<p>Happy distance calculations, until next time!</p>

        <div>
            <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

    

    <div itemprop="articleBody">
        <h2 id="prologue-getting-muted-in-a-a-video-conference">   Prologue: getting muted in a a video conference <a href="#prologue-getting-muted-in-a-a-video-conference">#</a>   </h2>
                    

<p>As is the trend for many since 2020, I am working remote, and as a result in a lot of video conferences.</p>

<p>One silver lining with being remote is the ability to take notes: by nature of video conference, you’re in front of the computer, so it’s a lot easier to take notes on your computer without looking like you’re not paying attention.</p>

<p>In one such meeting, I was notified how I was muted in the middle while someone else was talking: it turns out my keyboard noise was quite audible! How embarassing.</p>

<p>So thus started the quest to find the quietest keyboard possible.</p>
                <h2 id="whats-causing-the-noise-when-i-type">   What’s causing the noise when I type? <a href="#whats-causing-the-noise-when-i-type">#</a>   </h2>
                    

<p>For context: I use an <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">ergodox-ez</a>. I didn’t realize it, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoDoxEZ/comments/9ls494/ergodoxez_case_seems_very_loud/">loud noise with the Ergodox EZ is a common issue</a>.</p>

<p>On the ergodox-ez page, there is a lot of discussion around keyswitches (the thing that detects the key being pressed) and how much they affect noise. I chose the <a href="https://www.cherrymx.de/en/mx-original/mx-brown.html">Cherry MX Browns</a> since they are made to be silent, but still provide a tactile feel.</p>

<p>But after experimenting with different keyboards, removing some pieces, and changing my style, I’ve found that keyswitches are just one piece of the puzzle. The additional factors I found were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keycaps: the cap you put on the key switches. Once you put the keycap on, the clacking becomes louder, seemingly due to the resonation of the keys to the bottom of the switch.</li>
  <li>keyboard housing: the reverberation that occurs in the housing can be significant. This occurs while the key is being pressed, and even once it’s released.</li>
</ul>

<p>When holding a decibel meter up to where my microphone is during calls, and when typing a single key in a rhythmic fashion, I found that my ErgoDox produces noise of 62.8 decibels (dB) of loudness. My voice talking normally (and also much closer to the mic) is roughly 72 dB.</p>

<p>To be silent for practical purposes, the keyboard would have to produce below 40dB of noise: that’s roughly the loudness of a library.</p>
                <h2 id="keyboard-components-in-depth">   Keyboard components in depth <a href="#keyboard-components-in-depth">#</a>   </h2>
                    
                <h3 id="keycaps">   Keycaps <a href="#keycaps">#</a>   </h3>
                    

<p>As mentioned previously, keycaps are the cover for a key, and is often marked with the key that would be typed if pressed. A little research shows that <a href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=69537.0">PBT plastic dampens higher frequencies</a>. These seemed to be loud in my case.</p>
                <h3 id="o-rings">   O-rings <a href="#o-rings">#</a>   </h3>
                    

<p>If your keypresses are loud, it’s common to just add o-rings (plastic rings that wrap the stem of your keycap) rather than brand by new switches. I’ve found the use of o-rings to be hit or miss, but generally they do play a part in reducing the noise of your keypresses, at the cost of the “feel” of your keys (the press feels a little squish at the bottom due to the ring being compressed rather than hitting whatever bottom it normally does).</p>
                <h3 id="key-switches">   Key switches <a href="#key-switches">#</a>   </h3>
                    

<p>Key Switches are the mechanical components which are responsible for “actuation”, in other words registering a key press.</p>

<p>There are a few general properties that can be used to categorize switches:</p>
                <h4 id="clicky-or-silent">   Clicky or silent <a href="#clicky-or-silent">#</a>   </h4>
                    

<p>If the switch is clicky, then the actuation includes a purposeful “click” sound. The click is actually not necessary to register the key press.</p>
                <h4 id="tactile-or-linear">   Tactile or linear <a href="#tactile-or-linear">#</a>   </h4>
                    

<p>For silent switches, tactile switches include physical feedback when the key is actuated. You feel a little resistance, and once that gives way you know you’ve pressed the button.</p>

<p>With a linear switch, the resistance is the same all the way through, which doesn’t give you a way to physically determine when the press was made.</p>
                <h4 id="travel-distance">   Travel distance <a href="#travel-distance">#</a>   </h4>
                    

<p>The distance the switch travels between pressed and unpressed. Typically a few millimeters.</p>
                <h4 id="actuation-force">   Actuation force <a href="#actuation-force">#</a>   </h4>
                    

<p>The total amount of force that must be applied to actuate the switch. The key will feel harder to press if the actuation force is higher.</p>
                <h4 id="my-conclusion-on-switches">   My Conclusion on Switches <a href="#my-conclusion-on-switches">#</a>   </h4>
                    

<p>I chose a switch with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>highest possible actuation force and travel distance. I tend to hit keys quite hard, and to minimize sound I need to try to actuate the key, but not actually “bottom out” and have my switch hit the bottom.</li>
  <li>Silent and linear attributes. Silent since the whole goal is to not make sound, and I found through testing that silent tactile switches result in additional noise when you hit the tactile feedback. The linear has no such noise.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the switch brand themselves, I found that Cherry MX, Gateron, and Kailh brand switches made roughly the same amount of noise. However, the <a href="https://zealpc.net/products/healio">ZealPC Healios</a> were orders of magnitude quieter in my HotDox. I’m not sure on exactly why, but it was impressive. Combined with the fact that they were linear switches, the Healios were the winner.</p>
                <h3 id="keyboard-housing">   Keyboard housing <a href="#keyboard-housing">#</a>   </h3>
                    

<p>The keyboard housing played a big part, based on my experiments (details below).</p>

<p>Housings that had less air inside produced less noise, since there wasn’t space for reverberation and the force of the keypress was more dampened by the material the keybaord was on.</p>

<p>Based on reviews, I read that the <a href="https://www.alpacakeyboards.com/">Hot Dox</a> keyboard was very silent (acrylic case with very little empty space inside). To further reduce any chance of reverberation, I added some <a href="https://kbdfans.com/collections/keyboard-foam/products/kbdfans-module-foam">EVA foam</a> to fill the space between the PCB and the metallic cover on top.</p>

<p>There is also a material called <a href="https://www.sorbothane.com/">Sorbothane</a> that dampens things even better than foam, but I didn’t go that route because it would require hand-cutting it, and the material is hard to cut. If I tried to cut it without special equipment, I would probably end up with a rather uneven and unpleasent look.</p>
                <h3 id="material-keyboard-is-on">   Material keyboard is on <a href="#material-keyboard-is-on">#</a>   </h3>
                    

<p>I also found that the material the keyboard is on made a difference, although of a couple decibels. Typing on hard wood was louder. I read that using a keyboard / mousepad mat and putting your keyboard on top helps, so I purchased <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014CP231W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">a cheap one on Amazon</a>.</p>
                <h2 id="experiments-with-different-scenarios">   Experiments with different scenarios <a href="#experiments-with-different-scenarios">#</a>   </h2>
                    

<p>To verify what I read, I tried to take some measurements with the loudness of various keyboards and configurations.</p>

<p>Although I originally tried to test the various scenarios with a decibel app on my phone, I found that the sensitivity wasn’t good enough to capture even relative differences between the different configurations. So I purchased a real decibel meter.</p>

<p>To measure the volume, I hovered the decibel meter about 3cm directly above the key being pressed. I pressed with the same rhythm, setting the decibel to “max” setting to capture the loudest the keypress ever is.</p>

<p>All experiments were with PBT Keycaps.</p>

<p>I started with a keyboard that was very loud (72.9 decibels), and was able to finish with a setup that was roughly 20dB quieter! Although the real noise reduction may be lower due to the microphone being more than 3cm away from the keyboard, the relative comparison is going from a noisy restaurant (70db) to a quiet office (50db).</p>

However, with the development of technology, the support has included more and more new functions, and its importance has grown. The COVID-19 pandemic also contributed to the development of IT support. In this article, we will figure out why IT support is important for business, why its quality directly affects the company’s profits, and what the prospects for this area are.</span></p>
<h2><span>The historical value of IT support</span></h2>
<p><span>The responsibilities of this service have grown in number steadily as technology, methodologies, and customer relationships have evolved.</span></p>
<p><span>Today, the main functions of the IT help desk include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>technical support for the company’s employees;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>support of external clients – users of the company’s products;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>maintenance of the company’s infrastructure and its applications/products;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>control over the execution of requests at the agreed service levels;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Call Center/Help Desk;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>work with the Service Desk system;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>filling the knowledge base;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>monitoring the quality of the company’s IT services;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>communication with clients, employees, contractors.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>And this is without a lot of smaller tasks that differ depending on the specifics of a company. Most of them are hidden from prying eyes like the underwater part of an iceberg.</span></p>
<p><span>Despite the deepness of modern IT support, there is an opinion that this support for both employees and customers does not have an essential impact on the financial performance of the company. This point of view has been formed over decades, so no wonder that changing it is very difficult. But the world does not stand still, and changes have affected this function of the business as well.</span></p>
<p><span>It is the support service that is often the first point of contact between customers and a company, and it has great potential to take their relationship to the next level. Modern IT support specialists are no longer bearded geeks in sweaters who speak incomprehensible tech jargon.</span></p>
<p><span>Nowadays, a qualified IT support specialist is a person with a high level of sociability and empathy, as well as teamwork and problem-solving skills. Such a specialist is constantly evolving and puts the needs of the client first. And they can give the business something more than solving clients’ problems and advising them.</span></p>
<h2><span>COVID-19: a tragedy or a chance?</span></h2>
<p><span>The coronavirus pandemic directly affected the development of IT support services, just as it affected all businesses across the world. From the digital transformation era perspective, these changes present a tremendous opportunity for CEOs around the world.</span></p>
<p><span>The pandemic has greatly accelerated the global development of digital processes. Companies that managed to implement digital solutions in time have already seen practical benefits for their businesses. Those that hadn’t, realized their oversight with the beginning of the transition of the whole world to remote work. There is no doubt that the trend will not decline but, vice versa, only grow in the coming years.</span></p>
<p><span>This opens up new opportunities and forces businesses to be more flexible, including in IT processes. In addition, the massive transfer of IT teams around the world to remote work has opened the eyes of companies to the effectiveness of remote support. More and more companies are announcing their plans to work in this mode at least for the whole of 2020, and some are organizing this process on an ongoing basis.</span></p>
<p><span>The work of IT support is going to a new level and increasing the value of the outsourcing format. Outsourcing companies often have a higher level of process maturity and a larger pool of resources than internal IT teams. Moreover, outsourcing services also actively introduce new digital approaches and change their models in accordance with modern customer requirements. Their flexibility is now extremely high, and the benefits of using their services are maximized.</span></p>
<p><span>These companies operate at agreed levels of service, so the client can be confident in the quality of service they will receive and how much it will cost. Both </span><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/customer-service-support/insights/trending-topics/coronavirus-impact"><span>Gartner</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/digital-transformation/articles/delivering-customer-service-during-COVID-19.html"><span>Deloitte</span></a><span> are reporting the increased value of outsourcing services during the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span>There are many examples of successful transfer of customer service to outsourcing companies, including by such well-known entities as Microsoft, Dell, Ford Motor Company, CISCO, General Electric, American Express. Cost reduction remains one of the major reasons for such transfers, but </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/operations/articles/global-outsourcing-survey.html"><span>Deloitte research shows</span></a><span> that modern companies are concentrating more on the overall value they can get from the outsourcing services instead of just cost savings.</span></p>
<h2><span>The digital future of IT support services</span></h2>
<p><span>Digital transformation is primarily perceived as the introduction of new technologies and communication channels in the work with clients. More and more companies are implementing chatbots, virtual assistants, notifications via messengers, polls via social networks, etc. Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Big Data are also increasingly used to create additional customer benefits in IT services.</span></p>
<p><span>But even this is not enough to get the maximum benefits of the current period of digital transformation. Now the most important thing is to change how the operating model of IT support works with clients. All operational processes need to be improved to meet the new service requirements that are put forward by today’s customers.</span></p>
<p><span>IT support teams should reorient from their usual performance indicators to those that are more important for the business:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Net Promoter Score</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Customer Lifetime Value</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Customer Profitability.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>The new benchmarks for the IT support function should be aimed at increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty by creating additional benefits for them. And IT support team leaders should reconsider processes much more often. This will ensure that the quality of their teams’ work meets the current requirements of clients.</span></p>
<p><b>Additional features of the support service that add value to your business:</b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Analyzing customer needs and behaviors</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Identifying key touchpoints of customers</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Growing customers’ loyalty through a personalized experience</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Demonstrating to customers how they can get the best from the new digital solutions</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Providing fast feedback about the efficiency of new methods and technologies</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span>All this makes it obvious that there is a need for urgent changes in the operational approaches of IT support for every company that wants to achieve maximum success in working with clients. The old approaches are hopelessly outdated, and the competition is higher than ever before. At the same time, the scale of the ongoing digital changes is enormous and brings many benefits to the business.</span></p>
<p><span>Those companies that adapt to the demands of the new era faster than others will be the first to maximize their competitive advantages. And clients, for their part, will tend to work with those companies that are actively implementing digital solutions in their work for the sake of the clients’ convenience. This is a win-win situation.</span></p>
<h2><span>Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span>The transformation has already affected all aspects of the business: sales, marketing, development, and so on. But the support service has one big advantage over all others: it historically has the maximum flexibility necessary to work effectively with customers. In a fast-paced world, support teams who work directly with customers on a daily basis are used to changing their approaches and tools as soon as required.</span></p>
<p><span>Since customers now more than ever dictate to companies the level of service they receive, the willingness of organizations to respond quickly to these requirements plays center stage. And here, the flexibility of customer service specialists and their developed software skills will be more useful than ever.</span></p>
<p><span>The determination to act and change is needed for one more reason. Digital transformation is not the last of the key trends affecting the business environment. It will be followed by other trends, also critical for business development. The sooner companies start implementing technological innovations, the sooner they will have the opportunity to be among the leaders in their field.</span></p>
<p><span>This mindset is now more important than ever for leaders who determine the strategy for support services for the coming months and years. Today, clients are very demanding and highly value quality service. The opportunities that have opened up for companies in the current era of digital transformation may be exactly the accelerator that many of them dream of. The only question is who is ready to change quickly for the benefit of clients and for the sake of their future – in practice, not just in words.</span></p>

When I first discovered it in 2016, I really liked how it can almost be fully customized as per the likes. Well, almost, because there was no way you could add or configure any buttons on the top side of the editor. FYI, this is possible in many popular IDEs like IntelliJ, Eclipse, Visual Studio, and even Notepad++. I was more of a mouse-guy back then so the lack of GUI buttons was hindering my so called <em>developer productivity</em>.</p><p>I decided to build an extension for this. That would add handy buttons for many common commands like save file, format (beautify) file, show opened files list, etc. To build this, I followed VSCode extension development docs and learned typescript along the way. I named it <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jerrygoyal.shortcut-menu-bar">Shortcut Menu Bar</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://gourav.io/_next/static/media/pages/blog/first-donation-on-open-source-side-project/1.png" alt="Shortcut Menu Bar"><figcaption>Shortcut Menu Bar</figcaption></figure><p>Fast-forward to 2020, and it got over 10k+ downloads and multiple 5-star ratings. I guess I wasn't the only mouse-guy out there.<br>

I explored few platforms to create donation links like buymeacoffee.com (charges 5% fee), patreon.com (more geared towards recurring donations, 5% fee), PayPal (UI sucks), Ko-Fi.com (0% fee and nice clean UI).</p><p>I made a free account on ko-fi.com, linked my PayPal account, and created a donation link. I added that link to the extension description.</p><figure><img src="https://gourav.io/_next/static/media/pages/blog/first-donation-on-open-source-side-project/2.png" alt="Buy me a coffee"><figcaption>Buy me a coffee</figcaption></figure><p>And guess what? someone donated 5$.</p><figure><img src="https://gourav.io/_next/static/media/pages/blog/first-donation-on-open-source-side-project/3.png" alt="donation via ko-fi.com"><figcaption>donation via ko-fi.com</figcaption></figure><p>I know I know, it's not that big amount, but somebody put an effort to make that transaction means he cared about it and found it useful.
I hope it inspires people who want to contribute and build stuff in the FOSS (Free and Open-Source Software) community. It's so captivating that the whole tech industry relies (and thrives) on open source software made by people in their free time.<br>

Despite living in Switzerland, since I am Portuguese, I usually fly with <a href="https://www.flytap.com/">TAP</a> at least to go home.</p><p>When I visit TAP's website, I am presented with a website in German. This is normal. Switzerland is a country with four national languages: German, French, Italian and Romansh. The most common one is German, so it stands to reason that most websites targeted at (or from) Switzerland present themselves in German on your first visit when they see you are coming from Switzerland.</p><p>Sadly, I don't know German (yet), so every time I enter a website in German, I start looking for the language picker so I can change the language to one that I might understand. Once I do this on TAP's website, I can finally get down to business and buy my tickets and when I do, I'm happy and leave the website thinking about the beaches and the sand waiting for me.</p><p>Sadly, five minutes later, I'm not that happy anymore because I just realized that I needed to travel with a check-in luggage that I forgot to add. No worries, I go back to <a href="https://www.flytap.com/">TAP</a> to fix the issue, but I'm greeted again with a website in German?!?</p><hr><p>This situation is common: you visit a website, you change the language to one you understand. Once you get what you need, you leave. The next time you come back, the website is once again in a language you do not understand instead of the one you picked on your last visit.</p><p>Some will say that this is nothing. In fact, it is nothing. A nothing that can be fixed in a couple of clicks. A nothing without any real impact. It is true but it is a nothing that happens every day, multiple times per day.</p><blockquote><p>Every time this happens it's something small, like a drop of water... but after a while, your cup will probably be full.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.flytap.com/">TAP</a> is a single example out of hundreds, probably thousands. Go ahead, try this at <a href="https://www.comparis.ch/">comparis</a> or even <a href="https://www.migros.ch/">migros</a>. Look for other Swiss websites but don't forget to close the page after picking the language and re-opening it to check what language you will be presented with. If you read until now, you already know the result.</p><h2>We as web developers</h2><p>As a web developer, this makes me mad. Why is the user presented with a default language he does not understand, if he already chose his preference before? If you have a good reason I'd really like to know. If not, can we do better? After all, Switzerland is mostly German but not only.</p></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[A guide to event handling in Elixir]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post">
  <p>Using events is a common way of integrating different parts of a modular system. But while the concept is easy to grasp, the implementation can be tricker.</p>

<p>Integrating subsystems is hard, and there are always trade-offs. Events are not different.</p>

<p>There are many possible ways of event handling. Choosing the wrong one for your needs can be a serious mistake.</p>

<p>This article shows you some of the choices available and trade-offs you have to consider with each of them. Some are related to Elixir itself, and some are technology-agnostic.</p>

<h2 id="1-synchronous-processing">1. Synchronous processing</h2>

<p>The simplest way to process events is to do this synchronously:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>Accounts</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>sign_up</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>,</span> <span>event_handlers</span> <span>\\</span> <span>[</span><span>Mailer</span><span>,</span> <span>Notifications</span><span>])</span> <span>do</span>
    <span># You can wrap the entire function in a transaction</span>
    <span># to ensure strong consistency.</span>
    <span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>save_user</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>)</span>

    <span>event</span> <span>=</span> <span>%</span><span>UserSignedUp</span><span>{</span>
      <span>user_id:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span>
      <span>name:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span>
      <span>email:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>email</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>for</span> <span>event_handler</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>event_handlers</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>event_handler</span><span>.</span><span>handle_event</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>)</span>
    <span>end</span>

    <span>{</span><span>:ok</span><span>,</span> <span>user</span><span>}</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Synchronous processing has multiple benefits and <strong>it should probably be the first step</strong> (especially for existing applications) unless you need the benefits of asynchronous processing.</p>

<p>If you’re running a modular monolith with a single database, you can even use a database transaction to guarantee strong consistency between the data and the event.</p>

<p><img src="https://mkaszubowski.com/assets/img/elixir-event-handling/synchronous.png" alt="synchronous processing"></p>

<p>That way, you can start decoupling your contexts logically (see: <a href="https://mkaszubowski.com/2019/06/28/events-and-different-kinds-of-coupling.html">Events and different kinds of coupling</a>) without dealing with the technical challenges of asynchronous code and eventual consistency.</p>

<p>The trade-off is that synchronous processing and/or a transaction means <strong><em>all or nothing</em> semantics</strong>. Either everything works correctly, or nothing is saved.</p>

<p><em>All or nothing</em> makes the code more predictable and easier to debug, but it’s not always desirable. When it’s an issue? When the customer places an order, you probably want that information saved even if there’s a temporary bug in the code handling that shipping.</p>

<p>When to consider synchronous event processing?</p>

<ul>
  <li>When you have little experience with events.</li>
  <li>If you don’t want to introduce additional technical complexity and infrastructure costs.</li>
  <li>In a monolith system, which you’d like to make more modular.</li>
  <li>As a replacement for other mechanisms in the test environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>When is synchronous processing <strong>not</strong> a good idea?</p>

<ul>
  <li>When you need to isolate failures.</li>
  <li>When quick response is crucial (and you know what you’re doing).</li>
  <li>For long-running, asynchronous, or third-party side effects. If side effects are out of your control, it might be a better idea to handle them in a proper asynchronous fashion.</li>
  <li>When side-effects can be delayed or batched in the background for better performance.</li>
  <li>When you’re communicating across different services (in other words - in a distributed system).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-process-based-pubsub">2. Process-based PubSub</h2>

<p>Since processes and message passing are basic building blocks in Elixir, we can use an in-memory PubSub mechanism (for example <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Registry.html#module-using-as-a-pubsub">Registry</a> or <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_pubsub/Phoenix.PubSub.html#direct_broadcast/5">Phoenix PubSub for a single node</a>) to broadcast events to subscribers.</p>

<p><img src="https://mkaszubowski.com/assets/img/elixir-event-handling/pubsub.png" alt="in-memory PubSub"></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>Subscriber</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>use</span> <span>GenServer</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>start_link</span><span>()</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>GenServer</span><span>.</span><span>start_link</span><span>(</span><span>__MODULE__</span><span>,</span> <span>name:</span> <span>__MODULE__</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>init</span><span>([])</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>PubSub</span><span>.</span><span>subscribe</span><span>(</span><span>"user_sign_ups"</span><span>,</span> <span>self</span><span>())</span>

    <span>{</span><span>:ok</span><span>,</span> <span>%{}}</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>handle_info</span><span>(%</span><span>UserSignedUp</span><span>{}</span> <span>=</span> <span>event</span><span>,</span> <span>state</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>:ok</span> <span>=</span> <span>Mailer</span><span>.</span><span>send_welcome_email</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>)</span>

    <span>{</span><span>:noreply</span><span>,</span> <span>state</span><span>}</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Such in-memory PubSub offers at-most-once delivery semantics</strong>. That means that the message will either be received once or won’t be delivered at all.</p>

<p>At-most-once delivery means that if we handle side effects or events using an in-memory PubSub mechanism, <strong>the side effects are not guaranteed to be executed:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>If a subscriber exits before the message is received, it won’t receive the message again.</li>
  <li>If a subscriber crashes when processing the side effect, it won’t try to process it again after restarting.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>This approach should only be used if losing some messages is OK</strong>. Some common examples are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In-app notifications.</li>
  <li>Transient application state (e.g. cache).</li>
  <li>Things that can be corrected by next messages or a periodic job.</li>
</ul>

<div><p>Be careful when sending in-memory messages from within a DB transaction: </p><p> 
1) The transaction can be rolled back after a message has been sent. <br>
2) It can lead to hard-to-debug errors when a subscriber receives the message and tries to read the data before a transaction has been committed.</p></div>

<h2 id="3-multi-node-process-based-pubsub">3. Multi-node, process-based PubSub</h2>

<p>Multi-node PubSub (like <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_pubsub/Phoenix.PubSub.html">Phoenix PubSub</a>) allows you to broadcast messages to subscribers on multiple nodes.</p>

<p><img src="https://mkaszubowski.com/assets/img/elixir-event-handling/multi-node.png" alt="multi-node in-memory PubSub"></p>

<p>Multi-node PubSub is usually useful for stateful processing when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You need to synchronize state across multiple nodes (e.g. distributed cache).</li>
  <li>You have clients with long-running connections (WebSocket, long-poll, …) - that’s why Phoenix Channels and LiveView use a multi-node Phoenix.PubSub).</li>
</ul>

<p>As with a single-node PubSub, message delivery is not guaranteed. Use this solution only if losing some messages is fine</p>

<p>With multi-node PubSub, you have to remember to make sure that the <a href="https://erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/distributed.html">nodes are connected to form a cluster</a>.</p>

<h2 id="4-same-database-for-events--smart-consumer-with-polling">4. Same database for events + smart consumer with polling</h2>

<p><img src="https://mkaszubowski.com/assets/img/elixir-event-handling/polling.png" alt="polling for events"></p>

<p>If you need every event to be processed in an async environment, you need some kind of persistent storage.</p>

<p>The first and simplest option is to use a single database for data and events. Then, you can have multiple subscribers fetching the data and processing the events asynchronously.</p>

<p>Benefits of this approach include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Low operational cost - you don’t need to add any additional infrastructure.</li>
  <li>The same database for data and events means it’s easier to maintain consistency since you can save events in a transaction. There’s no chance of “orphaned” events and no risk of not saving an event when something happens.</li>
</ul>

<p>Drawbacks of this approach:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Harder to scale for multiple services because of the coupling to the same DB.</li>
  <li>Harder to scale if the data exceeds a single DB.</li>
  <li>Each subscriber has to implement the logic to fetch the events, keep track of which events it’d already processed, and handle deduplication of events. This can be a lot of repetitive work for a larger system.</li>
  <li>Polling for events in a loop can have higher latency.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="alternative-use-listennotify">Alternative: Use Listen/Notify</h3>

<p>You can modify the following approach to limit the number of queries done by polling the DB for new events. <a href="https://blog.lelonek.me/listen-and-notify-postgresql-commands-in-elixir-187c49597851">If you use PostgreSQL, you can use Listen/Notify</a> to notify subscribers of new events. This way, you only have to ask the DB once (at startup) for the events missed by the subscriber:</p>

<p><img src="https://mkaszubowski.com/assets/img/elixir-event-handling/listen-notify.png" alt="listen-notify"></p>

<h2 id="5-events-in-separate-dbmessage-queue">5. Events in separate DB/message queue</h2>

<p>Once you use a lot of events, or you have multiple services, you will probably use a separate message queue for events. Examples include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>RabbitMQ</li>
  <li>Amazon SQS</li>
  <li>Google Cloud PubSub</li>
  <li>Kafka</li>
  <li>EventStore</li>
</ul>

<p>(While there are many differences between them, it’s way out of the scope of this article to describe them.)</p>

<p>The major drawback of this solution is that you can no longer rely on DB transactions to maintain consistency between your data and the events.</p>

<p>Consider the example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>Accounts</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>sign_up</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>save_user</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>)</span>

    <span>event</span> <span>=</span> <span>%</span><span>UserSignedUp</span><span>{</span>
      <span>user_id:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span>
      <span>name:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span>
      <span>email:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>email</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>:ok</span> <span>=</span> <span>save_event</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>)</span>

    <span>{</span><span>:ok</span><span>,</span> <span>user</span><span>}</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There’s no guarantee that the user and the event will be saved atomically.</p>

<p><img src="https://mkaszubowski.com/assets/img/elixir-event-handling/timeline.png" alt="timeline of function calls"></p>

<p>If anything goes wrong before those two function calls (or the second one fails), the event is gone forever.</p>

<p>One way of dealing with this is to <strong>treat events as a source of truth.</strong></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>Accounts</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>sign_up</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>event</span> <span>=</span> <span>%</span><span>UserSignedUp</span><span>{</span>
      <span>user_id:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span>
      <span>name:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span>
      <span>email:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>email</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>:ok</span> <span>=</span> <span>save_event</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>)</span>

    <span>{</span><span>:ok</span><span>,</span> <span>event</span><span>}</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://mkaszubowski.com/assets/img/elixir-event-handling/cqrs.png" alt="cqrs"></p>

<p>You might have heard about this pattern as <strong>Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS).</strong> The biggest challenge with this approach is that we’re now in the realm of <strong>eventual consistency.</strong> The user will eventually be saved in the database, but there’s some unknown delay. CQRS and eventual consistency make the code more complicated at the cost of lower operational coupling.</p>

<p>The important conclusion is that everything is a trade-off and there’s a price to pay for everything. You might lower the operational coupling by introducing a separate message queue, but the price for that is more complicated code and higher operations and infrastructure cost.</p>

<h2 id="6-the-outbox-pattern">6. The outbox pattern</h2>

<p>You can use the outbox pattern when you use events for integration and not as a source of truth, but you cannot lose any events.</p>

<p><img src="https://mkaszubowski.com/assets/img/elixir-event-handling/outbox.png" alt="outbox pattern"></p>

<p>The Outbox pattern relies on having an outbox table in the same database as the data. We use a DB transaction to atomically save the data (the user) and the event. A separate process reads the outbox table in the background, publishes the events to the external message queue, and deletes the events from the outbox.</p>

<p>Outbox pattern guarantees that <strong>each event will be published at least once</strong>, which means that we still have to make sure we can handle duplicated events (but this is a good practice anyway since most message queues have at-least-once delivery semantics).</p>

<h2 id="performance-warning">Performance warning</h2>

<p>It might be tempting to use asynchronous processing to make the system “faster” by doing some of the work after returning a response to the client. Unless you know what you’re doing, <strong>don’t do that.</strong></p>

<p>Doing work in the background doesn’t make it faster. It only hides the work from the client.</p>

<p>Synchronous calls serve as automatic <a href="https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/glossary#Back-Pressure">back pressure</a>. Since the clients wait for the response before making new requests, the server does only as much as it can handle. As the workload increases, so do the response times - which means that each client sends requests at a lower frequency.</p>

<p>Synchronous processing allows your system to slow down gracefully without collapsing. The system slows down, but it doesn’t crash.</p>

<p>If you do some work in the background, the clients can start sending the next requests much …</p></div></div>

        <p><a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent Of Code</a> is a yearly event offered by <a href="https://twitter.com/ericwastl">Eric Wastl</a>: every day before Christmas, you can unlock <strong>a<strong> daily code challenge</strong></strong> and crack it with the programming language of your choice.</p><p>It's super funny, with a pleasant Xmas/elve/reindeer... background and a soft difficulty curve (anyone with some programming experience can take the first challenges).</p><p>This year was my second participation. For the first time I was able to go through all the 25 challenges (it took me a bit more than 25 days) and the only language I used was Elixir.</p><p>I will now share with you my <strong><strong>Advent Of code takeaways</strong></strong>.</p><h2 id="1-you-re-not-an-impostor-"><strong>1 - You're not an impostor 🥸</strong></h2><p>Advent Of code is for anyone willing to improve their programming skills.</p><p>It doesn't matter if you are:</p><ul><li>a competitive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf">golf programmer</a> used to crack challenges in <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/leaderboard/day/25">less than 5 minutes</a> to rank among the first 🤯</li><li>a student or just some folk learning programming</li><li>a seasoned programmer willing to crank up his skills ( 👈 I'm here )</li><li>a seasoned programmer learning a new language (I might do next season's AOC in Rust)</li></ul><figure><img src="https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/2021/01/jim-carrey-2.gif" alt=""><figcaption>Cranking up my typing skills</figcaption></figure><p>What relieved me the most was how welcoming and helpful the AOC community is. A new <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/solution_megathreads">Reddit thread</a> is opened every day and people are encouraged to share their solutions or ask for help.</p><h2 id="2-cs101-again-"><strong>2 - CS101 ... again 👨‍🎓</strong></h2><p>If like me you graduated computer science quite a while ago, AOC might be the perfect occasion to refresh your academic knowledge.</p><p>Advent of Code will make you think about:</p><ul><li><strong>A<strong>lgorithmic complexity</strong></strong>, also known as <em><em>"</em>WTF<em> </em>why is <em>my code running for 30</em> <em>minutes and not yielding any result ?!?"</em></em></li><li><strong>D<strong>ata structures</strong>.</strong> Some challenges are tough without proper data modeling. So I suggest you know the ins and outs of basic data structures (chained lists, trees, and graphs) and related algorithms (depth-first vs breadth-first tree traversal)</li><li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_grammar">Formal Grammar</a></strong> will help you with some challenge</li><li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming">D<strong>ynamic programming</strong></a></strong> also saved me an evening of hacking.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/2021/01/infinite-loop.jpeg" alt="infinite loop" srcset="https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/infinite-loop.jpeg 600w, https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/infinite-loop.jpeg 1000w, https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/2021/01/infinite-loop.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Courtesy of <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryJGrady">Grady</a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="3-coding-kata-"><strong>3 - Coding Kata 🥋</strong></h2><p>We are no machines and we are not required to know anything by heart: so much knowledge is reachable online, within a few seconds.</p><p>Still, knowing a few will help.</p><p>AOC helped me to muscle my memory, and I'm now able to code most challenges in a single streak without reaching the documentation or copy-pasting from previous code. During this event, I reinforced my knowledge of some of the most important Elixir APIs (<code>Enum</code>, <code>Stream</code>, <code>String</code>, <code>Regex</code>).</p><figure><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/eiLJO8oDuWtU1xd5oc/giphy.gif" alt="Cobra Kai"><figcaption>Code Editor is your Dojo</figcaption></figure><p>By not abusing <em><em>alt-tab</em></em> and staying focused in your code editor you'll be able to reach what most athletes know as <strong><strong>flow state</strong></strong>: this mental state in which you feel the most enjoyed and productive.</p><p>Like athletes, everyday practice will give you reflex, confidence, and improve your judgment.</p><h2 id="4-and-a-few-elixir-lessons-"><strong>4 - And a few Elixir lessons 🧪</strong></h2><p>Reddit hosts the biggest AOC community, but you can also look after smaller AOC sub-communities. I learned much from ad-hoc threads created on <a href="https://elixirforum.com/tag/advent-of-code">Elixir Forum</a>.</p><p>Here are a few things I learned, mostly from reading at other's solutions:</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://elixirforum.com/tag/advent-of-code">Elixir comprehensions</a> are powerful</strong>. They let you iterate, combine, filter and reduce in few line of codes (I recommend you <a href="https://blog.lelonek.me/best-practices-of-comprehensions-in-elixir-310ae3167bd2">this article</a>)</li><li><strong><strong>Prepending is not appending</strong> - <strong>Elixir lists are not arrays</strong></strong>. Those assumptions sound trivial but helped me make a 60 seconds program run within a few milliseconds. Elixir is immutable and as such if you want to append a single item to a list, Elixir will create a whole new copy of the list (Elixir can't modify the last item to point at your new item - immutable we said ;-). On the opposite, prepending to a list will only create a new item that will point to the previous untouched list. That's why Elixir gives us a powerful prepend operator <code>prepended_list = [item | list]</code></li><li><strong>Elixir most common APIs hide a few jewels</strong> that I never used in 4 years of Elixir Programming. With AOC I discovered <code><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enum.html#chunk_every/4">Enum.chunk_every</a></code>, <code><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enum.html#chunk_while/4">Enum.chunk_while</a></code>, <code><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enum.html#zip/1">Enum.zip</a></code> or <code><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Stream.html#unfold/2">Stream.unfold</a></code></li><li>You have all <strong><strong>Erlang magic at hand</strong></strong>. I solved some of the challenges by using raw Erlang APIs such as <code><a href="https://erlang.org/doc/man/ets.html">ets</a></code>, <code><a href="https://erlang.org/doc/man/digraph.html">digraph</a></code>, or the fairly new <code><a href="https://erlang.org/doc/man/atomics.html">atomics</a></code> module.</li><li><strong>Immutability brings safety</strong>. Some challenges were tricky to code in some other languages because if you didn't take care of doing deep copies of your data structure you ran into an inconsistent state. In Elixir, there is no such thing as shared mutable state, so deep copy comes for free 😎</li><li><strong>Immutability is slower. </strong>The cost of safety is that any write operation in Elixir will be slower than in any other languages with mutable data structures. <code><a href="https://erlang.org/doc/man/ets.html">ets</a></code> or <code><a href="https://erlang.org/doc/man/atomics.html">atomics</a></code> Erlang APIs can sometimes be handy.</li></ul><h2 id="final-words"><strong><strong>Final words</strong></strong></h2><p>If you didn't know Advent Of Code before or just never tried, I hope this post will convince you to give a shot at it. AOC is not timebound and you can follow any event whenever you want at your own pace.</p><p>Oh, I forgot to mention that AOC is also a bit addictive and I may have started over from year 2015 🙊 😁 🎄</p>

<h2 id="bastille-default-templates">Bastille Default Templates</h2>
<p>Beginning with Bastille 0.8.20210101 the <code>Bastillefile</code> format is now standard
and the template system is fully native. This means that Bastille will use
default templates to apply base configuration of all new containers.</p>
<p>These default templates can also be customized or extended to meet your
specific needs.</p>
<p>In this post I will outline the Bastille template system and how it is used to
configure all new containers.</p>
<h3 id="template-overview">Template Overview</h3>
<p>Bastille templates are simple text files defining the automation needed to
configure a container. These templates can range from simple to complex. To see
a list of available templates visit <a href="https://gitlab.com/bastillebsd-templates/">BastilleBSD
Templates</a></p>
<h3 id="bastillefile">Bastillefile</h3>
<p>A <code>Bastillefile</code> is the “script” that is executed when a template is applied.
Each template will have a unique <code>Bastillefile</code>.</p>
<p>These files can also <code>INCLUDE</code> other Bastillefiles. This allows you to keep the
files relatively simple and organize logical components into separate
templates.</p>
<p>The <code>Bastillefile</code> template syntax follows a simple format of a Bastille
sub-command followed by its arguments. Inside a <code>Bastillefile</code> you do not need
to specify a TARGET. The target is defined when applying the template.</p>
<p>Given these simple requirements you can execute any Bastille sub-command in any
order by defining them <em>one per line</em> in the <code>Bastillefile</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Simple Bastillefile Example: nginx</strong></p>
<pre><code>PKG nginx
CP usr /
SYSRC nginx_enable=YES
SERVICE nginx start
RDR 443 443
</code></pre><p>This <code>Bastillefile</code> would perform the following tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install the <code>nginx</code> binary package inside the container.</li>
<li>Recursively copy <code>usr</code> from the template directory into container / path.</li>
<li>Enable the nginx service at container startup.</li>
<li>Start the nginx service in the running container.</li>
<li>Redirect port 443 traffic from host into container.</li>
</ol>
<p>Assuming the required nginx configuration files were included in the <code>usr</code>
directory (overlay), that container is now configured, enabled, running and
accepting traffic.</p>
<p>The “UPPERCASE lowercase” format is a simple visual representation of the
sub-command (UPPERCASE) and the arguments to that sub-command (lowercase).</p>
<p>Any Bastille sub-command that targets a container can be used within a
<code>Bastillefile</code>.</p>
<h3 id="default-templates">Default Templates</h3>
<p>As of version 0.8.20210101 Bastille ships with a handful of “default”
templates. These are used to apply any default configuration to newly created
containers. These “default” templates are:</p>
<ul>
<li>base</li>
<li>empty</li>
<li>thick</li>
<li>thin</li>
<li>vnet</li>
</ul>
<p>These default templates are defined in the <code>bastille.conf</code> like so:</p>
<p><strong>bastille.conf</strong></p>
<pre><code>+## Default Templates
+bastille_template_base="default/base"      ## default: "default/base"
+bastille_template_empty="default/empty"    ## default: "default/empty"
+bastille_template_thick="default/thick"    ## default: "default/thick"
+bastille_template_thin="default/thin"      ## default: "default/thin"
+bastille_template_vnet="default/vnet"      ## default: "default/vnet"
</code></pre><p><strong>If upgrading from a previous release be sure these lines have been merged
into your bastille.conf</strong></p>
<p>These templates are included in the installation at
<code>/usr/local/share/bastille/templates/default</code>.</p>
<p>The default <code>base</code> template is applied to all new containers. This base
template is applied by way of an <code>INCLUDE</code> statement within the other
templates.</p>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<p>Below is a copy of these five default templates for reference.</p>
<p><strong>default/base</strong></p>
<pre><code>ARG HOST_RESOLV_CONF=/etc/resolv.conf

CMD touch /etc/rc.conf
SYSRC syslogd_flags="-ss"
SYSRC sendmail_enable="NO"
SYSRC sendmail_submit_enable="NO"
SYSRC sendmail_outbound_enable="NO"
SYSRC sendmail_msp_queue_enable="NO"
SYSRC cron_flags="-J 60"

CP "${HOST_RESOLV_CONF}" /etc/resolv.conf
</code></pre><p><strong>default/thin</strong></p>
<pre><code>ARG BASE_TEMPLATE=default/base
ARG HOST_RESOLV_CONF=/etc/resolv.conf

INCLUDE ${BASE_TEMPLATE} --arg HOST_RESOLV_CONF="${HOST_RESOLV_CONF}"
</code></pre><p><strong>default/thick</strong></p>
<pre><code>ARG BASE_TEMPLATE=default/base
ARG HOST_RESOLV_CONF=/etc/resolv.conf

INCLUDE ${BASE_TEMPLATE} --arg HOST_RESOLV_CONF="${HOST_RESOLV_CONF}"
</code></pre><p><strong>default/vnet</strong></p>
<pre><code>ARG BASE_TEMPLATE=default/base
ARG HOST_RESOLV_CONF=/etc/resolv.conf

INCLUDE ${BASE_TEMPLATE} --arg HOST_RESOLV_CONF="${HOST_RESOLV_CONF}"

ARG EPAIR
ARG GATEWAY
ARG IFCONFIG="SYNCDHCP"

SYSRC ifconfig_${EPAIR}_name=vnet0
SYSRC ifconfig_vnet0="${IFCONFIG}"
# GATEWAY will be empty for a DHCP config. -- cwells
CMD if [ -n "${GATEWAY}" ]; then /usr/sbin/sysrc defaultrouter="${GATEWAY}"; fi
</code></pre><p><strong>default/empty</strong></p>
<pre><code></code></pre><p>As the name implies this is an empty container. No custom configuration
is defined.</p>
<h3 id="template-arg">Template ARG</h3>
<p>The keen observer will notice many of the default templates use the keyword
<code>ARG</code> to define variables. In this case:</p>
<pre><code>ARG BASE_TEMPLATE=default/base
ARG HOST_RESOLV_CONF=/etc/resolv.conf
</code></pre><p>These variables can be referenced later in the template:</p>
<pre><code>INCLUDE ${BASE_TEMPLATE} --arg HOST_RESOLV_CONF="${HOST_RESOLV_CONF}"
</code></pre><p>The above example variables would translate into:</p>
<pre><code>INCLUDE default/base --arg HOST_RESOLV_CONF=/etc/resolv.conf
</code></pre><p>Additionally you can define and later <code>RENDER</code> these custom variables inside
configuration files.</p>
<p>Tip: The variables <code>${JAIL_NAME}</code> and <code>${JAIL_IP}</code> are automatically included
and can be used within container configuration files.</p>
<p><strong>Example: RENDER file</strong></p>
<pre><code>PKG nginx
CP usr /
RENDER /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
</code></pre><p><strong>Example: RENDER directory (recursive)</strong></p>
<pre><code>PKG nginx
CP usr /
RENDER /usr/local/www
...
</code></pre><h3 id="customizing-default-templates">Customizing Default Templates</h3>
<p>As you can see from the included default template examples, most configuration
is done in the <code>default/base</code> template and the other templates <code>INCLUDE</code> that
and (optionally) extend with additional changes.</p>
<p>The best way to customize the default templates is to extend them in your own
custom template. These custom templates can then be configured as the defaults
for your environment by updating the <code>bastille.conf</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Note: In order to avoid having your changes clobbered with a Bastille package
update it is not recommended to edit the default template(s) themselves.</strong></p>
<p>Create a new template namespace at <code>/usr/local/bastille/templates/</code>. This
new template namespace is often a username or team/project name. Within this
namespace you can create new templates and extend the defaults.</p>
<p><strong>Example for admin: cedwards</strong></p>
<pre><code>mkdir /usr/local/bastille/templates/cedwards/base 
</code></pre><p>From here we can extend the <code>default/base</code> template with our own template.</p>
<p>Included below is an example <code>Bastillefile</code> that enables outbound sendmail.</p>
<p><strong>cedwards/base/Bastillefile</strong></p>
<pre><code>ARG HOST_RESOLV_CONF=/etc/resolv.conf
INCLUDE default/base --arg HOST_RESOLV_CONF="${HOST_RESOLV_CONF}"

SYSRC sendmail_outbound_enable="YES"
SYSRC sendmail_msp_queue_enable="YES"
</code></pre><p>Update the <code>bastille.conf</code> to use <code>cedwards/base</code> as the new default:</p>
<pre><code>bastille_template_base="cedwards/base"      ## default: "default/base"
</code></pre><p>With this configuration every new container would have <code>default/base</code> applied
(due to the <code>INCLUDE</code> from <code>cedwards/base</code>) followed by the additional
configuration in the <code>cedwards/base</code> template.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Bastille templates are a simple and effective way to automate container
creation and management. Who knew automated configuration management could be
so simple?</p>
<p>Customizing a default template <code>Bastillefile</code> will allow you to change the way
every new system is configured. These defaults can be set for each main
container type and can be extended using any Bastille sub-command.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>I wrote a post at the start of last year thinking about <a href="http://www.erisian.com.au/wordpress/2020/01/07/bitcoiner-maximalism">my general priorities for Bitcoin</a> and I’m still pretty happy with that approach — certainly <em><strong>“store of value” as a foundation</strong></em> feels like it’s held up!</p>



<p>I think over the past year we’ve seen a lot of people starting to hold a Bitcoin balance, and that we’ll continue to do so — which is a win, but following last year’s logic also means we’ll want to start paying more attention to the later parts of the funnel as well: if we (for instance) double the number of people holding Bitcoin, we also want to double the number of people doing self-custody, and double the number of people transacting over lightning, eg; and ideally we’d want that in addition to whatever growth in self-custody and layer 2 transactions we’d already been aiming for if Bitcoin adoption had remained flat.</p>



<p>That said, I’m not sure I’m in a growth mindset for Bitcoin this year, rather than a consolidation one: consider the BTC price at the start of the past few years: 2016: ~$450, 2017: $1000, 2018: $13,000, 2019: $3700, 2020: $8000, 2021: $30,000. Has there been a 8x increase in security and robustness during 2016, 2017 and 2018 to match the 8x price increase from Jan 2016 to Jan 2019? Yeah, that’s probably fair. Has there been another 8x increase in security and robustness during 2019 and 2020 to match the 8x price increase there? Maybe. What if you’re thinking of a price target of <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-hitting-200k-by-december-2021-is-now-conservative-willy-woo">$200,000</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/100trillionusd/status/1343140448160915457">$300,000</a> sometime soon — doesn’t that require yet another 8x increase in security and robustness? Where’s that going to come from? And those 8x factors are multiplicative: if you want something like $250k by December 2021, that’s not a “three-eights-are-24” times increase in robustness over six years (2016 to 2022), it’s an “<strong>eight-cubed-is-512</strong>” times increase in robustness! And your mileage may vary, but I don’t really think Bitcoin’s already 500x more robust than it was five years ago.</p>



<p>So as excited as I am about taproot and the possibilities that opens up (PTLCs and eventually eltoo on lightning, scriptless scripts and discreet log contracts, privacy preserving proof of reserves, cheap multisig — the list might not be infinite but at least seems computationally intractable), I think I’m now even more of the view that <em><strong>it’s probably more important to work on things that reinforce the existing foundations, than neat new ideas to change them</strong></em> than I was this time last year.</p>



<p>There are already a bunch of areas where Bitcoin’s approach to security and robustness has improved technically over the past few years: we’ve got more people doing reviews (eg, via the PR review club, or getting introduced to Bitcoin via the Chaincode Residency etc), we’ve got deeper and more diverse continuous integration testing (thanks both to more integrations being enabled via github, and travis becoming unreliable enough to force looking at other approaches), fuzz testing has improved a lot and become a bit more broadly used, and I think static analysis of the codebase has improved a bit. There have been a bunch of improvements in code standards (eg using safe pointers, locking annotations, spans instead of raw pointers) too, I think it’s fair to say. I haven’t done an analysis here, just going from gut feel and recollection.</p>



<p>With a focus on robustness, to me, the areas to prioritise in the short term are probably:</p>



<ol><li>Modularisation — eg, so that we can better leverage process separation to reduce security impacts, and better use fuzz testing to catch bugs in edge cases. There’s already work to split the gui and wallet into separate processes, though while that’s merged, it’s not part of the standard build yet. Having the p2p-network-facing layer also be a separate process might be another good win. While it’s a tempting goal, I think libconsensus is still a ways off — p2p, mempool management, and validation rules are currently pretty tightly coupled — but there’s steps we can make towards that goal that will be improvements on their own, I think.</li><li>The P2P network — This is the obvious way to attack Bitcoin since by its nature everyone has access to it. There are multiple levels to this: passively monitoring the p2p network may allow you to violate users’ privacy expectations, while actively isolating users onto independent networks can break Bitcoin’s fundamental assumptions (you can’t extend the longest chain if you can’t communicate with any of the people who have the longest chain). There are also plenty of potential problems that someone could cause in between those extremes that could, eg, break assumptions that L2 systems like lightning make. Third-party (potentially centralised) alternatives as backups for the p2p network may also be valuable support here — things like Blockstream Satellite, or block relay over ham radio, or headers over DNS: those can mend splits in the p2p network that the p2p layer itself can’t automatically fix. Or efficiency improvements like erlay or block-relay-only can allow a higher degree of connectivity making attacks harder.</li><li>CI, static analysis, reproducible builds — Over the past year, travis seems like it’s gone from having the occasional annoying problem to being <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2020/travis-cis-new-pricing-plan-threw-wrench-my-open-source-works">pretty much unusable</a> for open source projects. CI is an important part of both development and review; having it break makes both quite a lot harder. What we’ve got at this point seems pretty good, but it’s new and not really time-tested yet, so I’d guess a year of smoothing out the rough edges is probably needed. I think there’s other “CI”-ish stuff that could be improved, like more automated IBD testing (eg, I think <a href="https://bitcoinperf.com/d/YiV16Vsik/overview?orgId=1&amp;from=now-6M&amp;to=now">bitcoinperf</a> is about 3 months out of date). Static analysis serves a similar goal to tests in a different way; and while we’ve already got a lot of low hanging fruit of this nature already integrated into CI via linters and compiler options, I suspect there’s still some useful automation that could happen here. Finally, nailing down the last mile to ensure that people are running the software the devs are testing is always valuable, and I think the nixos work is showing some promise there.</li><li>Third-party validation — We’ve had a few third-party monitoring tools arise lately — various sites monitoring feerate and mempool sizes, forkmonitor checking for stale blocks (and double-spends), or, at a stretch, optech’s reviews of wallet behaviour and segwit support. There’s probably a lot of room for more of this.</li></ol>



<p>I’d love to list formal verification at the consensus layer as a priority, but I think there’s too much yak-shaving needed first: it would probably need all the refactoring to get to libconsensus first, then would likely need that separated into its own process, which you could only then start defining a formal spec for, which in turn would give you something you could start doing formal verification against. I suspect we’ll want to be at that point within another cycle or two though.</p>



<p>I’m not concerned about mining — eventually there might be a risk that the subsidy is too small and there’s not enough fee income, but that’s not going to happen while the price doubles faster than the pre-scheduled halvings. There’s certainly centralisation risks, whether in ASIC manufacture, in hardware ownership/control, or at the pool level, but my sense of things is that’s not getting worse, and is not the biggest immediate risk. Maybe I’m wrong; if so, hopefully the people who think so are working on preventing problems from arising, rather than taking advantage of them.</p>



<p>There are other levels of robustness and security beyond just “keep the network working”, if you consider the question of “how to prevent my coins from being lost/stolen?” more broadly. The phishing attacks and potential for physical attacks resulting from the Ledger leak are an easy example of a problem of this sort, but exchange hacks/failures in general, malware swapping addresses so your funds go to an attacker instead of the intended recipient, and lost access to keys are also pretty bad. I think descriptors, miniscript and taproot multisig probably provide for a good path forward to help prevent losing access to keys; and it’s possible that progress on BIP322 (signing messages against a Bitcoin address) may provide a path to avoiding address swapping attacks.</p>



<p>Technical solutions are, in some sense, all you can hope for if you’re doing self-custody; but where a bank/custodian is involved (good) regulation might be useful too: requirements to keep customer data protected or destroyed, third-party audits to ensure the best-practices procedures you’re claiming to follow are actually being followed, etc. If custodians store funds in taproot addresses, it may be feasible to do privacy preserving (zero-knowledge) <a href="https://twitter.com/n1ckler/status/1334240709814136833">proofs of solvency</a>, eg, making it harder for fly-by-night folks to run ponzi schemes or otherwise steal their customers’ funds.</p>



<p>Obviously where possible these sorts of standards should be implemented via audited open source code rather than needing extensive implementation costs by each company. But one other thing to think about is whether regulations of this nature could be setup as industry standards (“we comply with the industry standard, competitor X doesn’t”) rather than necessarily a government regulator — for one, it certainly seems questionable whether government regulators have the background to pick good best practices for cryptocurrency systems to follow. Though perhaps it would be to have something oriented towards “consumer rights” than “industry” per se, to avoid it just being a vector for regulatory capture.</p>



<p>I think there’s been good progress on stabilising Bitcoin development — in 2015 through 2017 we were in a phase where people were seriously thinking of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/according-viabtc-team-bitcoin-core-developers-fired/">replacing</a> <a href="https://blog.plan99.net/the-resolution-of-the-bitcoin-experiment-dabb30201f7">Bitcoin’s</a> <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-2017-bitpay-ceo-bitcoin-fork">developers</a> — devs were opposing a quick blocksize increase, so the obvious solution was to replace them with people who weren’t opposed. If you think of Bitcoin as an experimental, payments-oriented, tech startup, that’s perhaps not …</p></div></div>

	<p><strong>FEROZ KHAN HAS</strong> spent his whole life in Dubai, and hadn’t ever considered leaving until last year. The IT professional, 37, worked for Emirates airline in aviation technology until August, when he was made redundant. He was there for 14 years.</p>
<p>Khan applied for dozens of technology and startup jobs in the weeks since, both in the UAE and around the world. He gave himself until the end of the year to find something else, or else he’s heading for Canada to do a master’s degree. He probably won’t come back.</p>
<p>“I’m fairly well networked here in the industry, but anyone I’ve asked has said they’ll have to wait until [2021] to hire,” he says. “The toughest part for me is that I was born here. This is home—I have never known anywhere else. Thirty seven years in this city and I’m now wondering if I made a huge mistake by getting too deeply attached here.”</p>
<p>Over the months, Khan has watched as friends in the industry, mostly programmers and IT professionals, have been made redundant or have moved home because their spouses have lost their jobs, or found the IT salaries aren’t what they used to be.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen people who’ve been here 40 years who say they can’t afford to live here anymore. I think they need to have a good look and see how the expat model is going to work. There are so many people leaving.”</p>
<p>As Covid-19 wreaks havoc on the job market in the Gulf, expats are returning home in unprecedented numbers. A report from Oxford Economics suggests the UAE alone could lose 10 percent of its population due to the impact of the pandemic, but some believe it could be more.</p>
<p>And while this expat exodus is happening across industries—there are multiple reports of blue-collar workers, many from South Asia, leaving—what for the tech industry, a sector that the UAE, and many of its neighbors, have staked their futures on?</p>
<p>As the industry hemorrhages foreign talent due to industry-wide layoffs, can it still experience the record-breaking growth that was expected?</p>
<p>Experts say it’s possible—but companies will have to think hard about how they lure people back as things calm down, or figure out how to leverage foreign expertise in a world more accepting of virtual workplaces.</p>
<p>In 2019, the Middle East and North Africa experienced a boom in tech activity. A record 564 startup investments were made in the region, accounting for $704 million in funding, according data platform Magnitt. Philip Bahoshy, the company’s chief executive, believes if it had not been for Covid-19, that number would have hit $1 billion in 2020. And it was certainly on track to do so: the average deal size in the first half of this year was $4.1 million, more than double the $1.9 million seen in 2019. Funding to June 2020 already accounted for 95 percent of that for the whole of 2019; Bahoshy believes, however, that this has now slowed significantly as investors, cautious of market volatility, put their money into more established, but far fewer, startups.</p>
<p>The UAE has spent years positioning itself as a regional haven for tech companies and startups, with the Abu Dhabi and Dubai governments pouring millions into incubators and accelerators to help tech entrepreneurs and savvy businesspeople bring their ideas to fruition. The country’s 50-year plan heavily relies on its development as a knowledge- and technology-based economy focused on developing entrepreneurial ventures. But that hasn’t saved even the biggest startup stars in the country from the pandemic, which has hit both revenues and workforces.</p>
<p>Ride-hailing firm Careem in May cut almost a third of its workforce, accounting for 536 jobs. Meanwhile Fetchr—once one of the rising stars of the Middle East’s burgeoning startup scene, valued at almost $300 million in a 2017 fundraising round—shed 1,230 jobs across its operations, although its troubles pre-date the pandemic, having found itself on the brink of collapse in late 2019. It has since raised new funding however, and made a push into Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>But the list goes on. In late August, Dubai-based retail platform Awok closed only a year after raising $30 million in one of the largest investment rounds for an e-commerce startup in the region. According to its LinkedIn page, Awok employed 700 people.</p>
<p>With such a saturated market of technology professionals now out of work and many heading home, some worry for the future of the industry in the Gulf. However, Bahoshy says tech talent has “always been a challenge for startups in the region,” and redundancies are actually having some positive effects, with cases of out-of-work staff becoming entrepreneurs in their own right. “Having said that, the region continues to require experienced tech talent and now would be an opportune time to look beyond the region to attract individuals,” he adds.</p>
<p>Bahoshy is expecting further layoffs in the tech industry as mergers are explored by companies seeking to strengthen their position in the market.</p>
<p>Ray Dargham, chief executive of Step Group, which hosts tech shows, was more optimistic. Step Conference 2020 was held in February, and was its largest conference to date, with 300 startups participating. The Gulf tech scene has come a long way since Step began in 2012, Dargham says, producing several $100 million startups and one unicorn exit (Careem, which was acquired by Uber for $3.1 billion).</p>
<p>“The second cycle of the startup ecosystem, whereby the founders and staff who benefited from these exits will go on to launch new startups or funds, has just started,” he says.</p>
<p>However, the industry continues to be hindered by regulation as well as high setup costs, Dargham says. There was also beginning to be some market saturation, especially in e-commerce, food-tech, and logistics, which is where many of the redundancies are now coming from.</p>
<p>However, Dargham, who is originally from Lebanon, is optimistic that a possible influx of his countrymen into Dubai—as they flee their homeland’s economic crisis, which was exacerbated by the devastating explosion in Beirut in August—could bring about a new wave of tech entrepreneurs. After all, the Lebanese built much of the region’s advertising industry as they fled the country’s civil war between 1975 and 1990, and settled in nearby countries, such as Kuwait, Greece, and Cyprus. Later, many of the agencies’ head offices moved to Dubai, resulting in a thriving local advertising industry. So could we see something similar happen now?</p>
<p>Dargham believes so, but it’s a bittersweet moment for him. “Witnessing the vast numbers of Lebanese friends fleeing to Dubai is both heartbreaking and relieving for me,” Dargham says. “It’s heartbreaking because of all that’s happening in my country. It’s relieving because I know that they are coming to a great home, which has always been safe and prosperous for many Lebanese and Arabs running away from our countries’ miseries. If it weren’t for Dubai, I don’t know where we would go.”</p>
<p>Bahoshy agrees that Dubai could become a safe haven for Lebanese tech experts. “Talent in Lebanon has always been a strength for its ecosystem and economy, and yet as an economy or market for startups, has always been limited for growth. These startups can export their businesses to markets with larger consumer access while further developing their propositions,” he says.</p>
<p>Carrington Malin, a UAE-based entrepreneur and consultant, believes there has never been a more exciting time for the tech industry, due to the Covid-induced demand from the private and public sectors. But as lower oil revenues and the pandemic force companies to become leaner than ever, job roles are being adjusted—and this isn’t necessarily a bad thing. “Overall, this could be a blessing in disguise. Most businesses don’t look at new ways of doing things quite often enough,” he says.</p>
<p>The pandemic has meant that Gulf countries are now more resolute that new technologies will play a central role in their economic and social development, Malin says, and are “putting the initiatives in place to turn these into reality.” This means that future careers in technology and IT could be more attractive than ever for citizens and expats alike.</p>
<p>But, especially in the UAE, with 80 percent of its workforce coming from outside the country, has enough been done to bring Emiratis into the startup fold? Last year, a report on pre-seed startups by entrepreneurship platform Wamda found that Emiratis make up just 3 percent of the entrepreneurs in the UAE, despite the country’s best efforts to foster local talent.</p>
<p>Malin believes this is because the growth of Gulf economies has outstripped the local talent base, and “government departments have tended to monopolize the employment of top local IT talent.” This means Emiratis in tech have traditionally moved into roles in management. But that could be set to change.</p>
<p>“It’s not the best way to foster innovation, entrepreneurship, local research and development, nor leadership in the tech sector,” he says. “Attitudes are changing though and we’re now seeing a wide range of initiatives put in place by governments that will incentivize youth to look toward technology as a career. We’re going to see the Gulf’s pool of homegrown tech talent grow much faster now.”</p>
<p>Massimo Cannizzo, Middle East chief executive of startup support platform Gellify, which is headquartered in Italy but has a hub in Dubai, believes 2020 could herald a new age of globalization in Gulf tech. Companies could be more willing to leverage expertise remotely, he says. “It was previously necessary to have people here in the office and be part of an organization and move their family here. But remote working has changed that.”</p>
<p>However, for companies to be particularly innovative, there needs to be person-to-person …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Approaching this behemoth of an industry called web development can be overwhelming at times, everybody had that feeling of missing out on web development, especially the chaos that's happening in the <em>front-end world</em>...</p>
<p>...But just like any other problem, you break it down into smaller pieces. Think of the areas in web development you're lacking knowledge, then look for resources to fill that gap.</p>
<p>You also need to <em>practice learning</em> to be more proficient in it. Have a really good understanding of the basic programming principles first, that drive web development.</p>
<p>Focus on the fundamentals if you think you're lacking knowledge in that area, then build on top of that the new techniques and strategies that interest you.</p>
<p>There's too much noise on the Internet as it is, especially in tech, you need to focus on <em>extracting the signal</em> from the noise. By focusing on the programming principles you're building on top of a solid foundation because programming principles rarely change, it gets re-invented. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">OOP</a> is not new, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional programming</a> isn't either, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle">SRP</a> were all invented in the 70s and 80s.</p>
<p>With experience, you'll realize that a solid foundation is key, and the major difference between most web development programming languages is just the syntax only.</p>
<p>You’ll need to have a very narrow set of problems that only a specific programming language can solve, in other cases it truly is just a matter of preference, community adoption and the available resources you have on hand.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about good programming principles, check out my blog post on the <a target="_blank" href="https://primalskill.blog/10-books-every-programmer-should-read">10 books every programmer should read</a> where I cover books presenting these programming principles.</p>
<p>The bottom line is you need to love web development, love programming, then learning will be easy, but if you're a <em>9 to 5</em> programmer, not really interested in software, then you're going to have a hard time leveling up to be a better programmer.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t have a life outside work, on the contrary, work-life balance is really important.</p>
<p><strong>You need to invest time and energy every week to learn something new.</strong></p>
<h2 id="old-is-new-again">Old is New Again</h2>
<p>There's no such thing as the wrong approach in web development, it's more like the wrong solution to that set of problems you're trying to solve, and showing off your new programming techniques is usually the wrong solution for the problem. 😃</p>
<p>It's perfectly okay <strong>NOT</strong> to use the latest and greatest packages, modules, or techniques in your codebase, changing it out every day because something newer and shinier was released is almost always the wrong approach.</p>
<p>It's a much better strategy to use tried and battle-tested code instead, especially because of the dynamic nature of software development.</p>
<p>It's also a fallacy that not using the newest programming language or the latest framework you'll be doing a disservice to your project. You can solve 99% of the problems with any programming language. </p>
<h2 id="cut-out-90-of-the-news">Cut out 90% of the news</h2>
<p>Get off social media, stop procrastinating, and cut out any distractions while you're working. Practice async, passive information gathering, meaning, not to jump on a new video, blog, or podcast instantly, instead save it for later and keep a schedule for learning new things.</p>
<p>You can organize your streams and feed with a note-taking app, and keep a <em>log</em> of what you've learned on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>You can use apps like <a target="_blank" href="https://feedly.com/">Feedly</a>, created for this purpose, to filter the information overload you're being bombarded with daily. They even use an AI assistant that will learn from your habits and will filter out news for you.</p>
<h2 id="start-your-own-blog">Start your own blog</h2>
<p>If you want to really get neck-deep in a subject you want to learn, I think, the best way to do it is to write about it. You'll be <em>forced</em> to research the topic in-depth filling the gaps in your knowledge in the process.</p>
<p>Starting a blog is not complicated anymore, with services like <a target="_blank" href="https://hashnode.com/">Hashnode</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://dev.to/">DEV</a> it's 5 minutes to create your own blog and start writing.</p>
<p>The benefit of creating a blog on such services is that you will also get a huge audience from the get-go.</p>
<h2 id="other-tips">Other Tips</h2>
<p><strong>Read source code: </strong> most beginner developers I've met just don't read other developers source code at all. Why? Reading source code should be thought in schools 😁, it's one of the most fundamental things you should do if you're in software development.</p>
<p>Ask yourself this: Do you know what's inside <code>node_modules</code>? Do you know what code a module or package contains? </p>
<p>You can learn awesome techniques, simply by, reading other developer's code, and more importantly, you can <strong>vet</strong> that code for security exploits, maybe even fix it and create PRs, it's a win-win.</p>
<p><strong>Share and discuss:</strong> news, tutorials, and techniques with your friends in tech or your co-workers. It's very important to get feedback on your ideas, programming techniques, and the like.</p>
<p><strong>Get active on forums:</strong> it may be counterintuitive, and I personally, don't like to follow a bunch of people on social media, because it usually adds noise to my daily work, but by following a narrow set of topics on Reddit or Twitter can be okay.</p>
<p><strong>Get familiar with Github:</strong> look at what's <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/trending">trending on the website</a>, watch releases for repositories you're interested in, or popular repos, just to stay up to date on what direction the industry is pulling right now.</p>
<p>You can also follow <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/topics">topics</a> which gives you an overview of repository and user activities related to that topic, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/topics/data-structures">data structures</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/topics/docker">Docker</a>.</p>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<p>It's important to <em>learn how to learn</em> new things, but also to find the <em>signal in the noise</em>. Here are a couple of resources, that you could use to stay up-to-date with the new info.</p>
<h3 id="blogs">Blogs</h3>
<p>Find information hubs on the topics you're interested in. Blogs are a great resource for that, subscribe to influential authors' feed, remember RSS? Google tried to kill it, but it's coming back! 😊</p>
<p>Follow tech information <em>hubs</em>, but be vary, the content on these websites can be overwhelming and of lower quality unless it’s a curated feed.</p>
<ol>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://hashnode.com/">Hashnode</a> - is a good place to find articles organized by topics (e.g. tags), just follow a couple of tags that you're interested in.</li>

<h3 id="educational-websites">Educational Websites</h3>
<p>Educational websites are also a great way to level up on web development. You can look at the trending or <em>what's hot</em> sections on these websites to get the best courses on the topics you're interested in.</p>
<p>Even though these services are not free, it's worth the investment, because you'll get a reviewed, well-thought-out video course covering the topic from A to Z.</p>

                    This is an example customer lifecycle definition with

                    The actual process can be of any complexity, contain nested sub-processes, invoke 
                    other processes by starting or signaling them, call external services or publish

                    BPMN diagram button downloads a definition XML file; SVG image button generates a vector image.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>James Clear is the author of Atomic Habits, who popularized the idea of habits over goals. Last month he shared <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1344776679315689480">the rules he uses for running his business</a>, based on his 10-year experience. Among the rules was this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Build assets that compound. Eliminate problems, responsibilities, and obligations that compound. Your business should feel easier to sustain each year.</p>
<p>James Clear (from <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1344776679315689480">How I run my business</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Your business should feel easier to sustain each year." What if, instead of business, we focus on building software? And what if we turn the advice into a question? Then, we get: <em>does our codebase feel easier to sustain each year?</em></p>
<p>I love that question:</p>
<ul>
<li>It reveals the long-term vision of how to approach software engineering.</li>
<li>It encourages challenging missions to <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/">remove complexity</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/oTugjssqOT0?t=1256">target the important non-urgent quadrant</a>.</li>
<li>It exposes the murky alternative, that is, descending further into the complexity tar pit.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, I've found that the question brings fresh air and whirls settled dust.</p>

<b>Ask Marilyn ®</b> by Marilyn vos Savant is a column in <i>Parade Magazine</i>,
published by PARADE, 711 Third Avenue, New York, NY 10017, USA.
According to Parade, Marilyn vos Savant is listed in the
"Guinness Book of World Records Hall of Fame" for "Highest IQ."
</p><div><a name="FAQ">
</a><li><a name="FAQ">What is Marilyn's email address?
</a><p><a name="FAQ">PARADE announced on June 8, 1997 that email to Marilyn can be sent to
</a><a href="mailto:marilyn@parade.com">marilyn@parade.com</a>
</p></li><li>Precisely where (edition and category) is Marilyn listed in <i>Guinness Book of World Records</i>?
<p>
<a href="mailto:Citeon@prodigy.net">Citeon &lt;Citeon@prodigy.net&gt;</a>
reports that:
</p><blockquote>
She is listed on page 26 of the 1989 Edition.
It says "...as a ten year old achieved a ceiling score for 23-year-olds,
thus giving her an IQ of 228."
Her record was retired to the guinness hall of fame because scores that
high are no longer possible due to a lowering of test score ceilings.
(As I'm sure you're already guessing it's because scores that high
weren't very valid in the first place.)
</blockquote>
<p>
<a href="mailto:DOlmstead@aol.com">Linda &lt;DOlmstead@aol.com&gt;</a>
disagrees with Citeon about the validity of high test scores:
</p><blockquote>
IQs that high are legitimate.  None of the standard IQ tests in use today for children
(Stanford-Binet Fourth Edition and WISC-III) were designed to identify the
highly gifted.  It is standard practice to use the older Stanford-Binet Form
L-M when a child is at or near the ceiling score on the other newer test.
<p>
Please check out Linda Silverman's
<a href="http://www.gifteddevelopment.com/">Gifted Development Center</a> web site

programs, presentations, and resources for gifted children and adults.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Here are some <a href="http://www.wiskit.com/marilyn/iq.html">additional comments about Marilyn's IQ</a> <small> (10/03/98) </small>
</p><p>
According to <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/course/topics/Monty_Hall.html">
Behind Monty Hall's Doors</a>, Marilyn's IQ is 228.

</p></li><li>What books has Marilyn written?
<ul>
<li><i>Ask Marilyn</i>, St. Martin's Press, 1992, ISBN 0-312-08136-7.
</li><li><i>The World's Most Famous Math Problem:
       The Proof of Fermat's Last Theorem and Other Mathematical Mysteries</i>,
       St. Martin's Press, 1993, 0-312-10657-2.

</li></ul>

</li><li>Is Marilyn married? Who is her husband?
<p>
<a href="mailto:rory@carmelnet.com">Rory Sellers &lt;rory@carmelnet.com&gt;</a>
reports that Marilyn is married to the "Jarvik guy who invented the artificial heart".

</p></li><li>How do you feel about Marilyn?
<p>
Marilyn is more intelligent than I am, as measured by standard intelligence tests.
There are some areas in which I am more knowledgeable (trained or educated) than
Marilyn, just as there are some areas that Marilyn is more knowledgeable than I.
</p><p>
I do not hate Marilyn, and I am not jealous of her. I respected her more in the
past than I do now. I do not think I am better than Marilyn, and Marilyn certainly
has answered questions that would have stumped me. Furthermore, I am sure that
Marilyn is far more profitable for <i>Parade Magazine</i> than I could ever be.
</p><p>
I am concerned that some people believe that everything Marilyn says is correct
(except in the few cases that Marilyn has admitted error), just because she is
smarter than we are.
</p><p>
<b>This is not true!</b> Marilyn <b>does</b> make mistakes, and here they are.
</p><p>
I do wonder, though, why Marilyn considers this web site "a little creepy" (see below).
Is she afraid to confront her mistakes?

</p></li><li>Does Marilyn know about this web site?
<p>Eric Zorn, of the Chicago Tribune, reports that
<a><img src="http://www.wiskit.com/marilyn/broken.gif" alt="[BROKEN]"></a> <u>http://www.chicago.tribune.com/columns/zorn/archives/80597z.htm</u>
Marilyn is aware of this web site, but has never visited.
</p><p>Rich Morin, of the Washington Post, reports that
<a><img src="http://www.wiskit.com/marilyn/broken.gif" alt="[BROKEN]"></a> <u>http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPlate/1998-06/14/133l-061498-idx.html</u>
Marilyn considers this web site "a little creepy".
</p><p>The attorneys for Parade Magazine are also aware of this web site (see below).

</p></li><li>Why was your site shut down between June 9 and June 30, 1998?
    And why do you no longer include the original question and Marilyn's answer?
<p>The attorneys for Parade Magazine claimed that the amount of copyrighted material that I used
   exceeded what is permissible under the fair use provision of the copyright laws.
   Rather than contest their claim, I shut down the site until I could remove the offending material.
   I have tried to avoid biasing the material in my paraphrasing.

</p></li><li>How can I judge for myself whether Marilyn is Wrong if you no longer include
    the original question and answer published in Parade Magazine?
    Is there any way for me to obtain the original columns?
<p><a href="http://www.parade.com/reprint/index.html">Back issues</a> are now available directly from
    <a href="http://www.parade.com/reprint/index.html">Parade Magazine</a>
    for $3.00 per issue.
    Thanks to <a href="mailto:bs25@cornell.edu">Ben Sandler &lt;bs25@cornell.edu&gt;</a>
    for pointing me to <a href="http://www.parade.com/">Parade Magazine</a>'s web site.  <small> (06/14/00) </small>

</p></li><li>Does Marilyn have a research staff or depend upon outside assistance to answer the
    questions that appear in her columns?
<p><a href="mailto:bratach@gate.sunquest.com">Pete Bratach &lt;bratach@gate.sunquest.com&gt;</a> provides some information about <a href="http://www.wiskit.com/marilyn/research.html">Marilyn's Research Staff</a>  <small> (11/01/99) </small>

    If the government implements the COVID cess, it will be the latest in line of measures to boost revenue at a time when it has implemented several policies that either reduce government collections or increase its spendings.

<p>States have been facing pressure in revenues because of economic slowdown and corporate tax cuts, which means that the government is stretched to meet its spending needs. Goods and services tax (GST) collections have also struggled for a good part of 2020, in large part due to the pandemic and lockdown. Further, India’s growth rate is

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-1773">
    
	<div>
		<div>
			<p>I have been toying with the idea of migrating this blog to a static site to simplify its maintenance for some time. While <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress </a>is a great tool, this blog is a side project and any time I have to spend maintaining WordPress gets deducted from the time I have to write for the blog. Keep in mind that I’m self-hosting this blog and it’s actually running on a Linux VM that only handles the blog. That is yet another server that I need to administer, and it’s the odd one out, too, as all of the others are FreeBSD or OpenBSD servers.</p>
<p>Oh, and one of the big advantages of using a static site generator is that the whole site can be put in version control, archived there and also quickly re-generated from there should I manage to spectacularly mess up the host. A WordPress restore is a fair amount more work, as I found out about two years ago.</p>
<p>The only parts that don’t back up that well are the comments, especially if I use a self-hosted system for them.</p>
<h2>Migration is fine, but what to?</h2>
<p>For that reason, I had experimented with moving the blog to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> for quite a while. In fact, I have maintained a parallel Jekyll blog for years now. For a smooth switch over, the devil was in the details though, and I was never happy enough to actually migrate and shutdown the WordPress site.</p>
<p>After another patchapalooza, I revisited the idea of converting the blog to a static site and looked at several other static site generators. I also decided to resurrect an experiment I had started with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. My first attempt hadn’t been very successful, so I stuck with Jekyll. This second attempt however is a lot more successful as it addressed a couple of the issues that kept me from being happy with Jekyll:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hugo builds the site much faster than Jekyll</li>
<li>I found a <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-future-imperfect-slim/">theme</a> that I’m really happy with.</li>
<li>It looks like some of the details that I found hard to get right in Jekyll are already handled nicely in Hugo. This is mostly around the RSS feed generation – Hugo by default generates category feeds in addition to the regular “full” feed. It also looks like the category feeds are very similar path-wise to what WordPress uses, so hopefully the RSS feeds should continue working with the couple of aggregators that picked up this blog.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fortunately, this time I succeeded in importing the site from Jekyll into Hugo. It took some work to clean up some of the artifacts that originated in the WP-to-Jekyll conversion, and then I had to convert the Liquid template code to Hugo shortcodes. The latter was pretty easy, but a bit tedious. Just not tedious enough to write a script to do it.</p>
<h2>Hugo can render org-mode files (and so can Jekyll, apparently)</h2>
<p>Another nice feature is that my workflow can still use org-mode for when I want to use it to write longer posts. Shorter posts I usually crank out in Markdown, but for the more complex posts it’s nice to have org-mode as an option. <em>Especially</em> if the post contains source code.</p>
<p>While the setup I described before with using org-mode to post to WordPress is mostly working, it’s a bit clunky especially if you’re using more than one computer to work on blog posts. Both Jekyll and Hugo can handle org-mode files directly – in fact, even though this file would be as effortless to write as Markdown, what you are currently reading is actually a processed org-mode file. Assuming that you’re reading this on the <a href="https://static.lonecpluspluscoder.com/">static site</a>, that is.</p>
<h2>What’s left to before the actual cutover?</h2>
<p>There are two fairly large items I have to tick off the todo list before I can cut over for good.</p>
<ul>
<li>Migrate the comments. Now this blog doesn’t get a ton of comments, but I appreciate all of them and am trying to migrate them over to this blog. As I believe in self-hosting everything, I’m experimenting with <a href="https://posativ.org/isso/">isso</a>, and I need to redo some of the experiments with Hugo as so far, they’ve been completely focussed on Jekyll. Hugo does have built in support for disqus, plus this theme has support for staticman, but neither of the two are my preferred alternatives.</li>
<li>QA the site, especially the RSS feeds so that they hopefully keep working as they do right now.</li>
<li>There are still some minor tweaks to be done, analytics integrated and all that, but those are probably going to happen slowly after the cutover.</li>
<li>Oh, and the last item is all of the draft posts that have accumulated on WordPress that I somehow never got around to finishing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The beta of the static site is <a href="https://static.lonecpluspluscoder.com/">here</a> if you want to have a look. Any feedback is welcome.</p>

        <p>Of all the projects I’ve made, I receive the most questions about the <a href="https://github.com/thesephist/ink">Ink programming language</a>. Most questions fall into three categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why did you make a programming language?</li>
<li>I want to make my own programming language – any advice?</li>
<li>Why does Ink work the way it does?</li>
</ol>
<p>This post aims to answer questions (1) and (2) and provide some resources for you to get started on your own language. I think (3) is best left for its own, more technical post.</p>
<p>This post is organized into a few sections.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#why">Why should you?</a></li>
<li><a href="#design">Design</a></li>
<li><a href="#impl">Implementation</a></li>
<li><a href="#other">Other considerations</a></li>
<li><a href="#start">Start small, get creative, ask questions</a></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="why-should-you">Why should you?</h2>
<p>Making an interpreter for a new programming language is the most technically rewarding project I’ve worked on. It pushed my understanding of fundamental software concepts and helped me comprehend how a computer works at a deeper level.</p>
<p>Programming languages and compilers / interpreters can be black boxes for programmers starting out. They’re tools taken for granted, and you can write good software without necessarily worrying about how the languages and primitive tools you’re using work under the hood. But writing a programming language involves understanding the most meaty parts of the computing stack, from the CPU and memory up through the operating system, in-memory data structures, processes, threads, the stack, all the way up to libraries and applications. It’s the floodgate to the most interesting mathematics in computing – category theory and type systems, algebras, lots of applications of graph theory, complexity analysis, and more. <strong>Writing and studying programming languages, I found myself getting more familiar with both the mathematics and the mechanical underpinnings of how computers work.</strong></p>
<p>The project made me a better developer as a result, even if my day-to-day work rarely concerns programming language tooling or compiler writing.</p>
<p>A programming language also has lots of room for expansions, optimizations, and extra creativity even after the project’s version one is “finished”. If you design the initial implementation carefully, you can add new keywords, new features, optimizations, and tools to your language and interpreter / compiler incrementally over time. It’s easy to turn a language into a long-term project and creative outlet, and I’ve enjoyed expanding on my initial implementation while studying other languages after my version-one was complete.</p>
<h3 id="the-pl-world-is-broad-and-deep-pick-your-battles">The PL world is broad and deep; pick your battles</h3>
<p>Unlike some other areas of software that follow hype cycles, the programming language field has grown and deepened steadily and constantly for a long time in both academia and industry. There’s a <em>lot</em> of literature, research, prior art, and practical advice in the wild about a million different concepts that can be combined into a new language, and a million different variations on how to implement them.</p>
<p>Especially for a personal-project language, I think the most fruitful approach is to <strong>pick one or two interesting ideas from the archaeology of computing, and build a programming language that examines and expands on those ideas deeply</strong>, rather than try to build the One True Language that’s best at everything and combines the best features of all the languages. Not only is it impossible to make such a language for all use cases, I think that kind of mindset also slows down development, adds unnecessary work, and doesn’t give you the mental space to learn as much about a few interesting topics you might be interested in.</p>
<p>For example, you might be interested in functional programming and immutable data structures. You could try to build a language that’s designed around storing all state in immutable data structures, and study how such data structures can be optimized and manipulated efficiently in a compiler. Or maybe you’re interested in low-level C programming and systems languages, in which case you might try to build a scripting language whose primary goals include elegant interoperability with C APIs and binary interfaces.</p>
<p>Where you start also determines the challenges and tradeoffs you’ll contend with. You might have an easier time writing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a> interpreter due to its simpler syntax, because it’s easy to parse compared to, say, a more complex syntax for a language with a static type system. However, Lisps tend to have semantics that are further-removed from the low-level machine code that runs, like closures. So you may trade off the ease of parsing with execution complexity.</p>
<p>Pick your battles carefully, and stick to a few core ideas that you want to study deeply.</p>

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>Before you write either an interpreter or a compiler, you need to <em>design</em> a language. You can spend time studying category theory and type systems and programming paradigms, but the best thing you can do for yourself at this stage is to study ideas from a wide breadth of programming languages. Don’t just limit yourself to “modern” languages like Rust and Python; reach back into computing history. There’s rich ideas to be reinvented and combined in interesting ways reaching back at least a century into computing and mathematics.</p>
<p>It’s easy to get stuck in the mental model of popular modern OOP-like languages (Python, Ruby, Swift, C++) and spend the most time in this phase designing <em>syntax</em>. But designing the <em>semantics</em> of the language is where you should spend the most of your time, because it’s where the language gets its “feel” and where you’ll learn the most. Semantics are also more difficult to change after the fact than syntax. Some questions to ask yourself, to start thinking about language semantics and ergonomics:</p>
<ul>
<li>What types does your language have? Is it checked at compile-time? Does it automatically convert between types as necessary?</li>
<li>What’s the top-level organizing unit of programs in your language? Languages commonly call this modules, packages, or libraries, but some languages may invent their own concept, like Rust <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/crates.html">Crates</a>.</li>
<li>How does the language deal with exceptional conditions, like a missing file, a network access error, or a divide-by-zero error? Do you treat errors like exceptions that bubble up through the call stack, or are errors treated like values, as in C and Go?</li>
<li>Does your language perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call">tail recursion optimization</a>? Or do you provide native control-flow tools for looping, like <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops?</li>
<li>How much utility do you want to build into the language, as opposed to a standard library? C, for example, doesn’t know about strings – string semantics are provided by the C standard library. Maps and lists are fundamental language constructs in most high-languages, and not so in most low-level ones.</li>
<li>How does your language think about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management">allocating memory</a>? Is memory automatically allocated as needed? Does the developer need to write code to do so? Is it garbage-collected?</li>
</ul>
<p>To answer these questions, I think it’s most helpful to just get a taste of a variety of languages in the wild. Here’s a small starter set that I recommend you take a look at, and what ideas I personally found intriguing from each language or language family.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lua</strong>: a data structure called <a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/2.5.html">tables</a>, Lua <a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/9.1.html">couroutines</a>, using strings as byte slices, interoperability with C</li>
<li><strong>Scheme / Clojure</strong>: Metaprogramming with macros, homoiconicity, closures, control flow with recursion. Die-hard Common-Lispers may disagree, but Scheme and Clojure are the easiest languages in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a> family of languages for me to learn. You should study at least one kind of Lisp.</li>
<li><strong>Go</strong>: structural typing with <a href="https://tour.golang.org/methods/9">interfaces</a>, concurrency with blocking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_threads">green threads</a></li>
<li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: callback-style concurrency and asynchronous programming, first-class functions, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop">event loop</a>, Promises</li>
<li><strong>Awk</strong>: Awk is a great example of a small, simple language optimized for one use case: manipulating text files and textual data. It’s very well designed for that workflow, and a inspiration for how effective a small, domain-specific language with simple semantics can be.</li>
<li><strong>APL</strong> / <strong>J</strong>: APL and J are both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_programming#Array_languages">array languages</a>, which is a fascinating family of languages well known for its brevity</li>
<li><strong>Ruby</strong>: syntax. Ruby’s well known for its super-flexible syntax, because it lends itself easily to DSLs based on Ruby, like ActiveRecord.</li>
<li><strong>C</strong>: I like C mostly for its simplicity and minimalism, and an uncompromising commitment to compatibility</li>
<li><strong>Haskell</strong>: the type system and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_polymorphism">parametric polymorphism</a>, variant types, partial application and function type syntax. Once you wrap your mind around it, Haskell is also a good place to start diving deeper into the kinds of elegant programs possible with functional programming.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>Once you have a design for how a language should work and feel, you should first “test-drive” it to see how programs written in the language feel to use.</p>
<h3 id="test-drive">Test-drive</h3>
<p>In this phase, I usually keep a text document where I experiment with syntax by writing small programs in the new as-yet-nonexistent language. I write notes and questions for myself in comments in the code, and try to implement small algorithms and data structures like recursive mathematical functions, sorting algorithms, and small web servers. I usually hold myself to this stage until most of my questions about syntax and semantics are answered. I also use this phase to test my hypotheses about the core ideas behind the language design. If I designed a language around functional programming and asynchronous, event-driven concurrency, for example, I’d write some sample code in this phase to validate that those ideas combine well together, and lends itself to programs that I’d enjoy writing. If I’m proven wrong, I’ll update my assumptions or play around with the language design to reflect what I’ve learned.</p>
<p>This straw-man design phase is a quick way to make sure that the language you’ve invented in your head could work well for the kinds of programs you want to write, without having to write much implementation.</p>
<h3 id="build-an-interpretercompiler">Build an interpreter/compiler</h3>
<p>At their core, <strong>interpreters and compilers are layers and layers of small transformations to your source code (a string of text) into …</strong></p></article></div>

I have <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/hoods/">written about 56 of the 77</a> Chicago neighborhoods but left out 21 of them; the reason why is because those 21 neighborhoods do not have a significant enough gang history throughout the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> centuries due to a lack of poverty, consistent strong community ties and being consistently economically flourishing.&nbsp; Neighborhoods like Mount Greenwood and Edison Park have been known to have zero homicides for 10 or more years at a time.&nbsp; Neighborhoods like Forest Glen, North Center, O’Hare, Norwood Park, North Park and Beverly are very close to Mount Greenwood and Edison Park with almost no murders and no gang violence.&nbsp; Anywhere you look on the internet or read stats about these neighborhoods you will see a correlation with the lack of gang activity in these neighborhoods past and present with low crime rates; another interesting thing is most of these neighborhoods border the suburbs.</p>
<p>Some neighborhoods had a stint of gang activity in decades past; however, it was not enough to delve into a whole history of the neighborhood as there was no real socioeconomic or any other sociological reasons gangs were there in such neighborhoods as: Dunning, Jefferson Park, Portage Park and Montclare.&nbsp; Some neighborhoods I did not get into because they have some roughness throughout history, but not enough to really delve deeper, these neighborhoods such as: West Ridge, West Lawn, Edgewater, West Elsdon, East Side, Avondale, Hegewish, Ashburn and Clearing have only had a moderate level of gang violence over the course of history mainly though the 20<sup>th</sup> century and most importantly no significant street gangs were formed in any of the 20 neighborhoods I just mentioned. The only one that had a significant gang form within its borders was Hyde Park that is the home of the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/gang/black-disciples/">Devil’s Disciples. </a>At the time of the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/gang/black-disciples/">Disciples</a>&nbsp;being founded, the northern part of Hyde Park was a little rough for the first half of the 1960s decade but the issues that brought about the gangs were long ago eradicated and there was nothing else to discuss about Hyde Park after that.</p>
<p>Some neighborhoods I dove into because of their past but presently these areas have become a lot safer and changed their whole look, neighborhoods like: <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/north-center/">North Center</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/lincoln-park/">Lincoln Park</a>, <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/lincoln-square/">Lincoln Square</a>, <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/lakeview/">Lake View</a>, the <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/loop/">Loop</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/irving-park/">Irving Park</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-north-side/">Near North Side</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/garfield-ridge/">Garfield Ridge</a> and the <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-south-side/">Near South Side</a> have experienced huge makeovers in the 21<sup>st</sup> century that make them almost unrecognizable to those that walked those streets in the 20<sup>th</sup> century. these renovations also ended up pushing out most gang activity in these regions.&nbsp; Some other neighborhoods had stronger gang activity and violence in the 20<sup>th</sup> century but ever since the 21<sup>st</sup> century urban renewal, rising property values, gentrification and crack downs by police and residents, have greatly reduced violence and gang activity in these neighborhoods like: <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/belmont-cragin/">Belmont-Cragin</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/logan-square/">Logan Square</a>, <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/armour-square/">Armour Square</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/albany-park/">Albany Park</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/uptown/">Uptown</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/rogers-park">Rogers Park</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/bridgeport/">Bridgeport</a>, West Town, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/douglas/">Douglas</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/kenwood/">Kenwood</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/hermosa">Hermosa</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/archer-heights/">Archer Heights</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/mckinley-park">McKinley Park</a>, <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/lower-west-side/">Lower West Side</a> (<a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/lower-west-side/">Pilsen</a>), <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/brighton-park/">Brighton Park</a> and the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-west-side/">Near West Side</a> have seen massive improvements over time but still have quite a ways to go, however, these area have become significantly safer.</p>
<p>The rest of the other 31 neighborhoods still struggle with heavy violence and gang wars as the bodies stack up and crime is high.&nbsp; The 56 neighborhoods that have been explored above, all play a key role in the early formation of street gangs in Chicago and have molded the top organizations that we see active on the streets today that have even spread as far as other countries.</p>

		 

		

		

		

	
<p>We all know someone that is in a Chicago based street gang that we know comes from a comfortable home in a livable and/or safer neighborhood and we wonder why they are in a gang despite having a decent life; the answer to that question could be answered by sociologists and psychologists with answers along the lines of needing to fit in, peer pressure etc… but the organization that individual is a part of did not start in a well off neighborhood and did not come from the middle class sections of the city or <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/the-american-dream/">suburbs.</a>&nbsp;These organizations came from the darkest and ugliest side of Chicago history that came from poverty, racism and survival.&nbsp; Many sections of these organizations still suffer from these factors but many are just gang banging for the heck of it, as that is commonly seen in the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/the-american-dream/">suburbs;</a>&nbsp;especially when you see gang banging in communities like <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/the-american-dream/">Naperville</a>, Palatine or even <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/the-american-dream/">Oak Brook</a>.</p>
<p>Racism was the first and largest factor that created street gangs and organized crime in this city because being discriminated against leads an individual to not receive the opportunities for advancement in life such as: equal housing, equal employment and equal education.&nbsp; We cannot argue against the fact that African Americans have had it the worst throughout history as far as discrimination is concerned and this was started as soon as African Americans were sold by their chiefs and brought to this country on slave boats, even supposed “free men” in the old days were pushed to live in the most decrepit and most undesirable living situations to the point where many felt slavery was a better alternative.</p>
<p>This city was first settled (by a non-Native American) by a man with dark skin and from the African ancestral country of Haiti before any other non-Native American wanted to live on these lands that are now Chicago.&nbsp; Despite the fact that Du Sable was first and he was black it did not matter; once this military fort was converted into a town and then a city in the 1830s the African Americans that came to help build this city were forced to live in a confined area in the present day <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-west-side/">United Center</a> section of the <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-west-side/">Near West Side</a>, neighborhood away from the white settlers. Whites were allowed to settle in the <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/loop/">Loop</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-north-side/">Near North Side</a> and the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-west-side/">West Loop</a> section of the <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-west-side/">Near West Side</a>, and in actuality, the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-west-side/">United Center</a> part was not even annexed into the city in the 1830s; therefore, blacks were not even allowed in Chicago in the first decade of the city’s existence.</p>
<p>Another hated group were the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">Irish</a> in early history, which is hard to fathom for modern societies’ understanding because they have white skin. In reality there were signs in many cities that read <strong>“NO BLACKS AND NO IRISH”</strong> and this was put in front of store fronts and also in front of manufacturing businesses that were hiring that also paid a decent wage.&nbsp; The <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">Irish</a> were allowed to live among their fellow white man; however, they were forced to take the crappiest and most dilapidated housing, they also were only allowed to take the lowest income and the worst positions nobody wanted. This discrimination led to the first ghetto in Chicago known as “<a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-north-side/">Little Hell</a>” that was located in the <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-north-side/">Near North Side</a> neighborhood in the southwest quadrant in the areas of <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-north-side/">Little Hell</a> (now <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/housing-project/cabrini-green">Cabrini Green</a> area), <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-north-side/">Smokey Hallow</a> (Now the western part of <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-north-side/">River North</a>), and <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-north-side/">Goose Island</a>.&nbsp; This was the first slum, the first crime ridden area, the first site of poverty and socioeconomic issues.&nbsp; This area was also the birth place of street gangs and the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">Irish</a> and <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">Italian Mafia</a>, it all started here in this mostly <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">Irish</a> slum. When <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">Italians</a> first came to this city in the 1880s most of them were pushed into this slum while the rest had to settle in rural Hyde Park Township or Lake Township outside the city limits and fend for themselves. Those that arrived in the city limits got shoved into <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-north-side/">Little Hell</a> with the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">Irish</a> and were forced to live a life of anguish earning low wages, living in deteriorated housing, living among garbage and filth, living with no running water or plumbing just like the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">Irish</a>.&nbsp; Even the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">Irish</a> and <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">Italians</a> had their own restrictions in <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-north-side/">Little Hell</a> as they did not want blacks living there; however, the rest of the city did not want blacks either unless they lived near the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-south-side/">Vice District</a> (and the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-south-side/">Levee</a>), <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/loop/">Gamblers Row</a> and <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/loop/">Whiskey Row</a> in the southern part of the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/loop/">Loop</a> or on in the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-south-side/">Near South Side</a> shabbier buildings, when those buildings became crowded, blacks were allowed to move into <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-north-side/">Little Hell</a>.</p>

		 

		

		

		

	
<p>No matter where African Americans chose to settle, it was the same story of poverty, slums and living among criminals and hooligans in run down apartments or dilapidated cottages.&nbsp; Despite living among so many criminals the black man did not take up a life of crime because he knew that stealing that loaf of bread would cause him to be hung while the white man would get a small jail stint, so the vast majority of early African Americans did not run with street gangs or partake in or create organized crime with the exception of <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">John “Mushmouth” Johnson</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-west-side/">Little Hell</a>, the <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-south-side/">South Loop</a> and also in the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/new-city/">Back of The Yards</a> people lived in such awful conditions and desperately wanted to escape this life; however, restraints based upon ethnicity and race did not allow upward mobility which made many resort to a life of crime because they were <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">Italian</a>, because they were <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">Irish</a> and later because they were black.</p>
<p>Until the 1890s African Americans were forced to live in the slums of once great buildings built during early settlement leftover from whites that had moved up in the world. In the 1890s blacks now wanted to move to <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/grand-boulevard/">Grand Boulevard</a> and <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/douglas/">Douglas</a> and as they settled in these better areas the white community reacted in protest and even violence. Another reaction from the whites was to move out of the neighborhood for the simple reason that they did not want black neighbors despite the fact that black people posed no threat and were mostly law abiding citizens; much of it had to do with pride, they felt if they had black neighbors then they were living among poverty, it was all about image apparently.&nbsp; Proper and easier assimilation of blacks into these two neighborhoods was perhaps extremely vital in Chicago history because if this would have worked out without white flight and disinvestment happening in these …</p></div></div>

        <p>I don't remember the day but I was talking with a friend of mine about the benefit vs drawback of a exact match domain vs a brand domain.</p><p>I guess first I should explain what an exact match domain is, simply put, it would be the .com of what ever search the user might be doing in a search engine, such as google, bing, yandex, long or short, say "cars" the exact match would be cars.com, or "used cars" the exact match would be usedcars.com</p><p>Now a brand domain, would be something like Yout or IBM.&nbsp; Now of course these words mean nothing.&nbsp; So they can be anything.</p><p>The discussion was that there was a company back in the day that had started out with an exact match domain in a specific sector.&nbsp; Say cupakes.com and from there they went on and bought donuts.com, as they developed each out as one or both grew then acquiring a third, and so on.</p><p>They then got a point where they had decided they should instead make a brand, instead of managing each of the sites individually.&nbsp; So they launched a unified amazon type site, and redirected all their sites to the respective location on their brand site.</p><p>Of course their brand site went on to either go public or sold off for a large amount .&nbsp; Either way that would be determined a success.&nbsp; This of course showed that if you just start out as a brand in the beginning and execute well you can do everything.</p><p>So I guess it's more of semantics and my love for exact match domains given that I still think an exact match domain is the best way to enter any niche, and perhaps maybe not the best, but the most ever green if done well.&nbsp; </p><p>Now of course if you start expanding into other niches, or that was your original plan, I still think the scenario in which I described it would of still been beneficial to have launched an individual brand site and put a sort of "powered by" and maintained each of them running once you have enough exact matches or are doing well enough in one niche that you dominate it so well that you move onto the next, that it would be foolish to not, at least dominate twice the amount of the niche.&nbsp; I think more specifically because each niche has it quirks as well so by unifying you end up neglecting those.<br></p>

        <p>
        by  on <i itemprop="datePublished">2021-01-10</i></p>
        <p><span itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>This story goes back several years, to when I was working at Hipmunk on the
Backend Platform Team. Among the many varied responsibilities of this team<sup id="fnref:0"><a href="#fn:0">1</a></sup>,
we were responsible for maintaining our integrations with our partners via their
APIs. Most of these partner APIs returned data as nested dictionaries, encoded
as <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">JSON</a>. You may be able to imagine that
some of these APIs were less reliable than others, and so we had adapted with a
bag of tricks to deal with malformed and outright bad data. The story I'm about
to tell you describes when I got carried away trying to solve one specific
problem, the consequences it had, and the lessons I've learned from it.</p>

<h3>The nature of the problem</h3>

<p>First, lets abstract away the specifics of our API integration. In essence, we
would make some kind of standard, authenticated request to our partner, and the response
would be in the form of a JSON encoding of some nested dictionary tree structure. It would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>{
    "status": "success",
    "result": {
        "mandatory_key": "some attribute",
	"optional_key": "some attribute",
	"nested_object_1": {
            "key_1": "value 1",
	    "optional_nested_object_2a": {
                "key_1": "value 1"
		"possible_display_key": "display me if present",
            },
	    "nested_object_2b": {
		"possible_display_key": "display me as a fallback",
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Pay attention to <code>possible_display_key</code>, which appears twice in this response.
This is a stripped-back example of what the problem was, both in the number of
missing fields, and the depth of nesting. <code>optional_nested_object_2a</code> may or may
not be present in the response returned by the partner, depending on whether
their data covered that use case. For a fictional example, the entire hotel
image subtree might be missing from the results for a specific hotel if the
partner we queried had no images for that hotel.</p>

<p>Our code that tried to pull out these values was written with the end uses in
mind. So these missing subtrees made for clunky code, like the following:</p>

<pre><code>def extract_display_field(response):
    nested_object_1 = response['result']['nested_object_1']
    if 'optional_nested_object_2a' in nested_object_1 and 'possible_display_key' in nested_object_1['optional_nested_object_2a']:
        return nested_object_1['optional_nested_object_2a']['possible_display_key']
    if 'nested_object_2b' in nested_object_1 and 'possible_display_key' in nested_object_1['nested_object_2b']:
        return nested_object_1['nested_object_2']['possible_display_key']
    return 'some default'

</code></pre>

<p>Of course, I need you to put in some effort to imagine what it actually looked
like, since those nestings could be 3-6 layers deep of potentially missing
structures<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">2</a></sup>. Our parser code was trying to express that we wanted to do something
with the element at a certain path, if it existed. Because entire subtrees might
be missing, however, we needed to be careful about how we traversed the
structure, so that we didn't throw a <code>KeyError</code> if we accidentally stepped off
the tree.</p>

<p>Over time, we settled on an idiom that used the default parameter of
<code>dict.get()</code>, and it looked like the following:</p>

<pre><code>def extract_display_field(response):
    return (
        response['result']['nested_object_1'].get(
            'optional_nested_object_2a', {}).get('possible_display_key')
        or response['result']['nested_object_1'].get(
            'nested_object_2b', {}).get('possible_display_key')
	or 'some default
    )
</code></pre>

<p>Because of the depth, we'd need to chain those <code>.get</code>s so they'd look like:</p>

<pre><code>return response.get('foo', {}).get('bar', {}'
       ).get('baz', {}).get('quux', {}) or 'default'
</code></pre>

<h4>Why not just catch the KeyError?</h4>

<p>Why not rely on <code>KeyError</code> to detect when a value was missing? It's a common adage in Python that it's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#:~:text=Easier%20to%20ask">Easier to Ask Forgiveness Than Permission</a>, and so most idiomatic Python would use:</p>

<pre><code>try:
    val = response['foo']['bar']['baz']
except KeyError:
    val = "default"
</code></pre>

<p>Well, the reason was just one of convenience. <code>try</code> and <code>except</code> define clauses,
which cannot be part of expressions in the language. What we wanted was to be
able to write concise expressions like:</p>

<pre><code>response['foo']['bar']['baz'] or response['foo']['bar']['baz2']
</code></pre>

<p>without needing to pad out the number of lines.</p>

<h4>Why pick out fields rather than unmarshalling objects</h4>

<p>Another question that you might have is why not parse the entire API response
structure into objects, and then use methods of those objects to find what we
want, rather than querying dict trees? The answer there is cost. We had scores
of these API integrations to maintain, and our partners all had different domain
models for their objects.</p>

<p>For example, some APIs would represent the Lat/Long coordinates of an Airport as
part of the Airport object. Others might have a Location object within the
Airport, which then had the coordinates in there. The purpose of our integration
code was to pick out the coordinates, and put them into the common structured
object model we had for all such requests. Maintaining another set of objects to
represent each partner's structure would bloat the code for no additional
purpose.</p>

<h3>Enter LazyRecursiveDefaultDict</h3>

<p>This was where I had my bright idea. I wasn't the first person to come up with
the idea of a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19189274/nested-defaultdict-of-defaultdict/27809959">recursive
defaultdict</a>.</p>

<p>However, applying it to the problem of parsing these APIs seemed so <em>clever</em>,
that I was genuinely pleased with myself for having thought of it. That must
have been why I was so eager to implement it, despite the concerns my reviewers
raised about the excess complexity.</p>

<p>The code itself was very small. First let's have the code, and then I'll go
through the points I want to you notice. Remember, this is a cautionary tale, so
please don't add this in any production context. Also, I don't have access to
the original code anymore, so I threw this code together for this blog article.</p>

<pre><code>from collections import defaultdict

class LazyRecursiveDefaultDict(defaultdict):
    """Do not use in production."""

    def __init__(self, tree=None):
        if tree is None:
            tree = {}

        super(LazyRecursiveDefaultDict, self).__init__(
            LazyRecursiveDefaultDict, tree)

    def __getitem__(self, key):
        retval = super(LazyRecursiveDefaultDict, self).__getitem__(key)
        if isinstance(retval, dict):
            return LazyRecursiveDefaultDict(retval)
        return retval
</code></pre>

<p>A LazyRecursiveDefaultDict is a subclass of defaultdict. Defaultdict is a type
of collection available in the Python standard library. It behaves like
a dictionary, with the added ability to specify a default value for missing
keys. Judicious use of defaultdict simplifies a lot of code.</p>

<p>This code uses a recursive definition at <code>__init__</code> to set the default
constructed dictionary to be an empty LazyRecursiveDefaultDict. This way, any
number of nested, missed accesses would just return an empty LazyRecursiveDefaultDict</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; response["foo"]["bar"]["wrong"][
...     "somewhere"]["these"]["keys"]["are"]["missing"]
defaultdict(&lt;class '__main__.LazyRecursiveDefaultDict'&gt;, {})
</code></pre>

<p>The reason this is Lazy, is so that it doesn't have to process the entire tree
of dictionaries, converting them all, at construction time. By overriding
<code>__getitem__</code>, I was able to make sure that whenever the item being returned was
a dictionary, the appropriate construction code would come into play.</p>

<h3>Rollout, adoption, eventual fall</h3>

<p>I initially wrote this while implementing an API integration, whose rollout was
successful. I reported about LazyRecursiveDefaultDict to my teammates, and
recommended that we start adopting it more widely. And then, after I'd
publicly let everyone know that this tool was available for everyone's use,
the problems started!</p>

<p>Some of our existing parsers relied on the fact that nested accesses would
throw KeyErrors if not met. They had been written over many years of edge
cases, planned and unplanned mutations to external APIs, and changes to our
systems, and so there was a lot of surface area to cover. I had thought that all
we needed to do was to convert the response tree to <code>LazyRecursiveDefaultDict</code>,
to start reaping the benefits. Instead, we found that this exposed all sorts of
subtle errors started showing up in testing.</p>

<p>In addition, we found that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Debugging became harder, now that there was another recursive data structure
to reason about</p></li>

<li><p>There was a lot of needless copying during every dictionary access</p></li>

<li><p>LazyRecursiveDefaultDict didn't convert the objects returned from APIs if they were an element of a list</p></li>

<li><p>LazyRecursiveDefaultDicts were escaping their contexts, since parsers might
send them for logging or error reporting, and they had the potential to cause
subtle problems there too.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>None of these problems were unsolvable. However, solving those problems would
require writing more code, making this class even more complex. That forced me
to think about how much I was willing to invest in this as a solution, and
whether it was the right tool for the job.</p>

<h3>Restoration, and Replacement</h3>

<p>As soon as I realized that <code>LazyRecursiveDefaultDict</code> was not the panacea we
were looking for, I made sure to ticket work to remove it. In the end, a simple
solution was much better, a function that looked something like:</p>

<pre><code>def get_from_tree(
    tree: dict,
    path: typing.List[typing.Union[str, int]],
    default=None):
    """Implementation left as an exercise for the reader.

    Hint: use a for loop to traverse the path, picking
    your way down the tree. If you get a KeyError
    (or an IndexError!), return the default value instead.
    """

# Call it this way:
get_from_tree(response, ["foo", "bar", "baz", "quux"], "default")
</code></pre>

<p>The function was much easier to understand, which lowered the barrier to
adoption by the members of our team. …</p></span></p></div></div>

    <meta itemprop="description" content="A fast concurrent persistent key-value store and log, in C# and C++. Latest release v1.7.4">
    
    

    <section itemprop="text">
      <p>Managing large application state easily, resiliently, and with high performance is one of the hardest
problems in the cloud today. The FASTER project offers two artifacts to help tackle this problem.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>FASTER Log</strong> is a high-performance concurrent persistent recoverable log, iterator, and random 
reader library in C#. It supports very frequent commit operations at low latency, and can quickly saturate 
disk bandwidth. It supports both sync and async interfaces, handles disk errors, and supports checksums. Learn 
more about using the FASTER Log in C# <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/fasterlog-basics/">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>FASTER KV</strong> is a concurrent key-value store + cache (available in C# and C++) that is designed for point 
lookups and heavy updates. FASTER supports data larger than memory, by leveraging fast external 
storage (local or cloud). It also supports consistent recovery using a new checkpointing technique that lets 
applications trade-off performance for commit latency. Learn more about the FASTER KV in C# 
<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/fasterkv-basics/">here</a>. For the FASTER C++ port, check <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/fasterkv-cpp/">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>



<ol>
  <li>Latch-free cache-optimized index, in FASTER KV.</li>
  <li>A fast persistent recoverable append-only log based on fine-grained epoch protection for concurrency, 
in FASTER Log.</li>
  <li>Unique “hybrid record log” design in FASTER KV, that combines the above log with in-place updates, to 
shape the memory working set and retain performance.</li>
  <li>Architecture as a component that can be embedded in multi-threaded cloud apps.</li>
  <li>Asynchronous non-blocking recovery model based on group commit.</li>
  <li>A rich extensible storage device abstraction called <code>IDevice</code>, with implementations for local
storage, cloud storage, tiered storage, and sharded storage.</li>
</ol>

<p>For standard benchmarks where the working set fits in main memory, we found FASTER KV to achieve
significantly higher throughput than current systems, and match or exceed the performance of pure 
in-memory data structures while offering more functionality. See our <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/td-research-papers/">research papers</a>
for more details. We also have a detailed analysis of C# FASTER KV performance in a wiki page 
<a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/FASTER/wiki/Performance-of-FASTER-in-C%23">here</a>. The performance of the 
C# and C++ versions of FASTER is very similar. FASTER Log is also extremely fast, capable of saturating modern
NVMe SSDs using less than a core of CPU, and scaling well in a multi-threaded setting.</p>



<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We now support variable-length keys and values in FasterKV C# via <code>Memory&lt;byte&gt;</code> and more generally <code>Memory&lt;T&gt; where T : unmanaged</code> as key/value/input types. We also added
a new type called <code>SpanByte</code> to represent variable-length keys and values. See the sample <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/FASTER/tree/master/cs/samples/StoreVarLenTypes">here</a> for details on these capabilities. This is in addition to the existing object-log support for class types.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We support C# async in FASTER KV (and FASTER Log). See the guides for <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/fasterkv-basics/">FasterKV</a> and <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/fasterlog-basics/">FasterLog</a>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>Understanding and managing storage in Linux is essential. There are several key concepts and commands for working with block storage.</p>
<p><span>If you are an absolute beginner in configuring storage on Linux, then this article is for you.</span></p>
<p>Here we will discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Block storage device naming and the <code>/dev</code> directory</li>
<li>Disk partitioning</li>
<li>Creating and mounting filesystems</li>
<li>Logical Volume Manager (LVM)</li>
</ul>
<ol></ol>

<h2><span id="Prerequisites"></span>Prerequisites<span></span></h2>
<ul>
<li>A server running Linux preferably CentOS 7 or higher</li>
<li>At least 2 free storage devices</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="Introduction"></span>Introduction<span></span></h2>
<p>Every physical server or virtual machine has some directly attached block devices. These can be HDD, SSD, or USB Flash drives.</p>
<p>Whenever a new block device is inserted into the system, the available capacity is not immediately accessible. In other words, files and directories cannot be directly created on the device.</p>
<p>Some basic configuration is required to make the storage space available. It includes creating partitions, creating filesystems, and mounting.</p>
<p>Before we start discussing the commands relative to these operations, let’s talk about the <code>/dev</code> directory and block device naming.</p>
<h2><span id="Block_storage_device_naming"></span>Block storage device naming<span></span></h2>
<p>Linux handles storage devices as files. These files are stored under the <code>/dev</code> directory. It’s critical to understand this concept because most storage commands take files from this directory as their arguments. Many system programs also use these files as the interface for Input/Output or I/O operations with the block devices.</p>
<p>Whenever a new block device is inserted or detected, the system automatically creates a new corresponding file under the directory <code>/dev</code>.</p>
<p>The name of this file depends on several things. Most importantly, it depends on the device bus type and the order in which the device was inserted relative to the other devices.</p>
<p>For example, if the bus type is SCSI or SATA, the first half of the file name is <code>sd</code>. The other half is a letter assigned in alphabetical order depending on the order in which the device was detected.</p>
<p>The first, second, and third SCSI devices on a system are named <code>sda</code>, <code>sdb</code>, and <code>sdc</code>, respectively.</p>
<p>Devices with other bus types are subject to slightly different naming rules. For NVMe, which is a modern bus type, the first part of the device name is <code>nvme</code>. There is also a bus number added in the middle. The final part is a letter and a number, which indicate the order of detection. For example: <code>nvme0n1</code> or <code>nvme0n2</code>.</p>
<p>We can list the <code>/dev</code> directory content to get an overview of all the block devices present on the system.</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="generic">ls /dev</pre>
<p><img width="880" height="162" src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-40.png" data-src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-40.png" data-srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-40.png 880w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-40-300x55.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-40-768x141.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-40.png 880w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-40-300x55.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-40-768x141.png 768w"></p>
<p>There are many files, including <code>sda</code>, <code>sdb</code>, <code>sda1</code>, <code>sda2</code>, <code>nvme0n1</code>, and <code>nvme0n2</code>.</p>
<p>Note that <code>/dev </code>also includes other files that are not related to storage devices.</p>
<p><code>sda</code> and <code>sdb</code> are block devices. However, <code>sda1</code> and <code>sda2</code> don’t represent actual block devices. They represent partitions, which are discussed next.</p>
<h2><span id="Partitioning"></span>Partitioning<span></span></h2>
<h3><span id="What_is_partitioning"></span>What is partitioning<span></span></h3>
<p>Partitioning is the operation of dividing the block device into logical block devices called partitions. It is the first operation to do before we can use the disk.</p>
<p>To list all disks and partitions present on the system, use the command:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="generic">lsblk</pre>
<p><img width="880" height="286" src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-41.png" data-src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-41.png" data-srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-41.png 880w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-41-300x98.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-41-768x250.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-41.png 880w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-41-300x98.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-41-768x250.png 768w"></p>
<p><code>lsblk</code> shows a clear tree structure of disks and their partitions. Also, the “type” column of the output indicates whether the line represents a disk, partition, or LVM. (LVM type is an advanced storage scheme that is discussed at the end)</p>
<p>There are mainly two partitioning schemes: the Master Boot Record (MBR) and the GUID Partition Table (GPT). MBR is a legacy partitioning scheme, but it is still used. It is limited to a maximum disk size of 2 TiB. GPT partitioning is preferred because it breaks the limit of the 2 TiB disks and introduces other enhancements.</p>
<h3><span id="How_to_create_a_partition"></span>How to create a partition<span></span></h3>
<p>The<code> fdisk</code> command is used to create MBR partitions, while the <code>gdisk</code> command is used to create GPT partitions. Both are interactive commands and are very similar.</p>
<p>These commands create a partition table on the first few sectors of a disk. (With GPT, the partition table is also backed up at the last few disk sectors).</p>
<p>This table contains all the information about the partitions. For example, it includes the sector addresses where every partition begins and ends. (A sector is the minimum read/write block size used by disks, it’s usually 512 Bytes).</p>
<p>Let’s see an example. We have a CentOS VM with a 20 GB disk named <code>sdb</code>. Note that on your machine, the disk name could be different. Make sure to select the right disk. We will create a new GPT partition table and two partitions with 2 GB each.</p>
<p>Storage related commands are usually restricted to the root user only. So login as root and use the command below:</p>

<p>We use the “n” command to create a new partition, which also creates a new partition table. The command asks for parameters one by one:</p>
<ol>
<li>Partition number: because the disk doesn’t have any partitions yet, type 1 and press enter.</li>
<li>First sector: the partition starts from this sector. Leave it empty and press enter. The default value, which is the first free sector, is selected automatically.</li>
<li>Last Sector: it is where we indicate the required size of the partition. Type +2G, then press enter. Note that we can actually put the sector number, but this requires a further calculation to determine the exact sector that yields a partition of 2GB in size.</li>
<li>Partition file system: many filesystems are available. Keep the default value of “Linux filesystem” by leaving it empty and pressing enter.</li>
</ol>

<p>To see the change on the <code>sdb</code> device, use the command below:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="generic">lsblk /dev/sdb</pre>

<p>We can see that we have the <code>sdb</code> disk with 20 GB total size and two partitions of 2 GB. The <code>sdb</code> drive still has 16 GB of free space on which we can create more partitions later.</p>
<h2><span id="Filesystems"></span>Filesystems<span></span></h2>
<h3><span id="What_is_a_Filesystem"></span>What is a Filesystem?<span></span></h3>
<p>A Filesystem is built on top of a partition. A partition without a file system can be seen as just a long array of sectors.<code> </code>The filesystem is a logical abstraction layer that enables the creation of a hierarchy of files and directories.</p>
<p>There are many types of filesystems. The most widely used in Linux are ext4 and xfs. xfs is the default file system on modern Red Hat and CentOS distributions, while Ubuntu uses ext4.</p>
<h3><span id="Creating_a_Filesystem"></span>Creating a Filesystem<span></span></h3>
<p>Let’s continue with our example. We will create an xfs file system on the <code>sdb1</code> partition that we have already created. The command to make a filesystem is <code>mkfs</code>. It uses the -t argument to specify the filesystem type.</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="generic">mkfs -t xfs /dev/sdb1</pre>
<p><img width="979" height="261" src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-47.png" data-src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-47.png" data-srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-47.png 979w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-47-300x80.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-47-768x205.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px" srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-47.png 979w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-47-300x80.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-47-768x205.png 768w"></p>
<h3><span id="Mounting_a_Filesystem"></span>Mounting a Filesystem<span></span></h3>
<p>After creating the filesystem, we are one more step away from utilizing the partition storage space. That step is mounting.</p>
<p>Mounting a filesystem is the operation of linking the filesystem created on top of a partition to the system’s file hierarchy. It includes choosing a directory on the file hierarchy to host the filesystem built on the partition. This directory is called a mount point.</p>
<p>Let’s create a new mount point called “data” and mount the <code>sdb1</code> filesystem under <code>/data</code></p>
<p>To confirm the success of the mount operation, we can list all the mounted filesystems by using the command below:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="generic">mkdir /data
mount /dev/sdb1 /data
df -h</pre>
<p><img width="880" height="365" src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-48.png" data-src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-48.png" data-srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-48.png 880w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-48-300x124.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-48-768x319.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-48.png 880w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-48-300x124.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-48-768x319.png 768w"></p>
<p>The last line indicates that the filesystem has been mounted under <code>/data</code> directory. Now it can be used to store files. All files created under <code>/data</code> directory are stored in the <code>sdb1</code> partition.</p>
<p>Note that the xfs file system by default occupies some of the available space as metadata, which explains the used 33MB.</p>
<p>However, a manually created mount with the mount command does not survive a reboot. In most cases, the mount should last after a reboot. The mount parameters must be written in the file <code>/etc/fstab </code>to mount a partition persistently.</p>
<p><code>/etc/fstab</code> by default contains all the persistent mounts required by the system. The root user can further add user required mounts. Let’s see the content of this file:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="generic">cat /etc/fstab</pre>
<p><img width="880" height="281" src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-49.png" data-src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-49.png" data-srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-49.png 880w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-49-300x96.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-49-768x245.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-49.png 880w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-49-300x96.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-49-768x245.png 768w"></p>
<p>Each line in this file that doesn’t start with the hash character “#” corresponds to a mount, which is automatically created during the boot process. Each line contains 6 fields:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>Block device</code>: device file such as <code>/dev/sdb1</code>. Note that other device identifiers such as UUID also exist.</li>
<li><code>Mount point</code>.</li>
<li><code>Filesystem type</code>: xfs, ext4, vfat … etc.</li>
<li><code>Mount options</code>: these options are handed over to the mount command at boot. The value “defaults” is usually selected unless some different mount options are required.</li>
<li><code>Backup</code>: this field takes the value 1 to enable filesystem backup at boot or 0 to disable it. The backup is done by the <code>dump</code> utility. Most systems do not come with the dump program installed by default, so this field is usually set to 0.</li>
<li><code>Filesystem check</code>: this field takes the value 1 to enable filesystem check at boot or 0 to disable it. The filesystem check is done by the <code>fsck</code> command, which<code> </code>reports any inconsistencies or errors in the filesystem structure.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s add a line to persistenly mount the <code>/dev/sdb1</code> partition under the <code>/data</code> directory. You can edit the <code>/etc/fstab</code> directly or just append the line to the end of the file with the command below:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="generic">echo "/dev/sdb1 /data xfs defaults 0 0" &gt;&gt; /etc/fstab</pre>
<p>Use the cat command again to make sure the line was added successfully.</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="generic">cat /etc/fstab</pre>
<p><img width="880" height="305" src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-50.png" data-src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-50.png" data-srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-50.png 880w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-50-300x104.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-50-768x266.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-50.png 880w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-50-300x104.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-50-768x266.png 768w"></p>
<p>When a new line is added, the mount operation doesn’t occur unless the system is rebooted. To ensure the mount configuration is correct without rebooting, use the <code>mount</code> command with –a argument. ( -v for verbosity)</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="generic">mount -av</pre>
<p><img width="880" height="229" src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-51.png" data-src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-51.png" data-srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-51.png 880w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-51-300x78.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-51-768x200.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-51.png 880w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-51-300x78.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-51-768x200.png 768w"></p>
<p>The output indicates a successful mount. (Ignore the SELinux message)</p>
<p>The command mounts every line in <code>/etc/fstab</code> that is not mounted yet. After editing <code>/etc/fstab</code>, it is always recommended to use <code>mount -a</code>. Because if a typo or error exists in the file, the command reports an error and exits. If there is an undetected typo or issue in this file, the system will not boot correctly on the next restart.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		        
<p>On almost every product I’ve worked on, we’ve relied on a core group of active users to steer the development via great feedback and feature ideas. At Shapeways, <strong>most of our highly successful features came directly from our community.</strong> People who love your product are heavily invested in making it better. They will put in the time if you give them the space to do so and take their feedback seriously.</p>
<p>In this post I’ll share how teams have recruited, setup, and ran customer advisory councils (also called a customer advisory boards) that brought us a regular drip feed of high quality feedback. I’ll also share the mistakes we made along the way.</p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>To get the most relevant feedback, pick users who represent your target audience.</li>
<li>PM should start the council and run it for a few months then hand it off once it’s generating high quality feedback.</li>
<li>I recommend group / synchronous (e.g. video calls) sessions so you can ask follow-up questions and other users can chime in with their thoughts.</li>
<li>You should actually listen to their feedback (and implement it). Otherwise they will stop participating.</li>
<li>Bonus points if you can give them early access to features so they feel special (and you get early signal).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Why start an advisory council</h2>
<p>As your userbase grows, it becomes very challenging to understand what people actually think about your product. You’ll quickly get to a point where you are relying on data and expensive user research studies just to keep a pulse on what job people are hiring your product for and where it’s falling over. The beauty of an advisory council is that you don’t just get to hear from some of your best users, they’ll gather feedback on your behalf from other community members. It is by far the most effective way to start to get real stories from real users that are passionate about improving your product to meet their needs. I’m not suggesting that it’s the only signal you should care about, but it should be a tool in your toolbox alongside data and formal user studies.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of how advisory counciles drove impact:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.etsy.com/seller-handbook/article/introducing-etsys-2016-seller-advisory/37704589529">Etsy launched their ‘Seller Advisory Board’ in 2016</a> with 15 sellers picked from a pool of 600 applicants and asked them one simple question: “What’s the most important thing to your buyers?” After some deliberation the group agreed: the speed of the website. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCBMxCIgNcw">Video Interview</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://community.ebay.com/t5/Professional-eBay-Sellers/PESA-members-in-eBay-s-Voices-program/gpm-p/7829699">Ebay had a ‘Voices’ program where they fly out power users for a multi-day summit</a> filled with one-hour feedback sessions. Voices members were steering eBay feedback as early as 2000. <a href="https://www.ecommercebytes.com/C/abblog/blog.pl?/pl/2009/8/1250740707.html">The voices program was closed in 2009</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to start an advisory council</h2>
<p><strong>Identifying your council</strong></p>
<p>The first step is to identify who from your audience should join your council. You should start by defining who your target / mvp audience is and then filtering within that group. If you want to serve pro surfers from Australia, filter your userbase to that group and then look at their activity. <strong>You want users who are active, vocal, and constructive and represent your target audience.</strong> I typically will look at forums or customer service conversations to hand pick the first group. If your product has an interactive format (e.g. a game or a social media app), you should be able to spot folks using your product publicly. You want to avoid users who are constantly negative (they will drown out the voices of those who want to help) and have needs that are drastically different than one you plan to fulfill (e.g. if you are building a consumer 3d printing company for dog tags, you should include cat owners but not enterprise auto manufacturers).</p>
<p><strong>Recruiting members</strong></p>
<p>Reach out to each member and send them a personal e-mail or note. You need to make it clear that you’re handpicking them (so they feel special), that you value their input (so they feel wanted), and that you plan to involve them in the development process (so they feel like a part of the team). It’s important not to set expectations (e.g. we will ship your feature) because there’s a good chance you won’t use their feedback in the timeframe they expect. If you have a specific time commitment in mind or rewards you can offer (see '<a href="#council-love-you">How to get your council to love you</a>' below), make them known upfront. I strongly recommend avoiding any NDA’s if possible. Yes, you’re letting them behind the curtain of the developent process, but you should be able to keep any extreme trade secrets out of the way and you WANT them to tell their friends about how awesome it was to be a part of this. This is a great way to grow via word of mouth.</p>
<p><strong>Contacting members</strong></p>
<p>Don’t use fancy tools like mailing lists or contact forms to communicate with your council. These make it feel very formal and like they’re just on another mailing list. You want them to feel like part of the team. Either stick to e-mail or use something simple like a Facebook group or Slack channel that facilitates group interaction. Make sure each email sounds personal and use an e-mail address that supports reply-to so they can send you open ended questions or feedback. You’d be surprised how many great ideas start as a random email reply to an event invite.</p>
<p><strong>Who should run the council?</strong></p>
<p>There are a ton of upfront decisions that need to be made to ensure that you get good feedback that is useful to the product team. Because of this, I strongly recommend that the PM sets up the council along with any early processes and facilitation. This will ensure that you personally get value from the group. Once the process is humming and you’re regularly getting great feedback, you can hand it off to  I also suggest inviting at least your designer(s) and any eng that are product-minded. It’s more powerful to hear the ideas/feedback directly from the source than for you to proxy their comments.</p>
<h2>How to run the advisory council</h2>
<p>Ok, you’ve chosen your council and they’ve agreed to help. Now what do you actually do together?</p>
<p><strong>Structure and cadence</strong></p>
<p>There are a few options for how you run your council. You can choose between:</p>
<ul>
<li>Group vs. 1:1 setting</li>
<li>Synchronous vs. asynchronous</li>
<li>Scheduled vs. ad hoc</li>
<li>Video vs text</li>
<li>Structured vs unstructured</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://bdickason.com/static/posts/gather-great-feedback-from-power-users/lebowski.jpg">
<p><strong>I’ve found that getting as close to ‘a group of people sitting in the room shooting the shit’ as possible is key.</strong></p>
<p>I recommend a lightly structured synchronous group discussion over video. This allows you to facilitate in realtime and keep the vibe lighthearted (so it doesn’t feel like work) but still dig into meaty questions and hear multiple perspectives. To make this work, you’ll need to schedule time in advance and have a rough set of questions you want to cover as a starting point. You’ll also need to make sure that your team knows the ground rules: Can anyone ask questions? Are certain topics off limits? How do we talk about what’s in development right now?</p>
<p><strong>Facilitating the discussion</strong></p>
<p>When the discussion begins, people will look to you to lead it. Treat this like leading a meeting and assume that you need to drive the majority of the conversation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start the meeting with a loose agenda (e.g. “We will share a few recent feature developments to get your thoughts, we’ll then open the floor for Q&amp;A, we’ll leave 10 mins for you to ask questions”)</li>
<li>Make it clear when you’re calling on specific people vs when you want anyone to speak</li>
<li>Develop a protocol like ‘hand raising’ but online and try to enforce it. Many community members are going to be introverted and will get drowned out by the few talkative ones. Give everyone space.</li>
</ol>
<p>The most important part here is the Q&amp;A. You should come armed with a set of questions way too long for you to ever get through. They should typically have open ended answers (like most user research questions) and be very explicit. Try not to hand wave like “If we built a feature that kinda let you sorta do X, would you use it?” Instead focus on specific questions related to their workflow, their problems, and how they use your product.</p>
<p>One of the best questions I’ve asked is “What step of your workflow takes the longest and why?” <strong>(because it led to specific bottlenecks in our app that we could optimize)</strong> and one of the worst questions I’ve asked is “What is the one feature you want more than anything?” <strong>(because you will get a bunch of random not-thoughtful responses).</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://firstround.com/review/the-power-of-interviewing-customers-the-right-way-from-twitters-ex-vp-product/">Michael Sippy, VP Product at Twitter, keeps his sessions laser focused on problems</a>: <em>“The point is that we’re supposed to be solving a problem for people, and understanding that problem on a really fundamental level,” says Sippey. “Only then can you create a product that actually resonates with the market, and a business that can scale beyond any one feature.”</em></p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to let the discussion wander, let multiple community members answer the same question, or let them discuss amongst themselves. One member will often be inspired by another and share really helpful insights, so make sure you encourage the group to interact.</p>
<p>If you're struggling with this test, I suggest reading the book '<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mom-Test-customers-business-everyone/dp/1492180742">The Mom Test</a>' which gives a step by step guide to asking questions which will get at the pain point/problems customers are facing.</p>
<p><strong>Handling ideas during downtime</strong></p>
<p>When your council isn’t meeting, your community members will still have ideas and feedback. I’ve found that creating an asynchronous forum (e.g. Slack, Facebook group, etc.) can be useful for sporadic ideas so they don’t get lost. Try not to create a contract like “we will respond to your slack in 24h!” but your team does need to respond. If your users feel like they’re throwing their ideas into the ether, they won’t continue to do so. I typically will respond to the async forum once per day and then refer back to it when I am writing questions for the next get-together.</p>
<p>Asynchronous groups are great for getting quick answers to specific quetions. <a href="https://firstround.com/review/start-up-on-the-right-foot-build-a-customer-advisory-board/">TalentBin used their council for small data-driven asks</a>: <em>“We wanted to ask, 'What are the average contract values you guys sell?' and get a quick response, so we chose 10 of the people who have come to all our dinners and who we felt …</em></p></div></div>

<p>If you work with databases you are probably familiar with B-Tree indexes. They are used to enforce unique and primary-key constraints, and are the default index type in most database engines. If you work with text, geography or other complex types in PostgreSQL, you may have dipped your toes into GIN or GIST indexes. If you manage a read intensive database (or just follow this blog), you may also be familiar with BRIN indexes.</p>
<p>There is another type of index you are probably not using, and may have never even heard of. It is wildly unpopular, and until a few PostgreSQL versions ago it was highly discouraged and borderline unusable, but under some circumstances it can out-perform even a B-Tree index.</p>
<p><strong>In this article we re-introduce the Hash index in PostgreSQL!</strong></p>

<h2 id="hash-index"><a href="#hash-index">Hash Index</a></h2>
<p>Just like the name suggests, Hash indexes in PostgreSQL use a form of the hash table data structure. Hash table is a common data structure in many programming languages. For example, a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesmapping" rel="noopener">Dict</a> in Python, a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html" rel="noopener">HashMap</a> in Java or the new <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map" rel="noopener">Map</a> type in JavaScript.</p>
<p>To understand how you can benefit from Hash indexes, it's best to understand how they work.</p>
<h3 id="hash-function"><a href="#hash-function">Hash Function</a></h3>
<p>Hash indexes use a <em>hash function</em>. PostgreSQL's hash function maps any database value to a 32-bit integer, the <em>hash code</em> (about 4 billion possible hash codes). A good hash function can be computed quickly and "jumbles" the input uniformly across its entire range.</p>
<p>The hash codes are divided to a limited number of <em>buckets</em>. The buckets map the hash codes to the actual table rows.</p>

<figcaption>Hash Index</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A simple hash function for an integer type is modulo: divide a number by another number, and the remainder is the hash code. For example, to divide values across 3 buckets you can use the hash function <code>mod(3)</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>n</span><span>,</span> <span>mod</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>bucket</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>generate_series</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span>
<span> n  │ bucket</span>
<span>────┼────────</span>
<span>  1 │      1</span>
<span>  2 │      2</span>
<span>  3 │      0</span>
<span>  4 │      1</span>
<span>  5 │      2</span>
<span>  6 │      0</span>
<span>  7 │      1</span>
<span>  8 │      2</span>
<span>  9 │      0</span>
<span> 10 │      1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>When a new value is added to the index, PostgreSQL applies the hash function to the value and puts the hash code and a pointer to the tuple in the appropriate bucket. In the example above using the hash function <code>mod(3)</code>, if you insert the value <code>5</code> the index entry will be added to bucket <code>2</code>, because <code>5 % 3 = 2</code>.</p>
<p>When you query a value using a Hash index, PostgreSQL does the opposite. It takes the value and applies the hash function to determine which bucket may hold matching tuples. Once the bucket is identified, PostgreSQL will fetch the tuples referenced in that bucket and match them against your query.</p>
<h3 id="hash-collision"><a href="#hash-collision">Hash Collision</a></h3>
<p>You may have noticed that multiple values can map to the same bucket; this is called a <em>collision</em>. For example, the hash function <code>mod(3)</code> returned the hash code <code>2</code> for the values <code>2</code>, <code>5</code> and <code>8</code>.</p>
<p>What PostgreSQL actually does, is to first use a hash function to produce an integer hash code:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span>
    <span>hashtext</span><span>(</span><span>'text'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>hashchar</span><span>(</span><span>'c'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>hash_array</span><span>(</span><span>array</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>]),</span>
    <span>jsonb_hash</span><span>(</span><span>'{"me": "haki"}'</span><span>::</span><span>jsonb</span><span>),</span>
    <span>timestamp_hash</span><span>(</span><span>now</span><span>()</span><span>::</span><span>timestamp</span><span>);</span>

<span>─[ RECORD 1 ]──┬────────────</span>
<span>hashtext       │ -451854347</span>
<span>hashchar       │ 203891234</span>
<span>hash_array     │ -325393530</span>
<span>jsonb_hash     │ -1784498999</span>
<span>timestamp_hash │ 1082344883</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It then uses <code>mod(n_buckets)</code> to determine which bucket the tuple should be put in. This can cause multiple values to end up in the same bucket. This is why even after the bucket is identified, the database still needs to sift through the hash codes in the bucket and recheck the condition to filter only the matching tuples.</p>

<figcaption>Hash Index overflow pages</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As rows are added to the index, it's possible for a bucket's primary page to fill up. In this case, additional rows are written to overflow pages. The overflow pages contain index entries that did not fit in the bucket's primary page.</p>
<h3 id="index-split"><a href="#index-split">Index Split</a></h3>
<p>At some point, the database can decide it needs to split a bucket into two buckets. PostgreSQL uses special hash functions that ensure values in a bucket can be split into exactly two buckets. When a bucket is split, additional storage is allocated to the index.</p>

<p>Luckily, PostgreSQL does all the heavy lifting for you, so you don't have to decide what hash function to use, or how many buckets there are.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about the internals of Hash indexes in PostgreSQL, check out the <a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/backend/access/hash/README" rel="noopener">readme on "Hash Indexing"</a>.</p>

<p>Hash indexes were discouraged prior to PostgreSQL 10. If you read the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/indexes-types.html" rel="noopener">index type documentation for PostgreSQL 9.6</a> you'll find a nasty warning about Hash indexes. According to the warning, Hash indexes are not written to the WAL so they cannot be maintained in replicas, and they are not automatically available after a crash, so you need to manually rebuild them.</p>
<p>Starting at PostgreSQL 10 these limitations were resolved, and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/release-10.html#id-1.11.6.20.5.3.3" rel="noopener">Hash indexes are no longer discouraged</a>.</p>
<h3 id="creating-hash-indexes"><a href="#creating-hash-indexes">Creating Hash Indexes</a></h3>
<p>Now that you know how Hash indexes work in PostgreSQL, you are ready to see them in action. To illustrate, we'll create an imaginary URL shortening service.</p>
<p>A URL shortener service, such as "bit.ly" or the late "goo.gl", provides a short random URL that points to a longer URL. For example, you can have the short url <code>https://short.url/hb9837</code> point to the longer URL <code>https://hakibenita.com/automating-the-boring-stuff-in-django-using-the-check-framework</code>. We'll call the <code>hb9837</code> part of the short URL the <code>key</code>.</p>
<p>To implement your URL shortening service, create a table to store the mapping between the keys and the full URLs:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>id</span> <span>serial</span> <span>primary</span> <span>key</span><span>,</span>
    <span>key</span> <span>text</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span><span>,</span>
    <span>url</span> <span>text</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span>
<span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The table includes an auto incrementing primary key <code>id</code>, a text field for <code>key</code>, and a <code>url</code> field containing the full URL.</p>
<p>Next, create a B-Tree and a Hash index on both fields:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>shorturl_key_hash_index</span> <span>ON</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>USING</span> <span>hash</span><span>(</span><span>key</span><span>);</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>UNIQUE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>shorturl_key_btree_index</span> <span>ON</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>USING</span> <span>btree</span><span>(</span><span>key</span><span>);</span>

<span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>shorturl_url_hash_index</span> <span>ON</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>USING</span> <span>hash</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>);</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>shorturl_url_btree_index</span> <span>ON</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>USING</span> <span>btree</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You might have noticed that the B-Tree on <code>key</code> is a unique index, but the Hash index is not. This is because Hash indexes currently cannot be used to enforce unique constraints.</p>
<h3 id="hash-index-size"><a href="#hash-index-size">Hash Index Size</a></h3>
<p>The first thing you want to do is to compare the size of a Hash index to the size of a similar B-Tree index:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>EXTENSION</span> <span>"uuid-ossp"</span><span>;</span>

<span>DO</span> <span>$$</span>

    <span>END</span> <span>LOOP</span><span>;</span>
<span>END</span><span>;</span>
<span>$$</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To get a better sense of how both indexes behave, keep track of the size of the indexes as rows are inserted to the table:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate 1,000,000 short urls one by one</li>
<li>Every 10,000 rows log the size of all four indexes</li>
<li>Use <code>uuid_generate_v4</code> from the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/uuid-ossp.html" rel="noopener">uuid-ossp</a> package to generate UUIDs as keys</li>
<li>Generate a long URL from a 6-digit domain so it's not unique, but almost unique</li>
</ul>
<p>Running the script on PostgreSQL 13 and plotting the results gives the following chart:</p>
<figure><img alt="Hash vs. B-Tree index size" src="https://hakibenita.com/images/01-postgresql-hash-index.png"><figcaption>Hash vs. B-Tree index size</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The chart provides several interesting observations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Hash index is smaller than the B-Tree index</strong>: Almost all along the way, the Hash index on both fields is smaller than the size of the corresponding B-Tree index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hash index grows in increments</strong>: Unlike the B-Tree index that seems to grow linearlly as rows are inserted to the table, the Hash index grows in sudden increments. These sudden increments are caused when a split is triggered to allocate space for more buckets. When that space runs out, another split is triggered and so on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hash index size is not affected by the size of the indexed value</strong>: A Hash index stores the hash codes of the index field values. A B-Tree on the other hand, stores the actual value of the indexed field in its leaves, so the size of the indexed value affects the size of a B-Tree index, but not the size of a Hash index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hash index size is not affected by the selectivity of the indexed value</strong>: The selectivity of the URL field is different than that of the key field, which is almost unique, but the Hash index on both fields is the same size. A size of a B-Tree index on the other hand, can vary based on the selectivity of the data (see note below about "B-Tree deduplication").</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div>
<p>B-Tree deduplication</p>
<p>PostgreSQL 13 introduced a new <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/btree-implementation.html#BTREE-DEDUPLICATION" rel="noopener">B-Tree deduplication</a> mechanism that reduces the size of a B-Tree indexes with many duplicate values. In the chart above, the size of the B-Tree index on the <code>url</code> field is smaller than the size of the index on the <code>key</code> field because it has fewer unique values.</p>
<figure><img alt="Hash vs. B-Tree index size on PostgreSQL 12" src="https://hakibenita.com/images/02-postgresql-hash-index.png"><figcaption>Hash vs. B-Tree index size on PostgreSQL 12</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you run the same script with deduplication disabled, or on PostgreSQL versions prior to 13, you'll see that the size of the index is the same (as long as values are the same size).</p>
</div>
<p>The script you ran before imitates a workload of an OLTP-like system, where single rows are constantly being added to the table. This is the size of the indexes after the script finished:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>\di+</span> <span>shorturl*</span>
<span>          Name           │ Type  │ Table    │Size</span>

<![CDATA[Hacking Bitcoin Wallets Through JSON Parser Bugs]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I didn’t steal any bitcoin. I’ve reported it to the appropriate company and they were shocked at how a bug this simple could have left their wallets empty.
Using different libraries to parse formats like JSON is a bad idea and can expose you to a type of attack that relies on different interpretations of the content by each parser. The microservice pattern introduces the ability to use amalgation of programming languages, but that typically also means differences in parsers.</p>


<p>There’s a lot of love for the microservice pattern and rightfully so. In essence, the microservice pattern tends to lead to greater seperation of privileges and access.
The code that decodes media objects such as videos and images runs in its own microservice, seperating it from the code that can access the database storing your VISA card credentials for example.</p>

<p>But the advocacy for the microservice pattern isn’t only coming from the security perspective.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The microservices architecture allowed Netflix to greatly speed up development and deployment of its platform and services. The company was able to build and test global services on a large scale without impacting the current system and they could quickly rollback if there were problems. The microservices architecture also allowed Netflix to create about 30+ independent engineering teams that could work on different release schedules which helped increase the agility and productivity of the development process. [0]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The main driver for organisations to adopt the microservice pattern is to enable faster development and deployments because each team operates more independently.
Every team can pick their own stack (language, libraries, etc..) to use in order to optimize their particular workload.</p>


<p>I consider it to be a better pattern than the monolith if applied correctly.
But the step back is that it may breath new life into an age-old security bug: parser differences.</p>

<p>Here’s my advice for anyone out there building microservices:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The JSON format leaves gaps for interpretation so make sure that all parsers across all microservices are using a single way to interpret the content.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you don’t quite catch what I’m trying to explain, here’s an example:</p>
<pre><code>{
    "method": "sendtoaddress",
    "method": "listtransactions",
    "params": [...]
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how the <code>method</code> key is presented twice in this JSON payload, but which method of the two will it eventually execute?
This the gap for interpretation that parsers silently deal with. This rather silent assumption can be a great attack vector.</p>

<p>Can we abuse the difference in interpretation by parser X used in microservice 1, which feeds data to parser Y in microservice 2?</p>



<p>This is an actual bugreport that I’ve submitted to a business that operates cryptocurrency nodes that a customer can rent.
But one of their options allows exposing a limited interface of <code>bitcoind</code>, behind a custom firewall that blocks sensitive methods.</p>
<pre><code>USER   ----&gt; [ FIREWALL ]    ----&gt;    [ bitcoind ]
</code></pre>

<p>The firewall microservice maintained a whitelist of methods (<code>getblock</code>, etc..) which was supposed to reject attempts to execute senstitive or malicious commands.
If it passed the filter, it would then pass the <em>COMPLETE</em> payload to the <code>bitcoind</code> daemon, which would then execute and return the results.</p>

<p>Here’s an overview to two parsers at play:</p>
<ul>
  <li>firewall: LIFO (OpenResty from <strong>Lua</strong>)</li>
  <li>bitcoind: FIFO (Boost (?) json parser from <strong>C++</strong>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s for example attempt to get the balance of the bitcoind node:</p>
<pre><code>{
    "method": "getbalance"
}
</code></pre>

<p>We are met with the following response:</p>
<pre><code>403 Forbidden
</code></pre>

<p>At this point I wondered whether we could bypass it, and naturally the first idea that I could come up with was setting it twice.</p>
<pre><code>{
    "method": "getblock",
    "method": "getbalance"
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code>403 Forbidden
</code></pre>
<p>It failed, but luckily I attempted to switch them around, just to be sure.
This time we hit the jackpot!</p>

<pre><code>{
    "method": "getbalance",
    "method": "getblock"
}
</code></pre>
<p>It returns the getbalance information instead of the error!</p>
<pre><code>{
    "result": 5.35784803,
    "error": null,
    "id": null
}
</code></pre>

<p>The firewall is using a <code>LIFO</code> style parser, which returned <code>getblock</code> as the value of the key <code>method</code>. It accepted the request as valid and forwarded it to the <code>bitcoind</code> daemon which uses a <code>FIFO</code> style parser resulting in <code>getbalance</code> to be used as the value of the key <code>method</code></p>

<p>Nice.</p>

      <p>
        Web Monetization is an API that allows websites to request small
        payments from users facilitated by the browser and the user's Web
        Monetization provider.

        <p>
          This specification is a work in progress within the community on the
          best shape it should take. Please see the
          <a href="https://webmonetization.org/docs/explainer.html">explainer</a> for more info.
        </p>
        <p>
          The specification reflects the desired end-state of the Web Monetization
          APIs as currently anticipated and agreed to between the contributors.
          The specification is being prepared here, in this format, to collect the
          input of the Web community and prepare the work to ultimately follow the
          W3C standards track should it have the necessary support to do so.

    <section id="relation-to-other-protocols">
      <h2>Relation to other protocols</h2>
      <p>
        The W3C have published two payments related APIs for browsers, the
        [[[payment-Request]]] and the [[[Payment-Handler]]].
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason this API is not using the [[[payment-Request]]] directly is
        that Web Monetization is intended for continuous payments rather than
        discrete payments. It is also designed to <em>not</em> have any user
        interaction: It is intended to provide a direct alternative to
        advertisements, rather than an alternative to traditional e-commerce
        checkout methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        In future, some changes will be required to the [[[payment-Request]]]
        and the [[[Payment-Handler]]] to support Web Monetization. This API
        brings the necessary capabilities to user agents in a manner that can
        integrate with existing payments APIs.
      </p>
      <p>
        With advertisements, the user agent decides whether to display the ads
        and the user decides whether to engage with the ads. With Web
        Monetization, the user's provider decides whether to pay the site and,
        if so, how much to pay.
      </p>
      <p>
        Web Monetization makes use of
        <abbr title="Simple Payment Setup Protocol">SPSP</abbr> on top of
        <abbr title="Interledger Protocol">ILP</abbr>/[[[STREAM]]] to provide a
        high-level way to send money and data, while still providing tremendous
        flexibility.

              The <a>user agent</a> generates a fresh
              <strong>random</strong> UUID (version 4) and uses this as a
              Monetization ID. This MUST be regenerated upon dynamic changes to
              the meta tags and MUST be unique per page load in order to avoid
              user tracking.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <a>user agent</a> passes these payment details to the user's

            <li>
              The provider resolves the Payment Setup Endpoint and begins to
              pay. The provider MAY be acting from a different machine from the
              user. Cookies and session information MUST NOT be carried with any
              requests made to resolve the Payment Setup Endpoint, with the
              exception of the Monetization ID.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  With the <code>destination_account</code> and
                  <code>shared_secret</code> fetched from the SPSP query, a
                  [[[STREAM]]] connection is established. A single [[[STREAM]]]
                  is opened on this connection, and a positive SendMax is set.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The provider SHOULD set their SendMax high enough that it is
                  never reached, and make payment adjustments by limiting
                  throughput.
                </li>

            <li>
              Once the [[[STREAM]]] connection has fulfilled an ILP packet with
              a non-zero amount, the provider notifies the browser:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The <a>user agent</a> sets
                  <code>document.monetization.state</code> to
                  <code>started</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This MUST occur before the `start` event is fired.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This event is a {{ MonetizationStartEvent }}
                  containing the Payment Setup Endpoint and the Monetization ID
                  as properties.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The <a>user agent</a> also emits a {{ progress }} event from
                  <code>document.monetization</code>, corresponding to this
                  first packet.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Payment continues for the lifetime of a given meta tag (or
              semantically equivalent)
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The provider MAY decide to stop/start payment at any time,
                  e.g. if the user is idle, backgrounds the page, or instructs
                  the browser to do so.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the [[[STREAM]]] connection is severed, the provider will
                  redo the SPSP query to the same Payment Setup Endpoint as
                  before with the same Monetization ID. The <a>user agent</a>
                  MUST NOT re-process the `&lt;meta&gt;` Tags Set.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each time a packet with a non-zero amount is fulfilled, the
                  provider notifies the browser, and the browser emits a
                  {{ MonetizationProgressEvent }}
                  on
                  <code>document.monetization</code>. The event has details of
                  the packet.

                <li>
                  When a stream is closed the
                  <code>document.monetization.state</code> MUST be set back to

      <h3 id="payment-handler-flow">Payment Handler Flow</h3>
      <p>
        A provider can be implemented as a Payment Handler supporting the
        'webmonetization' payment method (The payment method specification for
        this payment method is still under development as it is dependant on
        changes to the Payment Handler API that support streaming payments).
        Communication between the browser and the provider would use this flow.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          After parsing the `&lt;meta&gt;` Tags Set, the browser creates a new
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#paymentrequest-interface">PaymentRequest</a>
          object with the following
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#dom-paymentmethoddata">PaymentMethodData</a>
          argument.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <pre>        {
          "supportedMethods": "webmonetization",
          "data": {
            "paymentPointer": "&lt;payment pointer parsed from meta tag&gt;"
          }
        }
      </pre>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The <a>user agent</a> calls <code>.show()</code> on this
          PaymentRequest, triggering the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-handler/">PaymentHandler</a>
          for <code>webmonetization</code>. This PaymentHandler is how the
          browser communicates to the provider.
          <ul>
            <li>
              The return value of <code>.show()</code> MUST return a Promise,
              and must also implement the {{ EventTarget }}
              interface. The provider will emit
              {{ MonetizationStartEvent }} and
              {{ MonetizationProgressEvent }} events from this Promise to
              communicate to the browser when payment occurs. The Promise MUST
              NOT resolve, because Web Monetization continues for the entire
              lifetime of a given meta tag. The Promise MAY reject if there is
              an error preventing the …</li></ul></li></ul></section></div>

                <section>
                    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Document management is a core requirement for all sorts of regulated institutions - finance, telecom, healthcare, government and others. These institutions need to manage and retain an ever growing number of documents and regulatory guidelines often require these documents to be stored for a very long term (7-10 years). <br></p><p>Take for example, KYC (Know Your Customer) documents. Anyone starting a relationship with a financial institution needs to provide KYC documents. These documents are then stored with the institution as long as the relationship exists and even beyond that for several years. <br></p><p>Traditional document management systems are simply no longer able to provide the scale, cost efficiency and reliability that such use cases require. This has triggered the move to modern, cloud native solutions. <br></p><p>In this document we go through various challenges with traditional document management solutions and then look at the next generation solutions that some of our customers have developed.</p><h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2><h3 id="closed-monolith">Closed Monolith</h3><p>Traditional document management systems are monolithic, closed systems. This means IT teams can not take advantage of new paradigms like segregation of concerns (i.e. microservices), API access, disaggregating storage and compute, among others. Adding features or scaling such systems simply means paying for new licenses. <br></p><p>Additionally, these systems are built as blackboxes with little to no extensionsibility. So, the IT teams have to work around these tools to achieve their intended workflow.</p><h3 id="limited-system-integration-capabilities">Limited System Integration Capabilities</h3><p>Traditional Document management systems are inherently closed, with little to no API integration to plug into external systems, or plugin other tools. This creates a vendor lock-in, higher the number of documents a system manages, the tougher it becomes to get rid of the system.<br></p><p>This is orthogonal to the modern approach of native API integrations with other systems to build powerful features by composition of tools and technologies..</p><h3 id="scalability">Scalability</h3><p>Typical document management systems use databases combined with file systems. Both databases and file systems are well known to have difficulties in handling large data volumes. The scalability challenges in the underlying database and file system, invariably show up as the number of documents grows. <br></p><h2 id="solution">Solution</h2><p>Documents are essentially unstructured blobs of varying formats and sizes, ideal for object storage platforms like MinIO. With seamless scalability, API integration with major modern data platforms to enable search, audit logs and other important features, MinIO fits right in. <br></p><p>Here we propose a highly scalable approach to build a modern, cloud-native document store.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/cRg4-T5csoo6bC4Tu3wJgsPN8Q5gtYPInRokwDfZTQOOxLl3DCXtf6LA__Wzv-8ZMcCGjZAvJy_x367ASBi0QbEtd-BtiiqJ7xI3a7vW8c3NQOQFw5Vy72Jamzg9x2jKdsO8ueqm" alt=""></figure><p>Let’s take a closer look at the architecture, its components and their interaction:<br></p><ul><li><strong>Frontend:</strong> Modern JS based frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, or Svelte provide a great starting point for building the frontend for enterprise applications like this. Since all these frameworks are API driven, it is quite easy to integrate these with backend, special purpose applications like Identity and Access Management, DB, Object Storage among others. <br></li><li><strong><strong><strong>Text/Metadata Search: </strong></strong></strong>A<strong> </strong>key requirement for a document management system is to allow searching the whole document catalog for specific documents. This search may be based on document metadata (like owner-name, owner-id, document-type etc), or even based on contents of the document itself. Either way, any document metadata can be sent to text search tools like <a href="https://www.meilisearch.com/">MeiliSearch</a>, <a href="https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack">Elastic</a>. <p>Essentially, MinIO can be <a href="https://docs.minio.io/docs/minio-bucket-notification-guide.html">configured to send out event notifications</a> (with object metadata) to the text search platform. This way, the search platform then has all the document metadata and a link to the actual document in MinIO. The frontend can then send the user query the text search platform and fetch the relevant document.</p><p>Apart from simple text search, the object data and metadata from MinIO can be fed to Machine Learning pipelines as explained in <a href="https://blog.min.io/hyper-scale-machine-learning-with-minio-and-tensorflow/">this blog post</a>. This opens up opportunities to analyse and understand not only the metadata but also the actual documents, opening up business insights for the teams to leverage.</p></li><li><strong><strong><strong>Webhook: </strong></strong></strong>Customer documents are secure and private objects, it is very important for the compliance or audit teams to ensure that a detailed audit log of the document is maintained. <p>MinIO can be <a href="https://github.com/minio/minio/tree/master/docs/logging#audit-targets">integrated with various target systems</a> to send out audit logs. MinIO webhook integration allows seamless integration with any platform that supports webhooks, while removing dependency from message queue type systems. </p><p>Additionally, MinIO ensures that events missed while the remote webook target is offline are delivered later, as and when the target comes back online. Events pending for delivery are stored securely on MinIO, making sure that the audit log doesn’t miss any entry.</p></li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Object Storage:</strong> This is the backbone of the whole system. It provides scalable, persistent storage for documents (and their multiple versions), related metadata, user-access policies among other information. There are several unique advantages with a MinIO object storage vs. generic or legacy solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ILM based Tiering &amp; Archival: Lifecycle management feature allows automatically moving data from one storage tier to another (e.g. Warm/Hot to Archival) or even expire certain objects after they are no longer required.	This allows IT teams to ensure that only the frequently accessed documents are kept in the fast tier, while the other, infrequently accessed documents are moved to archival tier which potentially uses cost effective hardware allowing almost limitless storage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Active-Active replication: High availability and protection from data loss is critical for document management systems. MinIO Active-Active replication comes in handy here. Users can configure the MinIO cluster to replicate objects to a remote MinIO cluster. This means IT teams can leverage a 2 DC approach to ensure data is safe from a complete DC failure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cohasset certified object locking &amp; object retention: MinIO object retention and locking capabilities are certified by Cohasset. This means IT teams can be sure that MinIO software is complaint to the the appropriate regulator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Document versions: MinIO object versioning allows seamless storage of multiple versions of a document. This  maps very well to real life situations where customers may need to provide new documents due to issues in older versions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2><div><p>Document management is not immune to the advancements in cloud technologies, microservices and API-driven development. Having said that, compliance, particularly regulatory compliance does cause innovation to lag. The trend we are seeing today, however, is that major financial institutions are moving toward a model where object storage serves as the foundational element in KYC architectures. </p><p>Modern object storage is scalable, resilient, performant and in the case of MinIO, certified for object locking and retention. </p><p>We think this modern architecture is the optimal approach for regulated institutions like finance, telecom, healthcare, government. </p><p>And this is why all ten of the largest banks in the US run MinIO and eight of the ten largest banks in Europe run MinIO. </p><p>To learn more, reach out to us at <a href="mailto:hello@min.io">hello@min.io</a> and we can go into more detail than we can publicly.</p></div>

  <p>Dear Professor,</p>

  <p>I’m quite confused about the mark that came out on moodle on May.29th. I recalled getting 90 100 100 respectively for those three separate tasks during the face to face assessment, but the final mark turns out to be only 70. I remembered that the uploaded code check is said to be only a precaution check and wouldn’t have much effect on the final mark.</p>

  <p>Besides, I’m also baffled about that ‘Suspect of copying’ comment. I can assure you that I wrote all the code on my own without any help from other people or any unauthorized reference to other people’s work. Java Programming module is my favorite among all second-year courses. A lot of my time and effort is dedicated to these assignments in order to make the code as perfect as possible, and I have enjoyed every second of it. Therefore, it really hurts when I’m being regarded as suspect of copying. I’m writing this email to humbly ask for more clarification on this feedback as well as the reason why such a low score is received.</p>

  <p>Yours Sincerely,</p>

  <p>Shengwei [redacted]</p>

  <p>Dear Shengwei,</p>

  <p>The mark was decided by your marker Tom [redacted] (cc’ed).
It is true that the lab examination mark was 90 but then your
marker decided to drop to 70 upon examining your code.</p>

  <p>The key reason your source files have as first line
“package com.nicolaspepe;” which certainly raises a few eyebrows
re possible copying.</p>

  <p>Hi George,</p>

  <p>I just had a look again and since there is no other student called Nicholas Pepe, and, since I have just now realised that Nicholas Pepe is a professional footballer for Arsenal, I am willing to believe that the package name is due to the student typing in a random name when configuring the IDE, and not a result of cheating. I’ll have another look at the code and let you know.</p>

  <p>Sorry about this!</p>

  <p>Best wishes,</p>

  <p>Hi Shengwei,</p>

  <p>I’ve just had another look at your assignment. The code was generally good, well commented and demonstrated an understanding of polymorphism. You should avoid using generic classes such as Object in method declarations (use ListNode instead), but otherwise the code is fine.</p>

  <p>The reason you were given a low mark is because of the line “package com.nicholaspepe”, which implied to me that the work was plagiarised from another student - generally package names contain the person or company who wrote the code (for instance, com.johnsmith, or com.ucl.ee). However if you can explain why you have called your package “com.nicholaspepe” then I will review the mark.</p>

  <p>Best wishes,</p>

  <p>Dear [Tom],</p>

  <p>Back in August 2019 when I started learning Java, I took an online Java tutorial, saying that you can name the package with your own name or the name of a corporation. As a fan of Arsenal Football Club (the one located in North London Islington), I was really pumped at that time with the club’s record-breaking signing “Nicolas Pepe”, an Ivorian coast winger from the French Top Division. So, I decided to improvise a little bit and name my first package on IntelliJ as “com.nicolaspepe”.</p>

  <p>Since all my Java projects in year 2 are created under this package, the package name appearing at the start of all assignments is thus “com.nicolaspepe”. You can have a check on my assignment 2 code and the package name is still Nicolas Pepe. I’ve enclosed some more information regarding this footballer, and I hope that it’s useful in convincing you of my innocence.</p>

  <p>Yours Sincerely,</p>
