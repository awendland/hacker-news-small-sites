Meanwhile, SIGMA Corporation, a&nbsp;Japanese family company, combined in a&nbsp;remarkable way modern technologies with a&nbsp;traditional approach to doing business. This management model has perfectly proven its worth during the current crisis.</p><div><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__6"><mark>POLSKOJĘZYCZNA WERSJA TEGO ARTYKUŁU » » »</mark></p><div><div><p><span><span>Tomasz Kulas <span>PL</span></span>, <span>Kazuto Yamaki </span></span></p><p>W ostatnich latach najpopularniejszą receptą na pojawiające się niespodziewane wyzwania stało się zwinne zarządzanie, wzorowane na nowoczesnych firmach ery cyfrowej. Tymczasem japońska firma rodzinna SIGMA Corporation w&nbsp;niezwykły sposób połączyła zaawansowane technologie z&nbsp;tradycyjnym podejściem do prowadzenia biznesu. Ten model zarządzania doskonale sprawdził się podczas obecnego kryzysu.</p></div><a href="https://www.ican.pl/a/DTqxlEZNz"><picture><img src="https://cdn.ican.pl/minimized/v2/360xAxA/reader-files/book/PQqjAvKR9/DTqxlEZNz/39/cover.jpg"></picture></a></div></div><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__9">Even before I&nbsp;took over management from my father, SIGMA faced an enormous challenge of rising manufacturing costs. When we were launching our operations, manufacturing in Japan was relatively cheap compared to other countries, thus we could produce everything we wanted at home – and export our products at competitive prices abroad. However, along with the rise of standard of living in Japan, production costs have also been rising. This is why in the 90s almost all Japanese manufacturers of photography equipment decided to relocate manufacturing abroad.</p><figure data-resource-id="RXrRoI5RCAwtB" data-id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__A"><div href="https://cdn.ican.pl/f/res-minimized/RXrRoI5RCAwtB/1607959888/qgMd47upElbJX4rfHXLSKtVq6jIrXdpY.jpg" data-lightbox="5ffebfe19ebf5" data-title="<div class=&quot;figcaption_content&quot;></div>"><picture><img src="https://cdn.ican.pl/f/res-minimized/RXrRoI5RCAwtB/1607959888/qgMd47upElbJX4rfHXLSKtVq6jIrXdpY.jpg" title="" alt="The Path of the Little Samurai"></picture></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__B"><em><span>Indeks górny <strong>Kazuto Yamaki</strong>, CEO, SIGMA Corporation. Indeks górny koniec</span></em></p><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__F">At that time, SIGMA owned one factory only, located in Japan, in Fukushima Prefecture. We made a&nbsp;key decision then that production should stay at home. This is why we began to look for a&nbsp;solution that would still make it profitable. One of possible solutions would be to try to further lower radically the production costs, while another one would be to markedly raise the quality of our products, which would allow us to sell them at higher prices.&nbsp; We chose the second option, and I&nbsp;made all the employees aware that it’s the only way for SIGMA to survive.</p><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__H"><em>In fact, I&nbsp;believe I&nbsp;have been lucky, as essentially we had no choice and there was nothing to think about. The thing was simple – product quality improvement was a&nbsp;must, if SIGMA was to survive.</em>&nbsp;<em>There was no other option.</em></p><h2 id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__2Y">Culture of engagement </h2><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__L">The one wonderful thing handed over to me by my father was the culture of collaboration within the company. All, really all of the employees understood what changes needed to be introduced and worked with high commitment to execute this new, quality‑based course of company development. I&nbsp;believe that also now, when many of our competitors can afford to offer their products at lower prices, as they have lower production costs, what distinguishes us is the level of commitment of our employees. They identify incredibly strongly with the company, while being at the same time really passionate about photography and about what they are doing.</p><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__M">This difference may not be obvious to everybody, but it is key for us and determines our competitive advantage. If you are passionate about photography and manufacture photography equipment, at the same time to a&nbsp;highest possible degree you know what your customers need – as they are passionate about the same thing. This is the foundation on which we build customers’ trust for our company. To our advantage, it is impossible to launch production of highest class lenses overnight, as it requires not only the best technologies, but also many years of experience. This experience and commitment constitute our advantages and I&nbsp;believe, although of course I&nbsp;cannot be sure of that, that in spite of radical external changes that have taken place recently, they will allow us to continue operating under the current business model.</p><h2 id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__2Z">Resilience in the times of crisis </h2><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__O">Many company CEOs are currently facing the challenge of falling employee commitment. These CEOs are treated by these employees as “outside people” – professional managers whose task is about efficient management, no matter whom they manage and what&nbsp;the company does. However, my path was different, as I&nbsp;didn’t just take over the company from my father and didn’t just begin managing it.</p><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__Q"><em>Right after graduation, I&nbsp;began to work at&nbsp; SIGMA&nbsp;at various different positions and in different departments – and it took almost twenty years.</em></p><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__S">At that time, I&nbsp;met most of the people in various operational areas – designers, engineers, factory workers, business development, marketing and sales people. Of key importance was the fact that when I&nbsp;became the CEO, I&nbsp;already knew the people who worked there – and they knew me. Many of them, for that matter, have worked in a&nbsp;company for a&nbsp;dozen or a&nbsp;few dozen years.</p><div><h3 id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__U">What does SIGMA Corporation do </h3><div><figure data-resource-id="R3WDWqaCWgAk3" data-id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__V"><div href="https://cdn.ican.pl/f/res-minimized/R3WDWqaCWgAk3/1607959888/LtSolsFPkutnuWbxILvU3dM57NyPlZQd.jpg" data-lightbox="5ffebfe1a03d4" data-title="<div class=&quot;figcaption_content&quot;></div>"><picture><img src="https://cdn.ican.pl/f/res-minimized/R3WDWqaCWgAk3/1607959888/LtSolsFPkutnuWbxILvU3dM57NyPlZQd.jpg" title="" alt="The Path of the Little Samurai"></picture></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__W">SIGMA Corporation is a&nbsp;Japanese family company, known first of all as one of the major global camera lens manufacturers. It also makes digital cameras, flash lamps and other photography accessories, but it’s the lenses for the photo and video interchangeable‑lens cameras constitute its core business. It&nbsp;was founded in 1961 by Michihiro Yamaki, and since 2012 its CEO and owner has been his son, Kazuto Yamaki.</p><figure data-resource-id="R2vuVZQ7kFZ9d" data-id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__X"><div href="https://cdn.ican.pl/f/res-minimized/R2vuVZQ7kFZ9d/1607959889/1dU52bYZ0v03IquPigz4WvYdvEb1pv6o.jpg" data-lightbox="5ffebfe1a153f" data-title="<div class=&quot;figcaption_content&quot;></div>"><picture><img src="https://cdn.ican.pl/f/res-minimized/R2vuVZQ7kFZ9d/1607959889/1dU52bYZ0v03IquPigz4WvYdvEb1pv6o.jpg" title="" alt="The Path of the Little Samurai"></picture></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__Y">Currently, the company employs 1,725 persons, with annual turnover (as of August 2019) at ca. PLN 1.4 billion. Company headquarters is located in the suburbs of Tokyo. The entire manufacturing is also located in Japan – in SIGMA‑owned Aizu factory, located in a&nbsp;small town of Bandai. Outside Japan, the company owns subsidiaries operating in North America, China, France, Hong Kong, Benelux countries, Germany and the UK. SIGMA Corporation products are officially sold and distributed in over 70 countries.</p></div><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__Z">I&nbsp;believe that, for that matter, this is where the advantage of family companies is. Since being a&nbsp;kid I&nbsp;had been learning and growing into the organization, as our apartment was located on the last floor of the headquarters building of our company. <strong>Since being six‑seven years old, I&nbsp;had been meeting in a&nbsp;natural way many people who had worked at SIGMA</strong>, and my life was developing along with the growth of the company. This is why it was something natural that when I&nbsp;took over the management, employees tried as hard as they could to help me in performing the new role and in further growing the company.</p><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__11">This traditional, family‑based managerial model turned out, in recent months, very resilient against the challenges the pandemic brought. In spite of SIGMA being a&nbsp;global operation, we are a&nbsp;relatively small company, thus it has been easier for individual people to understand the threats we are being faced with – and commit even more to helping the company and other co‑workers.</p><figure data-resource-id="RCQjHUyFdLfkh" data-id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__12"><div href="https://cdn.ican.pl/f/res-minimized/RCQjHUyFdLfkh/1607959889/2LT1u5yj0xYhOujlip44SUH9weZKigkU.jpg" data-lightbox="5ffebfe1a28a0" data-title="<div class=&quot;figcaption_content&quot;></div>"><picture><img src="https://cdn.ican.pl/f/res-minimized/RCQjHUyFdLfkh/1607959889/2LT1u5yj0xYhOujlip44SUH9weZKigkU.jpg" title="" alt="The Path of the Little Samurai"></picture></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__13">In April 2020, we asked most of the employees (except, of course, those who worked in the factory) to begin working remotely – and almost 80% began working from home. Thus, our company, just like others, was challenged with maintaining good levels of internal communication. <strong>This is when I&nbsp;began to send messages to all the employees</strong> – about the present condition of the company, the situation on the market, how advanced individual projects are. In October, we began to admit a&nbsp;possibility of returning to the office, as many teams – the engineering ones in particular – wanted to go back to working this way. In spite of this, daily messages that I&nbsp;send via the internal blog of the company, are being continued – and I&nbsp;still try to provide as much information about the state of the company as possible.</p><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__16"><em>I&nbsp;believe that&nbsp;good organizational culture is an underlying foundation of innovation, this is why I&nbsp;attach great importance to it.</em></p><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__18">Fortunately, exceptional cases aside, I&nbsp;do not notice any fall in engagement among employees. This might also be caused by the fact that each new product we launched this year on the market has been very well received. Such positive feedback from the market undoubtedly also helps sustain motivation in the entire team in a&nbsp;situation when I&nbsp;am unable – during remote work – to fully commit to all the co‑workers.</p><h2 id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__30">Global company, involved locally </h2><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__1A">Another element which undoubtedly has an impact on a&nbsp;high&nbsp; level of engagement is our care about the local community. First of all, naturally, it’s about SIGMA employees, who simultaneously belong to the local community. We are a&nbsp;small company and we cannot afford big actions aimed at improving the situation globally, but we still do all our might for a&nbsp;company of that size. First, we care about our customers, our employees and our local community. If we can take care of them, take care of their happiness, it spreads through them all around the world. I&nbsp;believe that if we won’t be able to take care about the local community, we won’t be able to do this for people in other regions of the world.</p><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__1B">It is particularly important in current times – the only thing that will help us survive the difficult situation related with the pandemic is efficient teamwork of content, happy, loyal and engaged employees. This is also the second reason – except betting on the quality of equipment we manufacture – for which we are not planning to move production abroad. We want, as long as&nbsp; possible, to take care of our employees, as opening a&nbsp;factory somewhere with lower production costs would probably mean not only higher profits for the company, but also a&nbsp;necessity to lay off many people from the home factory. We don’t want to allow for that to happen, we feel responsible for those people.</p><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__1D"><em>For that matter, when speaking of “Japanese quality”, I&nbsp;do not mean any singular, unique traits of our nation. I&nbsp;mean individual people, who have experience in lens manufacturing – as it is still partly an “analog” production process.</em></p><p id="DyaduWsNA_pl_main__1F">We can quite easily transfer the technology behind manufacturing of our equipment, experience, however, is a&nbsp;quality that you cannot transfer so simply and easily – in spite of very advanced automation and digitization of our manufacturing processes. They still contain many stages where it is the “human factor” that counts the most. …</p></div></div></div></div>

                <div>
                    <p>I started using Signal 5 years ago as I became increasingly conscious of my data footprint. Around the same time, I closed my Facebook and Instagram accounts, and later, my Google Account.</p><h2 id="the-problem-with-signal">The problem with Signal</h2><p>Signal makes it very difficult, and in most cases, impossible, for one to back up, export, or migrate message data. The Signal team insists these restrictions are meant to protect users’ privacy. However, backup and migration policies differ for each official Signal client and sometimes contradict each other.</p><p>For example, while iOS offers no official backups process, Android backups are built into the app. At the same time, iOS users can migrate their data to a new device (as long as their phone number hasn’t changed), but this is impossible on Android. Meanwhile, decrypting messages from the desktop client is trivial, but linking one’s phone and desktop client only syncs messages forward in time.</p><h2 id="why-export-signal-s-message-history">Why export Signal's message history</h2><p>Because it’s my fucking data.</p><p>The road to exporting my data was long, frustrating and filled with dead ends – it took over a year to get here. What's paradoxical is that someone else's phone turned out to be the key to my data. </p><p>In recent years, I moved most of my conversations to Signal, including those with family and close friends. Shortly after we started dating, I asked my partner to switch to Signal, and we’ve used it exclusively ever since. At some point, I thought it would be nice to export our conversation history – a sort of time capsule of our relationship. “Easy,” I thought. I was wrong.</p><p>Since we started dating, I had switched from a OnePlus 2 to an iPhone XS Max. And since migrating from Android to iOS isn’t possible, part of our conversation history was locked on my old phone. Jailbreaking the iPhone was out of the question since my version of iOS had not been jailbreaken. The Signal Desktop client could have offered an easy avenue to decrypt our chat history, but there was a period of several months during which I had not linked my iPhone to the Signal desktop client.</p><p>I opened a <a href="https://community.signalusers.org/t/ios-backups-through-the-desktop-client/8123">thread about this in the Signal Community Forum</a> in June of 2019. It quickly became apparent that backing up my Signal data would be an uphill battle. </p><p>Luckily, my partner had an iPhone 7, which she recently replaced with a company phone. Her old iPhone contained our entire message history in one place and was easy to jailbreak. Jackpot.</p><p>One important lesson I learned during this process:<strong> to ensure access to your conversation history, install the Desktop client and link it to your mobile device as soon as you start using Signal. </strong>The Signal database and encryption key are both accessible on your computer, allowing for easy decryption. Linking the desktop client later will only sync messages forward in time from the moment the devices are linked.</p><h2 id="tips-to-increase-your-chances-of-exporting-your-signal-database">Tips to increase your chances of exporting your Signal database</h2><p>If you haven’t linked the desktop client and extracting the iOS database is your only option, this guide is for you. If you've decided to embark upon this journey, here's some advice. </p><h3 id="stop-updating-ios">Stop updating iOS</h3><p>Your best chance of jailbreaking iOS is on older firmware versions. Turn off automatic updates and decline prompts to update iOS.</p><h3 id="backup-shsh-blobs-with-every-new-ios-update">Backup SHSH blobs with every new iOS update</h3><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHSH_blob">SHSH blobs</a> are the digital signatures that Apple generates and uses to personalize iOS firmware files for each iOS device. Apple only signs firmware updates for a limited time after release. Having these signatures handy allows one to install versions of iOS after Apple stops signing them – like when a jailbreak becomes available for that version. In some cases, you may be able to downgrade iOS to a previous version.</p><p>Backup SHSH blobs every time Apple releases a new version of iOS (e.g., 14.0, 14.1, 14.1.1). I personally use the <a href="https://github.com/airsquared/blobsaver">blobsaver</a> app, but <a href="https://tsssaver.1conan.com/v2/">TSS Saver</a> is a popular alternative.</p><h3 id="learn-about-jailbreaking-and-stay-up-to-date-on-developments">Learn about jailbreaking and stay up to date on developments</h3><p>Developers and hackers are constantly working to break the security of iOS, and new methods to jailbreak iPhones are frequently made public. Stay informed on jailbreak releases by following the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/">/r/jailbreak subreddit</a>.</p><p>This <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11DABHIIqwYQKj1L83AK9ywk_hYMjEkcaxpIg6phbTf0/edit#gid=1014970938">exhaustive list of jailbreak compatibility</a> by device and iOS version is also a great resource.</p><p>It's also useful to understand the difference between <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Untethered_jailbreak">untethered</a>, <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Semi-untethered_jailbreak">semi-untethered</a>, <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Semi-tethered_jailbreak">semi-tethered</a>, and <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Tethered_jailbreak">tethered</a> jailbreaks.</p><h3 id="recognize-that-this-may-not-work">Recognize that this may not work</h3><p>Depending on your iPhone, you might never be able to jailbreak it or extract Signals decryption key from the iOS Keychain. Apple is making it increasingly difficult to jailbreak iOS devices – improvements to hardware and software are leaving fewer cracks for hackers to exploit.</p><p>Ok, let's get our hands dirty. </p><h2 id="how-to-maybe-backup-signal-for-iphone">How to (maybe) backup Signal for iPhone </h2><p>This guide explains how I was able to backup and extract data from Signal's encrypted SQLite database on an iPhone 7 with iOS 13.6.1. </p><h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites </h3><ul><li>Physical access to the iPhone with Signal still installed</li><li>An original iPhone cable</li><li>A Mac or Linux computer</li><li>Patience and a bit of luck</li></ul><p>Shell environments will be differentiated as such. </p><pre><code>// Host machine

// iPhone 
root# &lt;command&gt;</code></pre><h3 id="step-1-jailbreak-ios">Step 1: Jailbreak iOS</h3><p>For iOS 13.6.1 on an iPhone 7, I used <strong>checkra1n</strong> which offers a straight forward semi-tethered jailbreak. Depending on the iPhone device and version of iOS, a jailbreak may or may not be available. </p><p>See this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11DABHIIqwYQKj1L83AK9ywk_hYMjEkcaxpIg6phbTf0/edit#gid=1014970938">updated list of iOS jailbreaks</a> for device compatibility and instructions. </p><h3 id="step-2-ssh-into-the-iphone">Step 2: SSH into the iPhone </h3><p>Cydia usually comes with OpenSSH installed and enabled, allowing shell access over IP or USB. If SSH access isn't activated, launch Cydia and install OpenSSH. </p><p><strong>As always, the root password on iOS is <code>alpine</code>.</strong></p><p>If the iPhone and the host machine are on the same network, SSH into the phone using its IP address. It may be found in the phone's WiFi settings. </p><pre><code>$ ssh root@[iphone ip] -p 22</code></pre><p>If SSH over the air isn't possible, USB may be an alternative. However, this involves enabling a proxy service on the host machine.</p><p>First, install <em><em>libimobiledevice</em></em> on the host machine. </p><pre><code>$ brew install libimobiledevice</code></pre><p>Then, edit <em><em>com.usbmux.iproxy.plist</em></em> and append the following XML to the file. </p><pre><code>$ nano ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.usbmux.iproxy.plist</code></pre><pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt;
&lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;dict&gt;
&lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;com.usbmux.iproxy&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;array&gt;
&lt;string&gt;/usr/local/bin/iproxy&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string&gt;2222&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string&gt;22&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/array&gt;
&lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;true/&gt;
&lt;key&gt;KeepAlive&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;true/&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;</code></pre><p>And finally, launch the proxy on the host machine. </p><pre><code>$ launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.usbmux.iproxy.plist</code></pre><p>It should now be possible to SSH into the iPhone over USB on port <code>2222</code>.</p><pre><code>$ ssh root@localhost -p 2222</code></pre><h3 id="step-3-install-required-packages">Step 3: Install required packages </h3><p>Once logged into to the iPhone's shell, install the following packages as they will come in handy. </p><pre><code>root# apt install zip unzip nano wget</code></pre><h3 id="step-4-backup-the-signal-data-directory">Step 4: Backup the Signal data directory</h3><p><strong>Locate Signal's data directory</strong></p><p>Much like macOS, iOS stores application data in a <em>Library</em>-like directory. In iOS&nbsp;13, its located here <code>/private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/</code>. </p><p>Signal's data directory contains the encrypted SQLite database file in <code>./grdb/signal.sqilte</code> and attachments, such as images and videos in <code>./Attachments</code>.</p><p>The data directory may be found by searching the filesystem for Signal's encrypted database file, <code>signal.sqlite</code>.</p><pre><code>root# find / -type f -iname "signal.sqlite"</code></pre><p>That should return something which looks like this:<br><code>/private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/01484069-3446-4CC0-8BE7-7464E7D08FDF/grdb/signal.sqlite</code> </p><p>The Signal directory is: <code>/private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/01484069-3446-4CC0-8BE7-7464E7D08FDF/</code></p><p><strong>Zip the Signal directory</strong></p><p>It is recommended to zip the entire directory, not only the database file, as it also contains images and other message attachments.

<section id="content" role="main">



<p>It is January 13th, 2021 as I finish writing these initial words. Major updates may get
a date stamp next to them.</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Someone</em> is sending the directory authorities (and fallback dirs) lots of
traffic.</li>
<li>This causes the dirauths to no longer be able to reliably communicate.</li>
<li>This means consensuses are no longer reliably produced every hour.</li>
<li>No new consensus three hours in a row means new connections to v3 onion
services stop working because of <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/issues/40237">a bug</a>.  Existing connections survive,
and no other part of Tor breaks at the three hour mark.</li>
<li>There is an <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/node/1969">alpha release</a> for <strong>experts who know what they are
doing</strong>.  It is making its way into all supported stable Tor versions.</li>
</ul>


<p>Please keep these facts in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>It is unknown if the traffic hitting the dirauths is maliciously
motivated</strong>. People keep calling it an <em>attack</em>. I don't think we have the
evidence to back that up at this time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>There is no evidence that the traffic overload is actively trying to hurt
v3 onions</strong>.  A <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/issues/33018">similar situation existed last year</a> and onions
didn't go down then. Claims that it is "the" government or rival drug markets
are not backed up with any evidence that I've seen.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>If you have evidence of who is behind this traffic, please let someone know.
<a href="https://support.torproject.org/get-in-touch/">Tor Project</a> or me
(blog comment, an email <small>(listed on <a href="https://matt.traudt.xyz/posts/about-me-6eKe2i5v/">About
Me</a>)</small>, or IRC message)</p>

<p><small>While I currently work on Tor-related stuff for my job, nothing contained in this
post has anything to do with my work. Everything contained in this post is public unclassified
knowledge. Opinions expressed, if any, are my own.</small></p>



<p>Roger points out on January 6th that
<a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2021-January/019201.html">"the overload is back"</a>.</p>

<p>It's not OMGWTFBBQ levels of traffic. It's not from one IP nor is it from IPs
all over the Internet. One dirauth says it <em>seems</em> to be a poorly written
custom Tor client requesting directory information too often.</p>



<p>On January 9th, 10th, and 11th, there are repeated instances of 3 or more
consensuses in a row that are not generated.</p>

<p>This is the trigger for v3 onions no longer working. Consensuses are generated
every hour and are valid for 3 hours. Most parts of Tor (v2 onions, general
circuit building, etc.) do not require a <em>live</em> (currently valid) consensus,
but can get by just fine with a recently valid consensus (expired less than 24
hours ago).</p>

<p>January 12th saw a few missed consensuses, but never 3 in a row. No consensus has been missed so far on the 13th.</p>



<p>The v3 onion service code was written to require a live consensus, and it didn't need to be (devs
are verifying this). The <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2021-January/045681.html">fix</a> for this <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/issues/40237">bug</a>
changes the requirement to just a recently valid consensus. It's getting tested
as I write these words on January 11th. The fix, or something very similar to
it, will be merged and backported in the coming days, at which point it's up to
the packagers for your OS or your tor-derived software (e.g. Tor Browser) to
notice the update and distribute it to you. I would expect Tor Browser to be updated very quickly.
Debian will probably take a day or two. Other distros, I have no idea.</p>

<p>If you're watching tor's logs, the current date includes "January" and "2021",
and you see the following message, then you have most likely hit the bug.</p>

<pre><code>Tried for 120 seconds to get a connection to [scrubbed]:6697. Giving up. (waiting for rendezvous desc)
</code></pre>

<p>The 6697 is <em>not</em> important. The "waiting for rendezvous desc" <em>is important</em>.</p>

<h2><a name="index1h2"></a>Status of the fix making it into Tor</h2>

<p>Primary sources for this section: <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/issues/40237">bug #40237</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Jan 12th: the fix is merged into 0.4.5.3-rc [<a href="https://blog.torproject.org/node/1969">blog post</a>]</li>
</ul>


<p>Upcoming events:</p>

<ul>
<li>backports to other supported versions of Tor</li>
<li>packaging</li>
</ul>




<p>On the 11th we
<a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-consensus-health/2021-January/011815.html">notice</a>
the fallback dirs are also failing.
This is major evidence in my opinion that this is not a purposeful attack on the dirauths. I, and at least two dirauths, think it is most likely a bad custom Tor client implementation that requests directory information too often.</p>

<p>We see the same failing of fallback dirs <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-consensus-health/2021-January/011840.html">on the 12th</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/dirbytes.html?start=2020-12-01&amp;end=2021-02-01">This graph</a> shows how the entire network is fielding more directory requests these days. <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/dirbytes.html?start=2019-10-01&amp;end=2021-02-01">This graph</a> shows more context for where load usually is. The 1.5 Gbit/s the dirauths saw for ~half of 2020 is talked about in <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/issues/33018">this ticket</a>.</p>

<p>An actual attack could disguise itself like this, but if this were an attack, I would expect it to be more consistently effective at preventing consensus generation.</p>



<p><em>(Last updated 15 Jan 2021)</em></p>

<p>The 14th saw no missing consensuses. If you had trouble reaching v3 onion services on the 14th, your issue is unrelated to the topic of this blog post.</p>

<p>The 15th so far has seen no missing consensuses.</p>



<h2><a name="index2h2"></a>What Tor relays/clients need to be updated?</h2>

<p>No relays need to be updated. Tor clients hosting v3 onion services and Tor clients wishing to visit v3 onion services will need to be updated when the fix is released.</p>

<h2><a name="index3h2"></a>How do I update my Tor?</h2>

<p><em>(Last updated 13 Jan 2021)</em></p>

<p>You don't yet, unless you're willing to compile and use a version of Tor that isn't considered stable yet.
If you're willing, then see <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/node/1969">https://blog.torproject.org/node/1969</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="index4h2"></a>Should we temporarily downgrade to v2 while waiting for a fix?</h2>

<p>If absolutely necessary, sure. Please keep in mind v2's issues (briefly described below in the glossary) and be aware that "temporary" probably means ~1 week (<em>crossing my fingers</em>). I personally will just suffer and wait for the fix to be released.</p>

<h2><a name="index5h2"></a>Are v3 onion services fundamentally broken?</h2>

<p>No.</p>

<h2><a name="index6h2"></a>Is this really major?</h2>

<p>Eh ... yes because of the impact, but no because the fix is easy and will be out quickly.</p>



<h2><a name="index7h2"></a>Directory authorities / dirauths</h2>

<p>There are 9 relays operated by highly trusted individuals that decide the state
of the network. They decide what relays are a part of the network and what
certain network parameters should be set to.</p>

<p>In a way they are a "single" point of failure and make the Tor network
"centralized." Decentralizing their role to 100s, 1000s, or every relay would:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>require massive fundamental changes to how Tor works. By itself this
probably is not a convincing reason to not do it.</p></li>
<li><p>open Tor up to new attacks it currently isn't vulnerable to. This should be
a bit more convincing. The keyword to Google for most of them is "Sybil".</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Having a "single" high quality root of trust is a valuable property that
"decentralize all the things!" people do not generally appreciate enough, in my
opinion.</p>

<p>You: <em>This v3 onion fix doesn't actually address the root problem: the dirauths weren't
able to communicate and create consensuses.</em></p>

<p>Yes! You are absolutely right that <em>something</em> about how the dirauths work should
change such that they can continue communicating with each other even in the
presence of malicious (purposefully malicious or not) traffic!
<a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/issues/40239">This ticket</a> is one idea and a good place to start your research
if I say nothing more and you want to research what is being done yourself.
They might also update <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/issues/33018">this ticket</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="index8h2"></a>V3 onion service</h2>

<p>The new type of onion service. Names are 56 characters long, like
tv54samlti22655ohq3oaswm64cwf7ulp6wzkjcvdla2hagqcu7uokid.onion. V2 onions are
16 characters long, like 3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion.</p>

<p>V2 onion services use old crypto and old protocols that are obsolete and
dangerous <em>now</em> or will be soon. The code for v2 is messy and the protocol is
not extensible. V2 onions are vulnerable to harvesting by malicious HSDirs, and these malicious HSDirs exist today (and are removed as soon as they are detected).
Support for v2 onion services will be removed from Tor soon. V3 onions are the
future despite the current events.</p>

<h2><a name="index9h2"></a>Fallback directory mirror / fallback dir</h2>

<p>Tor clients don't usually <em>directly</em> fetch consensus information from a dirauth
anymore. There's too many people using Tor and only 9 dirauths. Instead, a
large number of relays that are high quality have opted in to also be hardcoded
into Tor source code so clients can usually fetch consensus data from them on
first run. After first run and successful connection to Tor, clients get this
stuff from their guard instead.</p>

<h2><a name="index10h2"></a>Consensus</h2>

<p>The dirauths vote on what relays are currently in the network and what certain network
parameters should be set to. The "average" of their votes become the consensus.
They make a consensus every hour and each is valid for three hours. Clients typically
fetch a new consensus every two hours.</p>

<p>You can see information from the current consensus <a href="https://consensus-health.torproject.org/">here</a>. Recent consensuses
are archived <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/collector/recent/relay-descriptors/consensuses/">here</a>
and older ones archived <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/collector/archive/relay-descriptors/consensuses/">here</a>.</p>

<p>When the Zig project started, its audience was almost exclusively people with a lot of relevant experience, since those would be the only ones able to evaluate the promise and limits of the newborn language.</p>
<p>Today we’re at a point where Zig is becoming increasingly compelling for people coming from all layers of the stack. People have written <a href="https://github.com/Hejsil/mecha" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">parser combinators</a>, <a href="https://github.com/prime31/zig-gamekit" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">2d game rendering libraries</a>, <a href="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/futureproof/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a live editor for GPU shaders</a>, and much more. </p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong: all these projects have been developed by early adopters who wanted to try <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/buggy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a new and exciting</a> ecosystem. Zig is not yet stable, and won’t be for a while, but we’re getting there, and in the meantime Zig is already delivering big time on at least one promise: <strong>making it possible to learn more about programming without having to first buy into vast amounts of accidental complexity</strong>.</p>
<p>This redesign had two main goals and, as always, a few practical constraints. When it comes to constraints, it’s mostly my web design and project management skills, and the scope that can be addressed in no more than a couple of months, since we needed a new website <em>now</em> and not one year from now. Let’s now take a look at the goals.</p>
<h2 id="a-friendlier-first-impression"><a href="#a-friendlier-first-impression" aria-label="a friendlier first impression permalink"></a>A friendlier first impression</h2>
<p>The first goal addressed stems directly from the introduction of this blog post: we wanted to make the website more appealing to people that are looking at Zig as an opportunity to learn more about programming. For this reason, the lengthy breakdown has been moved to the Learn section and, in its place, we now have three short paragraphs that highlight some of Zig’s major features, followed by a code sample that gives you a first taste of the syntax. </p>
<p>Above the main introduction we still have the same slogan as before:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zig is a general-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining <strong>robust</strong>, <strong>optimal</strong>, and <strong>reusable</strong> software.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andrew did an outstanding job at formulating it and I believe it’s the one bit of the entire website that should probably never change.</p>
<p>Next to the slogan there’s a new cluster of buttons. This is where I wanted to come up with an interesting compromise: we follow the popular trend of putting a big call to action for new users, but we also use that block of space to create a single hotspot where regulars can get access to critical information. </p>

<p>My hope is for the big button to make new visitors become aware of that block and that, over time, checking there for docs and new releases just becomes muscle memory. That said, I know we’ll have to tweak the design once the auto-generated docs for the standard library become good enough for the front page.</p>
<p>Below everything I just described, we introduce the community and the Zig Software Foundation. The Zig project has grown to a point where governance matters and we want to show we’re doing everything the right way, up to the point of having formed a <a href="https://ziglang.org/zsf/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">nonprofit organization with a clear scope and mission statement</a>.</p>
<h2 id="internationalization"><a href="#internationalization" aria-label="internationalization permalink"></a>Internationalization</h2>
<p>The second goal of this redesign was to open the door to hosting multiple translations of the website. Having an i18n-enabled website is beneficial for multiple reasons: it helps with the first goal (i.e. help a wider range of programmers get started with Zig), it’s a good way of getting more use out of the informative materials we’ll progressively add to the website, and it’s also well aligned with the mission of the Zig Software Foundation. Lastly, I’m personally invested in the idea that we must ensure we don’t leave it to third parties to be the sole owners of all content available in a given language, as we’ve already seen bad actors exploit their position to implement a form of cultural arbitrage.</p>
<p>We’re well aware that keeping up with translations to multiple languages can quickly become an effort black hole. For this reason, I’ve tried to make sure the tooling would help in making the process as smooth as possible (more on that later), and I’ve also made sure to clarify in the design how translations are community-provided and thus best-effort.</p>

<p>At the moment of publication, the website can only offer <a href="https://ziglang.org/translations/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">an Italian translation</a> written by me. Italian was chosen out of necessity (i.e. it’s the only other language I speak), but it served the purpose of making me try out the ergonomics of producing a translation, and it can also act as documentation for others.</p>
<p>Finally, I should point out that there are some parts of the website we don’t plan to translate, like the News section, for example. This is another choice made out of necessity: we want to restrict translations to content with a long shelf life to reduce the amount of effort, but I don’t exclude that one day we might have enough resources to get rid of this compromise.</p>
<h2 id="implementation-details"><a href="#implementation-details" aria-label="implementation details permalink"></a>Implementation details</h2>
<p>The new website is statically generated by <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Hugo</a>. I also considered <a href="https://www.getzola.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Zola</a>, but its i18n support is not complete yet. The website lists a number of Zig code snippets, with relative output. Andrew originally implemented a program to produce release notes and language reference. That program takes in code samples, applies syntax highlighting, runs the code, and reports the output as HTML (it even retains colors from the terminal). I took the original code and packaged it as a tool with a more general interface. I called it <a href="https://github.com/kristoff-it/zig-doctest" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">zig-doctest</a> and it can be easily integrated with all kinds of static content generation tools.</p>
<p>Now a successful CI build of the <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ziglang/zig</a> repository triggers a build of the website, allowing us to catch outdated code examples much more easily. This addresses concerns raised in the past by people that would occasionally stumble upon a broken code sample.</p>
<p>Testing all code snippets is not instant as some tests include running the executable and capturing its output, so I made sure to integrate with Hugo’s caching system. I also noticed that Hugo processes tags sequentially within the same page, so I also <a href="https://github.com/kristoff-it/hugo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">added to it</a> a warmup routine that makes sure to parallelize the testing when loading the development server the first time.</p>
<p>The result is a very enjoyable development experience that only depends on Zig and two additional executables (Hugo and doctest) to be able to develop the Zig website locally, resulting in an acceptable experience for potential contributors. </p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="conclusion permalink"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope this post explains adequately the intent of this work and the practical limits of its execution. There’s still more work to do, but this seems a reasonable milestone for a first release, so I’m looking forward to working alongside the community to improve and add translations to the website.</p>
<p>For the next iteration I’ll work on improving accessibility, but first I have to focus on <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/track/zig_programming_language/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">FOSDEM, since we have a Zig dev room</a> and I have a bunch of duties to attend to. </p>
<p>When I first discovered Zig, I saw it as a way for me to learn more about all the aspects of programming I missed when working with interpreted and/or garbage-collected languages. Turns out I got to learn that <a href="https://ziglang.org/news/announcing-zig-software-foundation/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">and much more</a>, and I can’t tell you how excited I am about what’s to come. Despite everything, 2020 was a great year for Zig, and I fully expect 2021 to be even better.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Jubilee line used to run from Stanmore to Charing Cross, and was opened in May 1979. However Charing Cross was always supposed to be a temporary terminus, with the final destination of &nbsp;Cannon St Station. At the time it was called the Fleet Line, as it would pass under the Fleet River (now a <a href="http://www.guerrillaexploring.com/gesite/public_html/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=53:ges092-river-f-cso&amp;catid=53:draining&amp;Itemid=68">sewer</a>). There wasn't any money during the tough times of the late 1970's, only after the prosperous years under Thatcherism did money become available for the extension, and it was decided to take a different route, rather than to&nbsp; Ludgate Circus. The present Jubilee Line extension runs to Stratford. This meant that the line would run from Green Park to Westminster, bypassing Charing Cross. When the Jubilee Line Extension opened in November 1999, Charing Cross Jubilee Line Platforms became redundant. Many plans have been floated around, including a Jubilee Line Spur to Cannon St Station, as well as an extension of the Docklands Light Railway from Bank via also redundant Aldwych and into Charing Cross.</p>
<p>Of all the bits and pieces on the underground, here was always considered one of the toughest, along with <a href="http://www.guerrillaexploring.com/gesite/public_html/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=226:ges154-brtsh-museum-tube&amp;catid=52:metro&amp;Itemid=67">Museum station</a>. One access point tried by a number of people, would see a squad of cops arrive within seconds of breathing near it. Other options would have involved running down the tracks after service. And because this bit of the station is on a non-regular service branch line, it would be a 1000m run into what could be anything, a heritage train, service train, reversed train. All of which would leave the adventurous explorer smeared down the tunnel walls. Not a pretty site or way to go. GE077 loves his research, and had banded about a few possibilities. We'd looked at some of them, and they didn't seem possible. Eventually we happened to find a lid in a street not far away, that lead into a maze of cramped tunnels, carrying thick high voltage cables. A small gap existed that could get us into the vent shaft. It was so tight, that after GE077 managed to get through, I had to practically get naked to squeeze my longer body through. It's a scary moment when you are half way through and can't move back or forwards. I calmed down, and managed to twist up and down etc to get through.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.guerrillaexploring.com/gesite/public_html/images/guerrilla/GDS214/ges214-19.jpg" width="842" height="575"></p>
<p>Eventually we were in the huge shaft that lead into the heavens</p>
<p><img src="http://www.guerrillaexploring.com/gesite/public_html/images/guerrilla/DEV220/GES220-01.jpg"></p>
<p>One ladder down from the vent, there was a another steel ringed tunnel leading off to the Northern Line platforms ventilation grills. This was taken looking in from the shaft above.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.guerrillaexploring.com/gesite/public_html/images/guerrilla/DEV220/GES220-03.jpg"></p>
<p>Walking a bit further, the tunnel went up a slope. The light opposite the white brick stump, is where the shot above was taken. It's also the point where the tunnel changes from the bit with large pipes leading out of the main vent shaft, changes to the open one in the pic below.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.guerrillaexploring.com/gesite/public_html/images/guerrilla/DEV220/GES220-05.jpg"></p>
<p>Turning around from the pic above, there were a couple of floor grates and some electrical cabinets. This is looking down on to the Northern Line Platforms.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.guerrillaexploring.com/gesite/public_html/images/guerrilla/DEV220/GES220-04.jpg"></p>
<p>We walked back to the main vent shaft, and headed further down the shaft. The landing we walked from can just be seen at the top of the picture.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.guerrillaexploring.com/gesite/public_html/images/guerrilla/DEV220/GES220-06.jpg"></p>
<p>Turning around from the pic above, one sees the short ventilation tunnel, similar to many other stations. The lit up portals lead to grill openings above the disused Jubilee platforms.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.guerrillaexploring.com/gesite/public_html/images/guerrilla/DEV220/GES220-07.jpg"></p>
<p>Looking through one of the portals into a ventilation grill and the prize beyond. We had one stumbling block left, how to get down to the platforms. The only way would be to squeeze through the tiny opening on the side. That would leave the problem of getting down to the platform. Also the fact that the grill dropped onto the tracks, not the platform. We had with us a rope ladder to complete the job. We had to attach it to the grill and check it didn't touch the live rail. &nbsp;We also shook hands, if we were caught, the repercussions would be that we wouldn't be allowed to talk to each other. We'd had a pretty good ride, so it wasn't a sad moment.&nbsp; &nbsp;Going down the ladder first, I tried to go as quickly but stable as possible. Without risking hitting the rope tails of the ladder on the live rail. When down, I held the ladder over the platform for GE077. The remaining small problem was that the station is rigged with cctv cameras, including dome cameras, which would have been installed after the station closed. We gave each other 5-10mins to grab our shots and get the hell out.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.guerrillaexploring.com/gesite/public_html/images/guerrilla/DEV220/GES220-08.jpg"></p>
<p>I quickly ran up the steps to Trafalgar Square and Bakerloo line access, which would have been at the end of the this tunnel, instead one can see the white wall at the end. The Embankment sticker on the wall is a recent addition since closing.</p>

<p>Looking at the bottom of the steps/escalators above.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.guerrillaexploring.com/gesite/public_html/images/guerrilla/DEV220/GES220-11.jpg"></p>
<p>From the circulation area to the platforms. The Circulation area wasn't that long, certainly shorter than the platforms. Note the dome camera above the poster beneath the last strip light on the left.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.guerrillaexploring.com/gesite/public_html/images/guerrilla/DEV220/GES220-12.jpg"></p>
<p>A platform with the original station guide on the far wall, the Jubilee line extension runs from Green Park to Westminster now. Running up the tunnel at the top of the platforms would lead to Green Park.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.guerrillaexploring.com/gesite/public_html/images/guerrilla/DEV220/GES220-13.jpg"></p>

<p><img src="http://www.guerrillaexploring.com/gesite/public_html/images/guerrilla/DEV220/GES220-14.jpg"></p>
<p>Looking the other way up Platform 3, the tunnel at the top with the lights on is the overrun tunnel.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.guerrillaexploring.com/gesite/public_html/images/guerrilla/DEV220/GES220-15.jpg"></p>
<p>A shot inside the overrun tunnel, it bends round to the right after 20 odd metres. Sadly I figured it to risky to go have a look around the corner. It's said the tunnel runs to within a short distance of Aldwych (originally Strand station), however never linked up. Two full tube trains can be stabled here. (Trip 2 will cover this area more).</p>
<p><img src="http://www.guerrillaexploring.com/gesite/public_html/images/guerrilla/DEV220/GES220-16.jpg"></p>
<p>Looking back into the station from the overrun tunnel.</p>

<p>Looking down the escalators (of which there are 3 on this side, rather than 2 and a central set of steps on the Bakerloo side) from the above shot.</p>

<p>Having watched the latest James Bond flick a few months before coming here, I couldn't help but add a little nod to one of the scenes from Skyfall, which was filmed here.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.guerrillaexploring.com/gesite/public_html/images/guerrilla/DEV220/GES220-21.jpg"></p>
<p>And after this shot, I raced back to the platform. As I looked left and right, I couldn't see the rope ladder that GE077 had already left a few minutes earlier by. I thought briefly he'd done the dirty on me and left me stranded to await my fate. However after a few puzzling moments, realised I was on the wrong platform! It's confusing down here when everything is so symmetrical. &nbsp;I went to the correct platform, climbed back up and eventually got back to the street. Meeting up with GE077 some streets away. We were both wild that we'd pulled it off, and quickly left the area.</p>

		<p>How I removed google analytics and still have good data to analyze. It was just recently, that I opened my google analytics account and added it to this website. I wanted to get some insights, about my website’s visitors. But compared to the google search console, there was not much information interesting to me. </p>
<p>And actually I worried a little. Is it legal to just add analytics? analytics was easy to add, just adding a script tag into my page. In EU it is needed to inform the user about non essential cookies. Before setting one, it is needed to ask the users consent. However, analytics got added using a static html tag and there is no way to control what cookies are set immediately.</p>
<p>I was not sure if I should create that script tag dynamically after asking the user, using some client side javascript. and would analytics still work?</p>
<p>On the internet when searching for analytics without cookies there are many websites advising to use <code>motomo</code>. It is a very good solution made with php and mysql. But for my little blog setting up this server seem a little to much. Also because I would have to look that I keep it up do date and do some more security measures. For real production application, google analytics and <a href="https://matomo.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">motomo</a>, both will be a better choice recording lots of data you don’t know now you want to have in the future.</p>
<p>I added a little script into my website. Instead of cookies it uses local storage. local storage can not be used to track users across other websites. So I think this should comply with the law. Also in the storage there is nothing stored to identify the user.</p>

<p>On the server I just dump this information into a jsonl file, meaning one json log entry each line. It can easily be converted to csv for analyses via <code>excel</code>. Draw some charts or count per interval weekly and monthly interval. </p>

<p>Do you see, that I do not check if the browser supports the <code>fetch</code> API and modern arrow functions? I was thinking about it, and decided that I don’t need to care about old browser compatibility for this optional feature.</p>
<p>You see all the fields that are getting stored. These are what I came up with. That I think are interesting. To be honest, the API shown is not exactly the one running at tnickel.de, but the concept is this. On my running implementation I validate the received data, store urls and user agent string into a separate <a href="http://tnickel.de/2020/11/20/2020-11-rapid-prototyping-with-json-file-database/">json file database</a> and write the id into the log file. But with this example you can understand how you can implement the server side yourself.</p>
<p>As by chance: The dev.to community, was just asked about analytics tools. And I described my little solution. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dev.to/madza/what-web-analytics-tools-do-you-use-458o">comment</a> received a reply by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://charanj.it/">Charanjit Chana</a>, saying he is using a similar solution, here is what I found on his websites source code (it was minified, so I formatted it a little):</p>

<p>Seems as head of development he is interested in finding new developer talents for his team. I like the <code>allowToTrack</code> function used before the analytics request is made. This request then set a cookie, so multiple page views can be related to the same user and session. I don’t know about the rules in England after it left the EU, but I believe in Germany, an additional popup banner would be needed. Other than me, Charanjit is interested in the users screen resolution to know what to optimize the page for.</p>
<p>You now have seen two valid approaches to building the client side for collecting analytics information. With this article, I hope you find how how this website does analytics, without tracing the users all over the internet and even into their darkest dreams.</p>

January 14, 2021 | https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/inline-caching/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/inline-caching/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Inline caching is a popular technique for runtime optimization. It was first
introduced in 1984 in Deutsch &amp; Schiffman’s paper <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~palsberg/course/cs232/papers/DeutschSchiffman-popl84.pdf">Efficient implementation
of the smalltalk-80 system [PDF]</a> but has had a long-lasting legacy in
today’s dynamic language implementations. Runtimes like the Hotspot JVM, V8,
and SpiderMonkey use it to improve the performance of code written for those
virtual machines.</p>

<p>In this blog post, I will attempt to distill the essence of inline caching
using a small and relatively useless bytecode interpreter built solely for this
blog post. The caching strategy in this demo is a technique similar to the
ideas from <a href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/kps09/pdfs/brunthaler.pdf">Inline Caching meets Quickening [PDF]</a> in that it
caches function pointers instead of making use of a JIT compiler.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>In many compiled programming languages like C and C++, types and attribute
locations are known at compile time. This makes code like the following fast:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include "foo.h"
</span>
<span>Foo</span> <span>do_add</span><span>(</span><span>Foo</span> <span>left</span><span>,</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>right</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>left</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>right</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The compiler knows precisely what type <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> are (it’s <code>Foo</code>) and
also where the method <code>add</code> is in the executable. If the implementation is in
the header file, it may even be inlined and <code>do_add</code> may be optimized to a
single instruction. Check out the assembly from <code>objdump</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>0000000000401160 &lt;_Z6do_add3FooS_&gt;:
  401160:	48 83 ec 18          	sub    $0x18,%rsp
  401164:	89 7c 24 0c          	mov    %edi,0xc(%rsp)
  401168:	48 8d 7c 24 0c       	lea    0xc(%rsp),%rdi
  40116d:	e8 0e 00 00 00       	callq  401180 &lt;_ZN3Foo3addES_&gt;
  401172:	48 83 c4 18          	add    $0x18,%rsp
  401176:	c3                   	retq   
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>All it does is save the parameters to the stack, call <code>Foo::add</code>, and then
restore the stack.</p>

<p>In more dynamic programming languages, it is often impossible to determine at
runtime startup what type any given variable binding has. We’ll use Python as an
example to illustrate how dynamism makes this tricky, but this constraint is
broadly applicable to Ruby, JavaScript, etc.</p>

<p>Consider the following Python snippet:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>do_add</span><span>(</span><span>left</span><span>,</span> <span>right</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>left</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>right</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Due to Python’s various dynamic features, the compiler cannot in general know
what type <code>value</code> is and therefore what code to run when reading <code>left.add</code>.
This program will be compiled down to a couple Python bytecode instructions
that do a very generic <code>LOAD_METHOD</code>/<code>CALL_METHOD</code> operation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import dis
&gt;&gt;&gt; dis.dis("""
... def do_add(left, right):
...     return left.add(right)
... """)
[snip]
Disassembly of &lt;code object do_add at 0x7f0b40cf49d0, file "&lt;dis&gt;", line 2&gt;:
  3           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (left)
              2 LOAD_METHOD              0 (add)
              4 LOAD_FAST                1 (right)
              6 CALL_METHOD              1
              8 RETURN_VALUE

&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This <code>LOAD_METHOD</code> Python bytecode instruction is unlike the x86 <code>mov</code>
instruction in that <code>LOAD_METHOD</code> is not given an offset into <code>left</code>, but
instead is given the name <code>"add"</code>. It has to go and figure out how to read
<code>add</code> from <code>left</code>’s type — which could change from call to call.</p>

<p>In fact, even if the parameters were typed (which is a new feature in Python
3), the same code would be generated. Writing <code>left: Foo</code> means that <code>left</code> is a
<code>Foo</code> <em>or</em> a subclass.</p>

<p>This is not a simple process like “fetch the attribute at the given offset
specified by the type”. The runtime has to find out what kind of object <code>add</code>
is. Maybe it’s just a function, or maybe it’s a <code>property</code>, or maybe it’s some
custom descriptor protocol thing. There’s no way to just turn this into a
<code>mov</code>!</p>

<p>… or is there?</p>

<h2 id="runtime-type-information">Runtime type information</h2>

<p>Though dynamic runtimes do not know ahead of time what types variables have at
any given opcode, they do eventually find out <em>when the code is run</em>. The first
time someone calls <code>do_add</code>, <code>LOAD_METHOD</code> will go and look up the type of
<code>left</code>. It will use it to look up the attribute <code>add</code> and then throw the type
information away. But the second time someone calls <code>do_add</code>, the same thing
will happen. Why don’t runtimes store this information about the type and the
method and save the lookup work?</p>

<p>The thinking is “well, <code>left</code> could be any type of object — best not make any
assumptions about it.” While this is <em>technically</em> true, Deutsch &amp;
Schiffman find that “at a given point in code, the receiver is often the same
class as the receiver at the same point when the code was last executed”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> By <em>receiver</em>, they mean the thing from which the attribute is
being loaded. This is some Object-Oriented Programming terminology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is huge. This means that, even in this sea of dynamic behavior, humans
actually are not all that creative and tend to write functions that see only a
handful of types at a given location.</p>

<p>The Smalltalk-80 paper describes a runtime that takes advantage of this by
adding “inline caches” to functions. These inline caches keep track of variable
types seen at each point in the code, so that the runtime can make optimization
decisions with that information.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at how this could work in practice.</p>

<h2 id="a-small-example">A small example</h2>

<p>I put together a <a href="https://github.com/tekknolagi/icdemo">small stack machine</a> with only a few operations. There
are very minimal features to avoid distracting from the main focus: inline
caching. Extending this example would be an excellent exercise.</p>

<h3 id="objects-and-types">Objects and types</h3>

<p>The design of this runtime involves two types of objects (<code>int</code>s and <code>str</code>s).
Objects are implemented as a tagged union, but for the purposes of this blog
post the representation does not matter very much.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>enum</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>kInt</span><span>,</span>
  <span>kStr</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span> <span>ObjectType</span><span>;</span>

<span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>ObjectType</span> <span>type</span><span>;</span>
  <span>union</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>str_value</span><span>;</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>int_value</span><span>;</span>
  <span>};</span>
<span>}</span> <span>Object</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These types have methods on them, such as <code>add</code> and <code>print</code>. Method names are
represented with an enum (<code>Symbol</code>) though strings would work just as well.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>enum</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>kAdd</span><span>,</span>
  <span>kPrint</span><span>,</span>

  <span>kUnknownSymbol</span> <span>=</span> <span>kPrint</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span> <span>Symbol</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The representation of type information isn’t super important. Just know that
there is a function called <code>lookup_method</code> and that it is very slow. Eventually
we’ll want to cache its result.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Method</span> <span>lookup_method</span><span>(</span><span>ObjectType</span> <span>type</span><span>,</span> <span>Symbol</span> <span>name</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s see how we use these <code>lookup_method</code> in the interpreter.</p>

<h3 id="interpreter">Interpreter</h3>

<p>There’s no way to call these methods directly. For the purposes of this demo,
the only way to call these methods is through purpose-built opcodes. For
example, the opcode <code>ADD</code> takes two arguments. It looks up <code>kAdd</code> on the left
hand side and calls it. <code>PRINT</code> is similar.</p>

<p>There are only two other opcodes, <code>ARG</code> and <code>HALT</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>enum</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Load a value from the arguments array at index `arg'.</span>
  <span>ARG</span><span>,</span>
  <span>// Add stack[-2] + stack[-1].</span>
  <span>ADD</span><span>,</span>
  <span>// Pop the top of the stack and print it.</span>
  <span>PRINT</span><span>,</span>
  <span>// Halt the machine.</span>
  <span>HALT</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span> <span>Opcode</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Bytecode is represented by a series of opcode/argument pairs, each taking up
one byte. Only <code>ARG</code> needs an argument; the other instructions ignore theirs.</p>

<p>Let’s look at a sample program.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>byte</span> <span>bytecode</span><span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>/*0:*/</span> <span>ARG</span><span>,</span>   <span>0</span><span>,</span>
                   <span>/*2:*/</span> <span>ARG</span><span>,</span>   <span>1</span><span>,</span>
                   <span>/*4:*/</span> <span>ADD</span><span>,</span>   <span>0</span><span>,</span>
                   <span>/*6:*/</span> <span>PRINT</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>
                   <span>/*8:*/</span> <span>HALT</span><span>,</span>  <span>0</span><span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This program takes its two arguments, adds them together, prints the result,
and then halts the interpreter.</p>

<p>You may wonder, “how is it that there is an instruction for loading arguments
but no call instruction?” Well, the interpreter does not support calls. There
is only a top-level function, <code>eval_code</code>. It takes an object, evaluates its
bytecode with the given arguments, and returns. Extending the interpreter to
support function calls would be another good exercise.</p>

<p>The interpreter implementation is a fairly straightforward <code>switch</code> statement.
Notice that it takes a representation of a function-like thing (<code>Code</code>) and an
array of arguments. <code>nargs</code> is only used for bounds checking.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>char</span> <span>byte</span><span>;</span>

<p>Both <code>ADD</code> and <code>PRINT</code> make use of <code>lookup_method</code> to find out what function
pointer corresponds to the given <code>(type, symbol)</code> pair. Both opcodes throw away
the result. How sad. Let’s figure out how to save some of that data. Maybe we
can use the <code>caches</code> slot in <code>Code</code>.</p>

<h3 id="inline-caching-strategy">Inline caching strategy</h3>

<p>Since the Smalltalk-80 paper tells us that the receiver type is unlikely to
change from call to call at a given point in the bytecode, let’s cache <em>one</em>
method address per opcode. As with any cache, we’ll have to store both a key
(the object type) and a value (the method address).</p>

<p>There are several states that the cache could be in when entering the an
opcode:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>If it is empty</strong>, look up the method and store it in the cache using the
current type as a cache key. Use the cached value.</li>
  <li><strong>If it has an entry and the entry is for the current type</strong>, use the cached
value.</li>
  <li>Last, <strong>if it has an entry and the entry is for a different …</strong></li></ol></div></div>

							<p>Amazon puts obstacles in the way of consumers who wish to unsubscribe from its Amazon Prime service. Today the Norwegian Consumer Council filed a legal complaint against the company for breaches of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive.</p><p>In the process of unsubscribing from Amazon Prime, the company manipulates consumers to continue using the service in what seems like a deliberate attempt to confuse and frustrate customers.</p>
<p>The Norwegian Consumer Council`s <a href="https://fil.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/complaint-against-amazon-prime.pdf">legal complaint</a>&nbsp;to the Consumer Protection Authority highlights what we believe to be Amazon´s unfair commercial practices and breaches of marketing law.</p>
<p>– It should be as easy to end a subscription as it was to subscribe in the first place. Amazon should facilitate a good user experience instead of hindering customers and tricking them into continuing paid services they do not need or want, said Director of Digital Policy at the Norwegian Consumer Council, Finn Lützow-Holm Myrstad.</p>
<p>– In our view, this practice not only betrays the expectations and trust of consumers but breaches European law.</p>
<h2><strong>One out of four consumers struggle to unsubscribe </strong></h2>
<p>The Norwegian Consumer Council <a href="https://fil.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/population-survey-digital-content.pdf">surveyed 1,000 Norwegian consumers</a> and analysed their experience. One out of four Norwegian consumers reported difficulties unsubscribing from digital content services. Twenty-five percent of consumers surveyed reported that they pay for one or more subscriptions that they use with such infrequency that they might as well end the subscription.</p>
<p>– Most of us use digital content services to watch movies, listen to music or audiobooks, play video games, or read the news. At the same time, many consumers experience issues with subscriptions being very easy to sign up for, but difficult to get out of, said Finn Myrstad.</p>
<p>– Companies such as Amazon seem to speculate that they can discourage customers from cancelling their subscriptions either by heavily emphasizing the benefits that will be lost upon cancellation or by making the process so complicated that its users simply give up.</p>
<h2><strong>Amazon manipulates users into staying by using dark patterns</strong></h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GpEQ4OWNO4Y" width="650" height="433" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://fil.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-14-you-can-log-out-but-you-can-never-leave-final.pdf">The Norwegian Consumer Council’s study</a> analysed the cancellation process for Amazon Prime. The analysis shows that consumers who want to leave the service are faced with a large number of hurdles, including complicated navigation menus, skewed wording, confusing choices, and repeated nudging. Throughout the process, Amazon manipulates users through wording and graphic design, making the process needlessly difficult and frustrating to understand.</p>
<p>– Unfortunately, using <em>dark patterns</em>, or manipulative design, is a common practice online. Consumers are constantly bombarded by a variety of subtle and less subtle attempts to push us into making choices that favour the companies at the cost of our own time, attention, and money, said Myrstad.</p>
<h2><strong>A global problem requires global solutions</strong></h2>
<p>16 different consumer organizations in Europe and the United States are now taking action against Amazon based on the report by the Norwegian Consumer Council. They will each ask their respective consumer authorities to investigate the use of dark patterns in their countries.</p>
<p>This international campaign builds upon the Norwegian Consumer Council’s joint 2018 campaign with seven other European consumer organizations against Google’s use of dark patterns. The complaint, which the Irish Data Protection Commissioner’s office is still investigating, uncovered how Google manipulates users into turning on comprehensive location tracking.</p>
<p>– The Consumer Protection Authority can set an important precedent by issuing a decision against Amazon. A decision in favour of the complaint would mark that the use of dark patterns is not in accordance with European law and would elevate the rights of consumers.</p>

			<hr><p><strong>Amazon Prime</strong></p>
<p>A subscription to Amazon Prime provides discounts, shipping benefits, and access to other Amazon services. The Amazon Prime service has more than 150 million subscribers worldwide. Amazon’s European headquarters is in Luxembourg.</p>
<p><strong>Dark patterns</strong></p>
<p>Dark patterns, or manipulative design, are features of user interface design that nudge or push consumers into making choices that are in the best interest of the service provider, rather than in the interest of the consumer. This may include that certain options are easier to choose than others, that consumers are tricked into giving consent to sharing personal data, and many other practices.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The growing popularity of chatbots in the current market and especially in the restaurant industry can be readily noticeable. The primary reason is that they can be attributed to the wide bunch of services for which they can be put to use. Thus, becoming the support system for multiple brands for businesses.Â&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Real-World Examples of Restaurant Chatbot</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Some of the most prominent players and food chains like Taco Bell and Burger King leverage theirÂ&nbsp;</span>restaurant to establish<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Â&nbsp;better customer service and engage with their customers to simplify delivery and takeaway.Â&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The other three most prominent online ai chatbot users in this space are TGI Friday, Domino’s,Â&nbsp;</span><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2016/08/25/why-wingstop-is-betting-big-on-chatbots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Wingstop</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, and Pizzahut.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">WhereasÂ&nbsp;</span>Domino’sÂ&nbsp;andÂ&nbsp;PizzahutÂ&nbsp;leverage this technology for ordering food andÂ&nbsp;<a href="https://venturebeat.com/2016/09/20/tgi-fridays-new-bot-makes-table-reservations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TGI Friday</a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Â&nbsp;for making reservations.Â&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It might be possible your mind is full of questions such as as-.Â&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>“Can Chatbots be used by a restaurant?</p>
<p>Why do restaurants need a chatbot?</p>
<p>How do you make a chatbot for a restaurant?</p>
<p>Can a restaurant use a chatbot to take customer orders and make menu items suggestions?”</p>
<p>Then it would help if you considered this enormous real instance that we are about to discuss. Hold your mind and let it collect all the information!</p>
<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Instance- Burger king’s new chatbot for QSR chains’ order-ahead options!Â&nbsp;</span></strong></h3>
<p>Burger King is already up with an order-ahead tool within the Facebook Messenger platform. With this bunch of QSR, marketers started debating whether to invest in chatbots or not. And eventually, they landed on the belief of fakebook’s ability with an online ai chatbotÂ&nbsp;to serve as a viable food ordering platform. It came up with aÂ&nbsp;chatbot platformÂ&nbsp;to test a bot that enables customers to place food orders, pick-up location, and seamless payments. Thus, the QSR industry findsÂ&nbsp;online ai chatbotÂ&nbsp;useful, mainly when a brand or business is uncertain in investing in a whole new mobile application.</p>
<p>“Burger King has demonstrated a top hand in this space as it previously worked with Kik’s bot and now with Facebook Messenger to engage people with a compelling and easy to use interface.</p>
<p>Niki, an AI-powered chatbot that launched an in-chat ordering feature for Burger King. And is working in partnership with LimeTray. LimeTray is aÂ&nbsp;Chatbot builderÂ&nbsp;that helps the food industry get aÂ&nbsp;restaurant chatbotÂ&nbsp;to enable a better online presence.</p>
<p>Now I’m sure that you got all your answers with this example as it shows how big players are stepping into technology and leading to a better future. Now let’s take you deeper to get a better understanding of usingÂ&nbsp;bot generato<span data-preserver-spaces="true">r for your food business. Here’s </span></p>
<h2>Use Restaurant Chatbot for Improving the Customer Journey</h2>
<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">1.Aware your Audience :</span></strong></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Nowadays, people are spending more time on the web and social media platforms. AÂ&nbsp;</span>restaurant botÂ&nbsp;is an ideal medium to reach out to your customers. Grab their attention and let them know that you are here for them 24/7.</p>
<p>You can design anÂ&nbsp;online ai chatbotÂ&nbsp;<span data-preserver-spaces="true">to engage via asking questions, guiding them on the right path, updating new menus, telling offers, and much more. It can also collect customer information, such as email addresses and phone numbers. Offering instant response helps you build a better user experience.Â&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">2.Engage :</span></strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>Real-time responses:having a quick response system helps you boost customer support and engagement. For instance, any customer visits your website and wishes to inquire about the store timings via number or any other way. No matter how dedicated your staff is, they won’t be able to respond at odd hours. But with the help of a restaurant chatbot,Â&nbsp;you can quickly respond to customers in real-time. It will significantly reduce the average time taken to respond to customer requests or messages. Moreover, an engaged customer is more likely to purchase from your store.</li>
<li>Assistance : you can build a platform where your customers don’t have to scan your entire website to find whatever they are looking for. YourÂ&nbsp;chatbot platformÂ&nbsp;can FIR instant and relevant solutions the moment they will select their preferences.</li>
<li>Personalized communication: You can nurture your potential customers and persuade them to visit your store or order from your restaurant. For every new deal, you offer, you can send them via message or email, tempting them and leading them to your food.</li>
<li>Generation of leads: Your restaurant chatbot has immense potential to collect qualified leads and help your sales team nurture well for future productivity.<img loading="lazy" src="https://botpenguin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Restaurant-Bot-1-300x214.png" alt="Restaurant Bot" width="675" height="339"></li>
</ol>
<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">3. Accession :</span></strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>Limited-time deals, offers, and discounts: You can take advantage of aÂ&nbsp;bot generatorÂ&nbsp;and send regular emails or text messages. They can directly email lists and offer your customers exciting offers and limited-time deals.</li>
<li>Improved orders: AÂ&nbsp;restaurant bot<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Â&nbsp;can revamp your order efficiency by incorporating your customer support services with few add-ons or quick turns. They are as follows:Â&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Taking online orders lets your customers have their time choosing what they want to eat without any hurry. By offering an interface for online ordering will save their time and result in satisfied customers.Â&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Recommending food- a bot can also recommend food according to the mentioned preferences by the customers.</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Easy and quick delivery and takeaway- let them choose the location quickly and enjoy more effortless and seamless payment getaways.Â&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Decrease waiting for durations by pre-booking orders- allow them to pre-book the table and need not stand or wait on calls at the last minute.Â&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Let customers make reservations- some of the players are using bots for making reservations of tables, which leads to less chaos and a happy experience in the restaurant.Â&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">4. Build Loyalty :</span></strong></h3>
<p>Ask for feedback: Most people go for online shopping, whether it is about clothing or food, looking for their feedback and reviews over the web. This helps customers make up their mind whether they should go to that restaurant or not. Thus, assign yourÂ&nbsp;restaurant chatbotÂ&nbsp;to send timely reminder reminders to the customers for submitting their feedback and review and what was their experience with your food. Letting customers share their experience at your restaurant by a quick button on yourÂ&nbsp;online ai chatbotÂ&nbsp;can be a great way to attract attention. This will help you build loyalty amongst your future and potential customers in the long run.</p>

        This is an edition of the <a href="https://sirupsen.com/napkin/">Napkin Math newsletter</a>,
        a newsletter about using napkin math and first-principle thinking to
        estimate the performance of systems.
        You can <a href="https://sirupsen.com/napkin">subscribe through email.</a>
    </p>

    <p>A common problem you’ve almost certainly faced is to sync two datastores. This problem comes up in numerous shapes and forms: Receiving webhooks and writing them into your datastore, maintaining a materialized view, making sure a cache reflects reality, ensure documents make it from your source of truth to a search index, or your data from your transactional store to your data lake or column store.</p>
<p><img src="https://buttondown.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/8b99afab-9ae3-47cf-8703-f465aaec1473.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If you’ve built such a system, you’ve almost certainly seen B drift out of sync. Building a completely reliable syncing mechanism is difficult, but perhaps we can build a checksumming mechanism to check if the two datastores are equal in a few seconds?</p>
<p>In this issue of napkin math, we look at implementing a solution to <strong>check whether A and B are in sync for 100M records in a few seconds</strong>. The key idea is to checksum an indexed <code>updated_at</code> column and use a binary search to drill down to the mismatching records. All of this will be explained in great detail, read on!</p>
<h2 id="why-are-syncing-mechanisms-unreliable">Why are syncing mechanisms unreliable?</h2>
<p>If you are firing the events for your syncing mechanism after a transaction occurs, such as enqueuing a job, sending a webhook, or emit a Kafka event, you can’t guarantee that it <em>actually</em> gets sent after the transaction is committed. Almost certainly part of pipeline into database B is leaky due to bugs: perhaps there’s an exception you don’t handle, you drop events on the floor above a certain size, some early return, or deploys lose an event in a rare edge case.</p>
<p>But <em>even</em> if you’re doing something that’s theoretically bullet-proof, like using the database replication logs through <a href="https://debezium.io/">Debezium</a>, there’s still a good chance a bug somewhere in your syncing pipeline is causing you to lose occasional events. If theoretical guarantees were adequate, <a href="https://jepsen.io/">Jepsen</a> wouldn’t uncover much, would it? A team I worked with even wrote a TLA+ proof, but still found bugs with a solution like the one I describe here! In my experience, a checksumming system should be part of <em>any</em> syncing system.</p>
<p>It would seem to me that building reliable syncing mechanisms would be easier if databases had a standard, fast mechanism to answer the question: <em>“Does database A and B have all the same data? If not, what’s different?"</em> Over time, as you fix your bugs, it will of course happen more rarely, but being able to guarantee that they are in sync is a huge step forward.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this doesn’t exist as a user API in modern databases, but perhaps we can design such a mechanism <em>without</em> modifying the database?</p>
<p>This exploration will be fairly long. If you just want to see the final solution, scroll down to the end. This issue shows how to use napkin math to incrementally justify increasing complexity. While I’ve been thinking about this problem for a while, this is a fairly accurate representation of how I thought about the problem a few months ago when I started working on it. It’s also worth noting that when doing napkin math usually, I don’t write prototypes like this if I’m fairly confident in my understanding of the system underneath. I’m doing it here to make it more entertaining to read!</p>
<h2 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h2>
<p>Let’s start with some assumptions to plan out our ‘syncing checksum process’:</p>
<ul>
<li>100M records</li>
<li>1KiB per record (~100 GiB total)</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll assume both ends are SQL-flavoured relational databases, but will address other datastores later, e.g. ElasticSearch.</p>
<h2 id="iteration-1-check-in-batches">Iteration 1: Check in Batches</h2>
<p>As usual, we will start by considering the simplest possible solution for checking whether two databases are in sync: a script that iterates through all records in batches to check if they’re the same. It’ll execute the SQL query below in a loop, iterating through the whole collection on both sides and report mismatches:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>`</span><span>table</span><span>`</span>
<span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> id <span>ASC</span>
<span>LIMIT</span> <span>@</span><span>limit</span> <span>OFFSET</span> <span>@</span><span>offset</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Let’s try to figure out how long this would take: Let’s assume each loop is querying the two databases in parallel and our batches are 10,000 records (10 MiB total) large:</p>
<ul>
<li>In MySQL, reading 10 MiB off SSD at <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/napkin-math#numbers">200 us/MiB</a> will take ~2ms. We assume   this to be sequential-ish, <a href="http://yoshinorimatsunobu.blogspot.com/2013/10/making-full-table-scan-10x-faster-in.html">but this is not entirely true</a>.</li>
<li>Serializing and deserializing the MySQL protocol at <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/napkin-math#numbers">5 ms/MiB</a>, for a total   of ~2* 50ms = 100ms.</li>
<li>Network transfer at <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/napkin-math#numbers">10 ms/MiB</a>, for a total of ~100ms.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’d then expect each batch to take roughly ~200ms.  This would bring our theoretical grand total for this approach to <code>200 ms/batch * (100M / 10_000) batches ~= 30min</code>.</p>
<p>To test our hypothesis against reality, I implemented this to <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/napkin-math/blob/master/newsletter/14-syncing/check.rb">run locally for the first 100 of the 10,000 batches</a>. In this local implementation, we won’t incur the network transfer overhead (we could’ve done this with <a href="https://github.com/shopify/toxiproxy">Toxiproxy</a>). Without the network overhead, we expect a query time in the 100ms ballpark. Running <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/napkin-math/blob/master/newsletter/14-syncing/check.rb">the script</a>, I get the following plot:</p>
<p><img src="https://buttondown.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/dfef5830-f658-4268-b655-ec23e64ce90c.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Ugh. The real performance is pretty far from our napkin math lower bound estimate. What’s going on here?</p>
<p>There’s a fundamental problem with our napkin math. Only the <em>very</em> first batch will read only <code>~10 MB</code> off of the SSD in MySQL. <code>OFFSET</code> queries will read through the data <em>before</em> the offset, even if it only returns the data after the offset! Each batch takes 3-5ms more than the last, which lines up well with reading another 10 MiB per batch from the increasing offset.</p>
<p>This is the reason why OFFSET-based pagination causes so much trouble in production systems. If we take the area under the graph here and extend to the 10,000 batches we’d need for our 100M records, we get a <strong>~3 day runtime</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="iteration-2-outsmarting-the-optimizer">Iteration 2: Outsmarting the optimizer</h2>
<p>As <code>OFFSET</code> will scan through all these 1 KiB records, what if we scanned an index instead? It’ll be much smaller to skip 100,000s of records on an index where each record only occupies perhaps 64 bit. It’ll still grow linearly with the offset, but passing the previous batch’s 10,000 records is only 10 KiB which would only take a few hundred microseconds to read.</p>
<p>You’d think the optimizer would make this optimization itself, but it doesn’t. So we have to do it ourselves:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>`</span><span>table</span><span>`</span>
<span>WHERE</span> id <span>&gt;</span> (<span>SELECT</span> id <span>FROM</span> <span>table</span> <span>LIMIT</span> <span>1</span> <span>OFFSET</span> <span>@</span><span>offset</span>)
<span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> id <span>ASC</span> 
<span>LIMIT</span> <span>10000</span>;
</code></pre></div><p><img src="https://buttondown.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/47a71e04-2c3d-48e6-a7de-c2240d1ac26f.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It’s better, but just not by enough. It just delays the inevitable scanning of lots of data to find these limits. If we interpolate how long this’d take for 10,000 batches to process our 100M records, we’re still talking on the <strong>order of 14 hours</strong>. The 128x speedup doesn’t carry through, because it only applies to the MySQL part. Network transfer is still a large portion of the total time!</p>
<p>Either way, if you have some OFFSET queries lying around in your codebase, you might want to consider this optimization.</p>
<h2 id="iteration-3-parallelization">Iteration 3: Parallelization</h2>
<p>This seems like an embarrassingly parallel problem: Can’t we just run 100 batches of 10,000 records in parallel? Can the database support that? Since we can pre-compute <em>all</em> the LIMITs and OFFSETs up front, let’s abuse that?</p>
<p>This seems kind of difficult to do the napkin math on. Typically when that’s the case, I try to solve the problem backwards: Fundamentally, the machine can <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/napkin-math#numbers">read sequential SSD at 4 GiB/s</a>, which would be an absolute lower bound for how fast the database can work. The dataset is 100 GiB, as we established in the beginning.</p>
<p>If we’re using our optimization from iteration 2, then our queries are on average processing <code>50M * 64 bit</code> for the sub-query, and the <code>10 MiB</code> of returned data on top. That’s a total of ~400 MiB. So for our 10,000 batches, that’s 4.2 TB of data we will need to munch through with this query. We can read 1 GiB from SSD in 200ms, so that’s 14 minutes in total. That would be the <em>absolute</em> lowest bound, assuming essentially zero overhead from MySQL and not taking into consideration serialization, network, etc.</p>
<p>This also assumes the MySQL instance is doing <em>nothing</em> but serving our query, which is unrealistic. In reality, we’d dedicate <em>maybe</em> 10% of capacity to these queries, which puts us at 2 hours. Still faster, but a far cry from our hope of seconds or minutes. Buuh.</p>
<h2 id="iteration-4-dropping-offset">Iteration 4: Dropping OFFSET</h2>
<p>It’s starting to seem like trouble to use these OFFSET queries, even as sub-queries. We held on to it for a while, because it’s nice and easy to reason about, and means the queries can be fired off in parallel. We also held on to it for a while to truly show how awful these types of queries are, so hopefully you think twice about using it in a production query again!</p>
<p>If we change our approach to maintain <code>max(id)</code> from the last batch, we can simply change our loop’s query to:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>`</span><span>table</span><span>`</span>
<span>WHERE</span> id <span>&gt;</span> <span>@</span>max_id_from_last_batch
<span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> id <span>ASC</span>
<span>LIMIT</span> <span>10000</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>This curbed the linear growth!</p>
<p><img src="https://buttondown.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/6b0263d5-c59f-4127-a573-6b06d615c195.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now MySQL can use its efficient primary key index to do <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=log%28100*10%5E6%29%2Flog%281024%2F3*2%2F%288%2B4%29%29+%2B+1++*https%3A%2F%2Fdev.mysql.com%2Fdoc%2Frefman%2F8.0%2Fen%2Festimating-performance.html*">~6 SSD seeks</a> on <code>id</code> and then scan forward. This means we only process and serialize 10 MiB, putting our napkin math consistently around 100ms per batch as in the original estimate in iteration 1. That means this solution should <strong>finish in about half an hour!</strong> However, we learned in the previous iteration that we are constrained by only taking 10% of the database’s capacity, so as calculated from iteration 3, we’re back at 2 hours..</p>
<p>We fundamentally need an approach that handles less data, as the serialization and network time is the primary reason why the integrity checking is now slow.</p>
<h2 id="iteration-5-checksumming">Iteration 5: Checksumming</h2>
<p>If we want to handle less data, we need to have some way to fingerprint or checksum each record. We could change our query to something along the lines of:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> MD5(<span>*</span>) <span>FROM</span> <span>table</span>
<span>WHERE</span> id <span>&gt;</span> <span>@</span>max_id_from_last_batch
<span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> id <span>ASC</span>
<span>LIMIT</span> <span>10000</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>If there’s a mismatch, we simply revert to iteration 4 and find the rows that mismatch, but we have to scan far less data as we can assume the majority of it lines up.</p>
<p>Before moving on, let’s see whether the napkin math works out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading 10 MiB off SSD at <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/napkin-math#numbers">200 us/MiB</a> will take ~2ms.</li>
<li>Has…</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m not a “systems” person.</p>
<p>It’s not like I never tried - making schedules, using a Pomodoro timer,&lt;insert productivity “hack”&gt; - they didn’t work because I was trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/104540572-bb4c3d00-5645-11eb-86f9-de27e6b8d07d.jpg" alt="square_peg.jpg"> <small> <a href="https://baddadcartoons101.wordpress.com/2017/09/04/square-peg-and-a-round-hole/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <i> Source: BadDadCartoons </i> </a> </small> </p>
<p>What I ended up doing was instead of focusing on optimising the time I spent productively - i.e. the “deep work” part (which happened rather spontaneously independent of whether I’m on a productivity hack or not) - I decided to focus on the time that was not “deep work” i.e. time spent on ‘distractions’ or entertainment.</p>
<p>I used to spend an unhealthy amount of time in a day on Instagram where the feed was mostly filled with memes. I also used Quora/Twitter a lot.</p>
<p>Consuming content is easy. Like junk food. It's almost embedded in our reflexes.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing - you can easily turn your distractions to things that can benefit you.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Start with cutting off distractions that have too much noise i.e. do not give you a good return of investment on your time in any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specific knowledge/skills</li>
<li>Specific insight</li>
<li>Accessing and leveraging a network</li>
</ul>
<p>For the ones that remain, optimise the shit out of them.</p>
<p>For me, that meant Instagram was instantly off the list. Twitter and Quora were okay, but I had a long way to go.</p>
<br>
<h3> Optimising your feed </h3>
<p>Social media “feed”.
What comes to your mind when you think of the word - “feed”?</p>
<p>This comes to my mind when I think “feed”</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/104541024-c0f65280-5646-11eb-92f6-de5227d4b8a1.png" alt="sheep.jpg"> <i> <small> Sheep, “feed”ing </small>
</i> </p>
<p>Our minds are literally “fed” content.</p>
<p>“We are what we eat” - this doesn’t just stand for physical, tangible food - it applies to the digital content we feed our mind with.</p>
<p>I want you to take this literally because we take our attention for granted. In a digital economy run by monetising attention - it will naturally be full of noise.</p>
<p>Most of the content we read or watch is optimised solely for capturing our attention and clicks. More times than not, you don’t need something that is being shown to you. You will be perfectly fine without knowing it existed. Yep, sounds crazy but it is true.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to say social media is bad. Social media is an amplifier of all there is - of both the good stuff and the bad. It is an amplifier of your primal instincts so if you don’t proactively weed out the bad stuff from your feed regularly, you are going to get sick. Really sick.</p>
<p>What that means is, with some conscious effort you can filter out your feed to keep only the things that benefit you. Here’s how:</p>
<p><strong>Tip #1</strong></p>
<p>Don’t follow brands. Follow people.</p>
<p>I’ll bring the sheep here, again.</p>
<p>When I imagine a brand account, I imagine the shepherd.</p>
<p>And all of the 100-200-500k followers as the sheep.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/104541200-1599cd80-5647-11eb-8d7f-f89ae517eb81.png" alt="shepherd.jpg"></p><p>The only reason brand accounts exist is to convince you - in obvious or non-obvious ways - that you need their product in some way or the other. 99-100% of brand accounts posts are pure marketing. You do not need them.
It’s like bombarding your own feed with their ads - full time - <em>with your full consent</em>. Especially so if you are already consuming a brand’s product. Why?!</p>
<p>Who should you follow then?</p>
<p>Follow people. Now, you might argue that people themselves can be brands and you are absolutely right - avoid them too. This goes for popular celebrities, sportspeople, singers etc.
Around half the time, you are probably going to see marketing stuff from them as well. Not all are like that of course, apply your judgement. I respect a lot of celebrities but I don’t follow them because I simply don’t need their opinion in my feed - I couldn’t care any less - they are artists, I liked their art, I liked how they performed but that doesn’t mean I like their opinion nor do I need to listen to them on every single issue there is. At the end of the day, including every celebrity or band or anything in your feed just increases the “distraction” score in your feed.</p>
<p>Okay. Brands are out. Brand people are out. What next?</p>
<p>Follow thinkers. Follow do-ers. Follow people who are creating something.</p>
<p>Some follows I would recommend in no particular order:
<a href="https://twitter.com/naval/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> @naval </a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/nntaleb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> @nntaleb </a>,

<p>This is a subjective list, of course, but the idea remains the same: when you scroll - scroll to think, not to react. The posts/tweets in your feed should stop and make you think. If they enable <em>only</em> a reaction like rage or anxiety - remove it.</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>A simple heuristic to clean your social media feed:</p><p>Scroll to think, not to react</p><p>Reduce content that enables only a reaction. <br>Increase content that stops and makes you think.</p></div>— Akhil (@akhlkg) <a href="https://twitter.com/akhlkg/status/1346891698861862913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2021</a></blockquote> 

<p><strong>Tip #2</strong></p>
<p>When something is trending and it doesn’t really matter to you much, mute all the words/hashtags/etc related to it. The “Explore” section in Twitter is a black hole of distractions. Twitter will try to shove you up with random stuff all the time in your feed - but mute/block/ignore them all - this takes conscious effort but is well worth it.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/104541285-5691e200-5647-11eb-93d6-ed60a6cfa293.png" alt="twet.jpg"></p><p>If it's a trending event you do genuinely care about and you must “react” to it - here’s my two step strategy:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Ignore ‘the first wave’</strong></p>
<p>The first wave is the most emotional one. The purpose of the first wave, knowingly or unknowingly, is to polarise. There is no place for rationality in the first wave of posts, trends, articles, etc. You are likely going to see the same type/flavour of content - over and over from all sorts of people which essentially just convey the same thing in different shades of rage. There is nothing against the stream, yet. Mute ‘em all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assess the aftermath</strong></p>
<p>Once the first wave is gone and the hashtags die, start looking around. This can be anywhere from 1 week to several months depending on the issue. You are searching for truth, so don’t look at the news - if you’re reading articles online, don’t just look at one publisher, read on the same article by different publishers. Remember, each publishing house has a “flavour” of twisting things. An easy way to cancel the bias out is to read from many publishers and see what remains common. Now analyse the common facts - those are the fundamental facts that supposedly happened and anything above that, is just an opinion.</p>
<p>You can also look if the “thinkers” are reacting. If so, see what they are saying.
It takes effort to get to the truth and navigate through the noise, so I don’t end up doing this a lot of times because I simply didn't care about the event as much as I thought. And it looks like I end up doing okay.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>

<p>That’s about it. In theory, you can apply these principles to any social media platform. I tested and developed these on Twitter but the fundamental idea remains the same: <strong>scroll to think, not to react.</strong></p>
<p>And this fundamental idea helped me a lot. Twitter taught me a lot of things that form a core part of who I am now - staying healthy, strength training, mental models, entrepreneurship, making money online, writing.</p>
<p>You can use your distractions to literally change your life - and I really hope you do!</p></div></div>]]>

    <p>A hands on guide for individual developers, small teams without dedicated SRE or oncall teams to using Cloud services safely.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>About a month ago, I published two blog posts on our company blog sharing one of our stories that form our journey: <a href="https://blog.tomilkieway.com/72k-1/" target="_blank">We burnt $72K and almost went bankrupt</a>. The post was fairly well circulated in the tech community, and inspired me to write a post dedicated to the hacks that help me sleep better at night without having an oncall team to manage all the cloud services.</p>

<p>This post outlines practices I learnt and now practise for keeping a check on Cloud usage, and an attempt to eliminate possibilities of surprises.</p>

<h2 id="disclaimers-">Disclaimers (!)</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>1. If you're capable of hosting everything on your own server(s) ...
  </dt>
  <dd>Congratulations, you're one of the very few who have this knowledge and experience. You know what you're doing and keep it up. Depending on whether you have interest in Cloud platforms, this post may or may not add any value to you.</dd>

  <dt>2. Examples are centric to GCP but fundamentals should apply to all platforms</dt>
  <dd>Although examples in this post are on GCP, I've tried to structure around some fundamental vs. platform features. All cloud services have similar features, but they have different names, prices and usage policies.</dd>

  <dt>3. This is not an exhaustive list</dt>
  <dd>Like everyone, I'm still learning and growing. Below is what I learnt from several mistakes, figuring out solutions on my own and going through every piece of literature online from great kind minds. If you have more tips, feel free to share with me, and I'll be happy to add it to this list.</dd>

  <dt>4. This is a long post</dt>
  <dd>Sorry about it, but there's no way around it. If you find it useful and can't finish in one go, you can always come back to this post.</dd>

<h2 id="lets-jump-into-it">Let’s jump into it!</h2>
<hr>
<h3 id="1-use-multiple-forms-of-payments-fop-preferably-with-spend-caps">1. Use multiple forms of payments (FOP), preferably with spend caps</h3>
<p>Let’s begin with the simplest yet the most effective fixes.</p>

<center>
<img src="https://sudcha.com/assets/images/use-cloud/credit-card.jpg"><br>
</center>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Have spending limits/caps on the forms of payments (FOPs) you use.</strong> 
Most cloud services have a monthly billing except if a threshold spend is reached. If the threshold is reached, the Cloud platforms charge the given account right away. If for some reason, one of your services faulter, the cloud service would directly charge the form of payment (like credit cards) on file, and on non payment, stop the service.</p>

    <p>Ideally the spending limit could be anywhere between 120-150% of the cost you expect to incur given the usage of your platform.</p>

    <p>From what I’ve read, it’s relatively easier to get bill waived off than get a refund. While the suggestions in this post will make sure such situations don’t arise, it’s better to have it set up anyways.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Don’t use your $25,000 no limit credit card while setting up billing for a fresh account.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Use different FOPs for development and production.</strong><br>
After we messed up in one of our projects, our credit card was declined, and this had several unexpected ripple effects.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>First GCP suspended all our billing accounts tied to the same credit card for a suspect of fraud.</li>
      <li>Second, our bank started suspending all future transaction requests from GCP suspecting fraud.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Sorting this took several days, and it halted our development cycle. Thankfully we didn’t have a production service back then.</p>

    <p>In an ideal setup, I recommend using one FOP for production account, and another one for dev/test accounts. Never mix these two.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <br>
If you’re a solo developer, I highly recommend setting up an LLC or some umbrella that gives your personal assets protection. Doesn’t matter where you live, in recent years this process has become quite standard everywhere in the world, thanks to the entrepreneurial boom.</p>

<p>Some wise people online have suggested setting up a shell company (!). I personally don’t recommend spending time doing this. If you’re building something meaningful, spend all your time making it better in a legit way.</p>

<h3 id="2-setup-service-quotas">2. Setup Service Quotas</h3>
<p>In GCP users can define <a href="https://cloud.google.com/docs/quota">“Quotas”</a> for most services. AWS has similar feature called <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/intro.html" target="_blank">“Service Quotas”</a>, and I’m sure other providers have this as well.</p>

<p>Depending on type of Quota, some of them can be set for usage per day, per minute or even <em>per user</em> per minute. I don’t really trust the <em>per user</em> quota because who defines “a user”? The others quotas for the most part are fairly reliable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While GCP doesn’t allow auto cut off on billing, it does allow auto cut off based on usage, well at least for most services.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For any account with billing, when I enable a new service, I first check if there’s a quota, and if there’s one, I set it to really low while getting familiar with the service. A lot of the services are charged per use and setting up this quota also helps in validating the costs that will be incurred on use.</p>

<p>As an example, if I’m testing GCP Adult Image Classifier service, as soon as I enable the service, I would first set the Quota to <strong>100 per day</strong> and then try the codelab provided.</p>

<center>
<img src="https://sudcha.com/assets/images/use-cloud/vision-quota.png"><br>
</center>

<p>If the cloud provider you use neither has auto billing shutoff nor budgets, it should be a big red flag for you to use the service.</p>

<h4 id="some-caveats">Some Caveats</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Default Values are counter intuitive!</strong><br>
Most services have a preset default quota of unlimited or some absurd value like 1,000,000. Why? God knows. Maybe GCP engineers never paid attention to it, or they assume each of their users, considerable population of which is students, build apps with million dollar budgets.
Setting quotas is also multi click arduous process probably because they are optimized for large organizations. Don’t fret the extra clicks, it’s worth it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Not all services have Quota limits</strong><br>
For example Firestore Read/Write ops. From engineering standpoint, this is understandable because if the service has to check for quota, how can it be real time?
Don’t assume that every service has a quota.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Not all quotas work as advertised</strong><br>
Test each of the quotas before fully relying on them. I found several that <strong>don’t work</strong> and my consults led to bugs with Google. The bugs are not fixed yet, and so if something were to go wrong with those services, they would act as a fall back because it’s an issue on GCP’s side.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-cloud-monitoring">3. Cloud Monitoring</h3>
<p>While billing is delayed by about a day, most metrics provided by Cloud platforms are delayed by only a few minutes. For GCP this is called Cloud Monitoring, for AWS it’s called CloudWatch and in Microsoft - Azure Monitor.</p>

<p>These monitoring services are either free for the project services (standard metrics), or available at very, very cheap prices.</p>

<p>Setting up Monitoring wasn’t really in the face when I started using Cloud Services, nor is it generally advertised, but it’s a great feature that everyone should use.</p>

<p><strong>What it allows:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Creating beautiful custom dashboards with usage graphs for the services you care about</li>
  <li>Creating alerts that fire if usage goes beyond a user defined limit. The alerts can be SMS, email and app notifications.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="how-to-use-monitoring-service">How to use Monitoring service</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Set up Alerts</strong><br>
You can also set up alerts that’ll fire emails, text messages and mobile app notifications, all for free. While they may not be of much use while you’re sleeping, they do provide a lot of support while you’re awake.</p>

    <p>Case study from our development cycle:
During development of our first product Announce, one of the engineers on my team developing locally (live build on localhost) accidentally created an infinite loop that led to infinite Firebase read ops for a few minutes. We had a free limited project for development so nothing could go wrong, but the monitoring alerted me and I reached out to the team to see what was up.</p>

    <p>The only down side in this was that we had a very limited quota remaining for the day and the team waited until next day to resume development.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Look for spikes</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<center>
<img src="https://sudcha.com/assets/images/use-cloud/spike.png"><br>
<em>Always take the time to explain spikes in usage.</em>
</center>

<p>Most of the graphs may look daunting and it’s probably not worth understanding each and every metric and figure. To simplify your job, just look into anomalies.</p>

<p>After few steady days, your job should be to watch out for spikes in usage as compared to the usage in longer period of time. Set the usage to 6 weeks and see if there is a spike. If there is a spike, it should be explained, say too much local testing, surge in usage, expected triggers etc.</p>

<p>Looking for spikes only takes 2-3 minutes for the dashboard to load, and your job is done. This should be part of daily working routine if you have any service deployed on cloud.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Anticipate and Reduce Costs</strong><br>
As the graphs are only a few minutes late, after doing something you can wait for a few minutes to see what resources you consumed. You can also predict costs of something before it shows up in billing.</p>

    <p>Another big advantage is aide in reducing costs! For example, looking at Storage, I understood that GCP was continuously storing build artifacts from <em>each</em> build which took a development project storage that shouldn’t be using anymore than 100MB to 25GB. There are ways to fix this, but as a developer, one must know that this problem exists.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<center>
<img src="https://sudcha.com/assets/images/use-cloud/spike3.png"><br>
<em>High execution time could mean under allocation of resources, leading to more cost.
</em>
</center>

<p>Another example is memory or CPU consumption from the deployed services. Some graphs can easily tell if you have <strong>over/under allocation</strong> of resources to the services.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Write better Code</strong><br>
These graphs easily show low hanging fruits to optimize code. Maybe your cloud function is going into background processes, or perhaps its timing out due to some other service being called serially (instead of asynchronously).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-use-free-projects">4. Use Free Projects</h3>
<p>Cloud Platforms today provide a lot of free services per project, and there are a <strong>lot of projects that a user can create</strong>. There’s a reason why the systems are set up in such a way. Primary reason, as far as I can think of, is to give enough room for testing and learning about the service.</p>

<p>Firebase and GCP allow more than 10 …</p></div></div>

Many universities agree on the answer: “Absolutely nothing.”</p><p>Although anthropologists and archeologists still wonder why human beings have for so long organized themselves to fight, the study of war in history and political science departments is fading. Senior scholars are retiring and not being replaced, or their posts are allocated to other fields of history. Each year, fewer courses are offered on great conflicts such as the Napoleonic wars, the total wars of the 20th century, and the Cold War. The Second World War, you may hear on campus, “has been done.”</p><p>Yet war remains one of the events—along with revolution, famine, financial collapse and, as we are learning again, pandemics—that change the course of history. In privileged countries, we forget the importance of military conflicts because we have enjoyed the “Long Peace” that followed the Second World War. Other places have not been so fortunate, with wars around the world almost every year since 1945, bringing millions of deaths and creating millions more refugees. Meanwhile, the world’s great powers maintain large military establishments, and still prepare for battle. </p><p>It is as important as ever to understand war—its causes, nature and consequences—and the many ways that conflicts have shaped our societies. The conquering armies that came from the Arabian Peninsula in the 7th century after the Prophet Mohammad’s death created new empires and spread the new religion of Islam across the Middle East, North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula. The Seven Years’ War (1756-1763), a global conflict, laid the foundations for the dominance of the British Empire and the bankruptcy of France, which helped to fuel the French Revolution.&nbsp; </p><p>War can also speed up advances in science and technology that have benefits in peacetime. Think of the development of penicillin, blood transfusions, radar, or the transistor. And war can bring about significant social change, often for the better. The need for mass armies in the 19th and 20th centuries meant that governments had to treat the lower classes better, whether by educating them or by improving public health. In many countries that fought in the two world wars, ruling classes recognized the contributions of women and the working classes, granting them the franchise and introducing social benefits. </p><p>So why do history faculties, which accept the need to study other great forces in history, such as changes in the means of production or systems of belief, shy from war? I suspect that horror at the phenomenon itself has affected universities’ willingness to treat it as a subject for scholarship. Years ago, when I proposed a new course on war and society, an education consultant asked me, “Why don’t you call it peace studies?” </p><p>I have since met with incomprehension, even hostility, when I have pointed out that wars can bring unintended benefits. However much I say that we would not <em>choose</em> to make war in order to improve our societies, I am charged with loving war. Yet nobody would say that the study of imperialism, racism or famine means that we think those are good things.</p><p><strong>The history of war is neglected for other reasons, too. </strong>First, separate histories—of women, emotions, food and the environment, for example—have come along. Quite rightly, room has been made for them in the big and eclectic house that is the study of the past. However, part of the shift away from war studies owes to the quest for “social justice”—intended as a drive for radical change in society at large—that has taken root in many history faculties. </p><p>Here, for example, is how the chair of Historical and Cultural Studies at the Scarborough campus of the University of Toronto, Natalie Rothman, <a href="https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/hcs/">welcomed students</a> this autumn: “As a department, we have strengthened our resolve to confront racism, colonialism and Islamophobia throughout our curriculum and in our co-curricular initiatives.” The University of Berkeley in California <a href="https://history.berkeley.edu/graduate/prospective-students/admissions">asks prospective graduate students</a> to provide “evidence of how you have come to understand the barriers faced by others, evidence of your academic service to advance equitable access to higher education for women, racial minorities, and individuals from other groups that have been historically underrepresented in higher education, evidence of your research focusing on underserved populations or related issues of inequality, or evidence of your leadership among such groups.” It is hard to quarrel with such goals, but their impact on curriculum has been to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/29/opinion/why-did-we-stop-teaching-political-history.html?smid=em-share">downgrade subjects such as political and military history,</a> which are seen as too focused on elites and complicit with hierarchy and oppression. </p><p>Another factor is that history overall is worryingly in decline as an academic subject. While it remains popular among publishers and readers, enrollments in history majors are significantly down. They have <a href="https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/december-2018/the-history-ba-since-the-great-recession-the-2018-aha-majors-report">dropped more than any other major</a> in the humanities—perhaps by as much as <a href="http://www.chronicle.com/article/why-are-students-ditching-the-history-major">one-third</a> in <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/11/27/new-analysis-history-major-data-says-field-new-low-can-it-be-saved">American universities</a> in the past decade. At the University of Toronto, where I am a professor, colleagues fear that history enrollment may be down as much as 50% over the same period. Even in the United Kingdom, where history remains popular among undergraduates, the number of those majoring in history has dropped by about <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/07/18/the-study-of-history-is-in-decline-in-britain">one-tenth</a> in the past decade. </p><p>Part of the reason is that, given the lingering effects of the 2008 financial crisis and uncertainty over the economy, students and their parents want university courses to lead to jobs. The decline in history students in turn affects university hiring, and the fewer the tenured faculty, the fewer places for the doctoral students who are the future of the profession.&nbsp; </p><p>Faculties and administrators are not necessarily helping matters, reluctant to include popular courses on war in the curriculum, or to support well-established centers for the study of conflict, some of which are being remodeled, such as the Laurier Centre for Military, Strategic and Disarmament Studies, in Waterloo, Ontario, which will focus more on Canadian history; another at the University of Calgary is fading as those who retire are not replaced. This seems to be particularly true of elite universities. War studies remains in better health at military colleges or some second-tier public universities, while schools of public policy are also still teaching military history, strategic studies and diplomatic history. </p><p>But those in other fields stereotype war studies, characterizing it as too narrowly focused on tactics, battles, or “toys for boys,” meaning armaments. If that caricature were ever true, it has not been for decades. The great historian Sir Michael Howard, who pioneered the modern study of war and trained generations of historians, always insisted that what he was doing was to consider wars within their social and political contexts as a part of the great sweep of history, not somehow separate from it. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>My own evidence of the distaste for military and diplomatic history </strong>at North American universities comes from tales exchanged privately among fellow academics. One retired Canadian military historian recounted that his old faculty had asked him how to reverse the collapse in enrollment. He suggested a course in military history, but the response was a flat no. When a university in the Maritime provinces of eastern Canada was offered a fully funded post in naval history a few years ago—a good fit in a port town that had been deeply affected by conflict on the Atlantic—members of the department rejected it. </p><p>Yet, despite the overall downturn in university history programs, we know from course enrollments that students are interested in war, as indeed they are in international relations, when they get the chance to study them: At Yale, Paul Kennedy’s “Military History of the West” attracted large crowds; at Toronto’s Ryerson University, international relations courses are the most popular choices among students.</p><p>I would not suggest that student preference should determine what departments offer. But they should at least be listened to. Much more important is what we, as societies, want our future leaders to know. Political history, diplomatic history and the study of war—they all offer critical warnings and instructive analogies to our times. Social and cultural histories, and history from the bottom up, add to our understanding too. But we need balance, and a sense of how the micro- and macro-histories mesh with each other. </p><p>Do we really want citizens who have so little knowledge of how war helped to shape our values and societies and our world? Do we ever want another president asking, as Donald Trump <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-pearl-harbor-memorial-tour-john-kelly-stable-genius-2020-1?r=US&amp;IR=T">did</a> during a visit to the Pearl Harbor memorial: “What’s this all about? What’s this a tour of?” </p><p>If we aren’t aware of how wars happen, we may fail to recognize warning signs when the next conflict brews, as it will. </p><p><strong>Margaret MacMillan is a professor of history at the University of Toronto and emeritus professor at the University of Oxford. Her latest book, </strong><em><strong><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/609692/war-how-conflict-shaped-us-by-margaret-macmillan/">War: How Conflict Shaped Us</a></strong></em><strong>, was among the </strong><em><strong>New York Times</strong></em><strong> 10 Best Books of 2020. </strong></p></div></div>]]>

<h2><span id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h2>
<h3><span id="Trump_is_a_product_of_bad_schooling">Trump is a product of bad schooling</span></h3>
<p>Donald Trump is the most erratic president in the US history.
</p><p>If I told you I blame the education system for the emergence of Trump, you would probably first think about the president's own spotty world knowledge. His presidential credentials are not too strong in that department. However, his education is still well above the average. If I added that my claim is not about Trump but about society, your second bet might be placed on the dismal level of education provided by American schools. I would reply that it does not take a genius to differentiate between qualities of Trump, Hillary, Bush or Obama.
</p><p>Education systems around the world are under the assault of critics of all sorts. We keep complaining and the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Reform" title="Reform">change is coming</a>. However, there is still a last bastion of schooling that seems pretty resistant: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Socialization" title="Socialization">socialization</a>. There is an overwhelming belief that kids get their socialization at school. Even the best homeschoolers or unschoolers have to repeatedly answer the question: "<i>What about socialization?</i>". In this text, I show that <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Social_groups_in_socialization#Socialization:_Open_and_closed_systems" title="Social groups in socialization">open system socialization</a> would never let Trump emerge as the leader of the world. A tempered version of Trump might still be successful in real estate. He would be more ethical, less bombastic, more knowledgeable, less angry, more tame, etc. In open socialization, Trump would be better, Trump would be less prominent, and Trump would not care about his prominence.
</p><p>We socialize children for readiness in the idealized society. As a result, they are not ready to face dangers of reality. If Donald Trump sparked a nuclear war, I would blame the polished socialization based on polished rules in closed systems such as schools or daycare centers. 
</p>
<p>Instead of preparing children for an idealized society, we should let them adopt freely to real social environments</p>
<h3><span id="Why_should_I_speak_about_Trump.3F">Why should I speak about Trump?</span></h3>
<p>Using Trump's rich twitter feed, many a psychiatrist cannot patiently watch the show without a burning itch to violate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldwater_rule">Goldwater rule</a>. It is tempting to produce a distance diagnosis from the comfort of one's own keyboard.
</p><p>I am also mystified by Trump's brain and behavior. However, my diagnosis is pretty different from the consensus that seems to emerge in the media. My viewpoint is unique for two reasons. On one hand, my work on memory, learning, creativity, and intelligence provide a unique interpretation for Trump's thinking and his behavior. My knowledge exculpates the president on many counts. On the other hand, my own behavior and personality show some parallels that help me empathetically get into Trump's head. I need to hurry to add that I respect women, honor the truth, value the rich constellation of cultures, and worship science. However, my similarities with Trump go deep into how my brain works, and why it sets us both well apart from the social norm.
</p><p>In the end, I believe my conclusions are pretty important. If I am right, we will know how to handle Trump, and how to prevent future Trumps from becoming troublemakers.
</p>
<h3><span id="Diagnosis_by_media">Diagnosis by media</span></h3>
<p>Hundreds of armchair critics, haters, and homegrown scientists have hypothesized on the reasons for Donald Trump's weirdness. Serious scientists also took on the job of "remote diagnosis" with most of the conclusions drawn from news reports on Trump's behavior and decisions. I respect the Goldwater rule when it comes to serious diagnosis. Barry Goldwater was also "remotely" diagnosed as "unfit to be president". Psychiatrists tried to avoid making wild generalizations ever since. However, there should be no gag order on a free discussion. This is why I do not mind "virtual science at a distance". I like hypotheses and models, even if <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/What%27s_the_value_of_wrong_models%3F" title="What's the value of wrong models?">they are wrong</a>. Luckily, I am no psychiatrist, and I need not worry about my license and reputation.
</p><p>In wild hypothesizing, Trump is a particularly interesting case because he makes news daily, and so do critics who bring forward a whole array of mental diseases and cognitive impairments. My interest in Trump's brain comes from the fact that my job provides an entirely different perspective, and to the chagrin of all antagonists, I must say that I see no signs of serious pathology. Just the opposite, Trump's brain is pretty good a specimen that many should envy. A good brain does not prevent committing abhorrent acts such as "<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44518942">putting kids in cages</a>" (compare: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Would_you_have_a_heart_to_cage_a_puppy%3F" title="Would you have a heart to cage a puppy?">Putting puppies in cages</a>). The trick to a well-organized society is to find ways to employ good brains for a good cause. I see a couple of reasons why this is not the case for Trump.
</p>
<h3><span id="When_Goldwater_rule_does_not_apply">When Goldwater rule does not apply</span></h3>
<p>Sharon Begley argues the pros and cons of the Goldwater rule in her article "<a href="http://www.statnews.com/2017/12/06/goldwater-rule-psychiatry/">Experts challenge the science behind ban on psychiatrists discussing politicians’ mental health</a>".
</p><p>If psychiatry is an art, we can often arrive at major differences of opinion. Apparently, personality disorders are particularly affected. Most of all, if Trump's prime diagnosis is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder">narcisissm</a>, he is a particularly grateful subject for analysis. Here is an excerpt from Begley's argument (shortened):
</p>
<blockquote><div><p>The flaws of psychiatric exams and the usefulness of other data make the Goldwater rule "scientifically indefensible," said Dr. Leonard Glass, a psychiatrist at McLean Hospital and Harvard Medical School. "I sort of believed" that interviews offer the clearest window into someone’s mind, he said.</p><p>"Psychiatrists are taught that if a patient says he has three drinks a day, double that," said Dr Glass. "The psychiatric interview is flawed." His and other psychiatrists’ clinical experience is backed up by studies going back to the <a href="http://www.wpic.pitt.edu/research/biometrics/Publications/Biometrics%20Archives%20PDF/614Spitzer&amp;Fleiss1974.pdf">1970s</a> in which patients were examined by two psychiatrists <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2990547/">back-to-back</a>. The rate of agreement was so low that "the unreliability of psychiatric diagnosis has been and still is a major problem in psychiatry," researchers concluded. Later studies reported similar discrepancies, especially for <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cpsp.12088/abstract">personality disorders</a>, finding that examination-based conclusions by a psychiatrist often <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-39264-001">disagree with</a> assessments in a structured research setting.</p><p>Markers of pathological narcissism — grandiose self-importance, entitlement, exploitativeness, and lack of empathy — can be seen in someone’s public behavior, especially in the case of a public figure whose behavior and speech has been documented in hundreds of hours of TV interviews, speeches, offhand remarks, and tweets, plus the accounts of people who have lived or worked closely with him. This evidence can also be <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17629778">more accurate</a> than information from formal examinations.</p></div></blockquote>
<h3><span id="Is_virtual_psychiatric_diagnosis_valid.3F">Is virtual psychiatric diagnosis valid?</span></h3>
<p>I refuse to give up modelling, or speaking about brains, esp. in a situation where important conclusions can be drawn and inspire others. This is also my chance to transmit an important message about the school system. I claim that Trump is a child of modern schooling. In part, schooling might have damaged Trump. But more importantly, schooling damaged the electorate that Trump can now easily play with his social tricks.
</p><p>Secondly, we can't escape semi-professional psychiatric diagnosis and/or hypothesizing. Hillary 2016 was also a subject of wild hypotheses. At some point a strong meme started circulating the net: she suffered a serious brain trauma in a fall. Allegedly, she was no longer fit to be president.
</p><p>I was a subject of a pop diagnosis too. My own odd behavior was at times explained by my colleagues as a result of growing up without a father. I disagree: I had a dad and two moms (with my older siblings playing the roles). I was also a subject of a wild hypothesis that my <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Can_incremental_reading_cause_brain_damage%3F" title="Can incremental reading cause brain damage?">brain may have been injured</a> by decades of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading" title="Incremental reading">incremental reading</a>. That diagnosis makes me grin and giggle. The childish side of my personality makes me enjoy that kind of anxious theory. Most importantly, such a misdiagnosis is a fantastic ground for inspiration and further analysis.
</p><p>I see nothing wrong with hypothesizing, esp. when it is done in a casual blog with all caveats listed. I stand for <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/On_freedom_of_education_and_freedom_of_information" title="On freedom of education and freedom of information">free speech</a>, and I love inspiration.
</p><p>Some of my words in this text might be a bit offensive to president Trump, and I hate to offend. However, so many bad things have been said about the president, that my text may actually be taken as preponderantly complimentary.
</p>
<h3><span id="Trump.27s_brain_is_good">Trump's brain is good</span></h3>
<p>Opponents may hate to admit it, but Trump's brain is strong and his success is attributable to his brain properties.
</p><p>Most of the criticism of Trump's brain comes from the fact that we have set up a set of standards that we believe world leaders should live up to. They range from moral standards to <a href="https://www.theringer.com/tech/2017/8/30/16224184/president-trump-twitter-spelling">spelling</a>. In psychiatry, we should always divide abnormal behavior into two categories: (1) <b>deviant</b> and (2) <b>maladaptive</b>. In addition, we need to separate (1) cognitive <b>tradeoff</b> from (2) cognitive <b>pathology</b>.
</p><p>Trump meets all the criteria of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder">narcissistic personality disorder</a> except for one key factor: his narcissism does not lead to a significant impairment in functioning (in the light of his own goals). Just the opposite. Trump can use his bombast to his advantage. It might be a classic compensation via training. All healthy brains are capable of an excellent adaptation to the environment. Trump's brain has adapted to compensate for a great deal of bullets taken straight from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-5">DSM-5</a>.
</p><p>Trump is highly deviant, but his adaptation is excellent. He won the presidency. If an individual with a set of maladaptive traits could achieve that, we should fear for the future of democracy. Trump is also high on cognitive tradeoffs: he is strong at spotting patterns, and this characteristic always comes with a high disregard for detail. This is a typical cognitive tradeoff.
</p><p>In summary, Trump's brain is strong. A strong brain does not prevent one from being a freak.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>While developing the firmware for Winterbloom's <a href="https://github.com/theacodes/Winterbloom_Castor_and_Pollux">Castor &amp; Pollux</a>, I got very curious as to just what the Microchip/Atmel-provided linker script was doing.</p>
<p>If you've never heard of or seen a linker script before you're not alone. Most of us never even have to think about them, however, on memory constained embedded devices it's not uncommon to need to modify the default linker script.</p>
<p>The linker script controls how <code>ld</code> combines all of your <code>.o</code> files into a single <code>.elf</code> and how that resulting <code>.elf</code> file gets loaded by the target processor.</p>
<p>So I was staring at this script that made absolutely no sense to me. It's filled with incantations and mysterious symbols and there's no indication of what they're for or where they come from.</p>
<p>So I did a <strong>lot</strong> of research and now I can present to you <strong>the most thoroughly commented linker script</strong><sup id="fnref:probably"><a href="#fn:probably">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>You can see this script in its entirety, comments and all, on <a href="https://github.com/theacodes/Winterbloom_Castor_and_Pollux/blob/master/firmware/scripts/samd21g18a.ld">GitHub</a>. But if you'd like to read it here instead it's transcribed below.</p>
<h2 id="output-format">Output format</h2>
<p>Output format sets the ELF output format to use a specific BFD backend.</p>
<p>The first is the default BFD. The second and third arguments are used
when big (-EB) or little (-EL) endian is requested.</p>
<p>Since the SAM D series are configured with only little endian support,
"elf32-littlearm" is used across the board. This option seems to be
included by Atmel/Microchip out of an abundance of caution, as
arm-none-eabi-ld will do the right thing and use "elf32-littlearm" by
default.</p>
<p>The list of acceptable values can be obtained using <code>objdump -i</code>.</p>

<p>These variables are used by the following "MEMORY" command to define
the various memory spaces.</p>
<p>For the SAMD21G18A used by this project, the available Flash is
262kB and the available SRAM is 32kB.</p>
<p>This project also reserves 8kB for the bootloader and 1kB for
"non-volatile memory" (NVM) - which is used by the application
to store calibration and user settings.</p>

<p>ARM Cortex-M processors use a descending stack and generally
require stack space to be set aside in RAM.</p>
<p>The application's behavior determines just how much stack space
should be reserved. I generally start with 2kB (0x800) of
stack space for Cortex-M0+ projects programmed in C .</p>
<p>You can analyze stack usage in GCC using the <code>-fstack-usage</code>
flag and you can enable compiler warnings for stack usage
with <code>-Wstack-usage=STACK_SIZE</code>.</p>

<p>This section declare blocks of memories for specific purposes. Since an
ARM's address space is generally split between Flash, SRAM, peripherals,
and other regions, it's necessary to tell the linker where different
types of data can go in the address space.</p>
<p>These blocks will be used in the <code>SECTIONS</code> command below.</p>

</pre>
<p>Start with the Flash memory region. On the SAMD21, Flash starts at
the beginning of the address space (<code>0x00000000</code>) and is contiguous
right up to the size of the Flash. Flash is marked a <code>rx</code> so
that the linker knows that this space is read-only (<code>r</code>) and
executable (<code>x</code>).</p>
<p>The "bootloader" section allows this firmware to work with the uf2
bootloader. The bootloader takes the first 0x2000 bytes of flash
memory.</p>
<p>References:</p>

</pre>
<p>Following the bootloader is the flash memory used by the application,
called "rom" here - even though it's flash, the name is just a name
and doesn't carry special meaning.</p>
<p>The total length of the rom block is the MCU's flash size minus the
bootloader's size and any space reserved for "non-volatile memory"
by the application.</p>

</pre>
<p>The "nvm" block is space set aside for the application to store
user settings and calibration data in the MCU's flash.</p>
<p>The block is located right at the end of the flash space. This
is useful because it means that it says in a fixed location
regardless of how much flash space the application takes up
in "rom". Explicitly defining this section also lets the
linker ensure that application code doesn't overwrite the
data in this region.</p>
<p>This block is marked as read-only (<code>r</code>) because flash can not
be written in the same way as normal memory, however, the
application can use the SAMD's NVM peripheral to write data in
this region.</p>

<p>The "ram" block is mapped to the CPU's SRAM and it's where
the stack, heap, and all variables will go.</p>
<p>For the SAMD21, SRAM starts at 0x20000000 and is contiguous
for the size of the SRAM.</p>

<h2 id="sections">Sections</h2>
<p>The sections command tells the linker how to combine the
input files into an output ELF and where segments belong
in memory.</p>
<p>The linker takes a set of input files containing the "input
sections" and uses this to map them to "output sections"
which are placed in the output ELF file.</p>
<p>While the most important sections to think about here
are the ones that'll be placed into the memory (segments)
some sections are just placed in the output ELF for debugging.</p>

<p>The vector table defines the initial stack pointer and
interrupt/exception routines for the ARM CPU and device
peripherals. Every Cortex-M project needs this.</p>
<p>For the SAM D series the vector table is expected
to be at address 0x00000000 after reset. Since
flash memory starts at 0x00000000, the first values
in flash should be the vector table.</p>
<p>When defining the vector table in code you must use
<code>__attribute__ ((section(".vectors")))</code> to tell
GCC to place the vector table into the section
named ".vectors" in the input object file so that
the linker can find it.</p>
<p>Note that since this project uses the UF2 bootloader,
this actually gets placed at the beginning of the
program's flash area (0x2000). The Cortex-M allows
changing the vector table after initialization,
so the startup script sets the Vector Table Offset
Register (<code>SCB-&gt;VTOR</code>) to <code>_sfixed</code> during its
intialization. The <code>_efixed</code> symbol is unused but
included for completeness.</p>

<p>Include code and read-only data sections from all
input files.</p>
<p>By default, GCC places all program code into a section named
".text" and read-only data (such as const static variables) into
a section named ".rodata" in the input object files. This naming
convention is from the ELF ABI specification.</p>
<p>GCC generates three "flavors" of sections in object files:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.{section}</code>: the basic section.</li>
<li><code>.{section}.*</code>: sections generated by <code>-ffunction-sections</code> and
<code>-fdata-sections</code> so that each function/data has a unique
section.</li>
<li><code>.gnu.linkonce.{type}.*</code>: sections generated by GCC so the
linker can remove duplicates. Seems to be related to
Vague Linking.</li>

          <center><h2>Open Source Archetypes:<br>A Framework For Purposeful Open Source</h2></center>

          <p>“Open source” means many things to many people.  Many kinds
          of projects get grouped under the label "open source", and
          they may operate in very different ways.  Sometimes it helps to think
          through how an effort’s open source approach matches its
          goals, resources, and environment.  Our
          <a href="https://opentechstrategies.com/archetypes-files/open-source-archetypes-v2.pdf">field guide to Open Source Archetypes</a> is designed to help
          with that thinking, by providing a common vocabulary to
          discuss open source in ways that take account of important
          differences.</p>

          <p>The guide describes and compares a number of project
          archetypes we have observed.  We prepared it in partnership
          with <a href="https://mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>, and our
          organizations (as well
          as <a href="https://blog.jwf.io/2020/11/open-source-archetypes-unicef-open-source/">others</a>) have found it useful in deciding how to invest
          in open source endeavors.</p>

          <!-- Search for "vh_height" in xsl/ots.xsl. -->

          <p>We hope it is useful to you as you design open source
          initiatives, weigh tradeoffs in strategy, and pick metrics to
          track success. The archetypes we list are useful comparison
          points for anybody trying to maximize the benefits of their
          open source investment.</p>

<article id="3674">







<section id=""><div><p>Anyone versed in the utopian strain of contemporary science fiction needs no introduction to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Stanley_Robinson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kim Stanley Robinson’s</a> work. No living author has spent as much of his oeuvre grappling with the idea, its implications, and its achievability.</p>
<p><em>Pacific Edge</em>, his third novel (published in 1990), predates the Mars series he’s best known for and introduces many of the themes that permeate his later work<em>.</em> A deceptively low-stakes story of infatuation and heartbreak set against the backdrop of small town civic life in Orange County circa 2065, it paints a quietly powerful portrait of a California recovering from the excesses of late capitalism, but (this being America) still negotiating a balance between commerce, community, and the land.</p>
<p>It has never been more relevant. Here are some choice excerpts. ☼</p>
</div>

<section id=""><div><p>“For now, all is calm. White flakes falling. I write in a kind of pocket utopia, a little island of calm in a maddened world. Perhaps it will help make my future seem more plausible to me—perhaps, remembering Switzerland, it will even seem possible. But there’s no such thing as a pocket utopia.”</p>
<p>✳︎ ✳︎ ✳︎</p>
<p>“I hated capitalism because it was a lie!” Tom would say, fording Harding Canyon stream with abandon. “It said that everyone exercising their self-interest would make a decent community! Such a lie!” Splash, splash! “It was government as protection agency, a belief system for the rich. Why, even when it seemed to work, where did it leave them? Holed up in mansions and crazy as loons.” “But some people like to be alone.” “Yeah, yeah. And self-interest exists, no one can say it doesn’t—the governments that tried got in deep trouble, because that’s a lie of a different kind. But to say self-interest is all that exists, or that it should be given free rein! My Lord. Believe that and nothing matters but money.” “But you changed that,” Kevin would say, watching his footwork. “Yes, we did. We gave self-interest some room to work in, but we limited it. Channeled it toward the common good. That’s the job of the law, as we saw it then.” He laughed. “Legislation is a revolutionary power, boy, though it’s seldom seen as such. We used it for all it was worth, and most liked the results, except for some of the rich, who fought like wolverines to hold on to what they had. In fact that’s a fight that’s still going on. I don’t think it will ever end.”</p>

<section id=""><p>“We are the aristocracy of the world. But this time the revolution will bring down more than the aristocracy. Could be everything. Crumpled newspaper, compartmentalized disaster. Catastrophe by percentage points. We can avoid it, I swear we can. Must concentrate on that to be able to continue.”</p>

<section id=""><div><p>“We can protest, I say. Pam shakes her head, mouth bitter. Picks up In’tl Herald Tribune. Southern Club defaulting on all debt. Prediction of twenty-five percent reduction in world population called optimistic by. Civil war in India, in Mexico, in. Deforestation in. World temperature up another degree Centigrade since. Species going extinct— I’ve already read it.”</p>

<p>“My daily workload reminds me constantly that in fact it exists entangled in intricate webs of law. Their system is a mix, combining a communalism of the Santa Rosa model—land and public utilities owned in common, residents required to do ten hours a week of town work, a couple of town-owned businesses in operation to use all the labor available, that sort of thing—with aspects of the new federal model: residents are taxed more and more heavily as they approach the personal income cap, and they can direct 60 percent of their taxes to whatever services they support the most. Businesses based in town are subject to the same sort of graduated system. I am familiar with much of this from my years in Bishop, which has a similar system. As usual in these set-ups, the town is fairly wealthy, even if it is avoided by businesses looking for the best break possible. From all the income generated, a town share is distributed back out to the citizens, which comes to about twice the national income floor. But people still complain that it isn’t higher. Everyone wants to be a hundred. And here they believe that a properly run town could make everyone hit the cap as a matter of course. Thus there is the kind of intense involvement with town politics typical of these set-ups, government mixed with business mixed with life-styles, etc.”</p>

<p>“What a cheat utopias are, no wonder people hate them. Engineer some fresh start, an island, a new continent, dispossess them, give them a new planet sure! So they don’t have to deal with our history. Ever since More they’ve been doing it: rupture, clean cut, fresh start. So the utopias in books are pocket utopias too. Ahistorical, static, why should we read them? They don’t speak to us trapped in this world as we are, we look at them in the same way we look at the pretty inside of a paperweight, snow drifting down, so what? It may be nice but we’re stuck here and no one’s going to give us a fresh start, we have to deal with history as it stands, no freer than a wedge in a crack.”</p>

<section id=""><p>“Must redefine utopia. It isn’t the perfect end-product of our wishes, define it so and it deserves the scorn of those who sneer when they hear the word. No. Utopia is the process of making a better world, the name for one path history can take, a dynamic, tumultuous, agonizing process, with no end. Struggle forever. Compare it to the present course of history. If you can.”</p>

<section id=""><div><p>“Kevin listened to the wind, and looked around at the dark peaks poking into the night sky. Suddenly it was clear to him that Sally had had a reason to bring them up here to have this talk; that this place itself was part of the discourse, part of what she wanted to say. The university of the wilderness. The spine of California, the hidden source of the south’s wealth. This hard wild place.”</p>
<p>✳︎ ✳︎ ✳︎</p>
<p>“She saw the doggie look on my face, smiled. “So how’d the book go?” “The same.” It’s not fair, really. I can’t understand a word she says when she talks of her work, while for me, on this project at least, she is a crucial sounding board. “I’m thinking of alternating chapters of fiction with essay chapters which discuss the political and economic problems we need to solve.” “My God.” Wrinkled nose, as if something gone bad in fridge. “Hey, H.G. Wells did it.” “Which book?” “Well—one of the major utopian novels.” “Still in print?” “No.” “Libraries have it?” “University libraries.” “So Wells’s science fiction adventures are still in every library and bookstore, while this major utopia with the essays is long gone, and you can’t even remember the title?” I changed the subject. Think I might pass on the essays.”</p>
<p>✳︎ ✳︎ ✳︎</p>
<p>“They stepped and balanced, hopped and teetered. Occasionally they bumped together, arm to arm. Their skin was warm in the sun. They talked about this and that, and Kevin felt certain boundaries disappearing. Ramona was willing to talk about anything, now, about things beyond the present moment. Childhoods in El Modena and at the beach. The boats offshore. Their work. The people they knew. The huge rocks jumbled under them: “Where did they come from, anyway?” They didn’t know. It didn’t matter. What do you talk about when you’re falling in love? It doesn’t matter. All the questions are, Who are you? How do you think? Are you like me? Will you love me? And all the answers are, I am like this, like this, like this. I am like you. I like you.”</p>

<section id=""><p>Strange, this life, isn’t it? We think, nothing could ever get more real than this! Then this becomes nothing more than a darting fragmentary complex of pure mentation, while a new reality, more real than ever! steps in to obscure all previous candidates.

<section id=""><div><p>“Been on plane four hours now. Liddy finally asleep. Tapping on lap keyboard. Might as well distract myself. Strategies for changing history. Invent the history leading out of this world (please) into the world of the book. Causes of utopian process gaining upper hand. Words scroll up and disappear forever, like days. Lincoln not assassinated, no, no, we know it didn’t happen that way, we know we can’t take that road. Not useful. Someone appears to lead us, no! No Great Man theory here. No individual can save us. Together or not at all. Together or nothing. Ah, Pamela— Some group. In power or out. Act together. Say lawyers, the law? Still can’t escape the feeling that there’s where a difference could be made, despite my own experience. Remake the law of the land. Say a whole class of Harvard Law School, class of ’12 goes out to fill posts of all kinds, government, World Bank, IMF, Pentagon. Save the twenty-first century. Plausible? No. A story. But at least it’s possible, I mean we could do it! Nothing stopping us but inertia, ideology. Lack of imagination! Teachers, religious leaders&nbsp;… but there are few politically active people in any group. And to agree on a whole program of action, all of them. How implausible can something be before it’s useless? It’s conspiracy theory, really. We don’t need that either. History changed by a popular book, a utopia, everyone reads it and it has ideas, or vague pokes in the direction of ideas, it changes their thinking, everyone starts working for a better world— Getting desperate. Marcuse: one of the worst signs of our danger is we can’t imagine the route from here to utopia. No way to get there. Take the first step and you’re there. Process, dynamism, the way is the life.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>In my quest for designing a universal representation of code across all programming languages, I've been trying to build a deeper understanding of advanced language features. One feature that stands out is TypeScript's advanced type system, which allows types to be computed from other types. First, let's go through a quick intro, then we'll see how it could be interpreted in a different way.</p>
<h2>Introduction to TypeScript</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">TypeScript</a> is a powerful type system for JavaScript. It lets you catch issues early in the development process, such as accessing the wrong property of an object or passing an invalid function argument:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>type</span> User <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  name<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span>
  login<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span>
  age<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>,</span>
  comments<span>:</span> Comment<span>[</span><span>]</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>

<span>function</span> <span>greet</span><span>(</span><span>user<span>:</span> User</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>alert</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Hi </span><span><span>${</span>user<span>.</span>firstName<span>}</span></span><span>!</span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  
<span>}</span>

<span>greet</span><span>(</span><span>"Bob"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>TypeScript offers advanced features such as string literal types and unions. Here is an example in action:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>type</span> Color <span>=</span> <span>'white'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'red'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'green'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'yellow'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'blue'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'black'</span><span>;</span>

<span>function</span> <span>fill</span><span>(</span><span>color<span>:</span> Color</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  
<span>}</span>

<span>fill</span><span>(</span><span>'green'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>


<span>fill</span><span>(</span><span>'rainbow'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Generic types in TypeScript</h2>
<p>What makes TypeScript particularly useful is its support for generic types, which let you manipulate and transform types.</p>
<p>Here is one example with the generic type <code>Pick</code> from the <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">official docs</a>. <code>Pick</code> allows you to define a type that has specific keys in common with another type. This can be useful when you want to make sure that two types stay consistent with each other:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>type</span> Pick<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>K</span> <span>extends</span> <span>keyof</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>[</span><span>P</span> <span>in</span> <span>K</span><span>]</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>[</span><span>P</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>

<span>type</span> User <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  name<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span>
  login<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span>
  age<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>,</span>
  comments<span>:</span> Comment<span>[</span><span>]</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>

<span>type</span> UserPreview <span>=</span> Pick<span>&lt;</span>User<span>,</span> <span>'name'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'age'</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>


<span>type</span> UserPreview <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  name<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span>
  age<span>:</span> <span>number</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Explaining the Pick generic type</h2>
<p>TypeScript's type manipulation syntax can be quite difficult to grasp. If you're struggling to understand what <code>Pick</code> does, you're not alone.</p>
<p>Let's decompose it to understand exactly what it does:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>Pick&lt;T, K&gt;</code> means that <code>Pick</code> expects two type parameters which we name <code>T</code> and <code>K</code>. We could just as well have named them <code>Foo</code> and <code>Bar</code> if we wanted to. Using single-letter type names is only a convention.</li>
<li><code>K extends keyof T</code> means that a type passed as <code>K</code> must be a subset of the type of keys of <code>T</code> (<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html#generic-constraints" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">see generic constraints</a>).</li>
<li><code>[P in K]: X</code> means that for each possible value <code>P</code> in <code>K</code>, we declare a property <code>P</code> of type <code>X</code> (<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#mapped-types" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">see mapped types</a>).</li>
<li><code>T[P]</code> means that we look up the type of the property <code>P</code> of type <code>T</code> (<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/indexed-access-types.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">see indexed access types</a>).</li>
</ol>
<p>In our example, we invoked <code>Pick&lt;User, 'name' | 'age'&gt;</code> which means:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>T</span> <span>=</span> User
<span>K</span> <span>=</span> <span>'name'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'age'</span>
<span>keyof</span> <span>T</span> <span>=</span> <span>'name'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'login'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'age'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'comments'</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>K</code> is indeed a subset of <code>keyof T</code>, so the condition specified in (2) is satisfied.</p>
<p>The possible values of <code>P</code> are <code>'name'</code> and <code>'age'</code> so:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>type</span> UserPreview <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>[</span><span>'name'</span><span>]</span><span>:</span> User<span>[</span><span>'name'</span><span>]</span><span>,</span>
  <span>[</span><span>'age'</span><span>]</span><span>:</span> User<span>[</span><span>'age'</span><span>]</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Since <code>User['name']</code> is <code>string</code> and <code>User['age']</code> is <code>number</code>, the resulting type is indeed:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>type</span> UserPreview <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>[</span><span>'name'</span><span>]</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span>
  <span>[</span><span>'age'</span><span>]</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is equivalent to what we had earlier:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>type</span> UserPreview <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  name<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span>
  age<span>:</span> <span>number</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>The Return generic type</h2>
<p>Here is another example. <code>Return&lt;T&gt;</code> lets you extract the return type of a function:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>type</span> Return<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>T</span> <span>extends</span> <span>(</span><span><span>...</span>args<span>:</span> <span>any</span><span>[</span><span>]</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> infer <span>R</span> <span>?</span> <span>R</span> <span>:</span> <span>never</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let's decompose this one:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Return&lt;T&gt;</code> means that it expects a single type parameter.</li>
<li><code>T extends X ? A : B</code> means that that if <code>T</code> "extends" <code>X</code>, the generic type will return <code>A</code>, otherwise <code>B</code> (<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-8.html#conditional-types" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">see conditional type</a>).</li>
<li><code>(...args: any[]) =&gt; infer R</code> represents any function (any number of arguments of any type). The <code>infer</code> keyword here allows us to refer to the function's return type as <code>R</code> (<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-8.html#type-inference-in-conditional-types" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">see inferred types</a>).</li>
<li><code>never</code> is a type of values that never occur. There are no possible values of type <code>never</code>, not even <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code> (<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html#never" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">see basic types</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>If we pass it a function type, we'll get its return type:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>123</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>type</span> Example <span>=</span> Return<span>&lt;</span><span>typeof</span> f<span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>


<span>type</span> Example <span>=</span> <span>number</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>On the other hand if we pass it a type that doesn't represent a function, we'll get <code>never</code>:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>type</span> Example <span>=</span> Return<span>&lt;</span><span>number</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>  </code></pre></div>
<p>The examples we've just seen are, perhaps surprisingly, fairly simple generic types. It can get complicated quite quickly, to the point where <a href="https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">TypeScript challenges have emerged</a>. In fact, TypeScript's type system is powerful enough to be <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/14833" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Turing Complete</a>.</p>
<h2>A different perspective</h2>
<p>As part of my research into <a href="https://fwouts.com/projects" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Graphene</a>, I started exploring the meaning of generic types a little deeper. One particular analogy I wanted to explore was the difference between functions and generic types. Can we see types as values, and generic types as type-level functions?</p>
<h3>Types as values</h3>
<p>First, it's worth noting that a type definition looks a lot like a value. Notice the similarity between:</p>
<p><em>A variable assignment in JavaScript</em></p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>let</span> user <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  name<span>:</span> <span>"Bob"</span><span>,</span>
  login<span>:</span> <span>"robert"</span><span>,</span>
  age<span>:</span> <span>30</span><span>,</span>
  comments<span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p><em>A corresponding type declaration in TypeScript</em></p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>type</span> User <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  name<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span>
  login<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span>
  age<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>,</span>
  comments<span>:</span> Comment<span>[</span><span>]</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can think of <code>User</code> as a value, which is composed of other values such as <code>string</code>, <code>number</code> and <code>Comment[]</code>. They all belong to the same "space of types". Unlike JavaScript values, which exist at runtime, type values exist at compile time.</p>
<h3>Generic types as functions</h3>
<p>Next, let's look at generic types. Could we think of them as functions?</p>
<h4>Pick&lt;T, K&gt; as a function</h4>
<p>Let's look at our <code>Pick</code> example from earlier:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>type</span> Pick<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>K</span> <span>extends</span> <span>keyof</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>[</span><span>P</span> <span>in</span> <span>K</span><span>]</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>[</span><span>P</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If we consider types to be values, we could actually represent <code>Pick</code> as a function. Here is what that could look like, inspired from JavaScript's function syntax:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>function</span> <span>Pick</span><span>(</span><span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>K</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>K</span><span>.</span><span>extends</span><span>(</span><span>keyof</span><span>(</span><span>T</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>"K does not extend keyof T"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span><span>K</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span><span>P</span></span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>property</span><span>(</span><span>P</span><span>,</span> <span>T</span><span>.</span><span>getPropertyType</span><span>(</span><span>P</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Even better, we could get rid of the clumsy <code>throw</code> statement and use type annotations to describe the types <code>T</code> and <code>K</code>:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>function</span> <span>Pick</span><span>(</span><span><span>T</span><span>:</span> AnyType<span>,</span> <span>K</span><span>:</span> <span>keyof</span> <span>T</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span><span>K</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span><span>P</span></span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>property</span><span>(</span><span>P</span><span>,</span> <span>T</span><span>.</span><span>getPropertyType</span><span>(</span><span>P</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let's look at an invocation of our <code>Pick</code> function:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>Pick</span><span>(</span>User<span>,</span> <span>'name'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'age'</span><span>)</span>



<span>{</span>
  <span>...</span><span>(</span><span>'name'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'age'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span><span>P</span></span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>property</span><span>(</span><span>P</span><span>,</span> User<span>.</span><span>getPropertyType</span><span>(</span><span>P</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>



<span>{</span>
  name<span>:</span> User<span>[</span><span>'name'</span><span>]</span><span>,</span>
  age<span>:</span> User<span>[</span><span>'age'</span><span>]</span>
<span>}</span>



<span>{</span>
  name<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span>
  age<span>:</span> <span>number</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This produces exactly the type we expected.</p>
<h4>Return&lt;T&gt; as a function</h4>
<p>Now let's look at our <code>Return</code> type:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>type</span> Return<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>T</span> <span>extends</span> <span>(</span><span><span>...</span>args<span>:</span> <span>any</span><span>[</span><span>]</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> infer <span>R</span> <span>?</span> <span>R</span> <span>:</span> <span>never</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Again, we can rewrite it as a function:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>function</span> <span>Return</span><span>(</span><span><span>T</span><span>:</span> AnyType</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>T</span><span>.</span><span>isFunctionType</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>T</span><span>.</span><span>getArgumentTypes</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>extends</span><span>(</span>AnyType<span>[</span><span>]</span><span>)</span>
    <span>?</span> <span>T</span><span>.</span><span>getReturnType</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
  	<span>:</span> <span>never</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In fact, since we don't care about argument types, we can write the more elegant:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>function</span> <span>Return</span><span>(</span><span><span>T</span><span>:</span> AnyType</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>T</span><span>.</span><span>isFunctionType</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>?</span> <span>T</span><span>.</span><span>getReturnType</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>never</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Recursion and types</h2>
<p>One potentially challenging aspect of types is that they can be recursive. Here is a <code>LinkedList</code> type:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>type</span> LinkedList <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  value<span>:</span> <span>any</span><span>,</span>
  next<span>:</span> LinkedList <span>|</span> <span>null</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The equivalent value would be illegal in JavaScript:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>const</span> LinkedList <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  value<span>:</span> <span>'any'</span><span>,</span>
  next<span>:</span> <span>or</span><span>(</span>LinkedList<span>,</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>However, the only reason why this is illegal is because JavaScript is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eager_evaluation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">eagerly evaluated</a>. That is, a value is evaluated as soon as it's expressed.</p>
<p>Types are different. It is perfectly fine for a type to be self-referential in TypeScript. You could say that types are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">lazily evaluated</a>. In fact, you'll find that our "type functions" have no mutable variables or side-effects, i.e. they are pure functions. We could think of the TypeScript type system as a purely functional, lazy-evaluated language!</p>
<h2>Final words</h2>
<p>Let's summarise our findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Types can be thought of as abstract values and generic types as pure functions on these values.</li>
<li>The TypeScript type system is its own lazily evaluated language.</li>
<li>We've come up with an alternative syntax for generic types, using <code>type function</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>TypeScript's generic types are well know for their <a href="https://github.com/ghoullier/awesome-template-literal-types" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">fairly unreadable syntax</a>. I wonder if we could leverage these insights to make TypeScript more readable, and perhaps unlock even more powerful generic types?</p>
<p>If you're curious to read more insights on computer science and software engineering, I'm working on a book that explores the similarities between programming languages and builds up a universal model of code.

January 13, 2021 | https://leerob.io/blog/fonts | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://leerob.io/blog/fonts">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Typography accounts for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ia.net/topics/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period/">95% of web design</a>. Your font choice can be critical for branding, readability, and performance.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/web-fonts/">Over time</a>, recommendations for using web fonts have changed as browsers adopted new standards. Now in 2021, I wanted to learn the best practices for using web fonts on high-performance sites.</p><h2 id="system-fonts">System Fonts</h2><p>The fastest way to use a web font is none. Browsers include a set of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals#Web_safe_fonts">web-safe fonts</a> (e.g. Arial, Georgia, Times New Roman) you can use by default.</p><p>Using web-safe fonts or the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://systemfontstack.com/">system font stack</a> will be the fastest option.</p><pre><code><span>font-family</span><span>:</span> -apple-system<span>,</span> BlinkMacSystemFont<span>,</span> <span>'Segoe UI'</span><span>,</span> Helvetica<span>,</span> Arial<span>,</span>
  sans-serif<span>,</span> <span>'Apple Color Emoji'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Segoe UI Emoji'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Segoe UI Symbol'</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre><h2 id="why-use-web-fonts">Why Use Web Fonts?</h2><p>If system fonts are the fastest option, why do web fonts exist? Branding, improved design, and cross browser and device consistency. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2020/fonts">82% of web pages for desktop</a> use web fonts.</p><p>Let's cover five different areas for high-performance web fonts and conclude with a 2021 recommendation.</p><ul><li>Self Hosting</li><li>Preloading</li><li>Font Display</li><li>Variable Fonts</li><li>Subsetting</li></ul><h2 id="self-hosting">Self Hosting</h2><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a> is responsible for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2020/fonts#serving-with-a-service">70% of all web font usage</a>. With over 1000 fonts, they provide easy access to quality fonts, multiple formats, and performant defaults (pre-connecting and swapping).</p><p>However, <strong>Google Fonts is no longer necessary</strong>. Since 2018, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/08/web-performance-made-easy">Google has advised self-hosting</a> for optimal performance through preloading.</p><p>There aren't any caching advantages anymore, either. Let's say you're using the font "Roboto", which is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://fonts.google.com/?sort=popularity">a popular font</a> on Google Fonts. Chances are you've visited another site using "Roboto" and cached the font.</p><p>Since October 2020, Chrome <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/10/http-cache-partitioning">no longer allows</a> a shared cache across sites. Safari has worked this way since 2013. "Roboto" will be re-downloaded for every site, regardless of it being cached.</p><p>When self-hosting, ensure you cache your font with the <code>Cache-Control</code> HTTP header. <code>immutable</code> tells the browser the file will never change. When a request is made within the <code>max-age</code> (1 year), it avoids the roundtrip to ensure it's the latest content.</p><pre><code>Cache-Control: public, immutable, max-age<span>=</span><span>31536000</span>
</code></pre><p>If you need Google Fonts, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://csswizardry.com/2020/05/the-fastest-google-fonts/">use these optimizations</a>. With the latest changes in the v2 API, you can tailor fonts to specific users and platforms (including variable fonts).</p><h2 id="preloading">Preloading</h2><p>The browser assigns <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://web.dev/prioritize-resources/">loading priorities</a> to different types of resources. By default, CSS will be loaded before scripts and images. You can influence the importance of resources by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://web.dev/preload-critical-assets/">preloading critical assets</a>.</p><p>Fonts are discovered late by the browser by default. By preloading, we fetch the font file as soon as possible. Then, the browser caches the font making it available immediately.</p><p>Preloading can improve performance metrics like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://web.dev/interactive">Time to Interactive</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://web.dev/first-contentful-paint">First Contentful Paint</a>. For example, Shopify saw a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/ShopifyEng/status/844245243948163072">50% (1.2 second) improvement</a> in First Contentful Paint, removing their Flash of Invisible Text (FOIT).</p><p>As of 2020, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/fonts">75% of web fonts use WOFF2</a>. You likely only need this. For example:</p><pre><code>&lt;link
    rel=<span>"preload"</span>
    href=<span>"/fonts/inter-var-latin.woff2"</span>
    as=<span>"font"</span>
    type=<span>"font/woff2"</span>
    crossOrigin=<span>"anonymous"</span>
/&gt;
</code></pre><blockquote><p>Support: All modern browsers except Firefox.</p></blockquote><h2 id="font-display">Font Display</h2><p><code>font-display</code> allows you to modify the rendering behavior of web fonts with values such as <code>auto</code>, <code>swap</code>, <code>block</code>, <code>fallback</code> and <code>optional</code>. When loading web fonts, we want to prevent <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://web.dev/cls/">layout shift</a>. This occurs in two ways:</p><ul><li>Flash of Unstyled Text (FOUT) â€” The fallback font is swapped with a new font (e.g. <code>swap</code>).</li><li>Flash of Invisible Text (FOIT) â€” Invisible text is shown on the page until a new font is rendered (e.g. <code>block</code>).</li></ul><p>Browsers currently have a default strategy similar to <code>block</code>. The only option that eliminates layout shift is <code>optional</code>. Combined with the other performance optimizations in this article, <code>optional</code> is your best choice.</p><pre><code><span><span>@font-face</span></span> <span>{</span>
  <span>font-family</span><span>:</span> <span>'Inter'</span><span>;</span>
  <span>font-style</span><span>:</span> normal<span>;</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre><blockquote><p>Support: All modern browsers</p></blockquote><h2 id="variable-fonts">Variable Fonts</h2><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://web.dev/variable-fonts/">Variable fonts</a> allow us to combine multiple styles and weights (e.g. bold, italic) into a single font file.</p><pre><code><span><span>@font-face</span></span> <span>{</span>
  <span>font-family</span><span>:</span> <span>'Inter'</span><span>;</span>
  <span>font-style</span><span>:</span> normal<span>;</span>
  <span>font-weight</span><span>:</span> <span>100</span> <span>900</span><span>;</span> // Range of weights supported
  <span>font-display</span><span>:</span> optional<span>;</span>
  <span>src</span><span>:</span> <span><span>url</span><span>(</span>/fonts/inter-var-latin.woff2<span>)</span></span> <span>format</span><span>(</span><span>'woff2'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre><p>You can try out different variable font options <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Fonts/Variable_Fonts_Guide">here</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Support: All modern browsers. Even Google Fonts v2 API has support for variable fonts.</p></blockquote><h2 id="subsettings">Subsettings</h2><p>Font files contain multiple languages and glyphs, which increase the file size. Subsetting is the removal of characters you donâ€™t need.</p><p>For example, we might use the Inter variable font and subset to latin languages.</p><pre><code><span><span>@font-face</span></span> <span>{</span>
  <span>font-family</span><span>:</span> <span>'Inter'</span><span>;</span>
  <span>font-style</span><span>:</span> normal<span>;</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-179"><div><p>I took a deep dive on freemium pricing and decided to document it in this post. Why freemium? I think it’s how the little guys can win against market leaders.</p><p>Basically, it’s how you kill a unicorn.</p><p>Notion, Figma, Canva, Mailchimp, and Segment. What do all of these platforms have in common, besides being category leaders? Each one has unseated the previous category leaders with less money and smaller teams. Each has also opted for a product led growth strategy that is fueled by product virality and an innovative pricing strategy.</p><p>But let’s back up. How did we get here?</p><p>The year is 2012 and the preeminent name in design isn’t Sketch or Figma – it’s Adobe. 2012 era Adobe is a much different beast to where we are now. There was no real SaaS model and licenses were hundreds of dollars each, locked to a machine, and didn’t get upgrades. Still, Adobe is unequivocally the category leader. But in just a few years, that would all change due to an enterprising young entrepreneur and her new business model.</p><p>Canva launched in 2012 and spread like wildfire. In 3 years, the company was able to accumulate accumulated 10 million users, with almost 1 million coming in the first year alone. By the next year, they had 17 thousand videos about their product.</p><p>This kind of fervent user adoption is the stuff of legend. I started hearing about Canva around that time. My then-girlfriend (now wife) had put together a project and it looked much better than anything I could knock out in Photoshop or Illustrator. She mentioned it was not only really easy to use, but it was free! At the time I think I was still bouncing from Adobe license to Adobe license, each of which was half a month’s rent, so I was blown away.</p><p>Then I started seeing it everywhere. It was being used for school projects, large advertising campaigns, and was the first recommendation in online groups whenever someone needed a design tool.</p><p>That space used to be occupied by Adobe, but in a matter of a few years, they were being overtaken in the B2C and even a bit in the B2B space by a brand new company with a limited amount of funding.</p><figure><img width="1024" height="570" src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-1024x570.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-1024x570.png 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-300x167.png 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-768x427.png 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1.png 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-1024x570.png" data-srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-1024x570.png 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-300x167.png 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-768x427.png 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1.png 1215w"></figure><figure><img width="1024" height="572" src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-1024x572.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-1024x572.png 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-300x167.png 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-768x429.png 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2.png 1227w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-1024x572.png" data-srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-1024x572.png 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-300x167.png 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-768x429.png 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2.png 1227w"></figure><p>Meanwhile, another company, Sketch, was eating away at their market share by offering design-focused tools for modern internet companies. Adobe had Photoshop and Illustrator, neither of which was purpose-built for the internet and both of which were expensive af. Adobe XD wasn’t quite production-ready at that point, so Sketch was able to make inroads by offering a lower-priced license for its software.</p><p>Out of left-field comes the Canva of professional design tools: Figma.</p><figure><img width="1024" height="565" src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-1024x565.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-1024x565.png 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-300x165.png 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-768x423.png 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3.png 1255w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-1024x565.png" data-srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-1024x565.png 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-300x165.png 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-768x423.png 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3.png 1255w"></figure><p>Figma quickly overtakes Sketch by offering a few unique features and an unbeatable pricing model. Freemium, with a twist.</p><p>Figma, like Canva before it, quickly discovered the power that a free product with shareable outputs offers. Users create content with the tool, share the content and then inevitably get asked how it was made. Of course, the user is both happy to share and give a positive recommendation since the output content is being appreciated, and the platform gains another user.</p><p>A couple points to understand about the shiny world of marketing:</p><ul><li>Recommendations from trusted people always lead to higher conversion rates. It’s easy to recommend free things since the only exchange is time.</li><li>Backlinks are everything, still. Google hasn’t cracked how to build page authority without backlinks and having them everywhere, attached with positive recommendations and high user dwell time once a user clicks a link, is seen as a positive signal.</li><li>Creating content in the app means content can be shared outside the app. That’s a simple growth mechanism that can be leveraged mightily once a certain user volume has been hit.</li><li>Finally, email is the best marketing channel still. Freemium platforms exchange email addresses for access and make lead generation a snap.</li></ul><p>So Adobe now is taking fire from all sides and they eventually pivot to a cloud-based subscription model while also focusing all their efforts upmarket on the professional landscape, effectively ceding their B2C audience to Canva.</p><p><em>Quick note: There are many other factors that go into making a platform successful, from the founder to tech to the support. Pricing is just one of the pieces.</em></p><h2><strong>How Freemium really works</strong></h2><p>The common misconception with freemium is that it’s an easy way to not generate any revenue. How many stories have you heard about independent projects that have been worked on for years, only to launch with only a few dollars in revenue, followed by months of slogging before eventually shutting down. That’s very likely&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;a pricing problem, but a positioning problem. You need to position your product in front of the right audiences and the price becomes a natural fit for your expansion strategy.</p><p>In reality, there are a number of different ingredients in the recipe you need to nail before you can actually execute a freemium strategy effectively. You don’t need a team of hundreds of people, but it does help to lay out the strategy ahead of time.</p><p>Let’s break out the different factors involved in setting up a freemium plan.</p><ul><li>Pricing that scales with usage</li><li>Shareable content</li><li>In-app upsells</li><li>Massive market opportunity</li><li>Pricing innovation on the primary value</li></ul><p>First, if you are missing even one of these, it might not be the pricing strategy for you. Each part is key in building out a converting freemium funnel.</p><p><strong>Pricing that scales with usage</strong></p><p>If a user wants to dip a toe in and play around with your platform, they can do that at zero cost (outside of an email address). That’s the basic premise of a freemium plan, but what happens when a user is converted and wants to expand their usage?</p><p>Your pricing should accommodate that natural urge and your product should gracefully allow them to expand their usage with as few barriers as possible.</p><p><strong>In-app upsells aka feature gating</strong></p><p>You need to rope off some of your app so there’s a reason to pay! However, you should charge based on either&nbsp;<strong>secondary user value or</strong>&nbsp;expanding the primary user value, but ideally both.</p><p>Let me explain. Google Analytics made analytics free and accessible to everyone. They charge based on primary user value, but only if you want to expand to a much higher tier of usage. For 99% of people, it will always be free.</p><p>That’s great, but really they only offer expanding their primary user value (analytics) as an upsell. Profitwell, one of my favorite companies utilizing this technique, charges entirely on secondary user value. They offer Profitwell Retain, a dunning service, on top of their analytics. Analytics are totally free. After all, you already have all your financial information integrated into it and onboarded your team.</p><p>Canva however offers all that and more. They let users expand their primary usage through additional templates, but also access other tools like scheduling posts on social media once you upgrade. Why pay 12K a year for Hootsuite when you can just upgrade Canva?</p><figure><img width="1024" height="673" src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-1024x673.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-1024x673.jpg 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-300x197.jpg 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-768x505.jpg 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-1536x1009.jpg 1536w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-2048x1346.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-1024x673.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-1024x673.jpg 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-300x197.jpg 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-768x505.jpg 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-1536x1009.jpg 1536w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-2048x1346.jpg 2048w"></figure><p>With each of these product incentives, users are motioned into the next stage of the tool.</p><p><strong>Shareable content</strong></p><p>This could be considered a growth loop, since we’re building in some type of publishing into the platform so users can share links. Our goal with shareable content is to increase the k factor of a user, effectively turning a free user into a marketing machine. Every time they create content in the app and share it externally, you have another potential opportunity for user acquisition which helps balance out the slightly lower conversion rate you’ll see with a freemium plan.</p><p>You can do this with reports, tables, images, videos, etc. If it can be shared inside a team, you should enable it to be published from your platform.</p><p><strong>Massive Market Opportunity</strong></p><p>Freemium works best when you can boil the ocean. No really, let it rip. The ocean should be a massive existing user base or the early signs of a large user base. You will need the volume to make it work with freemium pricing. Here are the TAMs for a few of the examples.</p><ul><li>Canva: Anyone that needs to create images.</li><li>Profitwell: Anyone that wants to know their businesses metrics</li><li>Google Optimize: Anyone that wants to test anything on their site.</li><li>Microsoft Teams: Anyone that uses Slack. 😉</li></ul><p>Each of these audience segments is huge and represents uniquely large opportunities. Freemium pricing becomes much more difficult to pull off once you have to compete for a small audience with specific needs. You want to create a product that will work with 90% of users.</p><p><strong>Pricing Innovation on Primary Value</strong></p><p>What does this mean?</p><p>A competitive advantage that can’t be innovated against. This is the most important point. How does Slack compete with Teams when users have Teams included in their subscription? How does Baremetrics compete with Profitwell when most of what Baremetrics offered is free with Profitwell?</p><p>Well…they don’t. Baremetrics sold. Slack sold. You can’t compete against freemium when you’re able to offer the primary value for free. The existing market leaders can’t match your pricing without giving up millions in recurring revenue and they’re not going to do that.</p><p>That’s how you beat Adobe or fill-in-the-blank industry behemoth.</p><p>Create a great competitor (the hardest part), offer the primary value for free, then monetize on expanding that primary value or offer a secondary value.</p><h2><strong>I want to be free</strong></h2><p>So I’m putting my money where my mouth is. I’m switching over all my projects to freemium.</p><p>As of today:</p><ul><li><a href="http://snazzy.ai/">Snazzy.ai</a>, content marketing powered by GPT-3, now has a free tier</li><li><a href="http://ga-insights.com/">GA-Insights.com</a>, all your ad networks into Slack, has a free tier being built out</li><li><a href="http://weld.ai/">Weld.ai</a>, in beta as a Supermetrics alternative, will now be completely free at launch.</li></ul><p>The riskiest part of a freemium pricing tier as a bootstrapped founder is getting the volume you need to make up any initial drop in conversion rate.</p><h2><strong>Reference: The market leaders (and the victims)</strong></h2><ul><li>Profitwell: Baremetrics, Chartmogul</li><li>Canva: Photoshop, Illustrator, Word</li><li>Google Optimize: Optimizely, VWO</li><li>Microsoft Teams: Slack</li><li>Figma: Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketch Invision</li></ul><p>Early freemium …</p></div></article></div>

The hegemony of the U.S. dollar has been weakened and the actions taken in 2020 may only be the beginning.</p><p>Considering that a collapse may be imminent, now might be a good time to take a look at the popular store of value assets. Today we have two strong assets that may serve us in that regard: Gold and Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p><p>Both have served as a financial instrument that safeguards against inflation, but which one is more efficient in 2020? Gold may have a long history, but that does not mean that the disruptive technology found in Bitcoin cannot serve as a better option.&nbsp;</p><p>In the following sections, we will showcase bullish cases for both Bitcoin and gold. Moreover, we will also explain why one option may be better than the other for long term investors.&nbsp;</p><p>But before disclosing that information, let’s first see why we have a strong demand for SoV’s and why scarcity is so important in an age where paper currency lost its value.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610405110242_12502"><div>

History then switched into a timeline where global economies were based entirely on pure fiat money, with limited reliance on gold.</p><p>Across all ages of human history, gold was used as the primary form of currency. Even when civilizations deemed gold to be too burdensome for transferring value, paper money backed 100% by gold was still used.</p><p>As we have already mentioned gold is a popular SoV option due to its supply-demand ratio, formally known as stock to flow ratio. The ‘stock’ of mined gold is too small compared to the existing supply, hence why it is the perfect option for storing value with yearly inflation of around 1.5%.</p><p>But with the aforementioned changes that Central Banks have made in the previous century, entire economies were completely redefined. With heavy reliance on the U.S. dollar, instead of gold, banks have paid a high price.&nbsp;</p><p>For many, the current system is based on nothing at all - no economic game theory that can support the value of fiat currencies. Countries like the U.S. are <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/money/2020/05/12/coronavirushow-u-s-printing-dollars-save-economy-during-crisis-fed/3038117001/"><span>senselessly printing money</span></a> to keep their economies afloat, in spite of future consequences.&nbsp;</p><p>Currencies resume losing value against each other while the value of commodities and assets keep increasing in an environment where salaries stay the same. As such, the purchasing power of a nation decreases while inflation rises.</p><p>In 2020 alone, the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2"><span>U.S. M2 money stock supply</span></a> has increased by 24%. With incoming stimulus bills and further financial injections, it is easy to conclude that the supply of money will resume growing.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1609787077522_11228"><div>

As a result, many individuals are turning to SoV assets such as Bitcoin or gold. But why is Bitcoin a good SoV and is it better than gold?</p><p>Bitcoin is far more than just imaginary digital money. In fact, the coins are backed by real monetary value which is kept stable by the asset’s limited supply. Bitcoin is often referred to as digital gold and has been used as an SoV on numerous occasions, but why?</p><p>The anonymous creator <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"><span>Satoshi Nakamoto designed Bitcoin</span></a> in such a way that it can generate only 21 million coins. This is the first efficient tier that gives value to Bitcoin, but is there anything else?</p><p>On BTC’s blockchain network, miners keep the system alive by validating transactions. In return, they are rewarded with Bitcoin for every block of transaction that is verified. For a sensible price evolution, Nakamoto added a <a href="https://www.bitcoinblockhalf.com/"><span>4-year system</span></a> in which mining rewards are halved.</p><p>By doing so, Nakamoto made it possible for Bitcoin’s mineable coins to always remain drastically lower compared to the existing circulating supply. On that account, the leading cryptocurrency behaves exactly like gold as it keeps a stable stock-to-flow ratio.&nbsp;</p><p>With incredibly high scarcity, fungibility, portability, and divisibility, Bitcoin is a clear contender in the area of store-of-value assets.&nbsp;</p><p>As a matter of fact, three of these features are considered to be the properties of good money. But are the aforementioned features better in the case of Bitcoin compared to gold?</p><p>Those who believe that Bitcoin is ‘digital gold’ have three great reasons. BTC is not only great for its scarcity and limited supply but for its other characteristics which have historically been used to describe ‘good money.’</p><p>Scarcity and durability may result in a good asset, but these features alone are not enough for a currency.&nbsp;</p><p>If you wanted an SoV, a currency, and a speculative financial instrument all in one asset then Bitcoin is a perfect choice. Here are three reasons why Bitcoin is better than gold in this context.</p><h2>Portability</h2><p>Portability is obviously the first aspect that comes to one’s mind when comparing these two assets. Portability is the main feature of a currency as it allows individuals to seamlessly transfer value without any difficulty.&nbsp;</p><p>It may be easier to transfer $1 million worth of gold compared to $1 million worth of oil but can we do better? Bitcoin is naturally superior compared to precious and rare metals when it comes to portability as it only takes a few clicks to transfer value.</p><p>One million worth of gold weighs around 220 pounds. Besides the weight, we also need to account for the means of transportation, carry load, and security.&nbsp;</p><p>Depending on where you want to ship gold, it might take days if not weeks to do so. Administrative problems such as documenting the transfer and dealing with customs is yet another problem.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1609787077522_16211"><div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="mw-content-text" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p><small>This text is part of: "<i><a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Problem_of_Schooling" title="Problem of Schooling">I would never send my kids to school</a></i>" by <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr_Wozniak" title="Piotr Wozniak">Piotr Wozniak</a> (2017)</small>
</p>

<h2><span id="The_main_problem_in_education">The main problem in education</span></h2>
<p>The main problem with regards to education is the belief that learning may cause displeasure, and that this displeasure should be <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/The_grind_is_the_glory" title="The grind is the glory">endured</a> to achieve more learning.
</p><p>There are countless educators who believe that school should be like work: it is unpleasant but it just needs to be done. In this chapter, I will explain that the opposite is true: 
</p>
<p><b>Good learning is inherently pleasurable</b>, and without pleasure there is no good learning.</p>
<p>The displeasure myth is so prevalent that even good teachers with an extensive understanding of the pleasures of learning believe that a degree of unhappiness at school is unavoidable.
</p><p>In this chapter, I show that the pleasure of learning is wired into the brain, and how we systematically destroy this <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Education_counteracts_evolution" title="Education counteracts evolution">gift of evolution</a> at the cost of mankind's health, learning, creativity, and ultimately future.
</p><p>The main problem of education is also one of the main problems of society. By destroying the pleasure of learning we are contributing powerfully to the destruction of the pleasure of living. We have built an education system that sets millions of people up for a life of unhappiness.
</p><p>Chances are you are skeptical of my words, as the myth of unpleasant learning is a potent side effect of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Schooling" title="Schooling">schooling</a>. Therefore this chapter is an attempt to convince you. And all that is necessary to abolish this myth is an understanding of the simple mechanism by which new knowledge is encoded in the brain. 
</p>
<h2><span id="Learn_drive_and_entropy">Learn drive and entropy</span></h2>
<p>The concept of entropy is helpful in understanding why most kids do not learn much at school.
</p><p>You may recall from your physics class that entropy is a measure of disorder, and that the second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases. This is the type of sexy law of physics that we tend to remember for life. It is <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Applicability" title="Applicability">universally applicable</a>.
</p><p>There is a sister concept in information theory called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)">Shannon entropy</a>. It can be understood as the average value of information transmitted by a source. For example, take a channel that is continually transmitting a string of identical letters into infinity (e.g. a string of As: "AAAAAA..."). It is entirely predictable and carries an entropy of zero. We do not learn from such a channel.
</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon">Claude Shannon</a> proposed the concept of information entropy in 1948. Soon after, scientists were hypothesizing as to whether the entropy of an information channel may have a powerful impact on how the brain perceives the value of the channel. In 1957, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Music_and_entropy" title="Music and entropy">Meyer hypothesized</a> that the entropy of music determines the perception of its beauty. He concluded that a higher entropy may result in subjective tension, which correlates with more meaningful musical moments.
</p><p>Meyer's thinking was <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Impact_of_syncopation_on_the_pleasure_of_music" title="Impact of syncopation on the pleasure of music">later refined</a> to better understand the perception of music and information in general. There is more to music than just information. This is visible through the phenomena of a song being entertaining and fun for many playbacks. But this is rarely the case with books.
</p><p>Music is a universal message. If you were given a choice of a radio channel, you would quickly tune out from noisy static and you would also not be too excited about zero entropy silence. However, most people will respond positively to a regular beat of a drum. As long as it wasn't being drummed on broken glass, which we are wired to dislike, we would find a radio channel with a regular drumbeat more interesting than a silent one. This will naturally last only for a while until the drumbeat itself becomes boring and too predictable.
</p><p>Today, we can finally test the response of the brain to information entropy. Neuroimaging shows that the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15896570">anterior hippocampus responds to the entropy of a visual stream</a>, and similar findings have been confirmed for the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3403290/">ventral striatum</a>. Therefore we are now certain that the brain responds to information entropy. The entropy sensor is important in scanning the environment for learning opportunities. This is the prelude to the reward that underlies the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive" title="Learn drive">learn drive</a>.
</p>
<h2><span id="Prior_knowledge_in_information_seeking">Prior knowledge in information seeking</span></h2>
<p>We need to distinguish between information and meaning. Entropy is not a good measure of the latter. The measure of meaning must involve the brain itself in addition to the information channel metric. Prior knowledge is essential in learning. Imagine that in your search for an interesting channel on the radio you find a news service. If the service is delivered in Thai and you do not speak Thai, you will prefer a service delivered in English. In information sense, news channels may have the same entropy, yet your prior knowledge will make you opt for the English channel. While the Thai channel delivers a stream of sounds, the English channel delivers a stream of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">concepts</a>. Without understanding the knowledge of the recipient, information entropy tells us little. We cannot determine a signal-to-noise ratio.
</p><p>Every listener will have his or her own preferred level of information entropy. For most music lovers, the regular beat of a disco or techno will be somewhat more interesting than the isolated beat of a drum. This type of music carries a higher average level of information. For a more sophisticated listener a bit of syncopation will be welcome. However, syncopation requires a degree of prior learning. Those with lesser knowledge of music may get confused with increased rhythmic complexity. If there is too much information in the beat it <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Impact_of_syncopation_on_the_pleasure_of_music" title="Impact of syncopation on the pleasure of music">may no longer be possible to dance to the music</a>. To an average ear, the genius of Wynton Marsalis may be hard to perceive. Top shelf jazz music is reserved for only a small fraction of highly educated listeners, as for most of the population, as the complexity increases, the music slowly disintegrates into the direction of radio static.
</p>
<h2><span id="Entropy_detectors_in_the_brain">Entropy detectors in the brain</span></h2>
<p>The brain cannot effectively detect the entropy of the signal hitting the retina or the eardrum. Like pixels of a monitor, retinal cells are not aware of what they display. If the detector, such as the hippocampus, is to light up in response to entropy, it must operate on the inputs from the entorhinal cortex (i.e. the input to the hippocampus itself). Those inputs will present the signal after a high degree of processing. Instead of pixels, it may present a concept. A high entropy signal at the sensory inputs will lose most of its noise component early in the process of neural selection, completion, and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Generalization" title="Generalization">generalization</a>. The signal-to-noise ratio will determine how much information is lost. The bigger the noise, the bigger the loss. The smarter we are, the more selective this processing will be and the more information will be lost at that stage. That's good. We become blind to detail. Pattern recognition will act like a deterministic function, which by definition, results in a drop in entropy. Complex patterns may become simple concepts. Those concepts will provide the actual input to the detector, e.g. the hippocampus.
</p><p>Note that the visual stream produced in experiments that prove the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15896570">response of the hippocampus to signal entropy</a> has a highly <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">symbolic nature</a>. As such, the stream will lose far less information in processing. That highly simplified and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Generalization" title="Generalization">conceptualized</a> message will be scanned for surprisal and provide guidance to the entire <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive" title="Learn drive">learn drive</a> system. This is why, in this case, the hippocampus appears to be responding to input entropy.
</p><p>The above reasoning explains why both low and high entropy sensory signals can be uninteresting. After a degree of processing, a high entropy signal may lose all its noise and deliver a low entropy input to the hippocampus. We then observe the illusion of an "optimum entropy" level at sensory input. We need a new concept, <b><a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learntropy" title="Learntropy">learntropy</a></b>, that will help us accurately determine the attractiveness of the signal. Learntropy needs to take into account the high degree of processing of information before it can activate reward centers in the brain. Learntropy is discussed <a href="#Learntropy">later</a> in this text.
</p>
<h2><span id="Speed_of_information_processing">Speed of information processing</span></h2>
<p>An under-appreciated factor in sensory information scanning is the speed of information processing in the brain.
</p><p>For every piece of music, there is a tolerable playback range where the beauty of the music is appreciated. A high speed playback can be annoying and the music may become hard to decode, as the high speed goes beyond our processing power. The same piece of music slowed down can quickly lose its appeal. The same happens in speech delivery or in classroom lecturing. For the same information and the same entropy level, we may accomplish highly different levels of signal attractiveness. There is always an optimum speed of delivery and that speed depends on all other factors that power the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive" title="Learn drive">learn drive</a>, incl. prior knowledge. As such, speed of delivery is highly individual.
</p><p>I like to listen to lectures at 1.4x speed. I use 1.3x for more ambitious pieces. I never speed up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fareed_Zakaria_GPS">Fareed Zakaria</a> though, but rather relish every piece of information in this show. Students in a classroom lecture do not have a speed-up or slow-down button. Even the pause button, if available, is hard to hit as it may annoy other students.
</p><p>In schools, all too often, the speed of delivery surpasses student's processing capacity. This results in negligible learning and high stress. There is no time to <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Futility_of_schooling" title="Futility of schooling">enjoy the landscapes in the window of a high-speed train</a>. At MIT they call it <i>"drinking from a firehose"</i>.
</p>
<h2><span id="Probability_vs._knowledge">Probability vs. knowledge</span></h2>
<p>Low probability events carry more information. Average information determines entropy. Prior knowledge determines the perception of an information channel's entropy.
</p><p>If you happen to tune in to radio news and you hear that "<i>Janet Jackson has delivered a baby</i>", your degree of interest will depend on the probability of the event. If you have no idea who Janet Jackson is, this is a high probability event. If some <a href="http://www.theworldcounts.com/stories/How-Many-Babies-Are-Born-Each-Day">350,000 women deliver babies every single day</a>, this is no longer news and is not new or …</p></div></div>

<h2>Reverse Engineering The Great Escape</h2>

<p><dfn>The Great Escape</dfn> is a classic 1986 prison break game for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum">48K ZX Spectrum</a>. I've spent a considerable amount of time reverse engineering its routines and documenting its workings while simultaneously reimplementing it as portable C code. The following pages describe the process I went through.</p>

<p>This is an expanded-upon write-up of some of what I can dimly recall saying while presenting <a href="http://slides.com/dpt/the-great-escape/#/">these slides</a> to my team at INSIDE Secure (formerly Metaforic, now called <a href="https://www.verimatrix.com/">Verimatrix</a>) in Glasgow at a talk in January 2016.</p>

          <p>In case anybody still has problems with App Store rejection due to Corona references in the meta data, I just ran into that problem when submitting an update for Ice Trap that was rejected because:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Your app contains Corona references in the info_plist and other files in your binary, to what purpose does your app reference said subjects?</li>
<li>What are the steps needed to locate those references within your binary?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I replied the following and Apple was ok with it, and the update is now ready for sale:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason for “Corona references” in the plist file is because the game itself is built using the Corona 2D game engine which has existed for probably at least 10 years. See <a href="https://coronalabs.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://coronalabs.com</a>.</p>
<p>Since the Corona pandemic started, a rebranding of the Corona game engine has taken place and it is now known as Solar2D, see <a href="https://solar2d.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://solar2d.com/</a>.</p>
<p>However, a lot of the internal libraries and plugins used by the engine still contain the Corona name and/or the <a href="http://coronalabs.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">coronalabs.com</a> domain name. This is nothing that is ever exposed to the end users and there are definitely no connections or references to the Covid-19 virus, just a very unfortunate name collision.</p>
<p>Hope you have understanding, as there is nothing I can do to change that.</p>

It feels a bit crazy to be writing that and it also feels like we’re at a point of transition. </p><p>In many ways it feels like we’ve graduated—from being a pimply faced, early stage start-up teenager to a young company that’s blossoming into its potential. We’re undoubtedly more excited heading into 2021 than we’ve been at any point in our start-up journey so far.</p><p>This post serves as our four year update. Each of our previous updates, starting with our launch announcement, can be found below.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://www.outseta.com/posts/meet-our-new-software-start-up-outseta">Meet Our New Software Start-up, Outseta</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.outseta.com/posts/outseta-two-year-update">Outseta Two Year Update</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.outseta.com/posts/outseta-three-year-update">Outseta Three Year Update</a><br></p></li></ul><p>Let’s get right into the good stuff.</p><h2>Equity Allocation</h2><p>We’ve continued to use a very simple formula to distribute equity amongst our team—we all value our time at $100 per hour and anyone on our team can contribute cash to the company as well. At the end of each year we look at the total number of hours we’ve all worked plus the cash contributions we’ve each made and we use that to calculate how much equity we each hold in the business.</p><p>At the end of 2020 our equity allocation breaks down as:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Dimitris 36% </p></li><li><p>Dave 34% </p></li><li><p>Geoff 27%</p></li><li><p>James 3%</p></li></ul></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610145428502_5099"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610145428502_9440"><div><p>For the most part, we’ve continued to work primarily for sweat equity in the business so we can reinvest our revenue into the company. James, who works in a much more part-time capacity than the rest of us, has earned a mix of equity salary since he started working on Outseta. On September 1st of this year, I (Geoff) started drawing some salary from Outseta for the first time. We’d reached the point where we definitely needed more help and beginning to take some salary afforded me the opportunity to spend more time on Outseta and less time consulting. </p><p>It’s also worth noting the $1,572,200 number your see at the top of the 2020 column. Over four years this is really the cost of bringing a software product of Outseta’s scale to market. But as you’ll see as we get into our expenses, the vast majority of that figure would go towards salary that we haven’t taken.</p><h2>Expenses</h2><p>We’ve been really disciplined about keeping our expenses as low as possible since we started building Outseta. This goes back to our <a href="https://www.outseta.com/posts/outseta-saas-operating-agreement">operating agreement</a>, our desire to stay intentionally small, and our focus on profitability.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610145428502_12917"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610145428502_13209"><div><p>We’ve now spent a total of $123,335.23 on Outseta over the last four years. Our expenses have scaled up from about $8,000 in 2017 to about $57,000 in 2020. The primary driver of that increase was starting to draw some salary from Outseta this past year.</p><p>On the marketing front, we’ve focused almost exclusively on “free” marketing tactics to date—partnerships, content marketing, and email marketing. Our biggest lines items this past year were:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>$2,500 to be a Gold Partner with Makerpad</p></li><li><p>$1,200 for a Pro subscription to Wistia</p></li></ul><p>The partnership with Makerpad was a critical step for us as we increased our focus on serving the no-code community. And while Wistia is a significant line item, we use video liberally for both marketing and customer support—and they’re a team I’m nothing but happy to support.</p><p>All things considered, I think our expenses are a strong data point that you can bootstrap an extremely ambitious software product into existence for a lot less money than you might think. While $123,000 isn’t a small amount of money by any means, that’s spending incurred over four years.</p><h2>Marketing Results</h2><p>One of my favorite aspects of being a marketing founder is that I’ve gotten to build every aspect of our customer acquisition process from the ground up. I’ve used this, quite purposely, to prove a point I’ve always advocated for—the metrics marketers are most often held accountable to are bullshit.</p><p>Website traffic? Vanity metric. Twitter followers? Nonsense. MQLs? There’s just no value in arbitrary lead quotas. None. They hurt more than they help.</p><p>All that matters in marketing is how many buyers actually show up with buying intent. That’s it. Jay Acunzo captures this approach beautifully:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610211733556_13122"><div>

We have quite modest website traffic and our number of account sign-ups each month isn’t eye popping, but the quality of our leads is exceptional.  We get remarkably few low quality leads—I’d say at least 80% of our account sign-ups are founders of SaaS products or membership sites that are a great fit for Outseta. And if you think about it, that makes sense—almost all of our website traffic comes directly from Stripe, Webflow, IndieHackers, Makerpad, or content that I’ve written about bootstrapping subscription businesses. </p><p>With no pressure to hit some arbitrarily set marketing metrics, I haven’t had to turn to more “top of the funnel content” or other channels that would drive less qualified traffic to our site. And perhaps most importantly, this approach fits our strategy—because we want to stay intentionally small, from a resourcing perspective we’re better off with a lower volume of highly qualified leads than a higher volume of less qualified leads. </p><p>Here are our top performing lead generation channels.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610145428502_21408"><div>

    <p>Finding my ways to the firmware of a famous Harley tuner</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: All encryption keys and passwords are fake ones made up for writing this post.</strong></p>

</p>



<p>A tuner is a little device supposed to be plugged to a bike. It is meant to configure the on board computer in order to optimize fuel to air ratios and other parameters. It is known to be used to lift engine power restrictions, or optimize fuel consumption. Though I am pretty sure a real biker will have much better words to describe how it can be used.</p>

<p><img src="https://therealunicornsecurity.github.io/images/Dynojet/dynojet.jpg" alt="_config.yml"></p>

<p>The model studied here is a Power Vision for Harley Davidson, by Dynojet. The hardware is a Bobcat Revision D by Drew Technologies (there is a typo on the PCB, it is actually written Drew <em>Technoligies</em>).</p>

<p><img src="https://therealunicornsecurity.github.io/images/Dynojet/drewtech.jpg" alt="_config.yml"></p>




<p>The tuner is supposed to be configured while being connected to a computer. It has a mini-USB input next to the CAN Bus (this one should be connected to the bike’s on board computer). The tools used to configure it are free to download on Dynojet’s website.</p>

<p><img src="https://therealunicornsecurity.github.io/images/Dynojet/wintools.png" alt="_config.yml"></p>

<p>The installed Windows tools contain the following binaries:</p>
<ul>
  <li>WinPV.exe: the main software with the GUI</li>
  <li>PVUpdateClient.exe: updater, its job is to download in charge new firmwares and copying them through the USB link</li>
  <li>RecoveryTool.exe: called exclusively by the PVUpdateClient to flash the recovery part of the firmware</li>
  <li>PVLink.dll: in charge of the communication through the serial port, very important</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://therealunicornsecurity.github.io/images/Dynojet/pv_files.png" alt="_config.yml"></p>

<p>Now our goal is to get the firmware so we can start reversing. Checking on YouTube tutorials and TheWaybackMachine, we can see that firmwares used to be available directly on Dynojet’s website, under the <strong>firmware</strong> section, which is now empty. We find an interesting lead by running the PVUpdateCLient.exe, and Wireshark simultaneously.</p>

<p><img src="https://therealunicornsecurity.github.io/images/Dynojet/pvupdate.png" alt="_config.yml"></p>

<p>The Wireshark capture shows plaintext HTTP going to <em>dynojetpowervision.com</em> and checking for available firmware files. There is no real protection here, just the User-Agent you are supposed to be using is “PVUpdateClient”, otherwise the files remain hidden.<br>
Using <strong>curl</strong>, we get the filenames we are looking for:</p>

<p>We start focusing on the <strong>FIRMWARE</strong> and <strong>SYSTEM_UPGRADE</strong> files, as they are the most likely to contain what we are interested in. We download them using <strong>wget</strong>, and trouble begins here:</p>

</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <strong>SYSTEM_RECOVERY</strong>, that we will call “PVR file” is a password protected archive, and the <strong>FIRMWARE</strong> file, named “PVU_FILE”, is actually encrypted using Openssl. Also, the PVU_CERT file indicates that there might be an integrity check performed on the PVU_FILE.</p>

<p>I’ll skip the details, but since the PVR file is written in plaintext on the device, it was obvious that one of the tools (in this case RecoveryTool.exe) had the password somewhere. A bit of reverse engineering later, we get a password “POWERVISION_RECOVER_3456789Z”. Though I won’t explain the whole thing here, this password is actually somewhat hidden. It is not hardcoded but instead, some loops go over integer values to generate the ending pattern of the password and then concatenate a capital letter to it. There is a clear intention to hide this from badly intentioned users, and that’s usually a sign we’re on the right track.</p>

<h3 id="recovery-file-contents">Recovery File Contents</h3>

<div><div><pre><code>nandflash_bobcat.bin: data

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The recovery file is a u-boot image with a Kernel image. The entropy of the files indicates that parts of them are encrypted. Also, the presence of <em>at91bootstrap</em> file indicates we are in presence of a SAM AT 91 board, which can use secure boot. Damned. We can though get one information from those files: the processor type is  <strong>SAM926X</strong><br>
Browsing the internet, we also can find the following forum post, where a Drew <em>Technoligies</em> employee asks information about this very same family of processors (specifically, the SAM9260-EK): https://lists.denx.de/pipermail/u-boot/2011-June/093651.html</p>

<h3 id="update-file">Update File</h3>

<p>Since the update file is encrypted, we can formulate two hypothesis:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The firmware is stored encrypted, and decrypted at runtime. That might be slow, but since the board supports secure boot, it is a viable hypothesis.</li>
  <li>The firmware is stored unencrypted, only the updates are encrypted. The update process decrypts the PVU_FILE, and replaces the running firmware. Would be nice, wouldn’t it?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="22-physical-setup">2.2: Physical setup</h2>

<p>A quick and dirty win is always to desolder the memory chip to get the firmware. But in that case, it is a bit more complicated. The entire PCB was molded in a plastic protection, probably for sealing against humidity.</p>

<p><img src="https://therealunicornsecurity.github.io/images/Dynojet/mold1.jpg" alt="_config.yml"></p>

<p><img src="https://therealunicornsecurity.github.io/images/Dynojet/mold2.jpg" alt="_config.yml"></p>

<p>I had to cut it open to see the actual PCB:</p>

<p><img src="https://therealunicornsecurity.github.io/images/Dynojet/open_pcb.jpg" alt="_config.yml"></p>

<p>The memory chip seems to be soldered on the other side of the PCB. It is pretty bad news because it is under the screen, and it would probably destroy the device to try to get this physically. Also, at this stage, we don’t know if getting the chip will help us. It could simply contain an Openssl encrypted file that is decrypted during the boot process. So we looked elsewhere.<br>
By looking closely, we can spot 4 pins with written <strong>DEBUG</strong> over it!</p>

<p><img src="https://therealunicornsecurity.github.io/images/Dynojet/ports.jpg" alt="_config.yml"></p>

<p>So we connect to it using an UART to USB adapter, and fire up minicom.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>ROMBoot
Welcome to bobcat
bocat login:
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Problem is the shell is password protected, and even after days of bruteforcing (using <a href="https://github.com/FireFart/UARTBruteForcer/blob/master/uart.py">this tool</a>), no password was found. Also, U-Boot is set as quiet and there is no way from this shell to interact with the boot sequence.<br>
One track remains unexplored: the <strong>RECOVERY MODE</strong></p>

<h3 id="recovery-mode">Recovery Mode</h3>

<p>Messing around with the RecoveryTool.exe we find that there is a recovery mode for the device. It is activated by pressing the power button while plugin in the USB link.</p>

<p><img src="https://therealunicornsecurity.github.io/images/Dynojet/recovery.jpg" alt="_config.yml"></p>

<p>Now what is interesting with this mode is that it switches the communication mode on the USB Link port. In fact, in nominal working mode, this port uses a proprietary protocol that restrains many actions (I will detail this in a dedicated part), whereas in recovery mode the port exposes a U-Boot shell!</p>

<p>We can modify the boot parameters in order to bypass the authentication on the internal UART debug port:</p>

<span>bootdelay</span><span>=</span>3

Environment size: 319/131068 bytes
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>We replace <em>quiet</em> with <em>single</em> in order to deactivate the authentication, add a delay so we have enough time to get to the UART shell, and set <em>silent</em> to “no” in order to make sure we have a boot trace on the UART shell.</p>

<p>To do this, we need to be connected <strong>simultaneously</strong> to the USB link where we configure the new parameters, and the internal UART debug port, where the shell should pop.</p>

<p><img src="https://therealunicornsecurity.github.io/images/Dynojet/recovery_shell.jpg" alt="_config.yml"></p>

<p>Once all the parameters are set, running the <em>boot</em> command on the USB Link with U-Boot will trigger a single user recovery mode boot:</p>

    <p>I had planned building the kata for <code>Number.parseInt()</code> already a while ago.
Starting to work I discovered very quickly that this seemingly tiny kata is quite a 
rabbit hole that offers a lot of things one can learn.
Especially about how things evolve in the spec and how to read the spec, fortunately
this is a pretty easy to read part of the spec.</p>

<h2 is="more-h2" id="numberparseint-and-the-global-parseint"><code>Number.parseInt()</code> and the Global <code>parseInt()</code></h2>
<p>Actually ES6 makes the <code>Number.parseInt()</code> kata very simple. 
Because it just says it's the same as the global <code>parseInt</code>.
Reading the spec it seems this is a simple piece of JavaScript.
The kata should be easy to build. It builds on the existing global <code>parseInt</code>
function, so what is there left to learn for <code>Number.parseInt()</code>? Can I not just simply
link to the ES1 kata for <code>parseInt</code>?</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://blog.jskatas.org/blog/2021/01/11-building-the-parseint-kata/1-2.jpg" alt="The Number.parseInt spec text." width="100%">
    <figcaption>The Number.parseInt spec text.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the ES6 kata I currently just plan to have two tests (see image below). 
And I am thinking of adding a third one that just says "look into the ES1 kata for the global <code>parseInt</code>".
And this is where it gets a bit difficult.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://blog.jskatas.org/blog/2021/01/11-building-the-parseint-kata/2-1.jpg" alt="To begin with, two tests in this kata." width="300">
    <figcaption>To begin with, two tests in this kata.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 is="more-h2" id="es1-parseint">ES1: <code>parseInt()</code></h2>
<p>I looked up <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262-arch.htm">the spec archive</a> 
and <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST-ARCH/ECMA-262,%201st%20edition,%20June%201997.pdf">in ES1 <code>parseInt</code> was already specified</a> 
(see image below). 
But the content in the ES6 spec is quite different (see 2nd image below).
The ES1 spec has a list of 26 items defining the global <code>parseInt()</code> function, ES6 only 16.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://blog.jskatas.org/blog/2021/01/11-building-the-parseint-kata/3-1.jpg" alt="The ES1 spec text for parseInt." width="100%">
    <figcaption>The ES1 spec text for parseInt.</figcaption>

<figure>
    <img src="https://blog.jskatas.org/blog/2021/01/11-building-the-parseint-kata/3-2.jpg" alt="The ES6 spec text for parseInt, different to ES1." width="100%">
    <figcaption>The ES6 spec text for parseInt, different to ES1.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The change is interesting, since I was always under the assumption that JavaScript
only gets extended and never (or only very rarely) changed, so that it stays backwards 
compatible all the time.</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="diff-between-es1-and-es6">Diff Between ES1 and ES6</h2>
<p>Now, I have to decide how to continue for building the kata.
I had two choices:</p>
<ol>
<li>figure out when it changed, between ES1 and ES6, or</li>
<li>read the spec texts carefully and figure out if it matters for my kata.</li>
</ol>
<p>I went with 1), since I am too lazy for 2) and doubt I get it done this year.</p>
<p>The <code>parseInt</code> spec text changed significantly <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST-ARCH/ECMA-262,%203rd%20edition,%20December%201999.pdf">in ES3</a>. 
It is still not the same as <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-parseint-string-radix">in ES6</a> 
and also different to <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/index.html#sec-parseint-string-radix">ES10</a>.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://blog.jskatas.org/blog/2021/01/11-building-the-parseint-kata/5-1.jpg" alt="The ES3 spec of parseInt." width="100%">
    <figcaption>The ES3 spec of parseInt.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>The original question I wanted to answer was: In which category does the kata for <code>parseInt</code> belong? 
Into "ES1" or somewhere else?
I guess the answer is I put it into ES1 but will use the latest spec to write the kata, 
and assume the functionality has not changed (significantly).</p>
<p>In case I ever figure out that the functionality of <code>parseInt</code> has changed between ES1 and ES10, 
I would have to come back and split the <code>parseInt</code> kata and move the changes into the according ESx kata.</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="es5-introduced-one-change">ES5 Introduced one Change</h2>
<p>One thing <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt#ECMAScript_5_removes_octal_interpretation">changed with ES5 about how <code>parseInt</code> works</a>. 
"ECMAScript 5 removes octal interpretation" - I am glad this has changed, it did bite me hard once.
See below for the entire explanation from MDN. 
So good to read this, and also to read the hint <strong>"always specify a radix"</strong>.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://blog.jskatas.org/blog/2021/01/11-building-the-parseint-kata/10-1.jpg" alt="ECMAScript 5 removes octal interpretation" width="300">
    <figcaption>ECMAScript 5 removes octal interpretation</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 is="more-h2" id="katas-done">Katas Done</h2>
<p>So I finished two new katas for <code>parseInt</code>. 
One <a href="https://jskatas.org/#bundle-es6-katas">the ES6 version</a>, 
the other in <a href="https://jskatas.org/#bundle-es1-katas">ES1</a> 
and the in-depth one is just a draft. 
<a href="https://github.com/tddbin/katas/pull/80">PR is ready</a>. 
Input welcome.</p>
<p>Here is what it looks like currently, on my local system, and is probably already merged at the time you are reading this.</p>
<figure>

    <figcaption>The ES1 and ES6 katas.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It is live.
The ES1 <code>parseInt()</code> kata is live, now. The in-depth one will follow.
<a href="https://jskatas.org/">https://jskatas.org</a></p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I would sum up my learning like this: </p>
<ul>
<li>read the spec, </li>
<li>get your hands dirty, </li>
<li>investigate the roots, </li>
<li>you will always learn something along the way. </li>
</ul>
<p>The best part, is that you never know when the different dots of your knowledge connect.
Stay hungry, keep learning.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>January 13, 2021</p><div><div><p><img alt="Wolf family" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div></div><p>A little over one year ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/jon_perl/status/1193726557988118530" target="\_blank">we open sourced</a> the first version of <a href="https://github.com/qawolf/qawolf" target="_blank">QA Wolf</a>, a tool to help developers create browser tests.</p><p>Our goal with QA Wolf was to help developers ship confidently and improve the quality of web-based software. Since then, we've shipped over a hundred releases based on feedback from our users. â�¤ï¸�</p><p>Despite these improvements, we learned that QA Wolf was still too difficult to use for many developers (including ourselves). They still needed to install a Node.js package, set up CI, and become a detective to understand why their test failed. ðŸ•µï¸�</p><p>These learnings inspired us to build <a href="https://www.qawolf.com/" target="_blank">QA Wolf 2.0</a>: an easy way to create, run, and debug tests directly from the browser. And we had an important decision to make...</p><h3>Should QA Wolf 2.0 be open source?</h3><p>We kicked around various ideas, including open sourcing parts of the codebase while keeping others closed source. Then we asked ourselves, "what if we just open source all of it?"</p><p>It sounded terrifying at first. Our minds dwelled on the possibility of someone ripping off our entire product.</p><p>After the initial wave of anxiety subsided, the arguments for open sourcing came clearer into focus. We talked it over with our investors, and they agreed: the pros vastly outweighed the cons.</p><p>So today we are <a href="https://github.com/qawolf/qawolf" target="_blank">open sourcing QA Wolf 2.0</a>. We are excited for you to check it out, and look forward to your feedback!</p><div><p><img alt="Confused dog" src="https://qawolf-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/finn-code-review.gif" width="100%"></p><p>Our code reviewer Finn</p></div><p>Here is why we open sourced everything:</p><h3>It helps build a community</h3><p>QA Wolf is built for developers who want an easy way to set up browser tests. Open sourcing allows us to meet our audience where they are, and invites the feedback we need to build a great experience.</p><p>Open sourcing helps gain developers' trust. They can use QA Wolf without worrying about vendor lock-in. They can peek at the source code, and edit it for their own use case.</p><p>Being open source also makes product improvements public, building confidence about the future of the project.</p><h3>We will move faster and build a better product</h3><p>Building in the open is scary. Someone might discover a security hole, or make fun of that gross code we wrote.</p><p>We've found this to be a powerful forcing function. Having open issues motivates us to fix them faster, and we feel embarrassed if we don't show consistent progress. We also write better code knowing that anyone can see it.</p><p>Finally, we will be grateful for any contributions we get from being open source. ðŸ™�</p><h3>Open core is a headache</h3><p>We considered adopting an "open core" model, where only some parts of the codebase would be publicly available. As we evaluated this option, we realized that it created more problems than it solved.</p><p>Open core software is harder to contribute to and maintain. We would have to manage separate packages for various parts of the codebase, and no one else could contribute to the closed source code.</p><p>On top of deployment headaches, we would need to constantly evaluate whether new code should be open or closed source. Having a single open source project relieves us and future developers from this burden. It also allows our community to have maximum visibility into our codebase.</p><h3>It just feels right</h3><p>"Be open" is one of our values, and open sourcing feels like the right thing to do.</p><p>When we reflect on the good things that have happened to us this year, all of them came from being an open source company. We got invaluable feedback from the very first iteration of QA Wolf. We were also able to raise a pre-seed round (more to come soon in an upcoming post!).</p><p>After committing to making our source code public, we had to answer one more question.</p><h3>What license do we use?</h3><p>We want to clarify one thing upfront: <b>we're still not sure we made the right decision</b>. We did what we thought was best at the time to keep moving forward. In the future, our license may change based on your feedback.</p><p>After studying open source licenses, we narrowed down our options:</p><ol><li>Use a permissive license like Apache-2.0. This license allows people to use your code however they want, including to directly compete with your service.</li><li>Use the Business Source License (BSL). This license allows people to use your code however they want, except to directly compete with your service without buying a license. Over the past few years, companies like <a href="https://blog.sentry.io/2019/11/06/relicensing-sentry" target="_blank">Sentry</a> and <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/oss-relicensing-cockroachdb/" target="_blank">CockroachDB</a> have adopted this license.</li></ol><p>We decided to pursue both options.</p><p>We've licensed <a href="https://github.com/qawolf/qawolf/blob/main/LICENSE.md" target="_blank">most folders</a> (CLI and helpers, code generation and test runner) under Apache-2.0. QA Wolf 2.0 would not be possible without similarly licensed open source projects like the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright" target="_blank">Playwright test framework</a>. It's important that we give back to the community that has given so much to us.</p><p>The remainder of our product is licensed under BSL. When evaluating this option, we found that <a href="https://blog.sentry.io/2019/11/06/relicensing-sentry#deciding-to-re-license" target="_blank">Sentry's goals for licensing</a> resonated with us:</p><ul><li>"Anyone should be able to run <!-- -->[the service]<!-- --> for themselves or their business"</li><li>"No difference between our cloud service and our open source product (no open core model)"</li><li>"Minimal limitations on usage of code, as free as possible"</li><li>"Protection from other companies selling our work"</li></ul><p>Our goal is to build a sustainable business around our product, and we need to have the resources to do that. BSL allows us to share our source code while giving us some protection over our work.</p><p>In the future, we may license the entirety of QA Wolf under Apache-2.0. We're starting here to ensure that we get more rather than less permissive over time.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Thanks for making it this far. We hope you'll try <a href="https://www.qawolf.com/" target="_blank">QA Wolf 2.0</a> and let us know how it goes. ðŸ�º</p><p>If you'd like to get in touch, we'd love to hear from you at <a href="mailto:hello@qawolf.com">hello@qawolf.com</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>I’ve got a new Apple laptop, so I thought I’d do an Emacs build benchmark.  Building Emacs is what people do on computers, right?  At least if I extrapolate from myself, which is the only natural thing to do.</p>
<p>It’s called proof by induction.  Look it up, nerds.</p>
<p>So here’s the benchmarks:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>My Main Build Machine</td>
<td>AMD Ryzen 7 3700X (8 Core/16 Threads)</td>
<td>2m14s</td>
<td>7m31</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>My Lenovo Carbon X1 Laptop</td>
<td>Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10610U CPU (4 Core/4 Threads)</td>
<td>6m22s</td>
<td>15m22</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>My Old Apple Laptop</td>
<td>Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7360U CPU (2 Core/4 Threads)</td>
<td>7m13s</td>
<td>12m33</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>My New M1 Apple Laptop</td>
<td>Apple M1 (4-to-8-ish Cores)</td>
<td>2m44s</td>
<td>6m37s</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The next-to-last column is with -jTO-THE-MAX, and the last column is with -j1.</p>
<p>I’m impressed!  The M1 is able to build Emacs almost as fast as my AMD machine…  which is a lot bigger.</p>
<p>Of course, on Debian I’m using gcc and on Macos I’m using clang, so it’s an apples-to-some-different-brand-of-apples comparison.</p>
<p>It’s even more impressive how much faster this laptop is compared to the Apple laptop from…  2019?  Yeah.  It’s more than twice as fast!  And doesn’t have a fan!  The old Apple laptop would sound like a VAX in a hurricane while building Emacs!</p>
<p>And it’s also twice as fast as the laptop I use daily here on the couch; last year’s Lenovo Carbon X1, which is just embarrassing.  Lenovo!  Get on it!  Make an ARM laptop that’s fast!</p>
<p>For the first time in my life, I have Apple envy.  That is, for the first time ever, they’ve made a laptop that’s clearly superior to what’s available for us Linux peeps.  My only comfort is that the Apple keyboard still sucks.  Yeah!  And it doesn’t have a TrackPoint!  Yeah!  My laptop is still the best!  Yeah!  Take that!</p>

<p>Yeah!  I’m not the least envious!</p>
<p>*sniff*</p>
<p>Edit some hours later:</p>
<p>But one thing that would be interesting to look at is Emacs performance on M1 vs the other machines.  And a way to broadly look at that is to see how long it takes to byte-compile a bunch of Emacs Lisp files: This exercises much of Emacs, except display-related stuff.</p>
<p>So:  Benchmarking with</p>
<pre>rm `find lisp -name '*.elc'`; time make -jMAX</pre>
<p>I get:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>My Main Build Machine</td>
<td>AMD Ryzen 7 3700X (8 Core/16 Threads)</td>
<td>0m57s</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>My Lenovo Carbon X1 Laptop</td>
<td>Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10610U CPU (4 Core/4 Threads)</td>
<td>4m13s</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>My Old Apple Laptop</td>
<td>Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7360U CPU (2 Core/4 Threads)</td>
<td>5m33s</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>My New M1 Apple Laptop</td>
<td>Apple M1 (4-to-8-ish Cores)</td>
<td>1m33s</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Here the AMD clearly wins over the ARM, but per-core performance is in advantage of the ARM.  And, of course, the ARM soundly wins over both of the other two laptops.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article id="post-1749"><div><p>Let me share a short story. I used to hate doing squats at the gym. I would make good progress in every strength-training exercise except for the squat. My posture felt wrong, I had a hard time coordinating my movements, and my numbers would never improve. It was embarrassing, really. I ended up thinking of doing squats as something complicated, frustrating, and potentially dangerous; something I was better off avoiding altogether.</p><p>How do I feel about doing squats now? It’s become my #1 favorite strength-training exercise. Who changed my mind? A great personal trainer I met a few years ago who still trains me to this day. He taught me the right technique, helped me strengthen my weak spots while keeping the entire process challenging and motivating. He completely changed my perspective on squats. Now, I think they’re fun!</p><p>I have met many students over the years who saw negotiation just like I used to see squats: something hard and risky, something to avoid. Most people&nbsp;<em>want</em>&nbsp;to negotiate because they know that it’s the only way to obtain desirable outcomes. Their issue is they haven’t acquired the knowledge and developed the right skills to negotiate well enough yet to obtain these outcomes.</p><p>My goal is to help you acquire these skills. My approach to negotiation training is based on three tenets.</p><h3><strong>You can’t get stronger unless you learn the proper technique</strong></h3><p>A lot of people who claim to be great negotiators often mean that they are great at haggling. When people haggle, all they do is make price concessions until the other party agrees. It’s not hard, and it’s something you can learn quickly by mimicking others. Negotiation is a complex process designed to increase value and resolve conflicts. There are many ways one can screw up a negotiation.</p><p>To be a good negotiator, you need to know how to make the right decisions. Nobody was born knowing how to prepare for a negotiation, how to craft a first offer, or how to deal with negotiators who lie; these are learnt behaviors. Sure, you could rely on your intuition and figure things out on your own, but why would you try to reinvent the wheel when we already have established methods available?</p><p>For this reason, my next few emails will focus on proven methods and techniques to help you approach the main steps of a negotiation.</p><h3><strong>You can’t excel at everything, but you can mitigate your risks</strong></h3><p>Negotiation mobilizes so many different cognitive and interpersonal skills that it would be unreasonable to expect excelling at all of them. Nobody is THAT good. Negotiating is a stress test on your entire system, which means that you are only as strong as your weakest element.</p><p>Maybe you are too focused on making your counterpart happy, and you often leave the negotiation table having regrets about your own outcome. Maybe you have the opposite problem and you only see a negotiation as successful if you completely crush the other party. Now, nobody wants to negotiate with you anymore. It could be many things, but there are usual suspects and there are ways to deal with them.</p><p>You can’t completely fix your weaknesses, but you can use strategies to work around them. This will be the second phase of our negotiation training.</p><h3><strong>Becoming a good negotiator is a long-term commitment</strong></h3><p>Just like everything in life that has to do with human performance, negotiation training strictly follows the law of diminishing returns. This comes with good news and bad news.</p><p>The good news is that if you apply yourself to improving your negotiation skills, you will make progress very quickly in the beginning. This is a phase that people often find exhilarating because they feel like they have finally unlocked their potential.</p><p>The bad news is that the further you go in your negotiation training, the harder it will be for you to make new gains. You won’t be able to get by just by following basic rules anymore; it will be time to refine your skills. You will need to be exposed to increasingly complex negotiation situations, with incentives to keep you engaged and motivated throughout the process.</p><p>For this reason, my plan is to maintain this newsletter in the long-term, with fresh perspectives and different opportunities to engage.</p><h2>Do You Want to Improve Your Negotiation Skills?</h2><p>Sign-up using the form below.

            <p>
                
                <section>                
                    <time datetime="January 13, 2021">January 13, 2021</time>
                    
                </section>
            </p>
        

        <section>
            <p>Do you like your team standups? What about your team, do they like their standups?
Are they useful? You might think they are, but you might also be missing the point.</p>

<h2 id="whats-wrong">What’s wrong?</h2>

<p>I don’t want to sound harsh (dammit, I did it again), but… I bet your team is doing
things wrong. It’s not hard at all to mess things up and continuously thinking that
everything is fine. It happens a lot with shy teams; they might talk to each other about
these things, but they avoid raising the flag.</p>

<p>So, my advice here is, don’t trust your feelings; pause and observe their mood and
interactions during the meeting (take this advice to the next level and apply it to
every other meeting, you might see the same patterns) and ask yourself a simple question:
are they worth it?</p>

<h2 id="how-they-really-are-most-of-the-times">How they really are (most of the times)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Waste of time;</li>
  <li>Unnecessary pressure;</li>
  <li>Live status report.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your standup looks like a status report (you might have to pause and observe first),
you landed the right post, I guess. It’s not cool to have status reports, not cool at all.
It’s stressful and depressing. Not the right way to start the day, if it’s your case.</p>

<h2 id="you-dont-need-another-status-report">You don’t need another status report</h2>

<p>There’s a common practice of using standups to ask developers how long it takes to finish
a given feature. “Are you done yet?”, “And now, it’s finished?”, “How long it will take?”.</p>

<p>I don’t like these types of questions. It triggers feelings of pressure, insecurity, doubt,
you name it; I can’t find any valid reason to ask these kinds of questions during a standup.</p>

<p>A lot of people fear the spotlight, and it’s fine. A lot of people fear missing behind, and
again, it’s fine. It might be stressful to watch your teammates delivering multiple features
while you’re struggling with something complex. What if you struggle for two days or more?</p>

<p>In a standard status report, you either say that you finished something yesterday, or that
you’ll try to finish it today; you don’t say you’re struggling, you don’t ask for help, but
you should, and your teammates should offer their help.</p>

<h2 id="yesterday-yesterday-yesterday">Yesterday, yesterday, yesterday</h2>

<p>There’s another common practice of <em>just</em> telling what you did yesterday. Do you really need
to tell your teammates what you did yesterday? Unless you’re not making any kind of progress,
or you’re doing solo work (which you shouldn’t, if you work on a team), your teammates should
know already what you did yesterday.</p>

<p>We live in a world where every single line of code you do, is probably linked up to the related
feature. There are <em>issues</em>, <em>commits</em>, <em>pull-requests</em>, <em>merges</em>, <em>validations</em>, <em>deploys</em>,
<em>releases</em>. There are notifications and logs for each of these actions, and all of them are linked,
all of them should involve multiple people (if you work in a small team, ideally it should involve
all of your team), so the question is, why should you repeat yourself every single day?</p>

<p>The answer is: you shouldn’t; everyone in your team should know already what you did yesterday.
You did your work, you were able to communicate with your teammates, you even shipped the feature
into production, everyone at the company should know by now what you’ve been doing!</p>

<h2 id="what-about-writing-instead-of-speaking">What about writing instead of speaking?</h2>

<p>I like to write things down:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It helps me formalize my thoughts</li>
  <li>It serves as a personal diary</li>
  <li>Tends to improve my writing skills</li>
  <li>I can share them in multiple mediums</li>
  <li>I can look back and see what I wrote a few weeks ago.</li>
</ul>

<p>What if you wrote down your daily/weekly/monthly progress, instead of giving a live status report
every single day? If you value outstanding documentation, you’re probably surrounded by people
with outstanding writing skills. Writing should not be a problem for these kinds of individuals.</p>

<p>Everything you need for a <em>status report</em> like standup is already available on your digital collaboration
platform. You have multiple features, multiple work items, multiple states (todo, in-progress, done)
for each work item, multiple assignees for each work item, plus their corresponding commits, pull-requests,
deploys…</p>

<h2 id="tracking-disperse-but-valuable-information">Tracking disperse (but valuable) information</h2>

<p>You can make use of this valuable (but disperse) information and track it on your team channel. At the
end of the day, everyone in the team should know that Pedro took an item from <em>todo</em>, had a discussion
with another two teammates in the issue itself before merging three detailed commits into <em>master</em> that
were deployed into production a few minutes later.</p>

<p>If you want to give daily detailed updates, you can still write a compacted version of the activity log.
Give the activity log a try, and go with weekly updates; encourage your team to write their macro
accomplishments of the week; bundle those together and give a nice presentation to the whole company.
There are so many companies and open-source projects out there that deliver amazing products without
syncing every single day, why should you?</p>



<p>If you want to have some kind of human contact, write down your status and use those standups for things
that really matter: collaboration, collaboration, and collaboration. Check for dependencies, ask for help,
offer help, unblock the blockers, discuss and plan your day (especially if you’re pairing/mobbing), and for
f*cks sake, say hi to your teammates…</p>

<h2 id="is-there-any-action-point">Is there any action point?</h2>

<p>Optimize your daily team routine, drop those f*cking status reports and use that slot to start the day
(or week) in the right mood!</p>

        <div>

          <div data-article-id="121" id="article-body">
            <p>Over the years, I have been fortunate to spend lots of time (full-time for the last 2 years) learning from how thousands of early-stage (pre-series-A) COSS founders think, operate, build and more.</p>

<p>The #1 most critical quality I often see missing from their thought process and overall approach is a deep understanding of what I like to call "Market Dynamics". Let's dig into what I mean.</p>

<p>When building a COSS company in the early days, it is common to focus only on the technology. You are building something exciting for developers or end users who care about open source. It might be easy to think that once you build this exciting open source thing, everyone will organically learn about it and start to use it.. and that assumption might end up being right! Open source has amazing ways of finding efficient distribution, engagement and stickiness with large user communities, quickly.</p>

<p>In reality, as a COSS founder, you almost always have to be equal parts business builder (entrepreneur) and open source builder (technologist).</p>

<p>However, what nearly every early-stage COSS founder I speak with fails to deeply understand is the importance of having a clear point-of-view on the following questions, and furthermore, very thoughtful data that serve to illuminate a comprehensive perspective on a given market:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Once I build a commercial product or service around my open source core, who am I targeting? Who is/will be the end user customer?</p></li>
<li><p>What will I charge my end user customer for, exactly?</p></li>
<li><p>What pain points am I solving for that will be measurable enough to have someone pay for solving them?</p></li>
<li><p>Am I operating in a space that existing/legacy vendors are serving? If yes, who are those companies? What do they charge for? How do they charge for it? What are the revenues/growth rates or analyst sentiment on that market?</p></li>
<li><p>Is my end user customer educated about the capabilities of a COSS product (not your open source project) I will build in future? If not, do I have to educate those potential customers about a partially or completely new "terminology stack" in order for them to see the value? In other words, am I creating a new category/market or disrupting an existing one? Or something in between?</p></li>
<li><p>If I am operating in an existing market instead of creating a new one, what does that current market look like? How large is it (# of customers, $ spent per year, competitors, etc)? Is it evolving (why and how)?</p></li>
<li><p>Is my open source core a feature of a larger product that may be hard or improbable to commercialize at scale on its own? (bundling vs. unbundling)</p></li>
<li><p>Are there other companies (open core or not) addressing the customer market I am going after in the future? If yes, who are they and how are they doing? (funding, growth, revenue, etc)</p></li>
<li><p>What are my technical differentiators that will give my commercial product a distinct advantage, and why?</p></li>
<li><p>How will I charge for my commercial product (unit of measure, pricing model, etc) and is this based on re-thinking an existing approach already in the market, where customers have been conditioned to pay a certain way, or is this likely to be a new pricing approach?</p></li>
<li><p>How will I "go-to-market" with my future product? How will I achieve distribution? How will I access my target customers? How will they discover me?</p></li>
<li><p>How will my product sales motions work in the early days? Self-serve? Hands-on?</p></li>
<li><p>When will I start to build commercial product and what will the drivers be which will affect that timeline?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These are just a few high-level questions that, if answered with critical consideration, can unlock a great deal of clarity about how to mitigate risks and make better decisions. </p>

<p>As a solo or duo technical founding team, you often may NOT need to hire another team member early on to answer these questions. In fact, if you need to bring on another team member in order to begin to precisely answer these questions and develop strong points-of-view, you may not be the right founding team for the company you are building.</p>

<p>The best founding teams (CTO and CEO) both have strong understandings of these questions and have different ways of looking at the questions. </p>

<p>There are no perfectly "right" or "wrong" answers. The only failure is in forgetting to think carefully about all of these questions from Day 0 or when you embark on your journey to build a company.</p>

It was launched on January 2019, and one of its interesting features is a π/4-DQPSK high-speed transmitter for the 435 MHz Amateur satellite band.</p>



<p>I was always interested in implementing a decoder for this satellite, due to its unusual modulation, but the technical information that is publicly available is scarce, so I never set to do it. A few days ago, <a href="http://uz7.ho.ua/">Andrei Kopanchuk UZ7HO</a> asked me a question about the Reed-Solomon code used in this satellite. He was working on a decoder for this satellite, and had some extra documentation. This renewed my interest in building a decoder for this satellite.</p>



<p>With some help from Andy regarding the symbol mapping for the π/4-DQPSK constellation, I have made a <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/gr-satellites/blob/master/examples/satellites/nexus.grc">decoder GNU Radio flowgraph</a> that I have added to <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/gr-satellites/">gr-satellites</a>.</p>



<p>The modulation used by NEXUS is actually listed as π/4-QPSK 38k4 in several sites, such as in the <a href="http://nexusoperation.seesaa.net/article/479513451.html">satellite operations schedule</a>. However, to be more precise, the modulation is 19.2 kbaud π/4-DQPSK. This means that each pair of bits is encoded as the phase shift between one symbol and the next one. There are four possible phase shifts: \(\pi/4\), \(3\pi/4\), \(5\pi/4\), and \(7\pi/4\).</p>



<p>Thus, if the constellation is rotated appropriately, the constellation symbols are \(1\), \(i\), \(-1\), \(-i\) for even symbols, and \((1+i)/\sqrt{2}\), \((-1+i)/\sqrt{2}\), \((-1-i)/\sqrt{2}\), \((1-i)/\sqrt{2}\) for odd symbols. These are two QPSK constellations staggered by a 45 degree rotation.</p>



<p>The symbol mapping used by NEXUS to transform the phase differences between adjacent symbols into dibits is shown in the table below, together with the more usual QPSK symbol mapping that assigns to the constellation symbols \(z = \pm 1 \pm i\) the dibit given by \((\operatorname{Re}(z)+1)/2\), \((\operatorname{Im}(z)+1)/2\) (here the function \(t \mapsto (t+1)/2\) represents justs a bipolar to unipolar transformation, so that the symbol mapping accounts essentially to taking the real and imaginary parts of the symbol, which is very useful for decoding).</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Phase difference</th><th>NEXUS symbol mapping</th><th>QPSK symbol mapping</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>\(\pi/4\)</td><td>00</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>\(3\pi/4\)</td><td>01</td><td>01</td></tr><tr><td>\(5\pi/4\)</td><td>11</td><td>00</td></tr><tr><td>\(7\pi/4\)</td><td>10</td><td>10</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Comparing the NEXUS symbol mapping with the usual QPSK mapping, we see that we can convert between them by inverting the bits and swapping I and Q, so this gives an effective way of decoding the NEXUS symbol mapping. However, the NEXUS symbol mapping can be constructed in a more natural way by taking the usual order of the 2-bit Gray code, indexed by the phase differences in increasing order.</p>



<p>The baudrate (symbol rate) for the NEXUS signal is 19.2 kbaud. Probably the signal is listed as 38k4 because the bitrate (not taking FEC into account) is 38.4 kbit/s.</p>



<p>The frames transmitted in this signal are standard CCSDS Reed-Solomon frames with a frame size of 223 bytes (not counting the 32 Reed-Solomon parity check bytes). The dual basis is used for the Reed-Solomon code.</p>



<p>The payload of each Reed-Solomon codeword contains a single AX.25 frame, using some sort of HDLC encoding. The best way to describe this encoding is that if we take the payload and invert the bit ordering in each of the bytes (i.e., if we replace \(b_7b_6\ldots b_1b_0\) by \(b_0b_1\ldots b_6b_7\)), then we obtain a perfectly compliant AX.25 frame using HDLC. Bit stuffing, the LSB byte ordering of AX.25, and the CRC-16 CCITT are used. The payload starts by a single <code>0x7e</code> flag, and after the AX.25 frame, <code>0x7e</code> flags are repeated until the end of the payload. These final <code>0x7e</code> flags may or may not be byte-aligned depending on the amount of bit stuffing. This is represented by the image below, which Andy has shared. Note that the zero padding field should actually be <code>0x7e</code> padding.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/NEXUS-frame.png"><img width="942" height="252" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/NEXUS-frame.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/NEXUS-frame.png 942w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/NEXUS-frame-300x80.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/NEXUS-frame-644x172.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/NEXUS-frame-768x205.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 942px) 100vw, 942px"></a><figcaption>NEXUS π/4-DQPSK signal frame structure</figcaption></figure>



<p>This frame structure is quite interesting, because it resembles <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FX.25_Forward_Error_Correction">FX.25</a> in that an AX.25 frame is wrapped by an outer FEC layer. FX.25 is designed to be backwards compatible with AX.25, since an AX.25 receiver will just ignore the wrapping. However, the NEXUS framing is not AX.25-compatible, because of the CCSDS synchronous scrambler and also because the bit ordering in each byte needs to be inverted.</p>



<p>I am curious about why this frame structure was used, since it doesn’t give backwards compatibility with AX.25 receivers (and in any case, there are no 19k2 π/4-DQPSK AX.25 modems that I know of, so backwards compatibility is not very useful). If backwards compatibility is not desired, then it seems much more simple to include the AX.25 frame directly into the Reed-Solomon codeword payload, without using any of the HDLC features (though some way to mark the frame end or length would be needed).</p>



<p>The GNU Radio decoder flowgraph is shown in the figure below. The recording I’ve used has been provided by Andy and can be downloaded <a href="https://gist.github.com/daniestevez/da86fa0d02380d34868f2d1faf87ca1e/raw/4e56972159614675d8b52eed8e8860c9f4b61778/nexus.wav">here</a>. It uses 96ksps real sampling and the signal is centred at about 18750 Hz.</p>



<div>
<div>
<p>A Frequency Xlating FIR Filter is used to move the signal to IQ baseband at 48ksps. Then there is an AGC and the Symbol Sync block, that performs RRC matched filtering and symbol clock recovery.</p>



<p>Each symbol is multiplied by the complex conjugate of the preceding symbol in order to get a constellation that gives the phase difference between adjacent symbols. This constellation is decoded to dibits by using the relation with usual QPSK constellation explained above.</p>



<p>Then the gr-satellites <a href="https://gr-satellites.readthedocs.io/en/latest/components.html#ccsds-deframers">CCSDS Reed-Solomon deframer</a> is used to synchronize to the CCSDS frames, descramble and decode the Reed-Solomon code. The bytes in the payload are reflected to invert the bit ordering and then sent into the HDLC deframer, which checks the CRC-16 and outputs the AX.25 frames.</p>
</div>

<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nexus_flowgraph.png"><img width="1128" height="1052" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nexus_flowgraph.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nexus_flowgraph.png 1128w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nexus_flowgraph-300x280.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nexus_flowgraph-644x601.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nexus_flowgraph-768x716.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1128px) 100vw, 1128px"></a><figcaption>GNU Radio NEXUS π/4-DQPSK decoder flowgraph</figcaption></figure>

</div>



<p>Note that this decoder uses non-coherent demodulation of the differential constellation. Another approach would be to use coherent decoding by including a Costas loop. One way to do so would be to contra-rotate every other symbol by 45 degrees at the output of the Symbol Sync block, in order to compensate for the constellation staggering. Then a regular QPSK Costas loop can be used. At the output of the Costas loop, the 45 degree contra-rotation can be undone. Then the decoding can proceed as in the non-coherent case, by multiplying each symbol with the complex conjugate of the previous one.</p>

<p><span>“As Paulo Coelho wrote in </span><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18144590-the-alchemist?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=K3Q9uLgqQp&amp;rank=1"><i><span>The Alchemist</span></i></a><span>: Everything that happens once can never happen again. But everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time,” Nick references.</span></p>
<p><span>“What the Bitcoin bulls were right about was increased adoption and the ability of many Bitcoin owners to hold (‘</span><a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hodl"><span>HODL</span></a><span>’) even as prices rose dramatically. These two effects (more demand from buyers and reduced supply from sellers) have helped to boost Bitcoin’s price and cement it as a legitimate asset class within the investment community.” — Nick Maggiulli</span></p>
<p><span>People who were skeptical of Bitcoin before its recent price surge, told themselves that they’d buy Bitcoin if it dropped to the $1,000-$2,000 range. This range keeps going up for the skeptics. “…every time the price goes up in the future, these ‘mental buy limits’ go up as well, increasing the likelihood of Bitcoin’s future survival,” Nick explains.</span></p>
<p><span>“…both the price of gold and the price Bitcoin are based around one thing and one thing alone—belief. The belief that these assets will have value in the future.” — Nick Maggiulli</span></p>
<p><span>Nick compares Bitcoin to the early years of the ability to invest in gold. “Though Bitcoin is unlikely to follow a similar path to gold, it is likely to exhibit similar behavior. This means that Bitcoin will continue to have huge run ups in price followed by violent crashes. Crashes that may last years (and possibly decades) in the future.” — Nick Maggiulli</span></p>
<p><span>“…if Bitcoin’s market capitalization were to match that of gold, it would be worth over $500,000 a coin. This is why some investors are so bullish on Bitcoin.” — Nick Maggiulli</span></p>

								<p><b><i>My two cents</i></b><span>: That last fact is pretty mind-blowing. As an investor, the question becomes will Bitcoin ever reach the same market capitalization as gold? Nobody knows the answer to that question, but choosing to invest in Bitcoin means you’re willing to find out. I’m willing to find out. Albeit, I barely put any money in, although many people don’t realize you don’t have to buy 1 whole Bitcoin to invest. You’re able to buy $100 worth or whatever amount you’re comfortable with and still “own Bitcoin.” You’d just be a partial owner alongside tons of other partial owners. </span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>RBAC and ABAC are terms that security teams commonly throw around when discussing authorization and permissions systems. Most developers have heard them at some point and may have a sense for what they mean, but many aren't clear on how to think about RBAC and ABAC as tools for modeling permissions in their apps.</p><p>When building access control in an app, the common misunderstanding is that it's an "either/or" — that it's a decision between RBAC <em>or</em> ABAC — when in fact most applications want for <strong><em>both access control models</em>.</strong></p><p>This page will explain:</p><ul role="list"><li>What is role-based access control (RBAC)?</li><li>What is attribute-based access control (ABAC)?</li><li>What are common use cases and patterns for RBAC &amp; ABAC, and what do you get from each model?</li><li>Why should you think about using both RBAC and ABAC together?</li></ul><p>‍</p><h2>What is Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)?</h2><p><strong>RBAC, which stands for Role-Based Access Control, is a broad classification for using roles to control the access that users have to resources.</strong> Most people are familiar with the concept of roles, and expect them to be a part of any authorization system. For many app developers, roles are the first and fastest step in implementing application authorization.</p><p><a href="https://docs.osohq.com/getting-started/rbac.html">Roles can vary in how they are used, and how they are implemented</a>. Because of this, "RBAC" doesn't have an exact meaning, and it can be confusing and even frustrating to see it characterized as a one-size-fits-all solution.</p><p>Roles provide a structure for assigning groups of permissions to users. They give us a repeatable way to assign those permissions, rather than listing them out to each user every time we want that user to have those permissions. When done well, a role can convey to a user an intuitive understanding of what she can expect to do in the application.</p><p>Imagine we're building a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application like <a href="http://salesforce.com/">Salesforce.com</a>. We want to have at least one person who can, for instance, add new users, delete users, and a maybe do a few other administrative tasks for the company. We could list out these permissions for this one person. (This pattern is actually called an Access Control List, or ACL.) But if we expect to give these same permissions to another person at the company in the future, we'll need to list them out all over again.</p><p>Instead, we can group these permissions into a single <em>role</em>, give that role a name – say, Admin – and assign that role to the people who are responsible for carrying out these tasks.</p><h3>How Does RBAC Work?</h3><p>Most applications start out with simple authorization models because it may not be clear what access patterns the users will want. Roles are a common framework to reach for because: a) most people know about them, and b) you can take a pretty big hammer to your access controls with them.</p><p>For instance, you might say that Users can only take actions <em>foo, bar and baz</em> in an application, whereas Admins can do everything. Problem solved 😎!</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1483105c9a72fd0a3b662a/5ffd06657387a5b07045d2f5_roles%20small.png" loading="lazy" alt="Example: Role-Permission Mapping for Simple RBAC System"></p><figcaption>Example: Role-Permission Mapping for Simple RBAC System</figcaption></figure><p>A typical implementation of this simple model is to store this role ("user" or "admin") in the users table in the database. We map the role to a set of permissions — i.e., what the role is allowed to do. We can configure this information statically in the application, or in some cases we might even enable users to configure custom roles where they get to choose what a role can do.</p><p>Finally, when the user tries to take an action, we enforce this control by checking what role the user has and whether the action is in the set of permissions for their role.</p><h3>The limitations of RBAC</h3><p>This simple model holds up for a short while. But over time, it degrades as common use cases don't quite fit.</p><p>For example, we hire a new type of an employee – say, an IT administrator – and we want to let her add and remove users from the CRM, but we don't want her to see any sales data. The quickest solution is to create a new role with just these permissions. No big deal. Now let's say we hire a contractor, and we want that person to be able to do data entry; we can make a scoped role for him too wherein he can enter data but can't delete data or do anything else...</p><p>As you can see, the overarching approach to this type of problem using roles is: as new scenarios come up, create new, very specific roles. This often leads bizarre groupings of permissions and other hard-to-debug roles setups many folks have encountered in the wild.</p><p>What's more, with this mapping of roles and permissions and the underlying model, developers are left with little choice but to expose a 2D matrix to their end-users, who then have to squint at it to figure out what role or combination of roles they should pick in order to do whatever they're trying to do.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1483105c9a72fd0a3b662a/5ffd0648c5d8bda506b8d011_roles%20big.png" loading="lazy" alt="Example: When RBAC Role-Permission Mapping Starts to Hurt"></p><figcaption>Example: When RBAC Role-Permission Mapping Starts to Hurt</figcaption></figure><p>What's more, the roles model is often insufficient because most applications' underlying data models don't easily fit in a 2D matrix. They're not a flat list of things a user can do. An application might need to traverse organizational hierarchies (VP&gt;manager&gt;etc.), navigate nested resources (parent company&gt;subsidiary, etc.), and model other relationships that don't map to a simple list.</p><p>Let's take our CRM example again. We use this app to track information about prospects and customers – e.g., leads, contacts, deals, and accounts. Let's say we start with a small team. We have some sales reps, managers, and a VP.</p><ul role="list"><li>Sales Reps: can see and edit accounts and deals</li><li>Managers: can additionally approve quotes</li><li>VPs: can additionally assign/re-assign accounts</li></ul><p>Over time, the team grows, and we decide we want to break it up regionally – North America, Europe and Asia. What do we do? We could add roles to reflect the intersection of each role and continent, which would look something like this:</p><ol role="list"><li>VP - North America</li><li>VP - Europe</li><li>VP - Asia</li><li>Manager - North America</li><li>Manager - Europe</li><li>...</li></ol><p>And maybe we have a Global VP who needs the VP role for <em>all</em> regions.</p><p>Then we grow the team further and split it into junior and senior sales teams. Now we need to segment roles by level (VP, manager, etc.), region (Europe, etc.), and sub-team (junior vs. senior).</p><p>In an application like this, thinking about roles as a flat structure across the whole application can quickly lead to more roles than we care to manage.</p><p>Instead, we can think about roles as multidimensional data associated to data structures. For example, if we take our initial set of roles — Sales Reps, Managers, VPs — and associate them to a combination of user and a geographic region, then we can represent the desired granularity without introducing new roles.</p><p>Most RBAC implementations do not actually support this form of roles.</p><p>Traditionally, this kind of context-dependent role is instead considered a form of Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC).</p><p>‍</p><h2>What is Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)?</h2><p><strong>Attribute-based access control (ABAC) is sufficiently broad in that it's both incredibly powerful and almost entirely meaningless and useless as a category of authorization.</strong> While many folks probably think they don't understand the term, they have probably used it in one form or another before.</p><p>ABAC is a way of controlling access to data based on properties (i.e., attributes) of the user and the resource she is accessing. A simple example might be "all users can read <em>public</em> data." In this case, "is public" is an attribute of the data.</p><p>Another example might be: "only users who are <em>staff</em> can read documents that are <em>confidential.</em>" Here we specify the logic using both an attribute of the user – if she is staff or not – and a property of the data – is it confidential or not.</p><p>ABAC is also way of controlling access based on who the user is <em>in relation to</em> the resource or data she wants to access**.** "Users can edit their own files" is an example that may be familiar to many developers – it grants a permission (to edit) based on a relationship (ownership) of a resource (a file).</p><p>Given that attributes can be just about anything, ABAC spans so many scenarios that as a solution set it's not a terribly useful thing to point to. What is perhaps more useful, however, is to describe some of the patterns and use cases that come up frequently. We could use ABAC to implement access control for any of the following:</p><ul role="list"><li>Collaboration applications – e.g., 'a user can edit a file if she owns it or someone has given her editing privileges'</li><li>A multi-tenant application – e.g., 'a user can read this data if she belongs to this company'</li><li>Free vs. paid tiers – e.g., 'a user can access these features if she is a paid subscriber'</li><li>Hierarchies – e.g., 'a user can view this data if she owns it or if she manages an employee that owns it'</li><li>Impersonation – e.g., 'a user can view this data if she owns it or if she is a support engineer with permission to impersonate that user at this time'</li><li>And so on</li></ul><h3>How Does ABAC Work?</h3><p>Developers often "implement" ABAC without realizing it. For example, an if statement that checks whether the user is the file owner is actually a basic ABAC implementation.</p><p>ABAC is a superset of RBAC. Whereas RBAC is a flat 2D model that maps roles to a set of permissions, ABAC is multi-dimensional. So to implement an ABAC system, we need an interface that helps us express a potentially broader variety of rules about who can do what – specifically, we need one that lets us map both attributes on the user and attributes on the resource.</p><p>We can achieve this in a few different ways:</p><ul role="list"><li>Data in a database - We implement permissions by specifying constraints on the query – e.g., <strong>WHERE resource.owner_id = ?</strong> – or as a separate check in the application after data has been accessed.</li><li>Fields from a token - We pass around cryptographic tokens (e.g., JWTs) containing information about the user and what she can do. Application code or proxies check for the presence of correct fields on the token. For example, it might check that a token has the correct scope – e.g., <strong>"read:account" in token.scopes</strong>.</li><li>Policy engine - We express authorization logic using a policy language, and evaluate it over the relevant input data. For …</li></ul></div></div></div>

He was further banned from, or severely restricted from communicating by: <a href="https://www.axios.com/platforms-social-media-ban-restrict-trump-d9e44f3c-8366-4ba9-a8a1-7f3114f920f1.html">Reddit, Twitch, Shopify (??), Snapchat, TikTok, and Stripe.</a> Within 24 hours, amidst a chorus of “it’s just the free market, losers, if you don’t like it build your own app,” Google and Apple worked in concert to remove Parler, the “free speech” alternative social media app popular on the political right, from their app stores. Amazon followed the move with the equivalent of tech industry napalm, taking the extraordinary step of suspending Parler from using Amazon Web Services, effectively shutting the company down. The loosely-framed charge against both Trump and Parler was incitement of violence and insurrection. There were no trials. There was no evidence presented for any crime formally argued. This is law in the age of corporate oligarchy. It is purposefully ambiguous, it is uncompromising, and when you run afoul of the powers that be, there is no recourse. Not even for the “most powerful man in the world.” </p><p>This of course begs the question: who is actually in charge right now? </p><p>Today, the internet is a life-critical layer of our world. In some sense, what happens on the internet —&nbsp;from payments to communication —&nbsp;is all that matters, as without it few things of significance in the “real world” are possible. You would be forgiven for not remembering that Trump was impeached last year, as it meant practically nothing. But erasing him from the internet? If this sticks, and Trump can no longer communicate or raise funds at scale, a small handful of unelected tech executives just ended a president’s political career. In theory, they can legally do this to anyone, which means they are effectively the most powerful people alive. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-should-we-address-the-growing-power-shift-from-washington-to-silicon-valley/2018/11/19/1470eb9a-e9e4-11e8-bbdb-72fdbf9d4fed_story.html">Silicon Valley is our nation’s shadow capital, argues Katherine Boyle,</a> and welcome to the shadow state. It is not a democracy. </p><p>The immediate arguments both in favor and against Trump’s censorship were equally ridiculous. From the camp against, we were told the technology industry’s actions were comparable to Chinese-style censorship. This is not even close to true. The Chinese Communist Party executes political dissidents, and while our nation is not immune to such governance, and many Americans do perversely seem to want CCP-style censorship, such dystopia has not yet descended on our country. As Dan Primack correctly notes: &nbsp;</p><p>From the camp in favor of vanishing Trump — people who have warned us of some ambiguous corporate overreach for decades, which I suppose in hindsight only ever meant “money people bad” —&nbsp;we were told this is simply what a free market looks like. Free speech cannot be constitutionally guaranteed where private corporations are concerned, as it infringes on the owner of a company’s rights to free association and speech (again, an interesting point of concern from the “business is always wrong” corner of the commentariat). If you don’t want to be vanished, we’re told, build your own sprawling, multibillion-dollar, duopolistic communications platform. But legally speaking, this is in the first place not straightforward. </p><p>In <em>Pruneyard Shopping Center Vs. Robins</em>, <a href="https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/583/pruneyard-shopping-center-v-robins#:~:text=Robins%20(1980)&amp;text=In%20PruneYard%20Shopping%20Center%20v,afoul%20of%20the%20Fifth%20Amendment">the Supreme Court ruled California could protect political protesters from being evicted from private property.</a> This case built on a body of law that flourished throughout the 60s and 70s, and included such cases as <em>Marsh v. Alabama</em> (1946), <em>Lloyd Corporation Ltd. v. Tanner</em> (1972), and <em>Amalgamated Food Employees Union Local 590 v. Logan Valley Plaza</em> (1968). We haven’t even touched the <em>Sherman Antitrust Act</em>, or the much-discussed <em>Section 230</em>, and this is already complicated. In any case, the notion one should simply build a competitor platform if he isn’t happy with his Twitter ban has never really been serious, as everyone who works in tech is well aware it isn’t possible to build such a platform absent ideological submission to the shadow state. This was plainly evidenced by Parler’s fate last week. </p><p>If a natural right can’t meaningfully be exercised, can it really be said to exist? David Sacks has been absolute fire on this question all week:</p><p>The American Bill of Rights was written at the time of the printing press, a machine that anyone could buy, the street corner, on which anyone could sell a paper, a system of public roads and walks for distribution, and thousands of small businesses that comprised the “market,” any one of which, absolutely, could refuse to sell a paper, but no one or two (or five in obvious collusion) were capable of censoring a single voice out of public existence. Today, the internet is the gateway through which almost our entire democracy is conducted. It is where we go to learn about the world, almost without exception. It is our contemporary printing press, our street corner, our public roads and walks, and our market, all combined and dominated by a small handful of giants from the same class, of roughly the same politics, and from mostly the same region. </p><p>Should this tiny, unelected group of people so-empowered be allowed to vanish any voice from public, for any reason? Is this truly in keeping with the spirit of the Constitution? Separate from the legal questions: is this the kind of country you want to live in? </p><p>We are in danger, here —&nbsp;clearly, come on,<em> you know that this is true</em> —&nbsp;of something very dark. </p><p><strong>Ok but insurrection though.</strong> I recently spoke with a tech executive who supported Trump’s ban from public existence. He asked what theoretical action I would think worthy of such incredible censorship from the industry. A coup? Insurrection? What about incitement of violence? Herein lies tech’s only reasonable defense of itself, and the most popular argument in favor of Trump’s purge from the internet: he was hurting people. Isn’t that enough to act? The problem is the evidence here is ambiguous, and the argument lends itself to valid accusations of hypocrisy, as all of these things have been perpetrated by other political leaders, both at home and abroad, and often in a manner not ambiguous at all. The position is also somewhat naively oblivious of a political leader’s role, which is —&nbsp;I hate to break it to you, folks —&nbsp;violence. This is not to say violence is okay. This is not to excuse any of Trump’s deeply unhelpful ambiguity. This is only to say the logical consequence of the technology industry’s extraordinary actions last week must necessarily be massive, global censorship. Let’s set aside for a moment the question of whether or not censorship of this kind would be healthy. Is it really what our shadow state is planning? Because if dramatically accelerated speech crackdowns aren’t on the menu, tech’s actions sum only to narrow, draconian, partisan censorship. </p><p>It should go without saying I’m against activist political violence, and think everyone who participated in last week’s riot at the capitol should be tried and, when convicted, jailed. But I’ve said it anyway, repeatedly, both specifically in the context of the capitol riot and consistently, in every other context we’ve seen such behavior, throughout most of our batshit crazy 2020. I have felt compelled to speak about this issue as often as I have because what took place in Washington last week was not an outlier event. </p><p>The capitol riot was the latest in a string of unacceptably violent outbursts for which media personalities, activists, and politicians have spent the last year apologizing, and in many cases, by the standards to which we are now holding Trump —&nbsp;“dog whistles,” contributions to a “culture of hate” or “violence” —&nbsp;actively encouraging. Some cases have been less ambiguous. “Non-violence is an important tool for protests,” wrote Slate magazine this summer amidst a kind of chaos we have not seen on American streets for over half a century, <a href="https://twitter.com/Slate/status/1268415955937513473?s=20">“but so is violence.”</a> People were killed at the capitol, and property, both public and private, was destroyed. A federal building was invaded. All of these things are insane, and wrong, and intolerable. They are also illegal. Again: <em>these people should be tried, and when convicted sent to prison</em>. But have we so soon forgotten <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/goodbye-summer-of-love-11607898398">our summer of love in the CHAZ</a>? Or do we simply believe the MAGA Viking more likely to succeed in “insurrection” than the unhinged Stalinist baristas in Seattle explicitly calling for revolution? </p><p>I’ve been told repeatedly this week, while raising questions about a scale of censorship we have literally never before seen, that at least one of the capitol rioters was planning an assassination. This is chilling. If proven true, it will unfortunately also not be unique. Have we already memory-holed the Republican Congressional baseball shooting, where Congressman Steve Scalise and three of his colleagues were nearly killed by an unhinged Bernie Sanders stan? And how do we think this would-be assassin was radicalized? Carrier pigeon? No, the internet appears to be catalyzing significant political radicalization. The problem is deep, and broad. It is also by the way something <a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/tether-part-i">I write about not infrequently.</a> I’m glad the industry is finally concerned with the phenomenon, but is Jack Dorsey really prepared to own the issue? Because I’m sorry, but the problem isn’t Trump’s Twitter account, no matter how easy that would make this —&nbsp;in a sense, the problem appears to be Twitter. I’m pretty sure it’s driving us insane. </p><p>Gather round, friends. Have I told you yet about the time (this Christmas Eve) when a wildly-popular Marxist podcaster expressed a desire to see me dead in direct response to a piece I wrote about his fiancé’s boss, my San Francisco district supervisor? What about the time, immediately after, when his followers asked for my address, presumably to kill me? Do yourself a favor and keyword search the word “guillotine,” or the hammer and sickle emoji (which, while we’re on the topic, why the fuck does that exist?). Here’s …</p></div></div>

            Basic information about how the SDKs code function. They start with a call to the Android/Java API that deals with audio recording and playback. From there with a buffer array full of some audio data, it can then be sent to a native code library that is also installed as part of the SDK. These libraries handle the more CPU intensive work such as sifting through the data using various common methods (Goertzel et al) to find audio signals of interest. 
            </p><p>
            This first section shows some of the Android/Java function calls and parameters used.

<p>When it comes to programming, frameworks are there to make your life easy. React, Vue, Larvel, Bootstrap, I can go on and on to list your favourite frameworks.</p>
<p>When it comes to web development, I love to use frameworks because, </p>
<ul><li>It helps me to follow best practises.</li><li>Once I got used to a framework development becomes super easy and increases my productivity.</li></ul>
<p>But, recently two things happened to me that question me about frameworks and how they can change or alter the way you think in programming.</p>
<p>The first occasion happened when I attempted a challenge to create a javascript todo app that fits inside a single tweet, AKA, I had to make a bare minimal todo app under 280 characters.</p>
<p>I tried so hard to complete the challenge in plain javascript, only to give up, and ended up using a framework because I thought it is not possible to do it in plain javascript. I even went on to write a post and even comment on HackerNews that it is not possible to do it in plain javascript, only to be proven wrong by many talented developers on HackerNews.</p>
<p>You can read more about that here</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>The second occasion happened to me when I was trying to make a simple HTML login page.</p>
<p>I’m used to using a CSS framework like Bootstrap or <a href="https://bulma.io/">Bulma</a>, and later modifying the CSS to fit my requirements, and even add more rules as I go along the way.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to the login page, I didn’t want to use a framework, because I don’t need all the unnecessary CSS rules, all I wanted to have two input boxes, some text and a button. So I decided to make a custom CSS file instead.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t simple as I initially thought, I have gotten used to using a css framework to a point I was too bored to write some basic CSS rules for the simple login page. </p>
<p>I wanted the instant snappy feeling. Add some classes box, and you are done, boom, you have a decent design in five minutes. But with heaps of unwanted, unused CSS rules polluting the page.</p>
<p>But that was not the case, I had to write some basic css in order to get things working, and it felt boring, and painful drag.</p>
<p>I call this the framework trap, you have gotten used to depending on a single framework so much, that you tend to forget the basics, or want to bypass the basics, or it has altered your thinking pattern like in the first instance, where I felt like there was no other way to solve the challenge other than using a framework.</p>
<p>I may have fallen to the trap of Vue, Bootstrap or Bulma, but think to yourself, replace my frameworks with React, Angular or some other framework, have you ever got caught in the framework trap?</p>
<p><strong>No by this post, I don’t mean that you should not use any framework, and I will continue to use frameworks, and kudos to all the FOSS developers who make these awesome frameworks. </strong></p>
<p>But don’t get caught in a framework trap, and know that there can be multiple solutions for a single problem.</p>

<h2>
Descriptions
</h2>
<h3 id="SECURITY-1889">
XSS vulnerability in notification bar
</h3>
<p><strong>
SECURITY-1889
/
CVE-2021-21603
</strong></p><p>Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier does not escape notification bar response contents (typically shown after form submissions via Apply button).</p>
<p>This results in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to influence notification bar contents.</p>
<p>Jenkins 2.275, LTS 2.263.2 escapes the content shown in notification bars.</p>
<h3 id="SECURITY-2035">
Stored XSS vulnerability in button labels
</h3>
<p><strong>
SECURITY-2035
/
CVE-2021-21608
</strong></p><p>Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier does not escape button labels in the Jenkins UI.</p>
<p>This results in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by attackers with the ability to control button labels.
An example of buttons with a user-controlled label are the buttons of the Pipeline <code>input</code> step.</p>
<p>Jenkins 2.275, LTS 2.263.2 escapes button labels in the Jenkins UI.</p>
<h3 id="SECURITY-2153">
Reflected XSS vulnerability in markup formatter preview
</h3>
<p><strong>
SECURITY-2153
/
CVE-2021-21610
</strong></p><p>Jenkins allows administrators to choose the markup formatter to use for descriptions of jobs, builds, views, etc. displayed in Jenkins.
When editing such a description, users can choose to have Jenkins render a formatted preview of the description they entered.</p>
<p>Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier does not implement any restrictions for the URL rendering the formatted preview of markup passed as a query parameter.
This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability if the configured markup formatter does not prohibit unsafe elements (JavaScript) in markup, like <a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/anything-goes-formatter/">Anything Goes Formatter Plugin</a>.</p>
<p>Jenkins 2.275, LTS 2.263.2 requires that preview URLs are accessed using POST and sets Content-Security-Policy headers that prevent execution of unsafe elements when the URL is accessed directly.</p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Note</p>
</td>
<td>
In case of problems with this change, these protections can be disabled by setting the <a href="https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/system-properties/">Java system properties</a> <code>hudson.markup.MarkupFormatter.previewsAllowGET</code> to <code>true</code> and/or <code>hudson.markup.MarkupFormatter.previewsSetCSP</code> to <code>false</code>.
Doing either is discouraged.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<h3 id="SECURITY-2171">
Stored XSS vulnerability on new item page
</h3>
<p><strong>
SECURITY-2171
/
CVE-2021-21611
</strong></p><p>Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier does not escape display names and IDs of item types shown on the New Item page.</p>
<p>This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to specify display names or IDs of item types.</p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Note</p>
</td>
<td>
As of the publication of this advisory, the Jenkins security team is not aware of any plugins published via the Jenkins project update center that allow doing this.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Jenkins 2.275, LTS 2.263.2 escapes display names and IDs of item types shown on the New Item page.</p>
<h3 id="SECURITY-1923">
Improper handling of REST API XML deserialization errors
</h3>
<p><strong>
SECURITY-1923
/
CVE-2021-21604
</strong></p><p>Jenkins provides XML REST APIs to configure views, jobs, and other items.
When deserialization fails because of invalid data, Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier stores invalid object references created through these endpoints in the Old Data Monitor.
If an administrator discards the old data, some erroneous data submitted to these endpoints may be persisted.</p>
<p>This allows attackers with View/Create, Job/Create, Agent/Create, or their respective */Configure permissions to inject crafted content into Old Data Monitor that results in the instantiation of potentially unsafe objects when discarded by an administrator.</p>
<p>Jenkins 2.275, LTS 2.263.2 does not record submissions from users in Old Data Monitor anymore.</p>
<p>In case of problems, the <a href="https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/system-properties/">Java system properties</a> <code>hudson.util.RobustReflectionConverter.recordFailuresForAdmins</code> and <code>hudson.util.RobustReflectionConverter.recordFailuresForAllAuthentications</code> can be set to <code>true</code> to record configuration data submissions from administrators or all users, partially or completely disabling this fix.</p>
<h3 id="SECURITY-1452">
Arbitrary file read vulnerability in workspace browsers
</h3>
<p><strong>
SECURITY-1452
/
CVE-2021-21602
</strong></p><p>The file browser for workspaces, archived artifacts, and <code>$JENKINS_HOME/userContent/</code> follows symbolic links to locations outside the directory being browsed in Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier.</p>
<p>This allows attackers with Job/Workspace permission and the ability to control workspace contents (e.g., with Job/Configure permission or the ability to change SCM contents) to create symbolic links that allow them to access files outside workspaces using the workspace browser.</p>

<p>Jenkins 2.275, LTS 2.263.2 no longer supports symlinks in workspace browsers.
While they may still exist on the file system, they are no longer shown on the UI, accessible via URLs, or included in directory content downloads.</p>
<p>This fix only changes the behavior of the Jenkins UI.
Archiving artifacts still behaves as before.</p>
<h3 id="SECURITY-2021">
Path traversal vulnerability in agent names
</h3>
<p><strong>
SECURITY-2021
/
CVE-2021-21605
</strong></p><p>Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier allows users with Agent/Configure permission to choose agent names that cause Jenkins to override unrelated <code>config.xml</code> files.
If the global <code>config.xml</code> file is replaced, Jenkins will start up with unsafe legacy defaults after a restart.</p>
<p>Jenkins 2.275, LTS 2.263.2 ensures that agent names are considered valid names for items to prevent this problem.</p>
<p>In case of problems, this change can be reverted by setting the <a href="https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/system-properties/">Java system property</a> <code>jenkins.model.Nodes.enforceNameRestrictions</code> to <code>false</code>.</p>
<h3 id="SECURITY-2023">
Arbitrary file existence check in file fingerprints
</h3>
<p><strong>
SECURITY-2023
/
CVE-2021-21606
</strong></p><p>Jenkins provides a feature for jobs to store and track fingerprints of files used during a build.
Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier provides a REST API to check where a given fingerprint was used by which builds.
This endpoint does not fully validate that the provided fingerprint ID is properly formatted before checking for the XML metadata for that fingerprint on the controller file system.</p>
<p>This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to check for the existence of XML files on the controller file system where the relative path can be constructed as 32 characters.</p>
<p>Jenkins 2.275, LTS 2.263.2 validates that a fingerprint ID is properly formatted before checking for its existence.</p>
<h3 id="SECURITY-2025">
Excessive memory allocation in graph URLs leads to denial of service
</h3>
<p><strong>
SECURITY-2025
/
CVE-2021-21607
</strong></p><p>Jenkins renders several different graphs for features like agent and label usage statistics, memory usage, or various plugin-provided statistics.</p>
<p>Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier does not limit the graph size provided as query parameters.</p>
<p>This allows attackers to request or to have legitimate Jenkins users request crafted URLs that rapidly use all available memory in Jenkins, potentially leading to out of memory errors.</p>
<p>Jenkins 2.275, LTS 2.263.2 limits the maximum size of graphs to an area of 10 million pixels.
If a larger size is requested, the default size for the graph will be rendered instead.</p>
<p>This threshold can be configured by setting the <a href="https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/system-properties/">Java system property</a> <code>hudson.util.Graph.maxArea</code> to a different number on startup.</p>
<h3 id="SECURITY-2047">
Missing permission check for paths with specific prefix
</h3>
<p><strong>
SECURITY-2047
/
CVE-2021-21609
</strong></p><p>Jenkins includes a static list of URLs that are always accessible even without Overall/Read permission, such as the login form.
These URLs are excluded from an otherwise universal permission check.</p>
<p>Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier does not correctly compare requested URLs with that list.</p>
<p>This allows attackers without Overall/Read permission to access plugin-provided URLs with any of the following prefixes if no other permissions are required:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>accessDenied</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>error</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>instance-identity</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>login</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>logout</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>oops</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>securityRealm</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>signup</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>tcpSlaveAgentListener</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>For example, a plugin contributing the path <code>loginFoo/</code> would have URLs in that space accessible without the default Overall/Read permission check.</p>
<p>The Jenkins security team is not aware of any affected plugins as of the publication of this advisory.</p>
<p>The comparison of requested URLs with the list of always accessible URLs has been fixed to only allow access to the specific listed URLs in Jenkins 2.275, LTS 2.263.2.</p>
<p>In case this change causes problems, additional paths can be made accessible without Overall/Read permissions:
The <a href="https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/system-properties/">Java system property</a> <code>jenkins.model.Jenkins.additionalReadablePaths</code> is a comma-separated list of additional path prefixes to allow access to.</p>
<h3 id="SECURITY-2057">
Credentials stored in plain text by TraceTronic ECU-TEST Plugin
</h3>
<p><strong>
SECURITY-2057
/
CVE-2021-21612
</strong></p><p>TraceTronic ECU-TEST Plugin 2.23.1 and earlier stores credentials unencrypted in its global configuration file <code>de.tracetronic.jenkins.plugins.ecutest.report.atx.installation.ATXInstallation.xml</code> on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.</p>
<p>These credentials can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.</p>
<p>TraceTronic ECU-TEST Plugin 2.24 adds a new option type for sensitive options.
Previously stored credentials are migrated to that option type on Jenkins startup.</p>
<h3 id="SECURITY-2098">
XSS vulnerability in TICS Plugin
</h3>
<p><strong>
SECURITY-2098
/
CVE-2021-21613
</strong></p><p>TICS Plugin 2020.3.0.6 and earlier does not escape TICS service responses.</p>
<p>This results in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control TICS service response content.</p>
<p>TICS Plugin 2020.3.0.7 escapes TICS service responses, or strips HTML out, as appropriate.</p>
<h3 id="SECURITY-2156">
Credentials stored in plain text by Bumblebee HP ALM Plugin
</h3>
<p><strong>
SECURITY-2156
/
CVE-2021-21614
</strong></p><p>Bumblebee HP ALM Plugin 4.1.5 and earlier stores credentials unencrypted in its global configuration file <code>com.agiletestware.bumblebee.BumblebeeGlobalConfig.xml</code> on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.</p>
<p>These credentials can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.</p>
<p>Bumblebee HP ALM Plugin 4.1.6 stores credentials encrypted once its …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<article>
      <p>Snowpack v3.0 is here! This is our biggest release yet with brand new features including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-bundled streaming imports</strong> - Import any npm package, on-demand.</li>
<li><strong>Integrated build optimizations</strong> - Built-in bundling, preloading, minification, and more.</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript API</strong> - Integrate with Snowpack’s brand new native JS API.</li>
<li><strong>Node.js Runtime API</strong> - Import your Snowpack-built files directly into Node.js.</li>
<li><strong>Bug fixes, stability improvements, and a whole lot more!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Install the newest version of Snowpack to get started:</p>
<pre><code>$ npm install snowpack@^3.0.0
</code></pre>
<p>Or, try out one of our updated <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-snowpack-app">Create Snowpack App</a> starter templates:</p>
<pre><code>$ npx create-snowpack-app new-project-directory --template  @snowpack/app-template-react
</code></pre>
<h2 id="reimagining-web-development-for-esm">Reimagining Web Development for ESM</h2>
<p>1 year ago, Snowpack first released with the mission to reimagine web development for modern JavaScript and ESM. Snowpack leverages modern web features to deliver a frontend build tool that needs just 50ms to start up &amp; react to new file changes, regardless of project size. In comparison, traditional web bundlers could take several seconds or even full minutes to start up in large projects.</p>
<p>Snowpack v3.0 marks another huge leap on our mission to push web development forward with the release of <strong>streaming imports</strong>. Streaming imports make it possible to import any package directly into your project, pre-built and pre-bundled for immediate use. It’s the power of the entire JavaScript ecosystem, at your fingertips.</p>
<video preload="auto" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="">
 <source src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/streaming-imports-demo.webm" type="video/webm">
 <source src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/streaming-imports-demo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<h2 id="what-are-streaming-imports%3F">What are Streaming Imports?</h2>
<p>The typical web developer installs and manages their JavaScript dependencies locally using a package manager CLI like <code>npm</code>, <code>yarn</code> or <code>pnpm</code>. These npm packages can’t run directly in the browser, so additional work is needed to resolve, process, build and bundle these packages for the browser before you can actually use them.</p>
<p><strong>What if we could simplify this? What if you could skip the “npm install” step entirely and just fetch the relevant, pre-built package code on-demand via ESM import?</strong></p>
<pre><code><br><span>import</span> <span>*</span> <span>as</span> React <span>from</span> <span>'react'</span><span>;</span><p><br><span>import</span> <span>*</span> <span>as</span> React <span>from</span> <span>'https://cdn.skypack.dev/react@17.0.1'</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre>
<p>That URL in the example above points to <a href="https://www.skypack.dev/">Skypack</a>, a popular JavaScript CDN that we built to serve every package&nbsp;on npm as ESM. Importing dependencies by URL like this is well supported in Snowpack, Deno, and all major browsers. But writing these URLs directly into your source code isn’t ideal and makes development impossible without a network connection.</p>
<p><strong>Snowpack v3.0 brings together the best of both worlds:</strong> Get the simplicity of <code>import 'react'</code> in your own source code and let Snowpack fetch these dependencies behind the scenes, pre-built and ready to run in the browser. Snowpack caches everything for you automatically, so you can continue to work offline after the first package fetch.</p>
<p>This new workflow has several benefits over the traditional “npm install” approach:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speed:</strong> Skip the install + build steps for dependencies, and load your dependencies on-demand as pre-build, pre-bundled ESM code.</li>
<li><strong>Safety:</strong> ESM packages are pre-built into JavaScript for you and never given access to <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec19-zimmermann.pdf">run code on your machine</a>. Third-party code only ever runs sandboxed in the browser.</li>
<li><strong>Less Tooling:</strong> ESM packages are managed by Snowpack, so frontend projects that don’t need Node.js (Rails, PHP, etc.) can drop the npm CLI entirely if they choose.</li>
<li><strong>Identical Final Build:</strong> When you build your site for production, package code is transpiled with the rest of your site and tree-shaken to your exact set of imports.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is our bet on the future of web development. But if this all sounds too wild for you or you have some technical reason to keep managing your dependencies with npm, don’t worry. This is <strong>100% opt-in</strong> behavior for those who want it. By default, Snowpack will continue to pull your npm package dependencies out of your project <code>node_modules</code> directory like it always has.</p>
<p>Check out our guide on <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/guides/streaming-imports">Streaming Package Imports</a> to learn more about how to enable this new behavior in your project today.</p>

<h2 id="built-in-optimizations%2C-powered-by-esbuild">Built-in Optimizations, Powered by esbuild</h2>
<p><a href="https://esbuild.github.io/">esbuild</a> is a marvel: it performs 100x faster than most other popular bundlers their own benchmarks. esbuild is written in Go, a compiled language that can parallelize heavy bundling workloads where other popular bundlers – written in JavaScript – cannot.</p>
<p>Snowpack already uses esbuild internally as our default single-file builder for JavaScript, TypeScript and JSX files. Snowpack v3.0 takes this integration one step further, with a new built-in build optimization pipeline. Bundle, minify, and transpile your site for production in 1/100th of the time of other bundlers.</p>
<p>Snowpack is able to adopt esbuild today thanks to an early bet that we made on the future of bundling: <strong>bundling is just a post-build optimization.</strong> Thanks to this early design decision, esbuild can be plugged in and swapped out of your Snowpack build as easily as any other bundler.</p>
<p>esbuild is still a young project, but its future looks promising. In the meantime, we will also continue to invest in the existing bundler plugins for a long time to come, so that more mature projects can continue to use mature bundlers like Webpack &amp; Rollup.</p>

<h2 id="a-new-javascript-api">A New JavaScript API</h2>
<p>Snowpack’s new JavaScript API grants you more advanced control over Snowpack’s dev server and build pipeline, helping you build more powerful integrations on top of Snowpack to unlock new kinds of dev tooling and server-side rendering (SSR) solutions.</p>
<p><a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/whats-the-deal-with-sveltekit">SvelteKit</a> is the new official web app framework from the Svelte team, built with Snowpack. SvelteKit uses our new JavaScript API to manage the build pipeline and build files on-demand. Snowpack helps SvelteKit speed up development, with zero rapid updates on file change and zero upfront server start-up cost.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/microsite">Microsite</a> is another exciting new project built with Snowpack. Microsite is a Static Site Generator (SSG) for Preact that features automatic partial hydration, so that you send as little JavaScript down to the client as possible.</p>
<p>Check out our new <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/reference/javascript-interface">JavaScript API reference</a> to start building your own custom integrations on top of Snowpack.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/post-snowpackv3-runtime.png" alt="js api"></p>
<h2 id="a-new-node.js-runtime">A New Node.js Runtime</h2>
<p>Speaking of Svelte, this next feature comes directly out of our collaboration with the Svelte team. As a part of building out SvelteKit, Rich Harris created a server-side runtime for Snowpack. This runtime lets you import any Snowpack-built file directly into Node.js, handling things like ESM-&gt;CJS conversion and CSS extraction automatically.</p>
<p>The result is a unified build pipeline across both Node.js and the frontend, with all of the on-demand build performance benefits of Snowpack. Importing frontend code to run in Node.js unlocks features like true server-side rendering (SSR), test runner integrations for Jest/uvu/Mocha, and more.</p>
<p>Check out our new <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/guides/server-side-render">SSR guide</a> to get started and learn more about all of the different ways that you can connect to your Snowpack build.</p>

        <p>The untyped lambda calculus has a very simple grammar with just three term formers: <span>\(\def\sp{\mspace{5mu}}\)</span></p>
<p><span>\[ \mathrm{term}
 \mathrel{\vcenter{\hbox{::}}{=}} v \sp
  | \sp \lambda \sp v \sp . \sp \mathrm{term} \sp
  | \sp \mathrm{term} \sp \mathrm{term} \sp
  \]</span></p>
<p>Or in Haskell:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>data</span> <span>Lam</span> a <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2">  <span>Var</span><span> ::</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Lam</span> a</span>
<span id="cb1-3">  <span>Lam</span><span> ::</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Lam</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Lam</span> a</span>
<span id="cb1-4">  <span>App</span><span> ::</span> <span>Lam</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Lam</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Lam</span> a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In order that this work as a theory of computation, we need some notion of evaluation and this is driven by <span>\(\beta\)</span>-reduction. The standard jargon in lambda caluclus is to say that a <span>\(\beta\)</span>-redex is any subterm of the form <span>\((\lambda \mathrm{x} \sp . \sp \mathrm{f}) \sp \mathrm{arg}\)</span>. On such a <span>\(\beta\)</span>-redex we can then step via (capture-avoiding) substitution:</p>
<p><span>\[ (\lambda \mathrm{x} \sp . \sp \mathrm{f}) \sp \mathrm{arg}
    \rightsquigarrow
   f\sp[x  \mathrel{\vcenter{\hbox{:}}{=}} \mathrm{arg}]
  \]</span></p>
<p>Formally we then extend this to a congruence relation on Lambda terms via rules of the form:</p>
<p><span>\[
  M \rightsquigarrow M' \Rightarrow M N \rightsquigarrow M' N
\]</span> <span>\[
  N \rightsquigarrow N' \Rightarrow M N \rightsquigarrow M  N'
  \]</span></p>
<p>Precisely how we choose to set up these rules to give a computational semantics to our language corresponds algorithmically to a choice of evaluation strategy. As such, this opens up myriad interesting questions related to order of evaluation and normal forms and so on. Instead we will largely bypass these considerations and concentrate on the more humdrum (but no less vital) matter of the practicalities of performing such capture-avoiding substitutions. The basic problem with too naive an approach is as follows:</p>
<p><span>\[ (\lambda \sp \mathrm{x} \sp . \sp \lambda \sp y \sp . \sp  x) \sp \mathrm{y}
    \rightsquigarrow
   (\lambda \mathrm{y} \sp . \sp y)
  \]</span></p>
<p>Here we have substituted the <em>free</em> variable y into our lambda term and it has become <em>bound</em>. This is semantically incorrect: the names of free variables are meaningful because, in spirit, they refer to names we have defined elsewhere (that is, they can be looked up within a context, or, in other words, they are <em>open</em> for further substitution). Conversely, the names of bound variables are, computationally speaking, unimportant. In fact, it is usual to refer to the grammar we have introduced earlier as <em>pre-lambda terms</em> and to take lambda terms as referring to the equivalence classes under <span>\(\alpha\)</span>-equivalence. This refers to the (equivalence) relation whereby two terms are equivalent if we can consistently rename the bound variables of one to obtain the other (here too we need to take care, <span>\(\alpha\)</span>-renaming <span>\(\mathrm{x}\)</span> to <span>\(\mathrm{y}\)</span> in the above term would lead to a different sort of variable capture). Most accounts of <span>\(\alpha\)</span>-equivalence are themselves intimiately tied up with the question of how to perform substitution (and locally nameless is no different in this respect).</p>
<p>In practice this means that in order to compute <span>\((\lambda \mathrm{x} \sp . \sp \mathrm{f}) \sp \mathrm{arg}\)</span> we would first <span>\(\alpha\)</span>-rename <span>\(\mathrm{x}\)</span> to a variable that is neither already named within <span>\(\mathrm{f}\)</span>, nor appears free within <span>\(\mathrm{arg}\)</span>. Carrying out such a procedure by brute force is workable, but tends to be rather error-prone. A straightforward approach along these lines is described in <a href="http://augustss.blogspot.com/2007/10/simpler-easier-in-recent-paper-simply.html">this excellent post</a> by Lennart Augustsson.</p>
<p>There are a <a href="https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/user/edwardk/bound">whole host</a> of more sophisticated methods for dealing with the problem of capture-avoiding substitution. Perhaps one of the best known is to use De-Bruijn indices. The idea here is to replace all bound variables by a natural number. This indicates the variable’s distance from its binding site. All free variables are then represented by distinct natural numbers greater than the maximum depth of any binding site in the term. We then keep track of these variables within the environment under which computation is performed. For instance, the following is how one might translate a typical term into De-Bruijn indices:</p>
<p><span>\[ (\lambda \sp \mathrm{x} \sp . \sp \lambda \sp y \sp . \sp  x \sp z)
    \longrightarrow
   (\lambda \sp \lambda \sp . \sp 1 \sp 3 )
   \]</span> <span>\[
   [z \mapsto 3]
  \]</span></p>
<p>Here we keep both the translated lambda term but also the context for how to read free variables.</p>
<p>This approach offers two key advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capture avoiding substitution becomes a matter of keeping binding distance arithmetic in check.</li>
<li>The De-Bruijn representation gives canonical representatives for <span>\(\alpha\)</span>-equivalence classes, thus allowing us to test for <span>\(\alpha\)</span>-equivalence via syntactic equality of terms.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, Bob Atkey has, rather aptly, referred to the ability to read terms written with DeBruijn indices as a “cylon detector”. What we gain in ease of implementation we give up in much worse readability.</p>
<p>Instead we turn to the hybrid approach in the paper <a href="http://www.cs.ru.nl/~james/RESEARCH/haskell2004.pdf">I Am Not a Number – I am a Free Variable</a>. Let us keep free variables free and use De-Bruijn indices only for bound variables:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>-- Our variable type keeps the old free variables and uses</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><span>--integers to represent bound variables.</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><span>data</span> <span>Var</span> a</span>
<span id="cb2-4">  <span>=</span> <span>F</span> a</span>
<span id="cb2-5">  <span>|</span> <span>B</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb2-6"></span>
<span id="cb2-7"><span>-- Locally nameless terms will be the same lambda terms with</span></span>
<span id="cb2-8"><span>-- variables now labelled either bound or free.</span></span>
<span id="cb2-9"><span>type</span> <span>LocallyNameless</span> a <span>=</span> <span>Lam</span> (<span>Var</span> a)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Notice how, because we use the same lambda terms with this representation, we still have names at binders. This is useful as we can recover the named term we started out with, carrying along all such names as we perform work. Here is how we convert between the two representations:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>{-# LANGUAGE LambdaCase          #-}</span></span>

<p>Now let’s see that this works as expected (this is, for me, a worrying amount of bookeeping to leave to “Looks good!”). Let us use quickcheck to see that <strong>fromLocallyNameless</strong> is a left inverse to <strong>toLocallyNameless</strong>:</p>

<p>Thankfully, this does indeed work as expected:</p>
<pre><code>Tests
  Property Tests
    fromLocallyNameless ∘ toLocallyNameless == id: OK (0.35s)
      +++ OK, passed 1000 tests.</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have terms in locally nameless representation, we can perform substitution in a fairly straightforward manner. In the McBride–McKinna (MM) paper, they refer to this operation as <strong>“instantiate”</strong>. It is also common in the locally nameless literature to call the operation <strong>“opening”</strong> or <strong>“open”</strong> because it involves opening the body of a term to substitute for its outermost bound variable. As this accords with our intuitions on the meaning of substitution of locally nameless terms, we will follow this convention.</p>
<p>Note that in the code below, we follow (at least in spirit) the MM approach of using a scope type to denote a term that is only legal as the body of an expression (i.e.&nbsp;a term which may have bound variables referring to a non-existant outer binder such as <span>\(\lambda \sp . \sp 1\)</span>). In our case, we only use a type synonym; however, in a more substantial implementation, one should use a newtype to get the type safety that such a measure confers.</p>

<p>It’s a new year and there’s a new <a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/releases/tag/v0.13.0">Gleam release</a>! Let’s take a look
at what this one brings.</p>

<h2 id="gotta-go-fast">Gotta go fast</h2>

<p>The compiler was no slouch but with this new version it’s faster than ever
thanks to improvements to the Gleam and Erlang code generators, as well as a
full rewrite of the parser by <a href="https://gitlab.com/greggreg">Greg</a>.</p>

<p>With these changes compiling Gleam code is 1.8 times faster, and formatting
Gleam code is a super nimble 4.6 times faster! On my machine Gleam compiling
the standard library now takes ~170ms, and formatting all the files takes ~70ms.</p>

<p>This is only the start. Gleam compilation is currently single threaded and
doesn’t make use of any caching, so there’s lots of opportunities to make big
performance improvements in future.</p>

<h2 id="even-better-errors">Even better errors</h2>

<p>Greg’s parser rewrite wasn’t just about performance, it also greatly improved
the error messages caused by syntax errors. Here are some examples to click through:</p>

<h2 id="type-safe-division">Type safe division</h2>

<p>Division is a tricky problem thanks to the number zero. In mathematics the
result of dividing any non-zero number by zero is undefined, making it is a
question with no answer.</p>

<p>Sadly as programmers we can’t leave it undefined, have to do something. At
some point some code will be written that divides by zero, so what should the
language do when that happens? There are largely three options:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Throw an exception</li>
  <li>Return <code>Infinity</code></li>
  <li>Return zero</li>
</ol>

<p>Throwing an exception is the approach taken by Erlang and other BEAM
languages, and historically this is the approach taken by Gleam. However,
there is a problem.</p>

<p>Gleam aims to be an exception free language, and the <code>assert</code> keyword is
intended as being the only way to crash a process. Errors should be
represented by the type system, so it is not in keeping with the design and
goals of the language for division to sometimes crash when dividing numbers.</p>

<p>Languages such as JavaScript that follow IEEE 754 return an <code>Infinity</code> value
when dividing by zero, which may be positive or negative. This is a familiar
solution to many programmers, and it fits well with Gleam’s “never implicitly
crash” goal.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there is no <code>Infinity</code> value on the Erlang virtual so Gleam
would have to implement this. While possible this would cause problems with
Erlang and Elixir interop- we could no longer safely pass Gleam numbers to
Erlang functions as they may be this special <code>Infinity</code> value, which would
likely cause a crash. The same problem would occur when calling Gleam code
from Erlang or Elixir, resulting in adding Gleam libraries to your Erlang or
Elixir application being less appealling.</p>

<p>The last option is to follow in the footsteps of languages such as Pony,
Isabelle, Lean and Coq and return zero. This might seem strange at first, but
it is type safe, allows us to maintain good interop with other BEAM
languages, and is representable on any other platform we might target in
future.</p>

<p>In Gleam dividing by zero returns zero!</p>



<h2 id="improved-documentation">Improved documentation</h2>

<p>Gleam has the ability to render <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/">HTML
documentation</a> for your code, ready to
upload to Hexdocs.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/michaeljones">Michael Jones</a> documentation for
functions and types can automatically insert links to GitHub, GitLab, or
BitBucket so you can quickly see how they are implemented.</p>

<p><img src="https://gleam.run/img/gleam-0-13-docs-link.jpg" alt="A screenshot of Gleam's rendered docs showing a link to source code"></p>

<p>Let us know if you use another source code hosts and would like support added too.</p>

<p>Following up from that <a href="https://github.com/michallepicki">Michał Łępicki</a>
added a version selector so that you can quickly find the documentation for
the version of the library you are using. This dropdown is integrated with
Hexdocs so it will display all versions of the library, rather than just
earlier ones.</p>

<p><img src="https://gleam.run/img/gleam-0-13-docs-version.jpg" alt="A screenshot of Gleam's rendered docs showing a version selector"></p>

<h2 id="other-stuff">Other stuff</h2>

<p>These are just some of the highlights, but there’s plenty more improvements
made to the compiler and the standard library since the last release. For all
the details check out the changelog files:</p>

<![CDATA[Beginner Friendly Virtual Gaming Machine with PCI Passthrough on Ubuntu 20.04]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

				
<h2>Preamble</h2>



<p>The direct way to a PCI passthrough virtual machines on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. I try limit changes of the host operating system to a minimum, but provide enough details, that even Linux rookies are able to participate.</p>



<p>The final system will run Xubuntu 20.04 as host operating system(OS), and Windows 10 2004 as guest OS. Gaming is the main use-case of the guest system. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, the setup process can be pretty complex. It consists of fixed base settings, some variable settings and several optional (mostly performance) settings. In order to sustain readability of this post, and because I aim to use the virtual machine for gaming only, I minimized the variable parts for latency optimization. The variable topics itself are linked in articles – I hope this makes sense. 🙂</p>



<h3>About this guide</h3>



<p>This guide targets Ubuntu 20.04 and is based on my former guides for Ubuntu <a href="https://mathiashueber.com/windows-virtual-machine-gpu-passthrough-ubuntu/">18.04</a> and <a href="https://mathiashueber.com/amd-ryzen-based-passthrough-setup-between-xubuntu-16-04-and-windows-10/">16.04</a> host systems. </p>



<p>However, this guide should be also applicable to <strong>Pop!_OS</strong> 19.04 and newer. If you wish to proceed with <strong>Pop!_OS</strong> as host system you can do so, just look out for my colorful <strong><span><span>Pop!_OS</span></span></strong> labels.</p>



<h4>Breaking changes for older passthrough setups in Ubuntu 20.04</h4>



<h5>Kernel version </h5>



<p>Starting with kernel version 5.4, the “vfio-pci” driver is no longer a kernel module, but build-in into the kernel. We have to find a different way instead of using <code>initramfs-tools/modules</code> config files, as I recommended in e.g. <a href="https://mathiashueber.com/windows-virtual-machine-gpu-passthrough-ubuntu/">the 18.04 guide</a>.</p>



<h5>QEMU version</h5>



<p>Ubuntu 20.04 ships with QEMU version 4.2. It introduces audio fixes. This needs attention if you want to use a virtual machine definition from an older version.</p>



<p>If you want to use a newer version of QEMU, <a href="https://mathiashueber.com/manually-update-qemu-on-ubuntu-18-04/" target="_blank" aria-label="you can build it on your own (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can build it on your own</a>.</p>



<blockquote><p><span><strong>Attention!</strong></span> </p><p>QEMU version 5.0.0 – 5.0.0-6 should not be used for a passthrough setup due to stability issues.</p></blockquote>



<h5>Bootmanager </h5>



<p>This is no particular “<em>problem</em>” with Ubuntu 20.04, but at least for one popular distro which is based on Ubuntu – <a aria-label="Pop_OS! 20.04 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://pop.system76.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Pop!_OS 20.04</a>. </p>



<p>I think, starting with version 19.04, <strong><span><span>Pop!_OS</span></span></strong> uses systemd as boot manager, instead of grub. This means triggering kernel commands works differently in <strong><span><span>Pop!_OS</span></span></strong>.</p>



<h2>Introduction to VFIO, PCI passthrough and IOMMU</h2>



<p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vfio.txt" target="_blank">Virtual Function I/O</a> (or <strong>VFIO</strong>) allows a virtual machine (VM) direct access to a PCI hardware resource, such as a graphics processing unit (GPU). Virtual machines with set up GPU passthrough can gain close to bare metal performance, which makes running games in a Windows virtual machine possible.</p>



<p>Let me make the following simplifications, in order to fulfill my claim of beginner friendliness for this guide:</p>



<p>PCI devices are organized in so called <a aria-label="IOMMU groups (opens in a new tab)" href="https://vfio.blogspot.com/2014/08/iommu-groups-inside-and-out.html" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank">IOMMU groups</a>. In order to pass a device over to the virtual machine, we have to pass all the devices of the same IOMMU group as well. In a prefect world each device has its own IOMMU group — unfortunately that’s not the case. </p>



<p>Passed through devices are isolated, and thus no longer available to the host system. Furthermore, it is only possible to isolate all devices of one IOMMU group at the same time. </p>



<p>This means, even when not used in the VM, a device can no longer be used on the host, when it is an “<em>IOMMU group sibling</em>” of a passed through device. </p>



<h2>Requirements</h2>



<h3>Hardware</h3>



<p>In order to successfully follow this guide, it is mandatory that the used hardware supports virtualization and has properly separated IOMMU groups.</p>



<p><strong>The used hardware</strong></p>



<ul><li>AMD Ryzen7 1800x (<strong>CPU</strong>)</li><li>Asus Prime-x370 pro (<strong>Mainboard</strong>)</li><li>2x 16 GB DDR4-3200 running at 2400MHz (<strong>RAM</strong>) </li><li>Nvidia GeForce 1050 GTX (Host <strong>GPU</strong>; PCIE slot 1)</li><li>Nvidia GeForce 1060 GTX (Guest <strong>GPU</strong>; PCIE slot 2)</li><li>500 GB NVME <strong>SSD</strong> (Guest OS; M.2 slot)</li><li>500 GB <strong>SSD</strong> (Host OS; SATA) </li><li>750W <strong>PSU</strong></li></ul>



<p>When composing the systems’ hardware, I was eager to avoid the necessity of kernel patching. Thus, the ACS override patch is not required for said combination of mainboard and CPU. </p>



<p>If your mainboard has no proper IOMMU separation you can try to solve this by using a <a aria-label="patched kernel (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://queuecumber.gitlab.io/linux-acs-override/" target="_blank">patched kernel</a>, or <a aria-label="patch the kernel on your own (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PCI_passthrough_via_OVMF#Bypassing_the_IOMMU_groups_(ACS_override_patch)" target="_blank">patch the kernel on your own</a>. </p>



<h3>BIOS settings</h3>



<p>Enable the following flags in your BIOS:</p>



<ul><li><code>Advanced \ CPU config - SVM Module -&gt; enable</code></li><li><code>Advanced \ AMD CBS - IOMMU -&gt; enable</code></li></ul>



<blockquote><p><strong>Attention!</strong> </p><p>The ASUS Prime x370/x470/x570 pro BIOS versions for AMD RYZEN 3000-series support (v. 4602 – 5220), will break a PCI passthrough setup. </p><p>Error: “<strong>Unknown PCI header type ‘127’</strong>“.</p><p>BIOS version <strong>up to</strong> (and including) 4406, 2019/03/11 are working.</p><p>BIOS version <strong>from</strong> (and including) 5406, 2019/11/25 are working.</p></blockquote>



<p>I used Version: 4207 (8th Dec 2018)</p>



<h3>Host operating system settings</h3>



<p>I have installed Xubuntu 20.04 x64 (UEFI) from <a href="https://xubuntu.org/download" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>



<p>Ubuntu 20.04 LTS ships with kernel version 5.4 which works good for VFIO purposes – check via: <code>uname -r</code></p>



<blockquote><p><span><strong>Attention!</strong></span> </p><p>Any kernel, starting from version 4.15, works for a Ryzen passthrough setup. </p><p><strong>Except</strong> kernel versions <strong>5.1, 5.2 </strong>and<strong> 5.3</strong> including all of their subversion.</p></blockquote>



<p>Before continuing make sure that your kernel plays nice in a VFIO environment.</p>



<h4>Install the required software</h4>



<p>Install <a aria-label="QEMU (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.qemu.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">QEMU</a>, <a aria-label="Libvirt (opens in a new tab)" href="https://libvirt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Libvirt</a>, the <a href="https://virt-manager.org/" target="_blank" aria-label="virtualization manager (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">virtualization manager</a> and related software via:</p>



<p><code>sudo apt install qemu-kvm qemu-utils libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-clients bridge-utils virt-manager ovmf</code></p>



<h2>Setting up the PCI passthrough</h2>



<p>We are going to passthrough the following devices to the VM: </p>



<ul><li>1x GPU: Nvidia GeForce 1060 GTX </li><li>1x USB host controller</li><li>1x SSD: 500 GB NVME M.2</li></ul>



<h3>Enabling IOMMU feature</h3>



<p>Enable the IOMMU feature via your grub config. On a system with AMD Ryzen CPU run: </p>



<p><code>sudo nano /etc/default/grub</code> </p>



<p>Edit the line which starts with <code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT</code> to match: </p>



<p><code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="amd_iommu=on iommu=pt"</code> </p>



<p>In case you are using an Intel CPU the line should read:</p>



<p><code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="intel_iommu=on"</code></p>



<p>Once you’re done editing, save the changes and exit the editor (<code>CTRL+x CTRL+y</code>). </p>



<p>Afterwards run:</p>



<p><code>sudo update-grub</code> </p>



<p>→ Reboot the system when the command has finished.</p>



<p>Verify if IOMMU is enabled by running after a reboot:</p>



<p><code>dmesg |grep AMD-Vi</code></p>



<div>
<p>
dmesg output
</p>
<div>

<pre><code>[ 0.792691] AMD-Vi: IOMMU performance counters supported 
[ 0.794428] AMD-Vi: Found IOMMU at 0000:00:00.2 cap 0x40

[ 0.794688] AMD-Vi: Lazy IO/TLB flushing enabled
</code></pre>
<p>[collapse]</p>
</div>
</div>




<h4>For systemd boot manager as used in Pop!_OS </h4>



<p>One can use the kernelstub module, on systemd booting operating systems, in order to provide boot parameters. Use it like so: </p>



<p><code>sudo kernelstub -o "amd_iommu=on amd_iommu=pt"</code></p>



<h3>Identification of the guest GPU</h3>



<blockquote><p><span><strong>Attention!</strong></span> </p><p>After the upcoming steps, the guest GPU will be ignored by the host OS. You <strong>have to have</strong> a second GPU for the host OS now!</p></blockquote>



<p>In this chapter we want to identify and isolate the devices before we pass them over to the virtual machine. We are looking for a GPU and a USB controller in suitable IOMMU groups. This means, either both devices have their own group, or they share one group. </p>



<p>The game plan is to apply the vfio-pci driver to the to be passed-through GPU, before the regular graphic card driver can take control of it.</p>



<p>This is the most crucial step in the process. In case your mainboard does not support proper IOMMU grouping, you can still try patching your kernel with <a aria-label="the ACS override patch (opens in a new tab)" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PCI_passthrough_via_OVMF#Bypassing_the_IOMMU_groups_(ACS_override_patch)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the ACS override patch</a>. </p>



<p>One can use a <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/471285/how-to-create-execute-a-script-file/471286#471286" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">bash script</a> like <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PCI_passthrough_via_OVMF#Ensuring_that_the_groups_are_valid" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">this</a> in order to determine devices and their grouping:</p>



<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
# change the 999 if needed
shopt -s nullglob
for d in /sys/kernel/iommu_groups/{0..999}/devices/*; do
    n=${d#*/iommu_groups/*}; n=${n%%/*}
    printf 'IOMMU Group %s ' "$n"
    lspci -nns "${d##*/}"
done;</code></pre>

      <h4 id="brad-joins-a-startup">Brad joins a startup</h4>
<p>When I first joined <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> almost a year
ago, one of the first things I asked
<a href="https://github.com/crawshaw">Crawshaw</a> was, “So, what database do you
use? MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite maybe?”, knowing that he loved SQLite.</p>
<p>“A text file," he replied.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, we write out one big JSON object to a text file.”</p>
<p>“How? When? <em>What?</em>”</p>
<p>“Yeah, whenever something changes, we grab a lock in our single
process and rewrite out the file!” he chuckled with glee.</p>
<p>It sounded insane. It <em>was</em> insane. Sure, it was easily testable, but
it didn’t scale. We both knew that. But it worked.</p>
<p>Until it didn’t.</p>
<p>Even with fast NVMe drives and splitting the database into two halves
(important data vs. ephemeral data that we could lose on a tmpfs),
things got slower and slower. We knew the day would come. The file
reached a peak size of 150MB and we were writing it as quickly as the
disk I/O would let us. Ain’t that just peachy?</p>
<p>So, migrate to MySQL or PostgreSQL, right? Maybe SQLite?</p>
<p>Nope, Crawshaw had other ideas.</p>
<h4 id="a-bit-of-backstory-from-david">A bit of backstory from David</h4>
<p>Tailscale’s coordination server, our “control plane”, has become known
as <a href="https://getsmart.fandom.com/wiki/CONTROL">CONTROL</a>. It’s currently
a single Go process on a single VM. The very earliest prototypes for
CONTROL used SQLite. Our original designs were very different from
what we ended up with, involving configuration databases synchronized
onto client machines and all sorts of other concepts we ended up not
needing. Through this process we would do major reorganizations of our
SQL data model every week, which required an astonishing amount of
typing. SQL is widely used, durable, effective, and requires an
annoying amount of glue to bring into just about any programming
language. (Attempts to avoid this with ORMs usually replace an
annoying amount of typing with an annoying amount of magic and loss of
efficiency.)</p>
<p>One day, fed up with the refactorings, I threw it all out and built an
in-memory data model for experimentation. That made iterating
much faster. A couple of weeks later, a customer wanted to try it
out. I wasn’t ready to commit to the data model yet and do it properly
in SQL, so I took a shortcut: the object holding all the data was
wrapped in a <code>sync.Mutex</code>, all accesses went through it, and on edit the
whole structure was passed to <code>json.Marshal</code> and written to disk. This
gave us data model persistence in ~20 lines of Go.</p>
<p>The plan was always to migrate to something else but, uh, we got busy
with other stuff and kinda forgot.</p>
<h4 id="what-comes-after-jsonmutexdb">What comes after JSONMutexDB?</h4>
<p>The obvious next step to take was to move to SQL. My favorite is still
SQLite, but I couldn’t bring myself to make an argument for migrating
a rapidly growing service to it. It certainly could work, especially
as the design of our control plane doesn’t require the high
availability of typical web services: the result of a short outage is
that new nodes can’t log in; working networks continue to work.</p>
<p>MySQL (or PostgreSQL) would come next. I’m not particularly familiar
with anything MySQL post 1998, but I’m sure it would work. The HA
story for open source databases is somewhat surprising, though: you
can either have traditional lagging replicas, or commit to
no-primary-replica clusters that have very surprising transaction
semantics. I wasn’t excited about trying to design a stable API or
good network graph calculations on top of those semantics.
<a href="https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach#what-is-cockroachdb">CockroachDB</a>
looked very promising, and indeed still does! But it’s relatively new
for a database and I was a little concerned about getting attached to
features in a fresh DBMS that would be hard to migrate away from if we
needed to.</p>
<p>Making our control server depend on MySQL or PostgreSQL also means our
control server’s testing story gets slow &amp; ugly. Brad had fought that
battle with <a href="https://perkeep.org/">Perkeep</a> and previously written
<a href="https://godoc.org/perkeep.org/pkg/test/dockertest">perkeep.org/pkg/test/dockertest</a>
which works but isn’t something we wanted to subject future employees
to. It requires Docker on your machine and it’s not particularly fast.</p>
<p>Then one day we saw a <a href="https://jepsen.io/analyses/etcd-3.4.3">Jepsen report on
etcd</a>. Unlike the usual
less-than-satisfying Jepsen reports to which we’d become accustomed,
this one said <em>good things</em> about <a href="https://etcd.io/">etcd</a>.
Combined with some positive experiences <a href="https://github.com/danderson">Dave Anderson</a>
had with it, we started thinking about whether we could just use etcd directly.
Being written in Go, we could just link it into our tests and use it
directly. No Docker, no mocks, testing what we’d actually use in
production.</p>
<p>It turned out that the core data model we were writing to disk closely
followed the pattern:</p>
<pre><code>type AllTheData struct {
	BigLock    sync.Mutex
	Somethings map[string]Something
	Widgets    map[string]Widget
	Gadgets    map[string]Gadget
}
</code></pre><p>This maps surprisingly well onto a KV-store. So this led us to etcd as
a “minimally-viable database”. It does the critical things we needed
now, which was 1) breaking the BigLock into something more akin to a
<code>sync.RWMutex</code>, and 2) reducing our I/O to only write the changed data,
not the whole world on any write.</p>
<p>(We are careful not to use any etcd features that would be hard to map onto CockroachDB.)</p>
<p>The downside of this is that etcd, while popular in Kubernetes, has
relatively few users for a database system. As a company, Tailscale is
spending an <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">innovation
token</a> on it. But the
database is conceptually small enough that we don’t have to treat it
as a black box. When we ran into a surprisingly slow key pagination
edge case in etcd 3.4, I was able to read my way through its sources
and write a fix for it in an hour. (I then discovered an <a href="https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/commit/26c930f27d46776da5fedae69267ba0b69c31185">equivalent
fix</a>
had already been applied to the next version of etcd, so we backported
that instead.)</p>
<h4 id="tailetc-our-etcd-client-wrapper">tailetc: our etcd client wrapper</h4>
<p>The client we use for etcd is open source at
<a href="https://github.com/tailscale/tailetc">github.com/tailscale/tailetc</a>. It
is built around two concepts: 1) the total data in the DB is small
enough to fit into the server’s memory and 2) reads are far more
common than writes. Given that, we want to make reads cheap.</p>
<p>The way we do that is by registering a watch against etcd. Every
change is sent to the client, which maintains an enormous cache
<code>map[string]interface{}</code> behind a <code>sync.RWMutex</code>. When you create a Tx
and do a Get, the value is read out of this cache (which may be behind
etcd, but is kept transactionally consistent by tracking the modrev: a
global incrementing ID that etcd uses to define revisions of key-value
pairs.). To avoid aliasing bugs with the cache, we copy the object
out, but avoid JSON decoding on each Get by implementing a more
efficient Clone call on objects in the cache.</p>
<p>The result is that fetching a value from etcd does not require any
network traffic.</p>
<p>This is one of those few times writing Go that I felt the limitations
of its type system as I was designing a package. If I were working in
a language with all the bells and whistles, there would be some kind
of const qualifier I could place on objects leaving the cache and
avoid cloning the memory. That said, running profiles on our server
show the copying is not a performance issue, so perhaps this is an
example of where I feel the pull towards a more complex type system
without actually having a real need for them. As is so often the case,
assumptions are dangerous, profiling is enlightening.</p>
<h4 id="one-snag-indexes">One snag: indexes</h4>
<p>The biggest problem with choosing a minimal viable “nosql” is the lack
of the wonderful index system every standard SQL DBMS supplies. We are
stuck with either storing indexes inside etcd, or managing them in
memory in our client.</p>
<p>With JSONMutexDB we generated them in memory, because it’s much easier
to make data model changes. The easy option with etcd would have been
writing them to the database, but that would have really complicated
data models. Unfortunately, if we want to move to running more than
one CONTROL process simultaneously for high-availability and better
release management, that means we no longer have exactly one process
managing the data, so our indexes need to be transaction (and
rollback) aware. So we invested what probably amounts to two or three
weeks of engineering time into designing in-memory indexes that are
transactionally consistent. This gets a bit tricky to describe, so
we’ll save that for a future blog post (and hopefully we can clean up
the code enough to open source it some day).</p>
<h4 id="the-migration">The migration</h4>
<p>The migration wasn’t very notable, which is always a good thing. We
ran both systems in parallel for a while and at some point stopped
using the old one. The most exciting thing was that our commit latency
dropped a bunch when we turned off the JSON writes. This was most
noticeable when editing networks in the admin panel. We’d include
pretty Grafana graphs here but the cut-over predates us changing our
Prometheus config to keep more history. In any case, writes went from
nearly a second (sometimes worse!) to milliseconds. When we’d started,
writes weren’t a second of course. Never underestimate how long your
“temporary” hack will stay in production!</p>
<h4 id="future">Future</h4>
<p>The most exciting thing about this work, besides ensuring the
Tailscale control plane can scale out for the foreseeable future, is
improving our release process. A consistent database we can easily
attach multiple control plane instances to means we can move to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-green_deployment">blue-green deployment</a>.
This will let Tailscale engineers experiment with deploying features
with the confidence that the worst-case outcome of a change is
limited. The goal is to keep development speed as close to the early
days of JSONMutexDB, when you could recompile and run locally in a
fraction of a second and deploy ten times a day.</p>

<h2>Ten years without Elixir</h2>
<p>José Valim committed the first bit of Elixir code January
9th, 2011, which marks a ten-year anniversary for the kid
brother of Erlang. It’s incredible how time flies on 
certain paradigms, while crawls on others.</p>

<p>I never got into Elixir, largely because it looked like
Ruby. I was a Rubyist for a good while, spent time
and effort to learn where to park my commas, semicolons,
and periods in Erlang, so I never felt that Elixir was
something I wanted.</p>

<p>Nor have I since. There was a good web framework that
came along, and since I’m of that age, you’d thing that
Phoenix would have pulled me in: it never did. I kept
hacking Erlang and just used lighter web <abbr>API</abbr>s like
Cowboy &amp; Elli, instead of going all in on a full
fledged web framework.</p>

<p>From my Erlang-colored glasses, Elixir seems to have
a lot of wins. Their packaging efforts looks like a
mature tool (Hex), and nobody seems to be complaining
about the documentation, an issue Erlang always had (though
to be honest, I never quite grasped what aspect of the
Erlang documentation to be problematic).</p>

<p>On the other hand, some of the syntax Elixir offers
is retrograde, in my humble opinion. Erlang seems to
have prettier syntax now that I have spent so much
time with it. A moot point, perhaps, considering how
subjective beauty is.</p>

<p>My strongest anti-Elixir sentiment (from armchair
reach) is their use of pipes. I know mixologists love
the Elixir pipe operator, but for someone who has
learned to necessarily un-nest code as severely as I have, I
feel as though this operator could be a detriment, or
at least come with some prickily moral hazards. More on that
can be read 
<a href="http://blog.cretaria.com/posts/erlang-beauty.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Elixir is a cool project, and managed to out-pace Erlang
in a lot of areas it struggled (community,

Hours later, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension.html">Twitter banned Donald Trump</a>. Soon after, <a href="https://www.axios.com/platforms-social-media-ban-restrict-trump-d9e44f3c-8366-4ba9-a8a1-7f3114f920f1.html">a broader group of major internet companies</a> did the same. Then, <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/amazon-parler-aws">Amazon brought the Ban Hammer down on Parler</a>, the hate reactor built by hapless fall guy John Matze and heiress Rebekah Mercer.</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_storming_of_the_United_States_Capitol#:~:text=The%20storming%20of%20the%20United,in%20the%202020%20presidential%20election.">excellent justifications for why this was necessary</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/generativist/status/1348310439331995650">why this emergent coordination occurred</a> and why was necessary. I don’t want to talk about them. What matters more for me right now? <a href="https://twitter.com/generativist/status/1348374694320250881">I don’t think it will ever work again</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/generativist/status/1348374695452708864">A trans-national economy of people building censorship-resistant technology seems to have a new occasion for war</a>. The fire next time won’t be containable in similar ways.</p>

<p>This leads me to a simple conclusion: <strong>if you care about making social mediums work better in the future, your solutions must assume censorship resistance as a given</strong>. Otherwise, <a href="https://twitter.com/generativist/status/1348374705766498304">your building on an already-pruned branch</a>.</p>
<h2 id="engineering-our-augmented-space">Engineering Our Augmented Space</h2><p>Centralized social media – as it exists today – is Procrustean. On Twitter, <a href="https://generativist.falsifiable.com/metaverse/the-real-supernode-problem">super-nodes excessively synchronize attention in mal-adaptive ways</a>. <a href="https://generativist.falsifiable.com/metaverse/dunbars-number-is-quadratic">The weight of identity-to-context skews far enough towards the former that we’re prone to chronically ignoring or failing to consider the latter</a>. <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/01/16/the-internet-of-beefs/">Social beefs end proliferate in wild abundance</a>. <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2016/09/15/crowds-and-technology/">Crowds grow, swarm, and disassociate from reality</a>. All of this is all great for farming freely-offered attention. But, a good cybernetic ecosystem it does not make.</p>

<p>Given it’s defacto-albeit-not-really role as the world’s hyperspace <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sphere">public sphere</a>, a great deal of (recent) attention seems to be on making a censorship-resistant Twitter. <a href="https://twitter.com/pfrazee/status/1348415859707023362">This is a mistake</a> borne of the DWeb/Blockchain communities’ ideological defaults.</p>

<p><strong>Censorship resistance <em>may be</em> necessary for solving some of these problems. But, it’s desperately far from sufficient.</strong> Missing is the attention dedicated to creating a social environment that fits us, not one that demands we fit it. It requires considering that – while there are a variety of technological architectures for creating a distributed and decentralized social medium – not all of them are sociological solutions.</p>
<p>I am interested in finding a solution at the intersection of both problems.</p>

<p>What follows is a small projection of my view from 10,000 feet.</p>
<h3 id="1-ephemeral-by-default">1. Ephemeral By Default</h3><p>Blockchains ensure immutability. Robust consensus mechanisms afford canonical state. Both can be useful. But the latter is computationally costly. More than that, there is an expense borne by <em>the forms of expression it selects for</em>.</p>

<p>In the context of ephemeral mediums, it’s excessively restrictive. <strong>Not every statement requires non-repudiation; in social contexts, very few do.</strong><label for="sn-0"></label><span>I’m bending what non-repudiation means a bit here. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten">Right to be forgetten</a> is almost closer. Except, you can’t forget on a global immutable ledger…by definition. Ephemeral by default albeit with cryptographic signing for message authentication means what you socially reveal is <em>more</em> in your control, and fosters better norms.</span> If every utterance persists forever, people either self-censor or <em>excessively</em> fracture their identity into disposable fragments, as a defense.<label for="sn-1"></label><span><a href="https://twitter.com/balajis">@balaijis</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=Dur918GqDIw">gives a talk worth listening to about pseudonymous economy</a> that proposes the use of cryptographic attestations to imbue alts with some of main’s properties, in a precise information theoretic way. He sees it as a way to manage social capital risks as any other capital asset. The talk is fascinating, but I think it’s solving the wrong problem.</span> Both behaviors frustrate social processes – including those of consensus formation.</p>

<p>The need to <em>optionally</em> commit a statement to a ledger in contexts where non-repudiation is desirable exists, as does the need.<label for="sn-2"></label><span>For example, if you are following someone whose reputation is derived from making accurate predictions about the future, <a href="http://www.investorhome.com/scam.htm">you want their full history, not the selectively trimmed version</a>. Global and immutable state makes such scams more difficult. <em>But</em>, my contention is that, making it impossible is too socially costly. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08913819508443369">Expressive behavior exists</a> and instrumentality is a dead end.</span> But it is not a good default. The temporal context of most expressions is now. Carrying prior utterances – generally without context – forward, creates conditions for maladaptive hysteresis. The past binds longer than it need to, in ways that don’t reflect the present – and, in doing so, it limits the future.</p>
<h3 id="2-peer-to-peer-by-necessity">2. Peer-to-peer by Necessity</h3><p>On the technological side, federation offers a means of decentralization that fits in well with existing skills and practices. For example, if you can deploy a website, you can probably set up a <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">mastodon instance</a>. This matters for fostering adoption. Participation at an infrastructure/administration level doesn’t have a steep learning curve or cost of entry.</p>

<p>On the sociological side, it also seems to solve a critical problem: users have a stake in the communities they join.  Or, more accurately, users are part of communities – <a href="https://www.nationalaffairs.com/why-speech-platforms-can-never-escape-politics">it doesn’t make much sense to speak of communities absent individual stakes</a>.  This can help create incentives for the community to define and enforce its boundaries.</p>

<p>However, boundary enforcement and community cultivation seems inextricably tied up in communal ownership of identity. For example, on mastodon, your identity is subject to community/node intervention. Expulsion doesn’t render you a digital nomad; it erases the identity. For what will end up being the most passionate and proselytizing early adopters, this is too repulsive. And while you can propose networks that afford right of <em>intact</em> exit, these have the effect of neutering the enforcement mechanisms. What you have is less of a community and more of a federated network transport.</p>
<p><strong>More to the point, I think the model reflects an implement-what-we-know mentality</strong>. Early websites were nothing more than digital brochures. Federation models try to replicate…schools? Co-op boards? Cities? City states? Nation states? They tend to assume a one-to-one/belongs-to relationship often bound by geography. But the beauty of the internet is that meat space doesn’t bind. And, the brilliance of twitter showed us that association is so free, it’s almost a liquid.<label for="sn-3"></label><span>I saw this tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronzlewis/status/1349079811587780609">@aaronzlewis</a> yesterday and wanted to plug it some how. It vaguely fits, but in any case, Aaron is worth a follow for thinking about this stuff.</span></p>

<p>Recapitulating, Zuckerborg was almost preposterously wrong when he said,<label for="sn-4"></label><span>This is unfair. If you use a loss function which penalizes legibility for the purpose of algorithmic attention resale, he was <em>precisely</em> correct.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have one identity…The days of you having a different image for your work friends or co-workers and for the other people you know are probably coming to an end pretty quickly […] Having two identities for yourself is an example of a lack of integrity.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Identity is contextual. <a href="https://amzn.to/3bBieEq">We all wear different masks</a>. And, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Distinction-Routledge-Classics-Pierre-Bourdieu/dp/0415567882/ref=sr_1_1?crid=PB4KYKEX2EUU&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=pierre+bourdieu&amp;qid=1610480340&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=pierre+bor%2Cstripbooks%2C237&amp;sr=1-1">we act in ways conditional upon both our expectation, capital, and social environment</a>. This doesn’t betray a “lack of integrity.” It is a fundamental <em>and adaptive</em> part of being a human being.</p>
<p>With this rough sketch, I reach the following conclusions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Individuals must own their identities</strong>. No one except the person associated with a particular identity can revoke it. The most motivated adopters won’t allow otherwise. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>The medium itself must not mediate voluntary associations</strong>. That is, for any possible relationship pair, no entity can inhibit <em>direct</em> communication except for either of the participants. This follows from the same adopter assumption. But, it’s also a consequence of the ethereal nature of association absent geographic confinement. While this environment has perils, it is also the source of its continuing promise.</li>
</ul>

<p>This largely precludes federation. Peer-to-peer is the way forward.<label for="sn-5"></label><span>This doesn’t mean there is no role for service providers that act as proxies, caches, aggregators, etc. There surely is and will be. But, I don’t believe they should be part of the p2p core.</span></p>
<h3 id="3-computation-is-the-massage">3. Computation is the Massage</h3><p>I argued that federation won’t work because it relies upon the wrong analogies. But, if any user can reach any user, the possible interaction space is quadratic. We do need something to structure something so incomprehensible.</p>

<p>The social graph is the scaffolding of that structure. It collapses <span>\(n^2\)</span> to something we can cope with. It affords repeated interactions and social recall. It defines an architecture for message passing <em>where we act as the processors</em>.</p>

<p>However, we are social creatures and social media is omnipresent. Viewing ourselves as the processors, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law">Parkinson’s Law</a> becomes oddly relevant: work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.  Who we follow increases until we reach the point of desired infinity-scroll saturation. At this point (or well before it), processing demands on a one-to-one basis exceed our human capabilities. <a href="https://generativist.falsifiable.com/metaverse/dunbars-number-is-quadratic">We fall back upon higher-order generalizations. Fuckery ensues.</a></p>

<p>Here, social media critics generally prescribe something like “people-centric technology” as the antidote. Increasingly, I think it’s snake oil. More often then not, you can replace it with <em>RETVRN</em> without loss of meaning. Technology changes the way we relate to each other. With it, so do our aspirations, perceptions, mediators, and institutions. Some expand, and some contract. The way through isn’t to retreat to a now inaccessible past.<label for="sn-6"></label><span>Makes note to reread <em>Industrial Society and Its Future</em> as an exercise in Take Cartography.</span> The way out is to marshal our modern resources into new capabilities.</p>

<p>This is a beautiful, astrally-projected depiction of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's <em>flow</em> concept. For the unfamiliar, here's how Csikszentmihalyi describes flow, or <em>the optimal experience</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is what the sailor holding a tight course feels when the wind whips through her hair, when the boat lunges through the waves like a colt -- sails, hull, wind, and sea humming a harmony that vibrates in the sailor's veins. It is what a painter feels when the colors on the canvas begin to set up a magnetic tension with each other, and a new <em>thing</em>, a living form, takes shape in front of the astonished creator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sounds pretty good, right? Csikszentmihalyi contends that flow is how we humans can achieve happiness. And it's not something that's given; it's something we have to cultivate and grow and work towards. I cannot recommend his book enough.</p>
<p>Even better was SOUL's depiction of the non-flow state - the lost souls:</p>

<p>Definitely been there. Usually its whenever I hear, "Can you see my screen?" These poor creatures wander the astral plane, lost and unhappy and unsure why.</p>
<p>Luckily, the movie tells us it's never too late, and I believe them.</p>
<p>So, how do we achieve flow?</p>
<p>It's the deliberate combination of skill meeting challenge. More from Csikszentmihalyi:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best moments usually occur when a person's body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This post documents a legitimate flow experience I had last week that began with an observation about my podcast addiction.</p>
<h2>All My Best Friends are Podcasts</h2>
<p>Yes, that's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_63ZZRLylE">Less Than Jake</a> reference. You're welcome, 8th-Grade Charlie.</p>
<p>And, if you're at all like 28th-Grade Charlie, then you're also helplessly addicted to podcasts.</p>
<p>I listen all the time -- while I'm washing dishes, folding laundry, performing my daily Amazon cardboard box cutting ritual, even taking showers. Carly doesn't understand it, and I certainly can't explain it.</p>
<p>Am I that afraid of silence? My own thoughts? Am I so lonely for friendship that I even found this evisceration quietly comforting?</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Podcasts saying literally nothing for 20 minutes. <a href="https://t.co/nmfka1Gjsp">pic.twitter.com/nmfka1Gjsp</a></p>— Jonathan Ogden (@jogdenUK) <a href="https://twitter.com/jogdenUK/status/1346442437376552962?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2021</a></blockquote> 
<p>I know too much about ancient Rome to be able to answer these questions.</p>
<p>So, if I'm just going to accept my Overcast overlords, can I turn the tides on this one-directional relationship?</p>
<p>Yes. We can. Enter: the spark of an idea.</p>
<h2>Create a podcast from the audio of YouTube videos</h2>
<p>If I can't control what my favorite podcast hosts are talking about in any given episode, can I instead choose <em>exactly</em> what I want to listen to? What if there were a virtually unlimited source of content to consume? Surely, I could then be more deliberate in my listening habits.</p>
<p>YouTube is our answer. I've been collecting computer science talks and lectures in playlists that I always mean to "watch later" and never do. Fact is, I don't want to watch a YouTube video. I rarely ever sit down and "watch YouTube" (other than The 8-Bit Guy cleaning old VIC-20s). It's not part of my routine. I'm usually moving around too much.</p>
<p>YouTube also makes it really hard to consume something "on the go." You need to pay for their PiP or minimized mode, I think.</p>
<p>Then I found this <a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/03/02/Creating-a-Podcast-Feed-from-a-YouTube-Playlist/">post by Benjamin Congdon</a>: a simple way to create an audio podcast feed from a YouTube playlist using a <a href="https://amzn.to/3qksZiq">Raspberry Pi</a> home server. His tutorial leverages an open source project called <a href="https://github.com/mxpv/podsync/">PodSync</a>, which itself leverages <code>ffmpeg</code> and, everyone's favorite controversy, <code>youtube-dl</code>, behind the scenes to download audio from YouTube and generate a podcast RSS feed. This, this, is exactly what I was looking for!</p>
<p>Nothing to add here, other than bravo, Benjamin. I was able to follow his tutorial pretty much straight through.</p>
<p>Wait, I do have something to add. Benjamin suggests using <code>rsync</code> to upload your mp3s and xml RSS feed to s3 or the like. I did this initially, but I didn't like the idea of having to mark these files as <code>public</code> on s3 in case of some huge accidental traffic surge.</p>
<p>So I came up with another idea:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a public repo on GitHub and enable GitHub Pages (mine is <a href="https://github.com/rockswhat/listener">here</a>)</li>
<li>Init the repo in your <code>/data</code> directory on the Raspberry Pi (this is the directory with the generated <code>.xml</code> RSS feed and <code>mp3</code> audio files)</li>
<li>Change your Podsync config's hostname to your GitHub Pages site: </li>
</ul>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>hostname = "https://rockswhat.github.io/listener"`</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>Change your cron command to push to your repo (instead of <code>rsync</code> to s3):</li>
</ul>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>*/15 * * * * cd /home/pi/podsync/data &amp;&amp; git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m "update feed" &amp;&amp; git push origin main</code></pre></div>
<p>Voila! My own podcast feed of YouTube videos, publicly available on the Internet. You can add my feed to Overcast (or your favorite podcast player) with its XML URL:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>https://rockswhat.github.io/listener/listen_laterz.xml</code></pre></div>
<h3>C'mon, you really achieved flow from <em>that</em>?</h3>
<p>No, not really, but <em>almost</em>. Tutorials, good ones, at least, are guided paths toward some goal, with micro-feedback and mini-frustrations along the way. And these things are well-suited to flow. They can lead you to flow.</p>
<p>In my case, this tutorial got my gears turning. Which now gets us into to the <code>creative computing</code> side of this article.</p>
<p>I think it's important to remind ourselves to have fun with our computers. To use them to make art, make music, create weird stuff, just because we can. There's so much on our computers and phones now thanks to the Internet that can warp our minds and render us into Lost Souls. We often forget the simple joys of computers of the past, back when they were bicycles for the mind, and used adorable floppy disks or CD-ROM drives for games and encyclopedias. I know there's so much "more" that we can do with computers, but we need to remember that they are here to work for us, and not the other way around.</p>
<p>As soon as I saw Overcast fill up with audio from my <code>Listen Laterz</code> YouTube playlist, I knew I needed to keep going, to see what else I could render from clay into podcast feeds.</p>
<h2>Creating a podcast audiobook from Project Gutenberg e-books</h2>
<p>Where else can we find a giant repository of open content on the Internet that also happens to be inconvenient to consume?</p>
<p>Hello, <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a>! </p>
<p>Project Gutenberg is just about the coolest --- and one of the most important -- things on the internet. The fact that it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Gutenberg">started on the ARPANET in 1971</a> blows my mind. That is some creative, forward-thinking from its founder Michael S. Hart.</p>
<p>My idea here is simple: pick a public domain book, chop it up into chapters, convert the chapters to audio, and then generate an xml RSS feed.</p>
<p>I picked Mary Shelley's <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/84/84-h/84-h.htm">Frankenstein</a>, because, why not? I already read it a few years ago during my October "Spooky Reads" habit, but I figured it's the perfect candidate for re-animation.</p>
<p>If you've clicked the link to the text on Project Gutenberg, you'll see it's a plaintext nightmare. I'm not ashamed to admit here that I manually just chopped it up into separate text files, rather than writing a script to somehow do this for me. Whatever, ok?</p>
<p>First let's make some files.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>cd</span> pieces
<span>touch</span> intro.txt
<span>touch</span> letter-<span>{</span><span>1</span><span>..</span><span>4</span><span>}</span>.txt
<span>touch</span> chapter-<span>{</span><span>1</span><span>..</span><span>24</span><span>}</span>.txt
<span>touch</span> license.txt</code></pre></div>
<p>And then we copy-pasta.</p>
<p>Now that I've got my chapters (aka future podcast episodes) all set, we're ready to convert them to audio. What's the easiest way I can do that?</p>
<p>My "in-the-zone" brain suggests using the terminal's <code>say</code> command. I've used this command a few years ago in one of my earliest creative computing projects: a <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/terminal-man-live-in-nyc">live musical performance from a telepresence robot</a>).</p>
<p>Surely, I can write a neat little script to loop through my text files and <code>say</code> them into an <code>mp3</code>. Some Googling for <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16501663/macs-say-command-to-mp3">advice</a>, and I've soon got this Bash script going:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> *.txt<span>;</span>
<span>do</span>
    <span>echo</span> <span>"processing <span>$i</span>..."</span><span>;</span>
    <span>name</span><span>=</span><span><span>$(</span><span>echo</span> <span>"<span>$i</span>"</span> <span>|</span> <span>cut</span> -f <span>1</span> -d <span>'.'</span><span>)</span></span>
    say -v Vicki -f <span>$i</span> -o aiff/<span>$name</span>.aiff
    lame -m m aiff/<span>$name</span>.aiff mp3/<span>$name</span>.mp3
    <span>rm</span> aiff/<span>$name</span>.aiff
<span>done</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And it works! Checkpoint reached! The <code>mp3</code> files are now sitting happily in their respective <code>/mp3</code> folder. I experience a fleeting moment of joy, and then immediately plunge into the next challenge: generating an XML feed.</p>
<p>My hack-y brain suggests another copy-pasta. Let's take the feed generated by the Podsync library in the section above, replace pieces of it with Bash variables, and then loop through my text files to jam in the values I want.</p>
<p>More googling ensures, including learning a bit more about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document#:~:text=In%20computing%2C%20a%20here%20document,it%20were%20a%20separate%20file.">heredocs</a>, and I've eventually got this script:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

While the price of Bitcoin dropped sharply on Monday, it is still up more than 50 percent from just <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/30/technology/bitcoin-record-price.html" title="">a month ago</a>, when it passed its previous all-time high of around $20,000. </p><p>The problem is that Mr. Thomas years ago lost the paper where he wrote down the password for his IronKey, which gives users 10 guesses before it seizes up and encrypts its contents forever. He has since tried eight of his most commonly used password formulations â€” to no avail.</p></div></div><div><div><p>â€œI would just lay in bed and think about it,â€� Mr. Thomas said. â€œThen I would go to the computer with some new strategy, and it wouldnâ€™t work, and I would be desperate again.â€�</p><p>Bitcoin, which has been on an extraordinary and volatile eight-month run, has made a lot of its holders very rich in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/16/style/bitcoin.html" title="">a short time</a>, even as the coronavirus pandemic has ravaged the world economy.</p><p>But the cryptocurrencyâ€™s unusual nature has also meant that many people are locked out of their Bitcoin fortunes as a result of lost or forgotten keys. They have been forced to watch, helpless, as the price has risen and fallen sharply, unable to cash in on their digital wealth.</p><p>Of the existing 18.5 million Bitcoin, around 20 percent â€” currently worth around $140 billion â€” appear to be in lost or otherwise stranded wallets, according to the cryptocurrency data firm Chainalysis. Wallet Recovery Services, a business that helps find lost digital keys, said it had gotten 70 requests a day from people who wanted help recovering their riches, three times the number of a month ago.</p><p>Bitcoin owners who are locked out of their wallets speak of endless days and nights of frustration as they have tried to get access to their fortunes. Many have owned the coins since Bitcoinâ€™s early days a decade ago, when no one had confidence that the tokens would be worth anything.</p></div></div><div><div><p>â€œThrough the years I would say I have spent hundreds of hours trying to get back into these wallets,â€� said Brad Yasar, an entrepreneur in Los Angeles who has a few desktop computers that contain thousands of Bitcoin he created, or mined, during the early days of the technology. While those Bitcoin are now worth hundreds of millions of dollars, he lost his passwords many years ago and has put the hard drives containing them in vacuum-sealed bags, out of sight.</p><p>â€œI donâ€™t want to be reminded every day that what I have now is a fraction of what I could have that I lost,â€� he said.</p><p>The dilemma is a stark reminder of Bitcoinâ€™s unusual technological underpinnings, which set it apart from normal money and give it some of its most vaunted â€” and riskiest â€” qualities. With traditional bank accounts and online wallets, banks like Wells Fargo and other financial companies like PayPal can provide people the passwords to their accounts or reset lost passwords.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/08/business/00LOSTKEYS2/00LOSTKEYS2-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/08/business/00LOSTKEYS2/00LOSTKEYS2-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/08/business/00LOSTKEYS2/00LOSTKEYS2-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"><img alt="â€œI would just lay in bed and think about it,â€� Mr. Thomas said." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/08/business/00LOSTKEYS2/00LOSTKEYS2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/08/business/00LOSTKEYS2/00LOSTKEYS2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/08/business/00LOSTKEYS2/00LOSTKEYS2-jumbo.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/08/business/00LOSTKEYS2/00LOSTKEYS2-superJumbo.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" decoding="async"></picture></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Nicholas Albrecht for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>But Bitcoin has no company to provide or store passwords. The virtual currencyâ€™s creator, a shadowy figure known as Satoshi Nakamoto, has said Bitcoinâ€™s central idea was to allow anyone in the world to open a digital bank account and hold the money in a way that no government could prevent or regulate.</p></div><div><p>This is made possible by the structure of Bitcoin, which is governed by a network of computers that agreed to follow software containing all the rules for the cryptocurrency. The software includes a complex algorithm that makes it possible to create an address, and associated private key, which is known only by the person who created the wallet.</p></div><div><div><p>The software also allows the Bitcoin network to confirm the accuracy of the password to allow transactions, without seeing or knowing the password itself. In short, the system makes it possible for anyone to create a Bitcoin wallet without having to register with a financial institution or go through any sort of identity check.</p><p>That has made Bitcoin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/technology/bitcoin-black-market.html" title="">popular with criminals</a>, who can use the money without revealing their identity. It has also attracted people in countries like China and Venezuela, where authoritarian governments are known for raiding or shutting down traditional bank accounts.</p><p>But the structure of this system did not account for just how bad people can be at remembering and securing their passwords.</p><p>â€œEven sophisticated investors have been completely incapable of doing any kind of management of private keys,â€� said<span>  </span>Diogo Monica, a co-founder of a start-up called Anchorage, which helps companies handle cryptocurrency security. Mr. Monica started the company in 2017 after helping a hedge fund regain access to one of its Bitcoin wallets.</p><p>Mr. Thomas, the programmer, said he was drawn to Bitcoin partly because it was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/23/opinion/sunday/venezuela-bitcoin-inflation-cryptocurrencies.html" title="">outside the control of a country</a> or company. In 2011, when he was living in Switzerland, he was given the 7,002 Bitcoin by an early Bitcoin fanatic as a reward for making an animated video, â€œ<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um63OQz3bjo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">What is Bitcoin?</a>,â€� which introduced many people to the technology.</p><p>That year, he lost the digital keys to the wallet holding the Bitcoin. Since then, as Bitcoinâ€™s value has soared and fallen and he could not get his hands on the money, Mr. Thomas has soured on the idea that people should be their own bank and hold their own money.</p><p>â€œThis whole idea of being your own bank â€” let me put it this way: Do you make your own shoes?â€� he said. â€œThe reason we have banks is that we donâ€™t want to deal with all those things that banks do.â€�</p></div></div><div><div><p>Other Bitcoin believers have also realized the difficulties of being their own bank. Some have outsourced the work of holding Bitcoin to start-ups and exchanges that secure the private keys to peopleâ€™s stashes of the virtual currency.</p><p>Yet some of these services have had just as much trouble securing their keys. Many of the largest Bitcoin exchanges over the years â€” including the onetime well-known exchange <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/business/dealbook/mt-gox-creditors-seek-trillions-where-there-are-only-millions.html" title="">Mt. Gox</a> â€” have lost private keys or had them stolen.</p><p>Gabriel Abed, 34, an entrepreneur from Barbados, lost around 800 Bitcoin â€” now worth around $25 million â€” when a colleague reformatted a laptop that contained the private keys to a Bitcoin wallet in 2011.</p><p>Mr. Abed said this did not dim his enthusiasm. Before Bitcoin, he said, he and his fellow islanders had not had access to affordable digital financial products like the credit cards and bank accounts that are easily available to Americans. In Barbados, even getting a PayPal account was almost impossible, he said. The open nature of Bitcoin, he said, gave him full access to the digital financial world for the first time.</p><p>â€œThe risk of being my own bank comes with the reward of being able to freely access my money and be a citizen of the world â€” that is worth it,â€� Mr. Abed said.</p><p>For Mr. Abed and Mr. Thomas, any losses from mishandling the private keys have partly been assuaged by the enormous gains they have made on the Bitcoin they managed to hold on to. The 800 Bitcoin Mr. Abed lost in 2011 were a small fraction of the tokens he has since bought and sold, allowing him to recently buy a 100-acre plot of oceanfront land in Barbados for over $25 million.</p><p>Mr. Thomas said he also managed to hold on to enough Bitcoin â€” and remember the passwords â€” to give him more riches than he knows what to do with. In 2012, he joined a cryptocurrency start-up, Ripple, that aimed to improve on Bitcoin. He was rewarded with Rippleâ€™s own native currency, known as XRP, which rose in value.</p></div></div><div><div><p>(Ripple has recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/21/technology/ripple-cryptocurrency-sec-lawsuit.html" title="">run into legal troubles</a>, in part because the founders had too much control over the creation and distribution of the XRP coins.)</p><p>As for his lost password and inaccessible Bitcoin, Mr. Thomas has put the IronKey in a secure facility â€” he wonâ€™t say where â€” in case cryptographers come up with new ways of cracking complex passwords. Keeping it far away helps him try not to think about it, he said.</p><p>â€œI got to a point where I said to myself, â€˜Let it be in the past, just for your own mental health,â€™â€� he said. </p></div></div></section></article></div>]]>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <div><p>Rumor has it that Redshift was named for its desire to <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2018/amazon-web-services-reportedly-named-cloud-database-redshift-order-tweak-oracle">shift people away from data warehousing offered by Oracle</a> (whose brand <a href="https://tbri.com/special-reports/oracle-openworld-2019/">used to be “red”</a> ). In that line of thinking, you can think of Snowflake as Redshiftshift.</p><p>Snowflake is a modern data-warehousing solution that’s built with the needs of today’s data teams in mind. Amazon Redshift is a huge legacy data warehousing product that, while powerful, doesn’t address these needs. Put simply, right now, Snowflake is better on almost all fronts and for most businesses than Amazon Redshift. Here’s why.</p></div><h2 id="snowflake-makes-your-life-easier">Snowflake Makes Your Life Easier</h2><div><p>Snowflake has invested in quality-of-life features — like how easy it is to share data and the user experience — from the ground-up, while Redshift is still trying to catch up. Even if all other aspects, such as pricing or concurrency, were equal (and they aren’t), this alone should tip the scale for most.</p><p>One big way Snowflake makes your life easer as a data person is that it make <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/workloads/data-sharing/">sharing data super simple</a>. It’s about as simple to share data with Snowflake as it is to share a Google Doc. </p></div><figure><img src="https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/2021/01/Snowflake-Data-Share.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Snowflake-Data-Share.png 600w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Snowflake-Data-Share.png 1000w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/Snowflake-Data-Share.png 1600w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/2021/01/Snowflake-Data-Share.png 2080w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><div><p>On a technical level, this simplicity is made possible by Snowflake’s unique ability to copy databases within your own data structure and then grant instant read access to those databases (<a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-sharing-intro.html">dive deeper into the documentation here if you want</a>). Copying a database in a safe, secure way with Snowflake takes only one click, and it’s all self-contained. When you’re done, you just click “deprovisionize” and you’re good. </p><p>The alternative is the more traditional way of sharing data that Redshift represents. Redshift (and other traditional data warehouses) require that you go through the messy, insecure, and stressful process of managing multiple duplicate ETL (extract, transform, load) data pipelines. And with Redshift, you need to work with production data (😬) if you want to copy databases within your data structure. It’s flat-out riskier and more stressful.</p><p>We could go on and on here about specific features, but at its core, Snowflake takes care of the crap for you so you can actually do your job. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bigdata/comments/ax0ixt/redshift_vs_snowflake/">One user on the r/bigdata subreddit described it like this</a> when they first switched to Snowflake, “I was skeptical but [Snowflake] actually does seem to make performance management easier and allows me more time to actually work with the data.”</p><p>As you can guess, these quality-of-life improvements have made Snowflake their fair share of fan boys/girls, us included (can’t you tell?). If you work in data, Snowflake just makes your life better.</p></div><h2 id="snowflake-is-cheaper-but-not-for-the-reason-you-might-think">Snowflake Is Cheaper, but Not for the Reason You Might Think</h2><div><p>Of course, the price of data warehouses depends on a ton of factors, but overall (<a href="https://fivetran.com/blog/warehouse-benchmark">according to our friends at Fivetran</a>) Redshift and Snowflake will cost about the same. The true cost-savings come from the tighter infrastructure Snowflake can help you build. </p><p>The big difference in cost between Snowflake and Redshift is the fact that Snowflake was built to decouple computing and storage costs. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-redshift-update-next-generation-compute-instances-and-managed-analytics-optimized-storage/">Redshift has tried to go this route</a>, but, again, it’s a game of catch-up. What this means is that storing data with Snowflake is cheap, and you pay only when you need to compute (i.e., use) that data.</p><p>Getting into the details, Snowflake uses credits whose costs fluctuate depending on the region you’re in — for instance, in the western United States, credits range from $2-$3. You can use these credits for computing purposes and other features. This credit system combined with relatively cheap storage costs — $40 per TB per month in the western U.S. — can help ensure that you pay for only what you use.</p><p>One slight downside is that with Snowflake you need to keep an eye on “credit munching.” Andrew Ferrier in the <a href="https://community.getdbt.com/">dbt Slack community</a> described working with Snowflake like this</p></div><blockquote>“On the flip side, we do munch through the credits, but most of this is due to optimizations that we can do on our side. One key tip here before deploying would be to think about setting up different types of processes on different warehouses, so that you can scale the warehouse according to need.”</blockquote><div><p>Redshift’s RA3<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-redshift-update-next-generation-compute-instances-and-managed-analytics-optimized-storage/"> allows you to decouple</a> compute and storage costs as well, but <a href="https://poplindata.com/data-warehouses/2020-database-showdown-bigquery-vs-redshift-vs-snowflake/">most Redshift users have dc2</a>, which doesn’t decouple. No matter what, if you want more space in Redshift, you need to buy more nodes, and it charges “per-hour per-node,” <a href="https://blog.panoply.io/redshift-vs-snowflake-the-full-comparison">according to Panoply</a>, which breaks down the formula like this:</p><p>Redshift Monthly Price = [ Price Per Hour ] x [ Node Cluster Size ] x [ Hours per Month ]</p><p>We’re getting into the weeds here, and others cover it more cohesively,<a href="https://www.clearpeaks.com/a-journey-from-redshift-to-snowflake-data-warehouse/"> particularly Clearpeaks</a>. Our main point here is that, despite these nuances and formulas, the real difference in costs comes from the data infrastructure Snowflake can help you build. </p><p><a href="https://resources.fivetran.com/mdsconference/deploying-a-data-team">In their webinar with Fivetran</a>, Drizly explains the evolution of their data team and data stack, which included a migration from Redshift to Snowflake. Their process was to spin up Snowflake parallel to Redshift and then slowly perform the Redshiftshift. When fully implemented, they were able to start cutting the fat in their data stack, relying solely on tools that do one thing really well. Their core stack ended up being:</p></div><ul><li><a href="https://fivetran.com/">Fivetran </a>for data ingestion that they don’t have to customize or babysit</li><li><a href="https://www.snowflake.com/">Snowflake</a> for semi-structured data storage and easy data sharing</li><li><a href="https://www.getdbt.com/">dbt </a>for transformations and a consistent modeling logic</li><li><a href="https://looker.com/">Looker </a>for analytics aimed at the end business user</li><li><a href="https://dagster.io/">Dagster</a> for overall data orchestration</li><li><a href="https://getcensus.com/">Census</a> to send transformed data back to source tools (like Salesforce)</li></ul><p>On this lean foundation, Drizly can build the data stack they need as they need it, instead of spending time, money, and effort with one-off solutions or ambiguous third-party tools. In the end, even through a massive spike in data processed due to COVID-19 (Drizly delivers alcohol by mail; what do you expect?), their operating costs didn’t significantly change.</p><h2 id="snowflake-scales-while-redshift-flails">Snowflake Scales While Redshift Flails</h2><div><p>Snowflake is built from the ground up to scale linearly, while Redshift simply doesn’t. Scaling this way is ideal for small startups looking to grow on a solid foundation of data. Trying to replicate this scaling ability with Redshift or other data warehouses can become prohibitively expensive.</p><p>If you have 40 minutes to spare, we recommend hitting “pause” and going to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gsaujml_Ff8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1102&amp;ab_channel=DataCouncil">Alessandro Pregnolato’s, head of data at Marfeel, talk on addressing complexity at scale</a>. His main point when it comes to Snowflake is that its ability to quickly and cheaply spin up <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses.html">virtual warehouses</a> is a game changer. He plays out the following scenario:</p></div><ul><li>If you have a query to run on a small machine (i.e., virtual warehouse) it might cost $3 an hour.</li><li>It could take an hour and will cost $3.</li><li>Or, with Snowflake, you spin up a machine that’s 10x bigger and costs $30 an hour.</li><li>Then, it could take you 6 minutes and still cost $3.</li></ul><div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/Gsaujml_Ff8?t=1426">Alessandro goes </a>on to say, “I can take these monster machines and 5-hour queries and make them run in 10 minutes. And I pay the same.” Redshift can’t do this. Even if it could, the fact that its most commonly used version can’t decouple storage and compute pricing, running a larger machine would break the bank. You’re forced to move slower.</p><p>Another aspect of scalability is concurrency and the handling of real-time data. Snowflake does it better. But don’t just take our word for it. <a href="https://medium.com/ro-data-team-blog/why-we-switched-to-snowflake-10c14d8dac52">Sami Yabroudi from the Ro data team has a fantastic write-up</a> about their Redshiftshift to Snowflake. </p><p>He echoes Alessandro’s point about spinning up computing resources: “Snowflake can automatically ‘spin up’ more computing resources and run all of the concurrent queries in parallel with zero drag on the execution speed of any individual query.“ Alessandro, for his part, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gsaujml_Ff8&amp;ab_channel=DataCouncil">just comes out and says</a>, “[Redshift] doesn’t scale well in terms of concurrency.”</p></div><figure><img src="https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/2021/01/Drizly-Analytics-Stack.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Drizly-Analytics-Stack.png 600w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Drizly-Analytics-Stack.png 1000w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/Drizly-Analytics-Stack.png 1600w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/2021/01/Drizly-Analytics-Stack.png 2080w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Drizly Analytics Stack Presented at Fivetran Modern Data Conference</figcaption></figure><p>And for real-time data, Sami says, “With Snowflake, there is no performance impact if we have real-time data syncing - all data in our warehouse is current to within 30 minutes.” This fact was echoed just about everywhere people talk about Snowflake, from Drizly’s webinar to Alessandro’s talk to Medium articles like Sami’s. The point is, Snowflake is built to scale in the way modern companies scale.</p><h2 id="snowflake-is-flexible-and-spry-while-redshift-is-old">Snowflake Is Flexible and Spry While Redshift Is ... Old</h2><div><p>We’ve been pretty harsh on Redshift in this article. The truth is that Redshift has a well-established role in the data industry — and by “well-established,” we mean old. </p><p>Redshift was built to be cutting-edge in 2013. That’s the same year <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK8mJJJvaes&amp;ab_channel=MacklemoreLLC">Thrift Shop</a> topped the charts (if it’s that outdated, maybe it belongs in a thrift shop?). Seven years is practically a century in data-industry terms, and it hasn’t made many significant improvements since then — at least until Snowflake started eating its lunch. There are a lot of relics Redshift still carries around that keep you from being as agile as you need to be in the modern data marketplace. </p><p>For instance, Redshift incentivizes long-term commitments, which is just them trying to lock you in. To stay agile and up to date with the seismic shifts in the data industry occurring every quarter, you need <a href="https://blog.getcensus.com/hub-and-spoke-vs-point-to-point-data-synchronization-theres-one-clear-winner/">a flexible data infrastructure</a>. And Snowflake, right now, is the best centerpiece for that infrastructure, thanks to its scalability, storage of semi-structured data, ease of use, concurrency, and more. </p><p>But the important caveat here is that Snowflake may go the way of Redshift come 2027. And we’ll be making fun of the fact that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOxj2ROIxok&amp;ab_channel=MeganTheeStallion">Savage</a> topped the charts at <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/16/investing/snowflake-ipo/index.html">the time of its IPO</a>. The point is that Snowflake is “that bitch.“ For now</p></div><h2 id="convinced-here-are-a-few-things-to-know-about-migration">Convinced? Here Are a Few Things to Know About Migration</h2><p>Migration from Redshift to Snowflake is a bit of a process, and there are a few quirks you need to keep in mind.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>GS2JSON is a free api which will allow you to transform any Google Sheet to a JSON file.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simply append your public spreadsheet url to: <a href="https://labs.zero.sh/api/gs2json?url=your-public-speadsheet-url" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://labs.zero.sh/api/gs2json?url=your-public-speadsheet-url</a> - Nothing else needed!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's free to use and doesn't require an API key or authentication. The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/Cosbgn/zero-labs/blob/master/api/gs2json.js" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Github</a></p>
<p>With Zero you can build great interactive dashboards pulling data directly from a Google Sheet using this API.
It's free! Read more in our blog post: <a href="https://zero.sh/blog/create-a-dashboard-with-google-sheets">Create a dashboard with Google Sheets</a></p>
<h2 id="1-make-sure-that-your-sheet-is-public">1. Make sure that your sheet is public</h2>
<p>This API can read only public sheets. To make your sheet public open it and then click on:</p>
<ol>
<li>File (On the top left of the Google Sheet window)</li>
<li>Publish for the web</li>
<li>Publish</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point you can close this popup and copy the <strong>full page URL</strong>. Directly from your browser's address bar.</p>
<h2 id="2-format-your-request">2. Format your request</h2>
<p>This API accepts only <strong>GET</strong> requests to this endpoint: <code>https://labs.zero.sh/api/gs2json</code></p>
<p>The following query parameters are allowed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the spreadsheet url often contains a hashtag symbol (#) make sure you add the URL as the last parameter or you risk that the others will be ignored, for example:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Do <code>?format=2&amp;url=https://docs...</code></li>
<li>Don't do <code>?url=https://docs...&amp;format=1</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The following parameters are accepted:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>format</strong>:
You can chose the format of your response. Possible values are 1,2 &amp; 3. Read about these below.</li>
<li><strong>sheet</strong>:
The number of the sheet in the spreadsheet (Defaults to the first sheet if nothing is passed)</li>
<li><strong>url</strong>:
This is the full spreadsheet url, something like: <em><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12345" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12345</a></em></li>
<li><strong>id</strong>:
Instead of the full url, you can also simply pass the id like: <em>12345</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-format-your-response">3. Format your response</h2>
<p>You can chose to have your data returned in 3 different ways, use the <code>format</code> parameter to chose the response your prefer.</p>
<ol>
<li>An object <em>without</em> columns names</li>
<li>An object <em>with</em> column names</li>
<li>An Array of the rows with mapped column names</li>
</ol>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Complex software can be daunting to author. I will dissect and reintroduce the concept of asynchronous machines, why we need it in the first place, and how delving into the concept might help conquer complex software.</p>
<h2>Software Complexity</h2>
<p>Software complexity is the number of components inside a software, assuming that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle">a single component has a single responsibility</a>. A software with a single component that does a lot of things is regarded as not only complex but also <em>amess</em>, but I'm not going to visit that idea. I don't stick to the strict definition of single-responsibility principle that comes from OOP, therefore a component is not necessarily a class, a struct. It's just one part of a software of many with a clear distinction from the others.</p>
<h2>Async Machines</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"><em>"Machine is a mechanical structure that uses power to apply forces and control movement to perform an intended action." - wikipedia.com</em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why are we mentioning "machine" at all?</p>
<p>Computer is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automaton">automaton</a>, a self-operating machine that follows a predetermined sequence of operations. Those operations are what we call a program. Being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">Turing complete</a>, a computer can simulate itself, therefore a program can be a machine too.</p>
<p>A video game runs, you play it. While it is running, it reads inputs from peripherals. Those inputs alter the internal state. At one point, the video game can reach a particular state that prompts it to quit. That video game is a machine. Another example, NodeJS. NodeJS loads and interprets JavaScript code and executes it. In this situation, NodeJS is the machine, while the JavaScript code is the program. This is why NodeJS is a VM.</p>
<p>A program can be as boring as receiving input, processing it, and spewing output, but each passing day that simple thing does not suffice. Computers gain new capabilities, file systems, networking, multi-threading, GPU processing, and those are made available through hardware with different speeds. And not to forget the most important part of the realm of computer, human, its user, doesn't like to be kept waiting. That's why a simple input, computation, output doesn't suffice. Everything around the program, hardware interfaces, humans, are all working and reacting at different paces. Inputs and outputs are needed at different intervals. This is the original reason why the concept of asynchronous machines exists.</p>
<p>Essentially, the concept of asynchronous machines is to make all parties, which are the I/O edges of the program, the happiest they can be.</p>
<p>A case: A browser is a complex system. It is responsible for many things, connecting to and loading from servers, running web pages, sandboxing tabs, synchronizing web storage to disks, etc. In it are asynchronous machines, each responsible for different parties:</p>
<ul>
<li>A tab is running a page. Inside a page is HTML DOM, CSS style computation and JavaScript code execution. This is a human facing machine. It must always be responsive to user input. You can find evidence that unresponsiveness is an intolerable behavior for this machine, such as calling a long-running JavaScript operation will trigger a prompt that says "page is unresponsive", offering the user an escape hatch, killing the page, to make sure that the user has options all the time.</li>
<li>A tab is running a page. Inside a page is HTML DOM, CSS style computation and JavaScript code execution. It is a human facing. It must always be responsive to user input. Unresponsiveness is intolerable for it. You can find evidence of that anywhere. For example, calling a long-running JavaScript operation will trigger a prompt that says "page is unresponsive". Then it offers the user an escape hatch: to kill the page.</li>
<li>A storage-facing program is "happy" when it efficiently reads and writes to storage.</li>
<li>And many more...</li>
</ul>
<p>Messaging is the most important basis of asynchronous machines. Messaging happens at small scale, like communication between threads, as well as at large scale, like blockchain mining. Synchronous APIs directed towards asynchronous machines are either wrapper for request/response with messaging underneath, or fire-and-forget message.</p>
<p>Messaging involves message queues at the receiver's side, and sometimes at the sender's side too. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_buffer">buffer</a> at the I/O to hardware is a message queue. Hardware and a program are separate asynchronous machines. They need buffers to store unprocessed messages.</p>
<p>Queues are abstracted out for a software developer most of the time. For example, NodeJS has a lot of APIs implementing stream. NodeJS's stream is actually a buffer and its processor behind the scene, which triggers events. NodeJS users only have to understand which events do what.</p>
<p>Many projects I have worked on involve writing two or more asynchronous machines at the same time. Usually one is the UI layer and the other is a layer that interacts with storage or network. Most of the time queues need to be handwritten because it needs a custom behavior, such as merging message duplicates, has a custom backpressure mechanism, etc. Then, because the queue is handwritten, the queue runner also needs to be handwritten. The queue is a "singleton function", in which only one instance of it can exist per queue. It runs at the start of the queue appendage and stops when the queue is empty. Then, at the caller's side, a wrapper is written to make an "illusion" of synchronous calls. Most of the time it is fun.</p>
<p>Messaging can either be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_broker">brokered</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer">not brokered</a>. A simple brokered messaging would be Mutex that guards access from multiple threads, or Kafka sending messages from one service to another. A message broker is essentially the party responsible for transporting messages from one party to the other. A message broker is essentially the party responsible for transporting messages from one party to the other. Meanwhile, unbrokered messaging is when two parties don't need another party to manage their messages. Peer-to-peer communication is one of those. Being brokered and unbrokered is not a hard 1 or 0 but a spectrum. There can be a messaging mechanism in the middle of the spectrum. Shared storage is, for example, is where multiple parties store data at the same site. The shared storage acts as a passive broker. The difference between brokered and not brokered lies in how a message gets transported and how the receiver and sender must do additional process before and after the transportation, like serialization, validation, etc.</p>
<p>Knowing the existence of a message broker is crucial when you design objects' lifecycle. The message broker must live before the components that rely on it. It also must die after them. This concept seems obvious, but it's not rare for projects to fail this aspect. An easy practice is to structure code chronologically, both for declarative and imperative styles.</p>

    <div data-language="react">
      <pre><code><span>// In declarative language/framework:
// example: react + jsx
(
	&lt;ComponentA&gt; {/* ComponentA is mounted first */}
    	&lt;ComponentB&gt; {/* ComponentB is mounted second */}
            &lt;ComponentC /&gt; {/* ComponentC is mounted last and dismounted first */}
        &lt;/ComponentB&gt; {/* ComponentB is dismounted second */}
    &lt;/ComponentA&gt; {/* ComponentA is dismounted last */}
)
// ComponentA is mounted first and dismounted last
// ComponentB is mounted second and dismounted second
// ComponentC is mounted last and dismounted first</span></code></pre>

<h2>The Line Separating FP vs OOP War Lies At The Edges of Asynchronous Machines</h2>
<p>Let's talk functional programming, or rather, programming with functional style. FP is often regarded as the opposite of OOP, while I think it's not the exact opposite. Sometime in the past birthed a language which forces you to write everything with <code>class</code>. A <code>class</code> has methods, which has call syntax <code>subject.predicate()</code>. <code>subject</code> in a sentence is active, an agent. This paradigm introduces a side effect. In the perspective of the programmer, a program written in an OOP style has many agents, whereas not every kind of program needs multiple agencies.</p>
<p>In an environment where there are no other machines with different paces, a machine only needs one agent, which is itself. The machine receives input and produces output and maybe some side effects. All components inside the machines work at the same pace, so there's no need for sub-agency, message passing, nor buffering. It is like a librarian with one mind and two hands cataloging and organizing books. The program manages data. It makes functional programming a prime paradigm in building a machine. Its principles like immutability over mutability, pure functions, recursion, higher-order functions, result in elegant code.</p>
<p>At the same time, two asynchronous machines have two agencies. Each has their memory, works at their own pace, acts on their own data, and occasionally communicates with each other. This is where the concept of multiple agencies needs to be introduced. This is, where I think, the original concept of OOP (not nowadays' OOP) makes sense. Alan Kay describes OOP as if computers are cells, and they occasionally send messages to each other. This is also why sometimes people throw jokes at functional programming for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADqLBc1vFwI">being difficult to do side-effects</a> on.</p>
<p>The line that separates FP and OOP paradigms, moreover how programmers perceive machines because of the two, lies at the edges of asynchronous machines.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~ram/pub/pub_jf47ht81Ht/doc_kay_oop_en">"I thought of objects being like biological cells and/or individual computers on a network, only able to communicate with messages" - Alan Kay</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Coda</h2>
<p>Understanding the concept of asynchronous machines is a huge help to me if we're talking about system design. While this piece of writing is a big idea presented in a rough format, I hope you get something out of it as much as I did.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>In this article, I am going to take a thorough look at an interesting piece of router/firewall hardware that I recently bought off AliExpress: A fanless Intel mini PC with six Gbit Ethernet ports that should make for an ideal router in any picky user’s home network.</p>

<p><img src="https://johannes.truschnigg.info/reviews/2021-01_fwbox/img/screenshot_2020-12-29_us__149_1_29__off_fanless_pfsense_intel_core_i5_7226u_i3_7167u_3865u_industrial_mini_pc_2_rs232_6_lan_..._.jpg" alt="original offer on aliexpress" title="Original offer on aliexpress.com"></p>

<p>If you don’t feel like spending too much time on my ramblings, you’re of course welcome to hop down to the <a href="#at-a-glance-summary-and-verdict">tl;dr-style section at the very end</a>.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&amp;SearchText=mini+pc">query AliExpress for “<em>mini PC</em>”</a>, you get back an avalanche of results. The storefront’s filtering capabilities also don’t make it easy on the potential buyer, and you will have to be ready and willing to wade through MANY colorful item descriptions and bundle choices if you are serious about finding the right fit for the purpose you have in mind. If you do, you will be rewarded with hardware designs that you just won’t be able to find anywhere in the EU’s retail market (except maybe on eBay’s or Amazon’s marketplace platforms, where dropshippers selling these probably source them from AliExpress/Alibaba themselves).</p>

<p>I have been on the lookout for a new home router/firewall appliance with Gbit Ethernet connectivity recently. I would like my new router to have enough horsepower to perform <a href="https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/cerowrt/wiki/Smart_Queue_Management/">Smart Queue Management</a> on the 300Mbps downstream link my ISP currently leases to me at home, and so I decided to give AliExpress’s x86 mini PC catalog a closer look. After a few short hours of virtual window shopping, I arrived at the <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/store/2177063">EGLOBAL Top MiniPC shop</a>. Their tagline reads <em>OEM &amp; ODM Mini PC Manufacturer</em>, and they have an impressive lineup of small-ish PC hardware in store. Compact and silent media center machines, powerful yet tiny desktop PCs, network/firewall appliances - if you’re looking to build any of these, they’ll probably have you covered.</p>

<h2 id="unveiling-the-fwbox">Unveiling the fwbox</h2>

<p>For my project, the <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000931029633.html"><em>EGLOBAL Fanless pfSense Intel 3865U Industrial Mini PC</em></a> caught my eye. That is quite a mouthful, and I quickly came to call it the <em>fwbox</em> myself. I will be referring to the piece of hardware tested here by that moniker for the remainder of the review. The fwbox’s hardware highlights, according to the manufacturer, are as follows (reproduced verbatim from the seller’s item description at the time of purchase, 2020-12-15):</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fanless system without cooling fan, no any noise, thicker and longer heat-sink fins for working as long as 7x24 hours durably.</li>
<li>6xIntel i201/i211 Gigabit RJ45 LANs and 2xRS232 COM ports, support Windows, Linux and pfSense OS.</li>
<li>1xmSATA SSD+1x2.5” SSD/HDD installation supported.</li>
<li>One embedded SIM card slot onboard, 3G/4G/WiFi optional.</li>
<li>Applied in Firewall, Network Server, Network Security, VPN Router etc.</li>
<li>Full Aluminum Alloy Black color shell, Exquisite production craft on outside design with high quality, slim design 209x150x57MM.</li>
<li>Low consumption save much energy and eco-friendly.</li>
<li>Support Watchdog, AWAL, RTC, WOL, PXE, Reset functions.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="configurable-and-optional-hardware-choices-warranty">Configurable and optional hardware choices; warranty</h3>

<p>As with many other AliExpress “mini PC” barebone offers, EGLOBAL lets the buyer choose which (soldered - which means you cannot change it later, unless you replace the whole motherboard) CPU, and if an (or which) optional storage and memory components they would like installed. I chose the 2GB RAM (PC3-12800 DDR3L SO-UDIMM) and 32GB SSD (mSATA-600) bundle, so that I would be able to start testing the machine in-depth right away, without any potential problems like minor (or not-so-minor) DRAM compatibility troubles holding me back. For the CPU, I chose the <a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/96507/intel-celeron-processor-3865u-2m-cache-1-80-ghz.html">Intel Celeron 3865U</a> - a dual core <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaby_Lake">Kaby Lake</a> (originally introduced in early 2017) Mobile/Laptop-class CPU clocking at up to 1800MHz that should easily be powerful enough to juggle everything my LAN and WAN would be throwing at it, with some headroom left for other tasks. I intend to put this 3865U to the test and see if this hunch actually holds true.</p>

<p>Although the manufacturer offers to pre-populate the miniPCIe slot with a suitable Wi-Fi card for a relatively small premium, I did not choose that option. There are only very few miniPCIe cards on the market that make decent stations when operated in Access Point mode, especially if you want to offer 802.11ac (“Wi-Fi 5”) speeds. Apart from that, you would usually want or need two distinct radios to cover all your wireless networking needs: one for covering the 2.4GHz band, and another one for the 5GHz band. Since that would take two cards/radios/slots, there’s no way to cram that into the fwbox - and USB adapters are another can of worms on their own. So, in my view, sticking to an external AP that does those wireless things well is the better choice to make, and my unit’s miniPCIe slot will remain unpopulated for the time being.</p>

<p>The seller also advertises a 3y warranty, which I would imagine to be difficult to benefit from, due to the international shipping and export/import burdens involved. Therefore, I did not make any warranty concerns or promises part of my decision making process when buying this mini PC.</p>

<h3 id="notes-on-os-and-software">Notes on OS and software</h3>

<p>With EGLOBAL shipping my device with mass storage pre-installed, they were nice enough to pre-load <a href="https://www.pfsense.org/">pfSense</a> in a fairly recent release (<a href="https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/releases/2-4-4-p3.html">2.4.4-p3</a>) for me. However, since I am not a FreeBSD expert, I will be performing my testing on GNU/Linux-based distros and operating systems instead. Experienced BSD users should not expect any nasty surprises though - the hardware really isn’t exotic, and the fact that the manufacturer actively advertises pfSense as the “expected” (and pre-loaded) OS for the fwbox certainly implies good compatibility between hardware and that choice of OS.</p>

<h3 id="notes-on-delivery-and-import-fees">Notes on delivery and import fees</h3>

<p>When I purchased the fwbox, my desired configuration was offered by EGLOBAL for US$ 193.35/EUR 163.75. DHL charged another EUR 43.69 on top of that to have the fwbox delivered to my doorstep from China in less than two weeks (even though they presumably were drowning in shipments over Christmas), while also handling import turnover tax and tariffs and the like for me. I consider that fair, and the grand total of about EUR 210 is absolutely fair for the kind of device when compared with Mini PC offers available here in Austria, like <a href="https://www.zotac.com/de/product/mini_pcs/ci329-nano">Zotac’s ZBOX</a> et al.</p>

<h2 id="looking-closer-at-the-hardware">Looking closer at the hardware</h2>

<h3 id="ethernet-and-networking-considerations">Ethernet and networking considerations</h3>

<p>The main feature and selling point of this specific mini PC variant, at least to me, is the six integrated Gbit-speed Ethernet ports. They’re all <a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/series/68667/intel-ethernet-server-adapter-i210-series.html">Intel i210</a>-based and are connected to the system via PCIe (2.5GT/s each) individually - the Ethernet ports on the fwbox’s back are therefore not connected to a software-configurable, internal Ethernet switch like you would find on most SOHO routers or the like. As a consequence, if you want the fwbox to act mostly like one of these appliances, you will have to emulate whatever a switch does “in software”, on the main CPU. Luckily, Linux can do that both easily end efficiently, by configuring a bridge over as many Ethernet (and other) devices/links as you want.</p>

<p>Most dedicated switching hardware comes with special offloading features and performance enhancements that give it an edge over general purpose networking solutions - but with the comparatively powerful host CPU the fwbox has at its heart, combined with the decent Ethernet adapters and drivers in play, it should be able to keep up in most (if not all) scenarios that involve up to six bridged Gbit links. On the flip side, we gain the unparalleled flexibility that Linux and other free OS offer to do as we please with all frames, packets, flows, and whatever else the fwbox will have to relay and route and proxy through it.</p>

<h3 id="device-case-front">Device/case front</h3>

<p>Apart from the obviously important embedded hardware components, there’s more interesting details to explore. As you’ve already been able to glean from the specs quoted earlier, the fwbox comes with four USB-A (USB 3.0 SuperSpeed, 5Gbps) and two COM/Serial (1x9P, 1xRJ-45) ports on the front. All these are easily accessible and live right next to an HDMI port (wired up to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Graphics_Technology#Kaby_Lake">Intel HD Graphics 610</a> IGP, which makes for a very fast console framebuffer - and probably even a decent media center appliance…), if you ever need to plug in a display to diagnose potential problems on a VT. The front also features a neatly looking, upside-down power button, and a slightly sunk-in reset button, which seems practically impossible to trigger by accident.</p>

<p><a href="https://johannes.truschnigg.info/reviews/2021-01_fwbox/img/fwbox_case_front.jpg"><img src="https://johannes.truschnigg.info/reviews/2021-01_fwbox/img/thm_fwbox_case_front.jpg" alt="fwbox front view" title="fwbow - Front view"></a></p>

<h3 id="device-case-back">Device/case back</h3>

<p>On the back, we have the aforementioned six Ethernet ports, two activity LEDs (red for power and green for mass storage activity - both far too bright, of course), the AC in, and two knobs for connecting Wi-Fi antennas, should your configuration need them. The two corresponding internal cables that connect these antennas to the Wi-Fi card dangle loosely on the inside, and are responsible for the audible rattling noises the fwbox emits whenever you tilt or shake it. If you’re not using them, you will want to make sure there’s no possibility for them to cause any kind of harm to the internals of your system, and carefully stow them away on the fwbox’s inside.</p>

<p><a href="https://johannes.truschnigg.info/reviews/2021-01_fwbox/img/fwbox_case_back.jpg"><img src="https://johannes.truschnigg.info/reviews/2021-01_fwbox/img/thm_fwbox_case_back.jpg" alt="fwbox back view" title="fwbox - Rear view"></a></p>

<h3 id="device-casing-and-build-quality">Device casing and build quality</h3>

<p>The manufacturer advertises the case as “exquisite production craft on outside design with high quality”, and the fwbox lives up to the meaning that supposedly tries to convey. It really feels solid and well-crafted. The matte black, all-aluminum case has a certain charm to it in my eyes, and acts as a very effective heatsink to boot - the whole design is fanless, and completely inaudible under all operating conditions. Still, I wouldn’t want this little tank of a PC to have to try hiding in plain sight in the living room. Luckily, it doesn’t need to: Given its relatively small width, it fits perfectly well inside a 10” rack. If you choose that, you’ll have to be a little creative when mounting it (as it doesn’t include rails), and reserve 2HE due to its somewhat protruding heat dissipation fins, however.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: With data breach risks and regulations on the rise, data access for developers will become increasingly restricted. Add to that the escalating complexity of mimicking production data in-house, and DevOps teams stand to face a sudden shortage of quality data for development and testing in the year ahead.</p><p>Perhaps the only thing riskier than making predictions for 2021, given the unprecedented year that was 2020, is not making predictions and responding to the trends when it comes to data privacy. Reflecting on what we’ve seen in the industry and in conversations with our customers, here are the developments we see unfolding in the year ahead.</p><h2>2021 will be the worst year for data breaches yet.</h2><p>The scale of data breaches will be worse in 2021 than ever before. How do we know? The <a href="https://www.identityforce.com/blog/2020-data-breaches" target="_blank">past few years</a> have been nothing but a steady upward climb. Even though the number of <em>breaches</em> decreased from 2019 to 2020, the number of <em>records exposed</em> in those breaches more than doubled, from 15.1 billion records in 2019 to <a href="https://pages.riskbasedsecurity.com/hubfs/Reports/2020/2020%20Q3%20Data%20Breach%20QuickView%20Report.pdf" target="_blank">36 billion in 2020 as of Q3</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Companies may be fighting the good fight in safeguarding against breaches, but when a breach occurs, they’re losing more data than ever. And with work-from-home now the norm for so many, the risks of a breach are <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/news/data-security-lapses-surge-in-work-from-home-era" target="_blank">heightened</a>.</p><h2>Remote work will redefine data governance—permanently.</h2><p>With the above in mind, the shift to remote work is changing how people think about <a href="https://www.tonic.ai/post/remote-work-data-sprawl">security for distributed teams</a>, especially around data minimization and access restrictions. We’re seeing changes in internal processing and an increase in tooling to reduce the use of sensitive data within an organization.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The real potential here is for ways that do so without limiting employees from getting work done. At Tonic, we're doubling down on this need as we believe these shifts are here to stay.</p><h2>Using production data in development is OUT.</h2><p>Thanks to privacy legislation like GDPR and CCPA/CPRA, the shift away from using production data in development and testing has been steadily picking up speed. But it’s not yet the gold standard that it should be.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Between the risks of remote work and ever stronger regulations on the horizon, we expect this shift to accelerate dramatically over the coming year. Some companies will opt to create dummy data in house; others will <a href="https://www.tonic.ai/post/building-data-de-identification-infrastructure">consider the work involved</a>, and seek out solutions like Tonic, to rapidly get high-quality, representative data at scale.</p><h2>Data access will make or break developer productivity.</h2><p>Developer productivity sets apart successful organizations from unsuccessful ones, making rapid, easy access to high quality data more important than ever. As applications become more advanced, the data involved in their use and creation is becoming increasingly complex.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Traditional dev tools simply aren't up to the challenge of meeting today’s data needs, and in-house solutions fail over time. Organizations that don’t find a faster, safer way to get their developers the data they need will be left behind.&nbsp;</p><h2>Privacy needs will impact cloud migrations.</h2><p>Simply put, migrating from on-prem to cloud data lakes needs to be done with privacy in mind. Compliance with regulations can impact how a company's data can be stored in the cloud. Data sanitization pre-migration may be a necessary step in the process, and data access post-migration must be carefully defined. We’re seeing many companies combine the potential of cloud data warehousing like Snowflake with streamlined data de-identification like Tonic to get the best that modern privacy tools and cloud storage solutions have to offer.</p><h2>Federal data privacy legislation is coming.</h2><p>You’ve probably heard <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/congress-may-finally-pass-federal-data-privacy-law-in-2021-2020-12" target="_blank">this</a> <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/2021-best-chance-for-federal-privacy-legislation/" target="_blank">elsewhere</a> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/predictions-2021-privacy-becomes-an-imperative-in-a-year-of-transition/" target="_blank">as</a> <a href="https://www.information-age.com/forrester-releases-privacy-cyber-security-predictions-2021-123492371/" target="_blank">well</a>. We’re all in agreement: it’s high time the US set a federal standard for data privacy. In the past two years, as many as <a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/state-comparison-table/" target="_blank">27 states</a> have taken matters into their own hands, introducing state-level privacy legislation. California, Maine, and Nevada have already signed their bills into law, complicating the landscape of compliance requirements companies must meet. Legislation at the federal level is in everyone’s best interest, from consumers to legislators to corporations.</p><p>So there you have it, the good, the bad, and the critical to keep in mind as we navigate another year in this unexpected landscape. We’re excited to see Tonic helping our customers address many of these concerns. If safe data access and developer enablement is top of mind for you in 2021 and our predictions strike a chord, <a href="https://www.tonic.ai/demo">drop us a line</a>. Here’s to a safe and happy new year!</p></div><div><h2>What’s a Rich Text element?</h2><p>The rich text element allows you to create and format headings, paragraphs, blockquotes, images, and video all in one place instead of having to add and format them individually.

<p>Modern task managers carry two implicit assumptions. At first glance, they seem correct.</p>
<p>But if you’re an IC, there’s a good chance that your task manager has caused you unnecessary pain by assuming:</p>
<ol>
<li>A task manager needs to remember all of your tasks</li>
<li>All tasks can use a similar creation workflow</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s not obvious why these are wrong.</p>
<p>Here’s why, and how to fix the problems they cause.</p>
<h2 id="permanent-tasks-cause-fatigue">Permanent tasks cause fatigue</h2>
<p>Before starting Tandem, my manager Tim previously co-founded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/01/yahoo-acquires-to-do-app-astrid/">Astrid</a>, a personal task manager, which he later sold to Yahoo.</p>
<p>At Astrid, Tim tried an interesting re-engagement email. Users who had been inactive for 6 weeks were asked: “want to delete all your tasks and start fresh?”</p>
<p>The hypothesis was that these inactive users had tasks that overwhelmed them. Either the amount, the complexity, or the low importance of backlogged tasks, caused users to put tasks off. So every time these users visited Astrid, they saw tasks they couldn’t do, felt bad, and eventually stopped visiting. The psychology of procrastination in action. So Astrid’s re-engagement email offered the users a chance to start fresh.</p>
<p>And it was impressively compelling. Most re-engagement emails get a 1% response rate. This email had about 5%.</p>
<p>I imagine those users had the same feeling you get when you move from one browser to another, or from one task manager to another, and leave your bookmarks, open tabs, backlogged tasks, to start fresh in the name of increased productivity.</p>
<p>But simply deleting the backlog doesn’t end the cycle.</p>
<hr>
<p>Nowadays, Tim uses a simpler task manager—a notebook. He uses a page a day, adds some tasks from JIRA, and when tasks come in during the day, he writes them down and works on them when he’s available. These are mostly small tasks, things that are easy to forget. If he gets an bug (important to track) or a task he can delegate, he puts it in JIRA.</p>
<p>The notebook isn’t meant to store issues forever. The pages get turned, and previous information becomes less accessible. So the next day, if he needs to carry over something that hasn’t been completed, he needs to make the conscious decision to do so.</p>
<p>This solution solves task-management fatigue. And incidentally, it solves another problem:</p>
<h2 id="the-gap-in-task-management">The gap in task management</h2>
<p>We know not all tasks are created the same. When we look at the tools used for tracking tasks and goals, there’s something for every level of the company:</p>
<br>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Level</th>
<th>Goal</th>
<th>Tool</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Company quarter-level</td>
<td>Quarterly Goals</td>
<td>Notion/Gdocs</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Org quarter-level</td>
<td>KPIs</td>
<td>Notion/Gdocs, JIRA Epics</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Team sprint-level</td>
<td>Tickets</td>
<td>JIRA Tasks/Bugs</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Personal day-level</td>
<td>???</td>
<td>???</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Except at the personal day-level, where you’re working on tickets, getting requests for feature updates from your PM, bug discoveries from QA, and breaking down your actual tickets into different tasks, which may require subtasks that weren’t anticipated.</p>
<p>One proposal is that you should track all of these tasks, no matter how small, in JIRA. But the teams I see successful at implementing this are those that can afford to work at a slower, more “enterprise” pace. Which isn’t a problem—at least for engineering—but it’s often not an option at smaller startups, when learning cycles must be fast.</p>
<p><em>Even if you work at a larger company, at a slower pace, you may relate when it comes to personal life: tasks come from a variety of directions, at all times. You can’t toss every minor task in a task manager.</em></p>
<p>You can’t fix every task before the next one comes in. If you only use JIRA, you choose between possibly forgetting these small tasks, or breaking your train of thought to search, categorize, and fill out a form every time you get a small task.</p>
<p>On the flip side, quickly writing these down in a temporary place means that you don’t need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>spend mental effort remembering minor tasks,</li>
<li>or take significant time to file minor issues.</li>
<li>have your task manager filled with minor issues you’ve forgotten to close,</li>
<li>or leave hastily-written issues for later, when you forget what the vaguely titled issue is for.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="filling-the-gap">Filling the gap</h2>
<p>But solution is cheap and simple: a temporary, personal task manager.</p>
<p>You may already use one. Tim’s notebook is a good example. I personally DM myself on Slack.</p>
<details zgotmplz="">
<summary>An example of how I Slack myself</summary>
<div>
<h4 id="using-slack-for-daily-personal-tasks">Using Slack for daily personal tasks</h4>
<p>When I’m working, and get a non-urgent task that would otherwise interrupt me, it goes in my Slack DMs. This is what it looks like:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/imessage-as-a-task-manager/IMG_7647.jpg">
</p>
<p>Some days are quiet</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/imessage-as-a-task-manager/IMG_7644.jpg">
</p>
<p>And some are hectic</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the morning, to re-build yesterday’s context, I just look at yesterday’s list. If there are unfinished items, I can carry them over. But it’s a conscious decision. I don’t need to carry over optional, low-priority tasks.</p>
<p>And if you’ve got a bad memory, there’s a huge benefit for team stand-ups. I used to write JQL filters to search JIRA (doesn’t work—and misses tasks), now I just take a look at Slack.</p>
</div>
</details>
<p>The important requirements are just that your task manager:</p>
<ol>
<li>Requires effort to carry over old tasks, and</li>
<li>Makes writing down tasks quick</li>
<li>Isn’t used for notes</li>
</ol>
<p>So take out a notebook, open Slack, pick what works for you. And see—does it let you focus less on managing your tasks, and more on doing them?</p>
<hr>


<p>I think these tools have interesting ideas to help ICs manage tasks.</p>
<h3 id="amna">Amna</h3>
<p>Ravi, my old college roommate and friend since high school, left Microsoft to build <a href="https://www.getamna.com/">Amna</a>, a personal task manager with tight browser integration.</p>
<p>I resonate with the thesis: recently I switched away from Firefox Tree Style Tabs, because I noticed that by organizing my tabs (which were part of tasks), it inadvertently became a de-facto task manager. But it wasn’t built for that!</p>
<p>Amna solves that exact problem: each task you do spawns a browser that keeps all of your relevant tabs.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/imessage-as-a-task-manager/amna1.jpg">
</p>
<p>All the tabs in this browser window are related to the same task, and Amna keeps their state when I close the browser.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/imessage-as-a-task-manager/amna2.jpg">
</p>
<p>After I'm done with a task, I can go back and look at the tabs I had open.</p>
</div>
<p>It helps prevent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muscle-memory opening HN, clicking an interesting blog post, and leaving it open “to read later” for several weeks</li>
<li>The pain of trawling through bookmarks and browser history, when you realize you forgot something</li>
<li>The clutter of leaving tabs open to prevent forgetting something</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve forgotten a time when you had less than five tabs open, <a href="https://www.getamna.com/">try using Amna</a>.</p>
<h3 id="jam">Jam</h3>
<p><a href="https://jam.dev/">Jam</a> was started by two of my ex-Cloudflare friends, Dani and Irtefa. It’s probably the fastest way for PMs/designers to directly make comments on a website. So you get less minor interruptions, and more clarity on the requested change.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/imessage-as-a-task-manager/jam2.jpg">
</p>
<p>All you do is type `jam` on the page, click an element, and type the comment</p>
</div>
<p>But I don’t include Jam here just for that. Jam also allows you to <a href="https://words.jam.dev/introducing-jam-wand/">offload the actual copy changes</a> to your PM, which flat-out decreases your minor tasks.</p>

<p><em>All organisms, including humans, face the fundamental challenge to interact with the environment in a manner that maximizes rewards while minimizing situations that lead to harm or such that cause boredom. Our reward system motivates us to primarily engage in activities that provide us with positive reinforcements. Fully aware of our biological traits, the strategy of the major media outlets is intended to disturb our values, make thinking seem unnecessary, and withdraw money from our bank accounts. But we don’t argue. We comply. And as I’ll argue below, this blind pursuit towards gratifying stimulus can be harmful to us.</em></p>



<p>This piece is a bit over 4000 words. </p>



<p>And right from the start, I can safely say that you don’t want to read it. Or maybe you do, but the mere thought that you’ll have to consume – manually go through – all of these pretty 4000 words surely make your head spin.</p>



<p>As I’ll explain below, you want to read something shorter. Something with more pictures and less text. Something with less friction. Actually, it will be best if this text magically transforms itself into a video that also plays in your native language.</p>



<p>I know this for a fact. I know this because I’m too, like everyone else, suffering from the degenerating ability to concentrate.</p>



<p>Recently, I wrote a whole article about our desire to receive regular doses of <a href="https://durmonski.com/self-improvement/lack-of-feedback/" target="_blank" aria-label="feedback (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">feedback</a>. While there I cover a lot of ground that is similar to the thesis below, it’s only scratching the surface on how the concept applies to our lives in the current times.</p>



<p>Reportedly, our attention span is getting shorter and shorter.<span id="easy-footnote-1-12750"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-12750" title="This statement is based on the study done by Nature Communications, <a aria-label=&quot;Abundance of information narrows our collective attention span (opens in a new tab)&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-04/tuod-aoi041119.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot;>Abundance of information narrows our collective attention span</a>."><sup>1</sup></a></span> But instead of the content that is being produced to help us increase our concentration, most platforms and publications do the opposite, they tailor their content to our inability to concentrate for more than 10 seconds. And instead of adjusting our media to the content, we adjust our content to the media.</p>



<p>What does this mean?</p>



<p>Well, in short, you don’t see a lot of websites or video creators that produce long-form pieces of content. Instead, we see most people focusing on producing and later sharing short, sweet, bite-size-type of content. </p>



<p>Why are such channels and platforms booming?</p>



<p>In our current reality, in order to sell something, in order to get people to watch and to make them pay attention to what you offer, you need to avoid complexity at all costs. Keep everything brief. Provide constant stimulation through variety, novelty, and movement. Don’t strain the attention and focus heavily on visuals and verbal precision.</p>



<p>These tactics make a lot of sense. After all, we’re bombarded by tons of news and other media on a daily basis. Thanks to the internet and emerging technologies, people around the world can now easily create content which means that the content available for consumption has quadrupled in less than 10 years.<span id="easy-footnote-2-12750"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-12750" title="Based on <a aria-label=&quot;recent reports (opens in a new tab)&quot; href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/09/26/global-online-content-consumption-doubled-in-2020/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot;>recent reports</a>, the average daily time spent consuming information is now six hours and 59 minutes, which includes phone, TV, and other forms of digital media."><sup>2</sup></a></span> And since our time per day remains more or less the same – 24 hours – it’s only logical to try to make content bite-sizy in order to save people some time and give them the opportunity to “taste” more opinions while still having a couple of minutes per day to shower and prepare food for themselves.</p>



<p>Plainly, long-form content is hard to fit into our days. That’s why platforms that provide ways to share short snippets of text, photos, and videos are booming.<span id="easy-footnote-3-12750"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-12750" title="Hey, even I do it! My <a aria-label=&quot;book summaries (opens in a new tab)&quot; href=&quot;https://durmonski.com/category/book-summaries/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot;>book summaries</a> present the main lessons from big books without you having to read the whole text."><sup>3</sup></a></span></p>



<p>This popular ambition everyone is aiming towards – to shorten everything and to fiercely remove all thinking barriers – is worsening our situation in the long-run.</p>



<p>We think that collecting viral tweets and saving Instagram carousels is making us smarter and intellectually more resilient, but we are simply further degenerating our already heavily fragmented attention.</p>



<p>If you’re still here after this too-long-for-most-people-to-consume introduction, let’s start my thesis where I’ll argue that the modern tools that focus on bite-sized-type of content and stripping away thinking are actually damaging our lives (not to mention preventing us from completing our long-term goals).</p>







<h2>How Our Brains Are Structured to Operate?</h2>



<p>My argument starts by sharing my findings in regards how our brains are wired to approach the surrounding environment.</p>



<p>According to neuroscience, we are mainly stimulus-driven creatures.<span id="easy-footnote-4-12750"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-12750" title="Based on <a href=&quot;https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-psych-010416-044216&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; aria-label=&quot;Learning, Reward, and Decision Making (opens in a new tab)&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot;>Learning, Reward, and Decision Making</a>."><sup>4</sup></a></span> We pursue rewards and behavior that will give us faster a sense of accomplishment and at the same time, require less computational resources. Put in a 21st-century language, “move fast and break things.”</p>



<p>That’s why we’ll often hear people say that “I want to feel better and move closer to pleasure by moving further away from pain and suffering.”</p>



<p>This often translates to: focusing on tasks that give returns now, in this very moment, and disengaging your participation in tasks that require too long to receive some sort of gains.</p>



<p>And it makes a lot of sense.</p>



<p>After all, if you are starving, if you are in a difficult financial situation, you will most likely do “any kind” of work, regardless of your long-term ambitions and goals.</p>



<p>The reward, money, in this case, which is actually the means to get food, is an absolute must for us to survive. And when the situation is complicated, we want to get it fast.</p>



<p>But it’s not only money. All of our senses are focused towards obtaining rewards as fast as possible. After all, for the brain to operate, and for the body to feel that what it’s doing is aligned with its main goal – to survive in the world for longer – a constant feed of reinforcements must be established otherwise you’ll question your actions and existence. </p>

If we do not get a proportionate return for our efforts, we will feel that our actions have been in vain. And we will probably stop doing the activity that does not bring results.</figcaption></figure>







<p>And that’s not all, along with physical survival – avoiding harm – we also want emotional prosperity – feeling good.</p>



<p>To rephrase, you want to get praise for what you’re doing. This praise while a lot of times from the outside perspective main seem vain and unimportant – think of social media likes and badges of honer – give to the brain important food. You see the likes and the nice words from others in your social media profile as what you’re doing is correct and that you’re worthy of living here – on the planet.</p>



<p>This is clearly visible in the actions of children.</p>



<p>From an early age, all they do is attract attention. Actually, in the book <a aria-label="The Evolving Self (opens in a new tab)" href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/the-evolving-self/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Evolving Self</a>, Robert Kagan explains that children are “designed” to be attractive. He states, “Among the ways an infant draws another to him, none is more powerful than his eyes.” After all, when born, we’re small and fragile. We need others to adore us. But most importantly, to stick around, so they can take care of us.</p>



<p>That’s why your children will interrupt you every time they make a new drawing or every time they create something new with their toys. But the new doodle or the new lego-tower constructed is not that important for them. They don’t simply invite you to play with them or to look at their creation, they want <em>you</em>, to tell <em>them</em>, that <em>they </em>matter. They are attached to you not only because you’re their biological parent, or the person providing food and other means for them to live. They also see you as the main source for their valuation. Thanks to the praise they receive from you, they feel valued.</p>



<p>The more frequent the praise, the better they feel.</p>



<p>This trait doesn’t go away when we grow up though.</p>







<h2>We Are Always Looking For Ways to Feel Valuable</h2>



<p>If we can put the above in one line, it will be perhaps the following: “Am I worthy?”</p>



<p>But let me expand this further so it can make more sense: “Am I spending my time, my resources, my mental capacity, in a way that will give me rewards that will ultimately reinforce my perception of worthiness?”</p>



<p>All the time, we’re asking ourselves this question. It can take different forms and shapes in different situations, but the core goal is always getting a firm yes to the question “Am I worthy?”</p>



<p>Here are some examples:</p>



<ul><li>Do you love me?</li><li>Do you like my project?</li><li>Do you like my new hair?</li><li>Do you like what I posted on my social media account?</li></ul>



<p>These questions are often not directly asked, of course. We transform them in some sort of actions.</p>



<p>For example, we won’t ask our spouse all the time “do you love me?” But we’ll do a lot of other things hoping to trigger sensations in them that will eventually get back to us in a form of food for our ego: We’ll prepare dinner hoping that he/she will like it and kiss us on the cheek which basically means, “You are worthy!”</p>



<p>We’ll share pictures of ourselves wearing fancy pajamas online hoping that others will like them. The more likes and comments we get, the more this means that “we are worthy and that we matter!”</p>



<p>Of course, there is more…</p>



<p>We’ll fine-tune our projects, arrange our desks, clean our rooms, buy expensive watches and designer-clothes, hoping that others will notice so we can get a nice dose of the “I matter” syrup.</p>



<p>The more the better.</p>



<p>And since the more the better is our guiding force, we focus on doing things that give us quick returns as opposed to doing things that will take years to accomplish.</p>

<p>Data. It’s everywhere and we’re <a href="https://techjury.net/blog/how-much-data-is-created-every-day/#gref">only getting more of it</a>. For the last 5-10 years, <em>data science</em> has attracted newcomers near and far trying to get a taste of that forbidden fruit. </p>
<p>But what does the state of <em>data science</em> hiring look like today?</p>
<p>Here’s the gist of the article in two-sentences for the busy reader.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: There are <strong>70% more open roles</strong> at companies in <em>data engineering</em> as compared to <em>data science</em>. As we train the next generation of data and machine learning practitioners, let’s place more emphasis on engineering skills.</p>
<hr>
<p>As part of my work developing an <a href="https://www.confetti.ai/">educational platform</a> for data professionals, I think a lot about how the market for data-driven (machine learning and data science) roles is evolving. </p>
<p>In talking to dozens of prospective entrants to data fields including students at top institutions around the world, I’ve seen a tremendous amount of confusion around what skills are most important to help candidates stand out in the crowd and prepare for their careers. </p>
<p>When you think about it, a <em>data scientist</em> can be responsible for any subset of the following: machine learning modelling, visualization, data cleaning and processing (i.e. SQL wrangling), engineering, and production deployment. </p>
<p>How do you even begin to recommend a study curriculum for newcomers?</p>
<p>Data speaks louder than words. So I decided to do an analysis of the data roles being hired for at every company coming out of <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/">Y-Combinator</a> since 2012. The questions that guided my research:</p>
<ul>
<li>What data roles are companies most frequently hiring for?</li>
<li>How in-demand is the conventional <em>data scientist</em> that we talk about so much?</li>
<li>Are the same skills that started the data revolution relevant today?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want the full details and analysis, read on. </p>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>I chose to do an analysis of YC portfolio companies that claim to make some sort of data work part of their value proposition. </p>
<p>Why focus on YC? Well, for starters, they do a good job of providing an easily searchable (and scrapable) <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/">directory of their companies</a>. </p>
<p>In addition, as a particularly forward-thinking incubator that has funded companies from around the world across domains for over a decade, I felt they provided a representative sample of the market with which to conduct my analyses. That being said, take what I say wit a grain of salt, as I didn’t analyze super-large tech companies.</p>
<p>I scraped the homepage URLs of every YC company since 2012, producing an initial pool of ~1400 companies. </p>
<p>Why stop at 2012? Well, 2012 was the year that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet">AlexNet</a> won the ImageNet competition, effectively kickstarting the machine learning and data-modelling wave we are now living through. It’s fair to say that this birthed some of the earliest generations of data-first companies.</p>
<p>From this initial pool, I performed keyword filtering to reduce the number of relevant companies I would have to look through. In particular, I only considered companies whose websites included at least one of the following terms: AI, CV, NLP, natural language processing, computer vision, artificial intelligence, machine, ML, data. I also disregarded companies whose website links were broken. </p>
<p>Did this generate a ton of false positives? Absolutely! But here I was trying to prioritize high recall as much as possible, recognizing that I would do a more fine-grained manual inspection of the individual websites for relevant roles.</p>
<p>With this reduced pool, I went through every site, found where they were advertising jobs (typically a <em>Careers</em>, <em>Jobs</em>, or <em>We’re Hiring</em> page), and took note of every role that included data, machine learning, NLP, or CV in the title. This gave me a pool of about 70 distinct companies hiring for data roles. </p>
<p>One note here: it’s conceivable that I missed some companies as there were certain websites with very little information (typically those in stealth) that might actually be hiring. In addition, there were companies that didn’t have a formal <em>Careers</em> page but asked that prospective candidates reach out directly via email. </p>
<p>I disregarded both of these types of companies rather than reach out to them, so they are not part of this analysis.</p>
<p>Another thing: the bulk of this research was done towards the final weeks of 2020. Open roles may have changed as companies update their pages periodically. However, I don’t believe this will drastically impact the conclusions drawn. </p>
<h2>What Are Data Practitioners Responsible For?</h2>
<p>Before diving into the results, it’s worth spending some time clarifying what responsibilities each data role is typically responsible for. Here are the four roles we will spend our time looking at with a short description of what they do:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Data scientist</em>: Use various techniques in statistics and machine learning to process and analyse data. Often responsible for building models to probe what can be learned from some data source, though often at a prototype rather than production level. </li>
<li><em>Data engineer</em>: Develops a robust and scalable set of data processing tools/platforms. Must be comfortable with SQL/NoSQL database wrangling and building/maintaining ETL pipelines.</li>
<li><em>Machine Learning (ML) Engineer</em>: Often responsible for both training models and productionizing them. Requires familiarity with some high-level ML framework and also must be comfortable building scalable training, inference, and deployment pipelines for models.</li>
<li><em>Machine Learning (ML) Scientist</em>: Works on cutting-edge research. Typically responsible for exploring new ideas that can be published at academic conferences. Often only needs to prototype new state-of-the-art models before handing off to ML engineers for productionization.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Many Data Roles Are There?</h2>
<p>So what happens when we plot the frequency of each data role that companies are hiring for? The plot looks  like this:</p>
<figure>

<p>What immediately stands out is how many more open <em>data engineer</em> roles there are compared to traditional <em>data scientists</em>. In this case, the raw counts correspond to companies hiring <strong>roughly 55% more</strong> for data engineers than data scientists, and roughly the same number of machine learning engineers as data scientists.</p>
<p>But we can do more. If you look at the titles of the various roles, there seems to be some repetition. </p>
<p>Let’s only provide coarse-grained categorization through role consolidation. In other words, I took roles whose descriptions were roughly equivalent and consolidated them under a single title. </p>
<p>That included the following set of equivalence relations: </p>
<ul>
<li><em>NLP engineer</em> <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mo>≈</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\approx</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> <em>CV engineer</em> <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mo>≈</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\approx</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> <em>ML engineer</em> <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mo>≈</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\approx</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> <em>Deep Learning engineer</em> (while the domains might be different, the responsiblities are roughly the same)</li>

<p>I probably could have lumped <em>ML research engineer</em> into one of the <em>ML scientist</em> or <em>ML engineer</em> bins, but given that it was a bit of a hybrid role, I left it as is. </p>
<p>Overall the consolidation made the differences even more pronounced! There are <strong>~70%</strong> more open <em>data engineer</em> than <em>data scientist</em> positions. In addition, there are <strong>~40%</strong> more open <em>ML engineer</em> than <em>data scientist</em> positions. There are also only <strong>~30%</strong> as many <em>ML scientist</em> as <em>data scientist</em> positions. </p>
<h2>Takeaways</h2>
<p><em>Data engineers</em> are in increasingly high demand compared to other data-driven professions. In a sense, this represents an evolution for the broader field. </p>
<p>When machine learning become hot 🔥 5-8 years ago, companies decided they need people that can make classifiers on data. But then frameworks like <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow</a> and <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> became really good, democratizing the ability to get started with deep learning and machine learning. </p>
<p>This commoditized the data modelling skillset. </p>
<p>Today, the bottleneck in helping companies get machine learning and modelling insights to production center on data problems. </p>
<p>How do you annotate data? How do you process and clean data? How do you move it from A to B? How do you do this every day as quickly as possible?</p>

<p>All that amounts to having good engineering skills. </p>
<p>This may sound boring and unsexy, but old-school software engineering with a bend toward data may be what we really need right now. </p>
<p>For years, we’ve become enamored with the idea of data professionals that breathe life into raw data thanks to cool demos and media hype. After all, when was the last time you saw a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</a> article about an ETL pipeline? </p>
<p>If nothing else, I believe solid engineering is something we don’t emphasize enough in data science job training or educational programs. In addition to learning how to use <em>linear_regression.fit()</em>, learn how to write a unit test too!</p>
<p>So does that mean you shouldn’t study data science? No. </p>
<p>What it means is that competition is going to be tougher. There are going to be fewer positions available for what is looking to be an abundance of newcomers to the market trained to do data science. </p>
<p>There will always be a need for people that can effectively analyze and extract actionable insights from data. But they have to be good. </p>
<p>Downloading a pretrained model off the Tensorflow website on the <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html">Iris dataset</a> probably is no longer enough to get that data science job. </p>
<p>It’s clear, however, with the large number of <em>ML engineer</em> openings that companies often want a hybrid data practitioner: someone that can build and deploy models. Or said more succinctly, someone that can use Tensorflow but can also build it from source.</p>
<p>Another takeaway here is that there just aren’t that many ML research positions. </p>
<p>Machine learning research tends to get its fair share of hype because that’s where all the cutting-edge stuff happens, all the <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">AlphaGo</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/">GPT-3</a> and what-not. </p>

<p>The other day, as I was going through some of my old notes, I stumbled upon something I had written about the console, the terminal and the shell on Unix-like operating systems. I have decided to rewrite these notes in order to share them here on my website. So without further ado we will now stroll down memory lane and take a quick look at the origins of the Unix terminal and shell. And I will also give my advice to new users on Linux or BSD regarding the choice of terminal emulator and shell.</p>

<h2 id="the-terminal-and-the-console">The terminal and the console</h2>

<p>Early computers where huge machines that consisted of multiple cabinets, e.g. one cabinet for the CPU, one or more cabinets for tape drives, one cabinet for each disk drive, one cabinet for a punched card reader and one cabinet for a high speed printer. The image below is a Univac 9400 system from 1967 consisting of several cabinets.</p>

<p>The "console" was the "control console". In the pictures below is a "UNIVAC 1" control console and a "UNIVAC 2" control console.</p>

<p>The word terminal comes from the Latin "terminus", meaning "an end, a limit, boundary line", indicating that it's the terminating end or "terminal" end of a communications process. You will sometimes hear the description "a dumb terminal" when referring to a text-based environment where the computer is <i>just taking input and showing text</i> while the real work happens at the other end, typically in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer">mainframe</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprinter">teleprinter</a> or TTY was the first kind of terminal. Rather than a monitor you would have a literal typewriter in front of you. When you typed on it, you would see the text on a piece of paper and that text would be send to the computer. When the computer replied, you would see the typewriter print on the paper. Some models could also be used to create punched tape for data storage (either from typed input or from data received from a remote source) and to read back such tape for local printing or transmission.</p>

<p>In the picture below is a Teletype 33 ASR Teleprinter. It was introduced in 1963 as an electro-mechanical teleprinter and it was one of the most popular terminals in the communications industry. The ASR stands for <b>A</b>utomatic <b>S</b>end and <b>R</b>eceive. The ASR 33 had a built-in punched tape reader and tape punch which allowed the user to save programs.</p>

<p><img src="https://unixsheikh.com/includes/images/asr33.jpg" alt="33 ASR Teleprinter"><br><span>A Teletype Model 33 ASR teleprinter, usable as a terminal.</span></p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b><br>If you're interested I can highly recommend that you take a look at Charles Baetsen's Hobby Page as he has a wealth of information about the <a href="https://va3ngc.weebly.com/asr-33-documentation.html">Teletype 33 ASR</a> in the form of both user manuals, installations manuals and videos.</p>

<p>In the picture below Ken Thompson (sitting) and Dennis Ritchie (standing) is using a 33 ASR teleprinter connected to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11">PDP-11</a>, the picture is from 1972.</p>

<p><img src="https://unixsheikh.com/includes/images/thompson-ritchie-pdp-11.png" alt="Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie"></p>

<p>Later, as computers became much smaller, it was possible to integrate multiple components into one single unit, with both a video monitor and a keyboard put together inside it, and the "console" now became more or less synonymous to the "terminal". Both the "console" and the "terminal" now referred to the physical video terminal that had replaced both the teleprinter and the old control console.</p>

<p>The video terminal provides a way for the kernel and other processes to send text output on the monitor to the user, and to receive text input from the user via the keyboard.</p>

<p>The VT100 is a video terminal, introduced in August 1978 by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). It was one of the first terminals to support ANSI escape codes for cursor control and other tasks, and added a number of extended codes for special features like controlling the status lights on the keyboard. This led to rapid uptake of the ANSI standard, becoming the de facto standard for terminal emulators.</p>

<p><img src="https://unixsheikh.com/includes/images/dec-vt100.jpg" alt="DEC VT100"><br><span>A DEC VT100</span></p>

<p>The VT220 is an ANSI standard video terminal introduced by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in November 1983. The VT240 added monochrome vector graphics support to the base model, while the VT241 did the same in color. The 200 series replaced the VT100 series. Among its major upgrades was a number of international character sets, as well as the ability to define new character sets, and a much lighter keyboard.</p>

<p>Today, in the software world, "console" and "terminal" has become completely synonymous.</p>

<h3 id="the-virtual-terminal">The virtual terminal</h3>

<p>A virtual terminal or virtual console is a program that simulates a physical terminal. For example, both the Linux kernel and BSD kernels support virtual terminals - terminals that are logically separate, but which access the same physical keyboard and monitor.</p>

<p>The virtual terminal gives the impression that several independent terminals are running concurrently. Each virtual terminal can be logged in with a different user and it can run its own shell and have its own font settings. The virtual terminals each use a device <code>/dev/ttyX</code>, and you can switch between them by pressing <code>Alt+FX</code> (where <code>X</code> is equal to the virtual terminal number, beginning with 1).</p>

<h2 id="the-terminal-emulator">The terminal emulator</h2>

<p>Emulation refers to the ability of a computer program to emulate, i.e. imitate, another program or device. A terminal emulator is a computer program that emulates a physical terminal within some other display architecture, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">X Window System</a>.</p>

<p>Many different terminal emulators have been developed that emulate terminals such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT52">VT52</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100">VT100</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT220">VT220</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT320">VT320</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_3270">IBM 3270/8/9/E</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_5250">IBM 5250</a>, and many others.</p>

<p>The terminal emulator takes the input you type at the keyboard and convert those to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> characters which it sends to the shell, or to a program running under the shell (more about the shell later). The terminal emulator also takes the stream of output characters from the various programs you run via the shell and displays them on the monitor.</p>

<p>The purpose of the terminal emulator is to allow access to the command line while working in a graphical user interface, such as the X Window System. Since the shell is "expecting" to interface with a human through a terminal, and we don't use a physical terminal while in a graphical environment, we need the terminal emulator.</p>

<p>You can see what terminal types are available on most Linux distributions by running <code>ls /lib/terminfo/*</code> (the path may be different on your system). On OpenBSD it's <code>ls /usr/share/terminfo/*</code></p>

<h4 id="xterm">xterm</h4>

<p><a href="https://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm.html">xterm</a> was originally written as a stand-alone terminal emulator for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAXstation#VAXstation_100">VAXStation 100 </a> (VS100) by Mark Vandevoorde, a student of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Gettys">Jim Gettys</a>, who worked at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation">DEC's</a> Cambridge Research Laboratory. It became clear that xterm would be more useful as part of X Window System than as a standalone program, so it was retargeted to the X Window System.</p>

<p>The xterm program is the default terminal emulator for the X Window System. It provides DEC VT102/VT220 features and other selected features from higher-level terminals such as VT320, VT420 and VT520. It also provides Tektronix 4014 emulation for programs that cannot use the window system directly. If the underlying operating system supports terminal resizing (for example, the SIGWINCH signal in systems derived from 4.3bsd), xterm will use the facilities to notify programs running in the window whenever it is resized.</p>

<p>Around 1996 the main line of development shifted to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XFree86">XFree86</a> implementation of the X Window System and xterm is now maintained by Thomas Dickey, who is also the current lead developer of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_%28web_browser%29">Lynx</a>, a popular customizable text-based web browser.</p>

<p>Early versions of xterm emulated the VT102 and Tektronix 4014. Later versions added control sequences for DEC and other terminals such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>VT220: Added in patch 24.</li>
    <li>VT320: Added in patch 24.</li>
    <li>VT420: DECSTR (soft terminal reset) was added in patch 34.</li>
    <li>VT520: Although not officially emulated, parts of VT520 features were implemented. Controls DECSMBV and DECSWBV for setting the margin- and warning-bell volume was added in patch 254.</li>
</ul>

<p>As with most X applications, xterm can be customized via global X resources files (e.g. <code>/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm</code>), per-user resource files (e.g. <code>~/.Xresources</code>), or command-line arguments. Most of the command-line options correspond to resource settings, as noted in the <a href="https://man.archlinux.org/man/extra/xterm/xterm.1.en">xterm manual page</a>.</p>

<p>While the name of the program is xterm, the X resource class in <code>~/.Xresources</code> is <code>XTerm</code>, e.g.:</p>

<pre>XTerm*utf8: 1</pre>

<p>The <a href="https://man.archlinux.org/man/extra/xterm/xterm.1.en">xterm manual page</a> provides a full list of features and options.</p>

<p>xterm is still being actively developed, it works really great across many different systems, it has extremely low input latency, it has many hidden gems and it is my favorite terminal emulator! For that reason I'm going to share some settings you can use in your <code>~/.Xresources</code> file:</p>

<pre>XTerm*faceName: "DejaVu Sans Mono"
XTerm*faceSize: 12
XTerm*renderFont: true

<p>Several years ago, I lived at the Zen Center of New York City, a Zen temple focused on supporting lay practitioners (folks who practice but also have jobs, families, and so on). Living at a Zen center is inherently intensive. You follow the temple schedule—morning and evening meditation, work and meals together, and regular meditation retreats—as well as managing your other responsibilities. Yet, there’s an ease to practicing meditation in such a place. You don’t have to expend mental energy to get yourself to practice because everything about places like ZCNYC supports your practice. Your schedule is clear. Even if you sleep in (🙋), someone will come to get you to join in the meditation hall (😅). Your life <em>systematically</em> supports your practice.</p>
<p>When I moved to California for my Ph.D., I had a hard time with my practice. I didn’t lack interest or motivation: I knew from direct experience that it was necessary. But now, without the structure of the Zen center, <em>I</em> was responsible for making it happen. After months of struggling with sitting<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> every day, I decided enough was enough. I made a vow: I was going to sit every day, first thing, for the rest of my life. I didn’t commit to a certain amount of hours or any other requirement. I just focused on consistency.</p>
<p>Making a vow to sit every day completely changed my experience. Why? The answer was clear to me almost immediately: the debate in my head was gone. There was no more “should I sit?”, no more “how long?” or “when?”. I didn’t worry about it, because it was a solved problem: I sit every day, first thing—nothing to think about. Even though spending <em>more</em> time practicing was valuable to me, I didn’t focus on that. I focused on the system that got me on the cushion. Because my practice is important to me, spending more time doing it bloomed naturally from a consistent habit; if I just got on the cushion every day, that was enough.</p>
<p>I recently read <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits"><em>Atomic Habits</em> by James Clear</a>, which I quite liked (<a href="https://kislayverma.com/books/book-review-atomic-habits/">here’s a summary</a>). Many books on productivity amount to one or two useful blog posts wrapped in 200 pages of gimmicky marketing, but I found this book readable and practical, supported by research. When I read the book, I realized: oh, what I did with my practice was an atomic habit. I focused on small, consistent actions that build on their own. I ingrained them in my life so that I did not need to think about it. I <em>became</em> a person who gets on the cushion every day.</p>
<div id="data-science-as-an-atomic-habit">

<p>In Clear’s view, the most important habits are small and consistent, whose benefits slowly build and compound over time, much like my commitment to sit every day. Where we get tripped up is this second part, and this especially true in learning data science. We <em>think</em> our abilities should grow linearly to our effort, but that is not so. My experience learning R and other data science tools followed this type of non-intuitive path: I had an expectation of what my progress should be that turned out to be quite different from what actually happened. When you’re learning R or python, for instance, you may find yourself wondering why, if you’re coding or studying every day, you still feel like the language doesn’t <em>get</em> you. Clear uses a diagram to show this, but since this is a data science post, we might as well draw it in R:</p>
<pre><code>library(ggplot2)
inner_thoughts &lt;- tibble::tribble(
  ~x,  ~y,    ~label,
  0,   800,   "Cool!",
  0.9, 800,   "...?",
  1.8, 1400,  "object... of\ntype... closure?",
  3.9, 900,   "Ugghhhh",
  5.3, 1200,  "Ugghhhhhh",
  6.7, 2500,  "Oh wait",
  7.7, 4000,  "...!!",
  8.5, 8000,  "!!!!!",
  7.9, 20000, "Oh sure, it's easy"
)

ggplot() + 
  geom_function(fun = exp, size = 1.2, color = "firebrick") + 
  geom_text(data = inner_thoughts, aes(x, y, label = label), hjust = 0) +
  xlim(0, 10) + 
  ggtitle("Mastering a programming language") + 
  theme_void(24)</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/4e6574a4bf8b405234b074df4c5784d1b278afae/e3e2b/post/2021-01-04-data-science-as-an-atomic-habit/index.en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="672"></p>
<p>This is the stubbornly quiet path of practice: our abilities lag behind our effort. At the “Ugghhhh” stage, our internal motivation starts to dissolve. Sure, you can make a plot or whatever, but you’re still fighting errors all day. What do you have to show for it at this point? Not that much more, you might feel, than when you started. But our growth is rarely linear: often, it’s explosive, at least at critical moments <a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. We suddenly begin to make connections, which help us build other relationships, and so on. Growth is never infinite (bad news: even if you manage to improve every day, you’ll die eventually), but it’s also rarely as linked to our <em>immediate</em> efforts as we expect.</p>
</div>
<div id="practice-and-becoming-are-one-action">

<p>With a meaningful habit—like learning data science—part of the issue is that we’re focused on the results as if our (not) being a data scientist is equal to how many errors our code makes. But that’s not quite right. If you’re learning to run, for instance, you aren’t becoming a person who runs for 30 minutes. You’re becoming a <em>runner</em>. That transformation is more profound, more challenging, and more bountiful. Running 30 minutes is just a useful strategy to engage with that transformation. When you’re sitting down with code and data, you’re not becoming a person who types R code without errors<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. <a href="https://jamesclear.com/identity-based-habits">You’re <em>becoming</em> a data scientist</a>. Becoming—birth—is a slow, sometimes painful, but ultimately astounding process. In Zen, we say, “don’t put a head on top of your own.” Don’t confuse the results with what’s really happening.</p>
<p>One of the better Hadley Wickham gifs is this one, <a href="http://datascience.la/hadley-wickhams-dplyr-tutorial-at-user-2014-part-1/">where he’s warning R learners</a> that, well, you’re going to suck at R for a while:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">…and that was the last time I ever asked Hadley for a pep talk. <a href="https://t.co/w0ThvrqqDs">pic.twitter.com/w0ThvrqqDs</a></p>— Mara Averick (@dataandme) <a href="https://twitter.com/dataandme/status/1022233480497954817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 25, 2018</a></blockquote>


<p>The fuller quote is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whenever you’re learning a new tool, for a long time, you’re going to suck… But the good news is that is typical; that’s something that happens to everyone, and it’s only temporary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve always liked this because you <em>should</em> prepare yourself for not being a master programmer for a while; it is an inherent part of the process and mostly unavoidable. However, I also think it’s good to recognize that your learning and effort are not going to waste. <em>Becoming</em> a data scientist merely lags behind the effort we put in to <em>practicing</em> data science. Practice and becoming are one process, one action, but we often don’t see how they’re connected. What’s happening underneath the surface of our effort is quiet—right until it rises with a fury.</p>
</div>

<div id="tracking">

<p>It helps if you track your habit to make sure you <em>are</em> showing up. One nice feature of GitHub is that it shows your commit history in a heatmap; if you commit, it’s green, and if not, it’s gray. If your habit is to make a commit every day, don’t leave any gray squares.</p>
<p><img src="https://malco.io/2021/01/04/data-science-as-an-atomic-habit/img/gitmap.png" width="742"></p>
<p>GitHub’s heatmap is very similar to a popular productivity technique: <a href="https://lifehacker.com/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret-281626">The Seinfeld Chain</a>. Jerry Seinfeld committed to writing a joke every day. He had a big, daily calendar, and he crossed off a day in red marker every time he wrote. You build up a chain of red Xs. Quoth Jerry: “Don’t break the chain.”</p>
<p>Several apps are good for this. I use <a href="https://www.thehabithub.com/">HabitHub</a>. I used to draw out 365 squares in my gridded Moleskine notebook and cross them off manually.</p>
<p>Right now, I track five habits on HabitHub. I slowly added them, focusing on one at a time, until they felt secure, then I add another. I also made modifications to them over time as my needs for this support changed. Some habits became so automatic that I didn’t need to track them anymore, while others benefited from creating a new, closely-related habit to stack on the one that had become stable.</p>
</div>
<div id="trust-yourself">

<p>Ultimately, what you’re cultivating here is consistency and patience with the process. We often conflate patience with grit. Patience, however, is not endurance; patience is trust. It is, in particular, trust in yourself. That’s good news because, while keeping your nose to the grindstone is useful, it’s not sustainable. Eventually, you run out of nose. Instead, apply your grit to where it’s most beneficial: consistency and trust. Get to the keyboard every day; make that commit every day; show up. While you’re doing that, choose to see your victories. Cultivate trust in yourself by witnessing yourself <em>for who you are</em>: someone who is capable of what you’ve set out to do. Witness the evidence of your abilities—perhaps small and simple at first. Then witness them bloom.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><img alt="Workaholism Leads to Mental and Physical Health Problems: Work Addiction Risk Depends on Occupation" src="https://www.hse.ru/data/2021/01/13/1347222870/iStock-1180554582.jpg" title="Workaholism Leads to Mental and Physical Health Problems: Work Addiction Risk Depends on Occupation"></p></div><div><p>Workaholism or work addiction risk is a growing public health concern that can lead to many negative mental and physical health outcomes such as depression, anxiety or sleep disorder. Perception of work (job demands and job control) may become a major cause of employees’ work addiction. The international group of researchers including the HSE University scientist explored the link between work addiction risk and health-related outcomes using the framework of Job Demand Control Model. The results were published in the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7593928/" rel="nofollow"><em>International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</em></a>.</p>  <p>Workaholics are people who usually work seven and more hours more than others per week. There are potential reasons for that: financial problems, poor marriage or pressure by their organization or supervisor. What can differentiate a workaholic behaviour from similar behaviour like work engagement? Workaholism is also known as a behavioural disorder, which means the excessive involvement of the individual in work when an employer doesn’t require or expect it.</p> </div>








    
    
        <p>The scientists aimed to demonstrate the extent to which the work addiction risk is associated with the perception of work (job demands and job control), and mental health in four job categories suggested by Karasek’s model or Job Demand-Control-Support model (JDCS). The JDCS model assumes four various work environments (four quadrants) in which workers may experience a different level of job demands and job control: passive, low-strain, active, and tense/job-strain. Job control is the extent to which an employee feels control over doing work.</p>


<div><ul>  <li>Passive” jobs (low job control, low job demands) might be satisfying to a worker as long as the workers reach the set goal.</li>  <li>Low strain” jobs have high job control and low job demands. Individuals in this category are not particularly at risk of mental health problems, and it corresponds typically to creative jobs such as architects.</li>  <li>Active” workers have high job demands and high job control. They are highly skilled professionals with responsibilities, such as heads or directors of companies. Those highly skilled workers have very demanding tasks but they have high levels of decision latitude to solve problems.</li>  <li>Finally, workers at risk of stress-related disorders are those within the “job strain” group (high demand and low control). For example, healthcare workers from emergency departments are typically in job strain because they cannot control the huge workload.</li> </ul>  <p>The study was conducted in France because it is one of the industrial countries with growing numbers of occupations. The authors of the research collected data from 187 out of 1580 (11.8%) French workers who agreed to participate in a cross-sectional study using the WittyFit software online platform. The self-administered questionnaires were the Job Content Questionnaire by Karasek, the Work Addiction Risk Test, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale and socio-demographics. The authors of this study divided all the participants based on their occupational groups and investigated the link between work addiction risk and mental and physical health outcomes.</p> </div>

Assistant&nbsp;Professor at the HSE&nbsp;<a href="https://ioe.hse.ru/en/">Institute of Education</a></h4>

<p>‘One of the novelties of this research was to introduce vulnerable occupational groups to organizations or job holders. For example, if we find that work addiction risk can be found more in some occupations and may result in negative outcomes for the health situation then we can give this information to decision makers in this organization or, for example, to the ministry of health. And they could intervene to prevent this problem.’</p>

            
        </div>


<div><p>The results show that high job demands at work are strongly associated with work addiction risk but the job control level does not play the same role. The prevalence of work addiction risk is higher for active and high-strain workers than for passive and low-strain workers. These two groups of workers appeared to be more vulnerable and therefore can suffer more from the negative outcomes of work addiction risk, in terms of depression, sleep disorder, stress and other health issues.</p>  <p>‘We found that job demands could be the most important factor that can develop work addiction risk. So this factor should be controlled or should be investigated by the organization's manager, for example, HR staff, psychologists. Also another conclusion could be the job climate like job demands of each job category can influence the rate of work addiction risk. Thus in this study we actually focused on external factors like job demands not internal factors like the personal characteristics,’ adds Morteza Charkhabi.</p>  <p>The researchers found that people with higher work addiction risk compared to people with low work addiction risk have twice the risk of developing depression. Sleep quality was lower to workers with high risk of work addiction compared to workers with low risk of work addiction. Also women had almost twice the work addiction risk than men.</p> </div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At work I contribute to a moderately-sized monorepo at 70 thousand files,
8-digit lines of code and hundreds of PRs merged every day. One day I
opened a remote buffer at that repository and ran <code>M-x find-file</code>.</p><p><code>find-file</code> is an interactive function that shows a narrowed list
of files in the current directory, prompts the user to filter and scroll
through candidates, and for a file to open.</p><p>Emacs froze for <em>5 seconds</em> before showing me the <code>find-file</code> prompt. Which
isn’t great, because when writing software, opening files is actually
something one needs to do all the time.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/find_file_linux.png"></figure><p>Luckily, Emacs is “the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time
display editor”, and comes with profiling capabilities: <code>M-x profiler-start</code>
starts a profile and <code>M-x profiler-report</code> displays a call tree showing how
much CPU cycles are spent in each function call after starting the profile.
Starting a profile and running <code>M-x find-file</code> showed that all time was being
spent in a function called <code>ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code>, which was being
called by <code>file-name-at-point-functions</code>, an <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html%5Fnode/emacs/Hooks.html#:~:text=A%20few%20hooks%20are%20abnormal,are%20used%20in%20some%20way.">abnormal hook</a> run when <code>find-file</code>
is called.</p><p>If you're familiar with Vim you can think of Emacs <i>hooks</i> as
Vim <i>autocommands</i>, only with much better ergonomics.</p><p>I checked the documentation for <code>ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code> with <code>M-x describe-function ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code> and it didn’t seem
to be something essential, so I removed the hook by running <code>M-x eval-expression</code>, writing the form below, and pressing <code>RET</code>.</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">(<span>remove-hook</span> <span>'file-name-at-point-functions</span> <span>'ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</span>)
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>This solved the immediate problem of Emacs blocking for 5 seconds every
time I ran <code>find-file</code>, with no noticeable drawbacks.</p><div><p>As I write this I attempt to reproduce the issue by re-adding
<code>ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code>
to
<code>file-name-at-point-functions</code>.
I can't reproduce it anymore. The initial issue might have been</p><ul><li>caused by having manually mutated the Emacs environment via ad-hoc code
evaluation (drifting from the state defined in configuration)</li><li>caused by settings or packages that aren't in my configuration anymore</li><li>fixed by settings or packages that were recently added to my
configuration</li><li>fixed by some recent package upgrade</li></ul><p>Or some combination of the above. I have no idea exactly what.
Which is to say: maintaining Emacs configurations is complicated.</p></div><p>I could now navigate around and open files. The next thing I tried in this
remote git repository was searching through project files. The great
<em>projectile</em> package provides the <code>projectile-find-file</code> function for that,
but I had previously given up making projectile perform well with remote
buffers; given how things are currently implemented it seems to be
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=projectile+tramp">impractical</a>. So I installed the <em>find-file-in-project</em> package for use on
remote projects exclusively: <code>M-x package-install find-file-in-project</code>.</p><p>Most Emacs commands are accessible via key combinations, with defaults
that can be customized to be anything you want. I'll stick to referencing
command names themselves instead of their default keybindings.</p><p>Both <code>projectile-find-file</code> and <code>find-file-in-project</code> (aliased as <code>ffip</code>):</p><ul><li>show a narrowed list of all project files in the minibuffer</li><li>prompt the user to filter and scroll through candidates</li><li>open a file when <code>RET</code> is pressed on a candidate.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/projectile_find_file_linux.png"></figure><p>To disable projectile on remote buffers I had the following form in my
configuration.</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">(<span>defadvice</span> <span>projectile-project-root</span> (<span>around</span> <span>ignore-remote</span> <span>first</span> <span>activate</span>)
  (<span>unless</span> (<span>file-remote-p</span> <span>default-directory</span> <span>'no-identification</span>) <span>ad-do-it</span>))
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>Which causes the <code>projectile-project-root</code> function to not run its usual
implementation on remote buffers, but instead return <code>nil</code> unconditionally.
<code>projectile-project-root</code> is used as a way to either get the project root for
a given buffer (remote or not), or as a boolean predicate to test if the
buffer is in a project (e.g., a git repository directory). Having it return
<code>nil</code> on remote buffers effectively disables projectile on remote buffers.</p><p>Emacs
<i><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Advising-Functions.html">advices</a></i> are a way of modifying the behavior of existing functions without
having to redefine them. They serve a similar purpose as hooks, but are
more flexible.</p><p>I then wrote a function that falls back to <code>ffip</code> when projectile is
disabled and bound it to the keybinding I had for <code>projectile-find-file</code>,
so that I could press the same keybinding whenever I wanted to search for
projects files, and not have to think about whether I’m on a remote buffer
or not:</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1

already tell that Emacs was GCing a lot; enabling this setting makes a

</p> 

<p>
2021, Jan 13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—&nbsp;
11 minute read
</p>
<p>One of my friends recently brought up the idea of consulting for startups. He’s been working in software for almost two decades, and he’s worked for a few well-known startups in the area. He definitely has skills and knowledge that would be valuable for a startup, so he was surprised when I told him <strong>startup consulting is not a good idea.</strong></p>
<p>I’ve thought about this topic a lot. I have worked for early-stage startups, done some startup consulting, and met plenty of startup consultants. A few of them have actually been pretty successful.</p>
<p>That said, I steer consultants away from startups when they ask, and in this post, I’ll explain why. I love working with startups, so please don’t read this as a knock against them. As you’ll see, they’re just an objectively poor target market for consultants.</p>
<p><em>Learning more about startups? I’ve compiled a list of <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/startup-books">my favorite books for founders here</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="what-is-startup-consulting">What is Startup Consulting?</h2>
<p>First off, when I say “consultant,” I’m not talking about freelancers or contract hires. Those two categories of employees are essentially tax shelters for small companies that can’t afford full-time people yet, and their work is typically very execution-focused.</p>
<p>I’m also not talking about advisors, mentors, or coaches. People in these roles are typically more focused on asking questions or serving as a sounding board. If you’re an experienced entrepreneur coaching a new founder, that’s great. I have several mentors, and they’re invaluable, but they don’t make a living from helping people like me.</p>
<p>A startup consultant is someone whose business is to come into a small company, ask some questions, analyze the data, prepare a report, and make recommendations based on their findings. They don’t execute tasks or manage team members directly (although there are exceptions) but focus instead on high-level strategy.</p>
<p>Startup consultants aren’t typically involved for the long-term (and are almost never offered equity), but the good ones might provide some follow-through to see how their recommendations pan out. They might also offer a retainer to answer questions about their recommendations as they come up, but they usually aren’t part of the day-to-day.</p>
<h3 id="why-do-people-start-consulting-for-startups">Why Do People Start Consulting for Startups?</h3>
<p><strong>The most lucrative piece of the consulting market is focused on Fortune 500 companies.</strong> That’s where giants like <a href="https://www.consultancy.uk/news/14018/the-10-largest-consulting-firms-in-the-world">PwC, Deloitte, E&amp;Y, KPMG, McKinsey, and BCG</a> all play, but for one-person consulting shops or small agencies, it’s pretty hard to land one of these customers.</p>
<p>So, many new consultants set their sites on startups. Some figure they can take their experience from a larger company (or, god forbid, <a href="https://www.cleverism.com/why-you-should-not-hire-mbas-for-startup/">an MBA</a>) to help early-stage startups “grow up.” Others trade on a former employer’s success (i.e., people who put “Formerly Google/Apple/Facebook/etc.” in their Linkedin bios), using name recognition to attract startups that like having a name brand behind their consultants.</p>
<p>These hopeful new consultants hang up their shingles, offering something vague like “Proven Growth Strategies” or “Scalable Product-Led Growth.” If they <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/the-key-to-networking-keeping-in-touch">have a deep personal network</a>, they’ll probably find enough clients to survive for a couple of years, but most of them won’t stick with the startup market long.</p>
<h2 id="the-case-against-startup-consulting">The Case Against Startup Consulting</h2>
<p>While startups can make decisions quickly - <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3006682/not-so-fast-10-hasty-mistakes-startup-founders-make">almost to a fault</a> - they aren’t an easy market to serve. They’re price sensitive, have high expectations, and prone to failure. Let’s dive into each of these points and see how they affect startup consulting.</p>
<h3 id="1-founders-have-unrealistic-expectations">1. Founders Have Unrealistic Expectations</h3>
<p>What consultants offer is squishy, and for big companies, it can be more political than practical:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“CEOs that want or need to make an unpopular decision often bring in a consulting firm to help. This provides ammunition to recommend an unpopular or risky decision to the board. The CEO can also distance herself from an unpopular decision by blaming the consultants.” - <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-value-do-consulting-firms-like-McKinsey-Bain-et-al-really-add-to-an-operation-What-exactly-is-it-that-they-do-that-commands-such-premium-compensation-and-more-importantly-has-created-an-entire-sustainable-and-enduring-industry/answer/Raj-Ramanan">Raj Ramanan, Co-Founder at Loku</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>While large companies hire consultants to validate decisions or reassure institutional investors, startups hope you will solve their deepest, darkest problems.</strong> Your recommendation isn’t just a handy report for investors - they’re going to stake the future of their business on it.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YkVXgqm.png" alt="Large company vs. startup consulting"></p>
<p>While you will certainly send the startup off with the strategy document you promised, anyone who has worked with a startup knows that <strong>things change too fast for a static recommendation like this to make any difference</strong>. They’re going to need you to come back and revise the strategy as they learn new things. Unfortunately, you probably didn’t build that into the price, so now you’re annoyed that they won’t just follow your original plan, and they’re annoyed that they spent $20k for an outdated document.</p>
<h3 id="2-price-sensitivity">2. Price Sensitivity</h3>
<p>As a consultant, it would seem that the obvious solution to the first problem is to simply <em>charge the startup more for ongoing help</em>. The problem is that <strong>startups must be frugal to survive</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“People who are cheap are much more likely to succeed. And not just because their money lasts longer; a frugal attitude seems to correlate with success.” - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=189830">Paul Graham, Y Combinator</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most funded startups are trading on borrowed time and get 12-18 months of runway per fundraise. Bootstrapped startups aren’t any better because the founders tend to be sacrificing more out of pocket to keep the lights on.</p>
<p>While large companies get budgets earmarked for hiring consultants or completing specific projects, small startups usually have to run all major expenditures by the founder. I’ve known founders who won’t let division heads charge so much as $100 to the company card without clearance from the CEO.</p>
<p>So while you look at your $200 per hour price tag as a bargain for startups (McKinsey is charging <a href="https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/revealed-mckinsey-partners-charge-16-000-a-day-before-discounts-20190808-p52f2a">$16k per day, after all</a>), they see it as a significant line item on a razor-thin budget. Misalignment like this is bound to lead to disappointment on one side or the other.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/pP8Astj.png" alt="Price sensitivity in startups"></p>
<h3 id="3-startups-need-more-hands-not-brains">3. Startups Need More Hands Not Brains</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“In truth, startups rarely need new ideas — they already have more than they know what to do with. So adding yet more ideas to the backlog is stressful, especially without the resources to execute them.” - <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/why-startups-hate-consultants-5b245ec275d3">Dave Bailey, CEO Coach</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I recently met with a startup that hired a very senior person from a big tech firm. He loved having a big title, but when the time came to build the product, he was unwilling to roll up his sleeves and write any code.</p>
<p><strong>“I’m the CTO who drives the Ferrari, not the Toyota,”</strong> he said.</p>
<p>In the first few years, startup founders spend at least 80% of their time on low-level, hands-on drudgery: sales calls, product development, social media management, writing email campaigns, hiring key people, setting up payroll/books/insurance/etc…It’s not glamorous work, but it needs to get done.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WTxowB5.png" alt="Startup founders and grunt work"></p>
<p>So, it’s tough for a startup to justify bringing on a consultant who <em>only</em> offers high-level strategy at an hourly rate many times higher than their early employees.</p>
<p>Most startup founders who have cleared the first couple of bars by doing some fundraising and making some sales are pretty smart people. They don’t need a consultant who’s never been in their shoes to tell them how to run their business; they need humble people who can get their hands dirty and make shit happen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Consultants had a very topical view of our business, did not sit with us every day, and did not have the same passion and zeal for our company that we as founders naturally had. After three months, we stopped using them and learned a very important lesson.” - <a href="https://www.startups.com/library/expert-advice/should-you-hire-startup-consultants">Gray Skinner, CEO at Droplr</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if you restrict your work to startups within a single industry or market, as a consultant, you’re never going to be as “bought-in” as the founders. So, when you come in and make a recommendation that flies counter to what the founder believes, they can simply write it off. “She must not see what we see.”</p>
<p>Whether the founder is right or wrong doesn’t matter. What matters is their perception that outside consultants are never going to be as dedicated or see the vision that they do.</p>
<p>You might be able to filter startups out if they’re especially hostile to consultants, but it’s usually hard to tell what their attitude will be until you start to make recommendations to them.</p>
<h3 id="5-the-expert-problem">5. The “Expert” Problem</h3>
<p>Most consultants consider themselves experts in some specific field. That’s great, but as I’ve pointed out in the past, <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/experts">experts fall prey to the same biases that the rest of us do</a>.</p>
<p>For one thing, many consultants tend to overgeneralize their experience. If you’ve been in marketing at a few startups, you might think you know everything there is to know about startup marketing. Even if you don’t project this hubris publicly, it affects the way you make decisions and closes you off to new inputs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We love anecdotes so much because it’s often much easier for people to believe someone’s testimony as opposed to understanding complex data and variation across a continuum. Anecdotes exempt us from having to prove our point: it’s happened once; that’s solid proof as far as I’m concerned.” - <a href="https://manuel.friger.io/blog/advice">Manuel Frigerio</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This overgeneralization problem seems especially toxic in startup consulting because what worked in <a href="">cutting-edge startups</a> five years ago won’t necessarily work today.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The solution the firm comes up involves a high tech presentation and even higher tech case studies, but when it comes to the true substance of the steps they recommend, it may as well be 1982.” - <a href="https://www.inc.com/michael-schein/how-consultants-kill-business.html">Michael Schein, CEO at Microfame Media</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="6-founders-need-to-learn-for-themselves">6. Founders Need to Learn for Themselves</h3>
<p>I recently saw a consultant who would sit down with a founder in <em>any industry</em> for an hour and tell them which marketing channels they should use.</p>
<p>I am skeptical that this will work. A startup’s early successful marketing channels will be based on which avenues the founder is most familiar with and where their target market hangs out. You can tell a founder to “just use Instagram ads,” but if they’ve never run an Instagram …</p></div></article></section></div>

<p>Open Source Security, Inc is proud to announce its funding of a full-time and 
public development effort of a <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a> front-end for <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>.
In this blog post, we'll detail the motivations for our involvement and the benefits the public will reap
as a result of this effort.</p>

<h2>A Security Need</h2>

<p>In July of last year, shortly after my virtual <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Kza6fdkSU">presentation</a> at the Linux Security Summit 
North America entitled <a href="https://grsecurity.net/10_years_of_linux_security.pdf">"10 Years of Linux Security - A Report Card"</a>, we put out a 
<a href="https://twitter.com/spendergrsec/status/1283005179135221761">call</a> to other 
companies interested in funding a GCC front-end for Rust.

The motivation for this arose
from outreach from Nick Desaulniers of Google on <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAKwvOdmuYc8rW_H4aQG4DsJzho=F+djd68fp7mzmBp3-wY--Uw@mail.gmail.com/T/">LKML</a> 
to discuss the possibility of Rust support in the Linux kernel at the upcoming Linux 
Plumbers Conference.  One obvious hurdle mentioned immediately was that the kernel is most 
commonly compiled with GCC, while Rust currently requires rustc/LLVM.  According to reports of
the resulting discussion, kernel 
developers were open to the idea of allowing the kernel to be built with GCC and the Rust 
portions with LLVM, as long as the two were ABI compatible.</p>

<p>Such discussions appeared to sidestep a more fundamental issue however: the security 
viability of a mixed assembly/C/Rust execution environment and how cohesive security 
functionality could be provided while mixing different compilers with different 
implementations/availability of said functionality.  The importance of this topic, though apparent 
on reflection, was formalized just recently in a paper by Michalis Papaevripides and Elias 
Athanasopoulos of the University of Cyprus entitled <a href="https://www.cs.ucy.ac.cy/~eliasathan/papers/tops20.pdf">"Exploiting Mixed 
Binaries"</a>.  In it, they detail how the overall security of an execution 
environment can be reduced by the introduction of code written in Rust or that of another 
language where the same binary-level security is not provided by the compiler.  An excerpt from page 3 of the paper makes the impact clear:</p>

<blockquote>
"We experimentally show that CFI can be bypassed using Rust/Go code for developing clearly 
more straight-forward exploits than current state-of-the-art CFI bypasses [57, 70]. Our 
exploits do not rely on respecting the statically computed Control-flow Graph (CFG) for 
bypassing the enforced CFI and are much simpler to implement. [ ... ]
Again, we stress here that in the absence of the safe part (Rust/Go code), the unsafe part 
cannot be trivially exploited."
</blockquote>

<p>
The same exact scenario above was one of the motivations for Microsoft to recently push for their
<a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/08/17/control-flow-guard-for-clang-llvm-and-rust/">Control Flow Guard (CFG) support</a>
in Clang and Rust (see the heading of "Rust linked with C/C++").
</p>

<p>As the source of the GCC plugin infrastructure in the Linux kernel and nearly all of the GCC plugins adapted
for inclusion in the upstream Linux kernel, we too immediately spotted the importance of this problem and set out
to ensure both those plugins as well as the security features built-in to GCC itself are able to instrument code
from all languages supported by the Linux kernel with compatible and consistent security properties.</p>

<h2>Funding Process</h2>

<p>So despite not expecting Rust code to land in the Linux kernel in the near future, we reached out to other 
companies as mentioned above to pull together funding for the GCC front-end effort.  None of the leads 
came to fruition, so we as a company decided to bootstrap the process, in the hopes that as progress in the work
is observed, others would join in.  Further, we wanted to offer funding under the same terms we would want as developers, 
across the entire spectrum: stability, salary, benefits, ownership, etc -- not token compensation or bounties 
that treat those working on free/open source software for the public as somehow <em>less</em> than 
developers of proprietary code.  To that end, we decided to fund the first year of a full-time
developer for the work ourselves.</p>

<p>If the failed experiment of the Core Infrastructure Initiative (<a href="https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/">CII</a>) taught us anything, it's that
one finds dedicated and competent developers for some work not among whoever happens to apply, but 
among those already involved in the work as a passion project.  This led us to reach out 
to <a href="https://thephilbert.io/">Philip Herron</a>, who we noticed was <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs">already working</a> on a GCC front-end for Rust with involvement
of external contributors.  We were extremely pleased to hear Philip was interested in performing the work 
full-time.</p>

<p>News of our outreach eventually extended to the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/steering.html">GCC Steering 
Committee</a>, who contacted us to coordinate efforts.  They were very helpful in recommending to us <a href="https://www.embecosm.com/">Embecosm</a>, a UK-based company with deep experience and involvement in 
GCC/LLVM development, among many other areas.  Embecosm graciously offered to contribute to the effort by 
handling Philip's employment and, at no cost to us, providing project management services to help ensure the project's success.  
The location, expertise, and sharing of our vision of doing right by the developer couldn't have been a 
better match.</p>

<h2>Vendor-Neutral, Developed in the Open</h2>

<p>To make sure the project remains vendor-neutral and in the public interest, Open Source Security, Inc. will not own any of the copyright over the code developed through its funding.
All relevant GCC code for the project is GPLv3-licensed and copyright is assigned, as required for upstream GCC inclusion, to the Free Software Foundation (FSF).  The work is being performed in the open, with Philip providing public monthly status updates on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/Reporting">https://github.com/Rust-GCC/Reporting</a>.  Reports are already available for the months of November and December.
</p>

<h2>Get Involved</h2>

<p>For more information about the "how" of this effort, Embecosm has prepared a 
blog at <a href="https://www.embecosm.com/2021/01/12/gcc-rust-how-it-can-be-achieved/">https://www.embecosm.com/2021/01/12/gcc-rust-how-it-can-be-achieved/</a> that we encourage 
all those interested to read.  To get involved in contributing technical work to the 
effort, Philip can be found on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/the_philbert">@the_philbert</a> or committing to the project's Github repository at <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs">https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs</a>.

    <p>This isn’t a theoretical piece about freedom and digital technologies. This is a real ongoing trend that is at best observed around secure messaging application Signal by Open Whisper Systems and it’s founder Moxie Merlinspike. His view and management of Signal reflects a wider trend that jepordises world’s freedom.</p>
<p>Signal is a secure messaging software that has changed the field a lot. Signal is built upon propriety software Textsecure and RedPhone applications that had been developed by Merlinspike and his co-founder Stuart Anderson. When Twitter acquired Whisper Systems, it releases both software under free software licenses. Merlinspike left Twitter acquired Whisper Systems, founded Open Whisper Systems and merged -once the private property of himself- TextSecure and Redphone into Signal.</p>
<p>Signal is free software. “Free as in freedom”, their client and server code is licenced under GPLv3 and AGPLv3. This makes the code and only the code itself pro-freedom. Just because the code it self free does not necessarily make the coder “free” as well and that is the problem we face today!</p>
<p>Open Whisper Systems led by Moxie Merlinspike, who is behind Signal, is and was never behind freedom. This has been seen in the light of LibreSignal (<a href="https://github.com/LibreSignal/LibreSignal/issues/37#issuecomment-217211165">https://github.com/LibreSignal/LibreSignal/issues/37#issuecomment-217211165</a>) debate where a fork of Signal client is build without unfree dependencies and published on the F-droid free software repository on Android. After much debate about federation, the claimed server resources and freedom, followed by legal trademark threats Libresignal has been removed from F-droid and so was anybody’s chance of using Signal as a secure messenger who doesn’t use Google services. <a href="https://wire.com/en/blog/axolotl-proteus-encryption-protocols/">Wire</a> case is just another example.</p>
<p>This approach is not only a threat to free software it is a recurring threat to human kind!</p>
<p>To prove this bold claim one needs to look at one recent blog post from Open Whisper Systems and a presentation made in 36C3 by Merlinspike.</p>
<p><a href="https://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/">Signal’s blog post</a>
<a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/01/02/on-privacy-versus-freedom/">Matrix’s blog Post</a></p>
<p>The main points of his claims can be listed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decentralized systems are harder to build</li>
<li>Decentralized systems are harder to evolve</li>
<li>Decentralized systems are harder to secure</li>
<li>Decentralized systems are becoming concentrated in predominant provider anyways</li>
<li>If users don’t trust their app provider they have the freedom to use something else</li>
</ul>
<p>While his claims are true up to a certain point they are only superficial. Through these points Merlinspike claims that, centralized services are superior in modern times!</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/01/02/on-privacy-versus-freedom/">anyone who is interested in the depth of this debate can start reading Martix’s answer to Merlinspike at the link here</a></p>
<p>It is really unnecessary to explain in depth why this type of thinking is dangerous when a simple change in words can tell more than 1000 page work. Let’s rename the object and compare his digital dystopia with one that has occured several times through-out analog human history and which once again recures today;</p>
<ul>
<li>Democracies are harder to build</li>
<li>Democracies are harder to improve</li>
<li>Democracies are harder to secure</li>
<li>In democracies power is becoming concentrated in predominant hands anyways</li>
<li>If people do not like their democracy provider (country) they have the freedom to leave and go another provider.</li>
</ul>
<p>One doesn’t need to think hard to see what Merlinspike is advising. He claims democracies suck because of the hardships of human organization and proposes autocracy to manage the world in favour of the helpless people occupying it. Why? Because democracies are inefficient and people don’t want that!</p>
<p>If he had given the same statement about democracies and governmental politics as he gave about federative systems it would have provoked outrage! People died for freedom, they are still dying and struggling around the globe. Then someone comes and stomps over every ideal which human society ever build up until this point in history and proclaims themselves the world leader! Think about it!</p>
<p>The example given is bad but why are Merlinspike’s claims about decentralized systems not considered bad as well? Because digital freedom has not yet been lost and won by blood or are we still asleep? Just because code is free, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the coders mind is also free! Freedom is not just a license, it is an ideal in any condition that we must stand for!</p>

    </span></p><p><em>This is a thought exercise to help explore what is okay (and what isn't) when it comes to the exchange between personal information and the provision of a personalised service.</em></p><p>Imagine you've moved to a new city and you're in need of a hairdresser to do your hair every other week. Perhaps you try out one or two different ones first, or perhaps you go with a friend's recommendation. Either way, after a short while you've settled on a hair dresser you're happy with. They're professional, they treat you well, they remember your name and you build up a relationship with them over time.</p><p>As you visit this hairdresser more often, they gain more experience with your specific hair type, your preferred hair style and your preferred hair products. Perhaps the hairdresser, knowing that you have particularly thick hair, and remembering that you dislike the way it curls around your ears when it gets too long, ensures a shorter cut in those areas by default. Or, perhaps remembering that you’re most happy when your hair has a bouncy look to it, they introduce you to a specific type of wax that helps you achieve that type of effect.</p><p>There's a direct relationship here between (1) how much the hairdresser knows about you, and remembers about you, and (2) the quality of the service you receive. The more the hairdresser knows about you, the better the service they can provide. It's convenient to you when you don't have to explain what you want every time you visit. It's valuable to you when your hairdresser knows so much about your hair and your preferences that they're able to suggest things to you you didn't even know you wanted. It can also be nice if they remember the names of your children, or if they ask about that issue you were grappling with at work the last time you stopped by.</p><p>Now imagine it’s time for your regular haircut, so you visit your trusted hairdresser. You sit down in the salon chair, as you've been doing every other week and they tell you they'll be "right with you." As you look into the mirror in front of you, you see them in the reflection walking up to the coat hanger where you've hung up your coat. Having arrived at your coat they start to insert their hand into your coat's pockets one by one. For each pocket they extract its contents (your wallet, your mobile phone, your keys <sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>) and examine each carefully, before placing them back. After having made their way through your entire coat, they return to your chair to finally tend to your needs: "So, what will it be today? The usual?"</p><p>In this real-life scenario most people would, at the very least, be astonished but hopefully also a bit angry. You might want to say: "Hey! What are you doing in my coat?" Now imagine their response being "Oh, that's just a new policy we've introduced which helps us improve our service to you. You see," they continue, "as I was examining the items in your coat, I noticed a car key with an Audi logo. One of my friends happens to be an Audi mechanic. I can put you in touch with him, if you're interested, and they can help you if your car ever breaks down. I also made note of the contacts in your phone, and if one of them ever comes in for a haircut, and I'll be sure to give them a special treatment, on the house." <sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup></p><p>Would this explanation suffice for you? Would it be sufficient justification for rummaging <sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> through your coat? Would it quench the anger you felt above?</p><p>I would hope that to most people this justification sounds silly, perhaps even patronizing and certainly not an adequate justification for rummaging through your belongings. Whether or not the hairdresser's rummaging improves his service to you doesn't matter.</p><p>The only thing that matters here is that your hairdresser has no business rummaging through your fucking coat <sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup>.</p><p>Please remember how this makes you feel. We're going to change some variables in the story and see what happens.</p><p>Let's go back to our imagined scenario. You feel offended that your hairdresser went through your coat and you say: "Hey man, I didn't agree to that!"</p><p>"Oh, I'm sorry" he replies "I didn't mean to offend you. But actually, you did consent to this new policy. You see, there's a sign at the door which says:</p><p><em>‘Anybody that walks through this door consents to their coat being rummaged through for purposes of improving our service to you.'</em></p><p>So by walking through the door, you've actually given your consent." <sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup>.</p><p>Let’s ignore, for the sake of brevity, the issue of whether walking through a door could reasonably constitute giving consent. Imagine instead that you don't catch the hairdresser rummaging through your coat, but instead they tell you their assistant will examine all your belongings while you lie back, close your eyes and have your hair washed by them with lavender shampoo.</p><p>Try to notice within yourself: Do you feel less outrage if you're not witnessing the act of someone rummaging through your coat, but you know it's happening? For me it makes it slightly more difficult to "find" the outrage inside of myself. Since I’m not witnessing the act with my own eyes, I need to first imagine it happening before I'm able to perceive any level of outrage. The outrage is still there, but it's become a bit harder to access. It's become a bit more distant if you will.</p><p>Let's continue to change variables. Let's imagine there's no assistant but the hairdresser has installed a high tech camera in the room which, without touching your coat and within a microsecond, is able to scan your coat and analyze all its contents. In doing so, it is able to extract the same information the hairdresser and their assistant were able to do when they were doing it themselves. Imagine this takes place in a split second and it happened as you sat down.</p><p>Do you feel angry about what just happened? Do you feel less outrage than before now that the violation is invisible to you, instantaneous and done through an inanimate object?</p><p>For me, I feel outrage, but it's become less visceral and more intellectual. It's as if I only feel outrage because I’m able to follow a sequence of logical steps to arrive at the conclusion that the outcomes of the camera scan and the physical rummaging are one and the same. That said, without the image of a person with their hands in my coat (imagined or not), it’s more difficult to feel outraged. It’s also harder to feel outraged when the violation is committed by an inanimate object. For one, I'm not sure who to get angry at, and I somehow feel less violated when it's a machine or an algorithm committing the act.</p><p>Now go one step further and imagine it's not even a high-tech camera doing the scanning, but some unknown technology which you cannot see and do not understand. It’s not located anywhere you can point at, it’s just “there” somewhere in the hairdresser’s salon with you as it scans the contents of your jacket.</p><p>Are you able to find any outrage at all this time? </p><p>I can still find it, but it’s even more difficult to find than before. With the camera at least I had something I could focus my anger on (and could potentially smash). Without any identifiable person or object committing these acts, the act itself seems to slowly lose the property of being something one could potentially object to.</p><p>My outrage seems to require at a minimum a crime and a perpetrator. I struggle to find those here. Only by invoking the analog equivalent from before and by imagining an actual person committing these acts do I feel outrage. But equating this last scenario to the analog equivalent feels slightly awkward; an oversimplification. As a result, the outrage doesn’t transfer fully from one scenario to the other.</p><p>By changing the process through which the information was extracted while keeping the outcome (the extracted data) the same, my outrage circuitry has almost entirely been bypassed. This was achieved by making the scenario more abstract, instantaneous, invisible and by making the actor an inanimate, unidentifiable piece of technology.</p><p>Now, one final step. Imagine we hadn't started with the analog example of the rummaging hairdresser and the emotional memory of how that made you feel. Imagine instead we would have started with the invisible, instantaneous, inanimate technology. Would you have been able to feel any outrage? Any whatsoever? Would you naturally think of coming up with an analog equivalent scenario to gauge your outrage?</p><p>You actually don't need to imagine the last example. If you're currently using WhatsApp, you're living inside of it. The hairdresser represents Facebook and the coat rummaging policy represents their new privacy policy, or Facebook's general conduct for that matter. If you don't feel outrage, then perhaps that's because you haven't imagined the analog equivalent of what's happening yet (which isn't always self-evident, that’s what I’ve tried to help you with here) <sup id="fnref-6"><a href="#fn-6">6</a></sup>.</p><p>The key observation to note here is that the outrage that gets triggered inside of you gets modulated by <em>the manner in which</em> your information gets extracted, not so much <em>if</em> it gets extracted. It's as if robbing someone of $100 would somehow be less outrageous if you did it through the internet rather than snatching it directly from their wallet.</p><p>In a high-tech society, where we’re surrounded by technological abstractions upon abstractions, should we only be relying on our instinctual outrage circuits to be our moral compasses when they can so easily be fooled?</p><p><em>Even though the hairdresser in this story (Facebook / WhatsApp) is rummaging through your coat, there are many reputable hairdressers (messaging services) that do not. My favourite alternative is <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> <sup id="fnref-7"><a href="#fn-7">7</a></sup>, but I've heard good things about <a href="https://threema.ch/">Threema</a> and although I don't get the impression the technology is accessible enough to port my friends and family, I'm supportive of what <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a> is trying to accomplish.</em></p></div></article></div>]]>

Nearly every culture has stories to tell about people who lived for thousands of years, showing that extending lifespan has always been one a deep desire across humanity. While modern medicine does not strive to find the fountain of youth, keen interest in promoting longevity has prompted research into the mechanisms of aging and the possibility of anti-aging drugs. Researchers now know that mitochondria play an important role in aging. Specifically, when mitochondria are harmed in some way and their function is impaired, a process called mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR<sup>mt</sup>) occurs that repairs mitochondria and benefits cell survival. Therefore, some scientists think it is possible to increase lifespan by identifying drugs that activate UPR<sup>mt</sup>.</p><p>Dr. Eriko Kage-Nakadai and her colleagues from Osaka City University in Japan are one of the many research teams fascinated by aging research. As Dr. Kage-Nakadai explains, “<em>Even though aging is not a disease, drugs may slow down aging and mitigate or prevent its negative effects on our health.” </em>Current research shows promising signs. Experiments with <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em>—a worm commonly used in biological research as a model—have found several compounds that increase the worm’s lifespan by triggering UPR<sup>mt</sup>.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Against the backdrop of these previous studies, this team, in their <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10522-020-09907-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new study published in <em>Biogerontology</em></a><em>,</em> screened about 3,000 drugs in worms that are engineered to glow if drug treatment activates <em>hsp-6</em>, a gene that is highly expressed when UPR<sup>mt</sup> occurs. It is interesting to note that of these 3000 drugs, 1300 were off-patent drugs approved by the USFDA, EMA, and other agencies, and the remaining 1700 were unapproved bioactive ones.</p><p>Through this method, Dr. Kage-Nakadai’s team identified metolazone, a drug used to treat heart failure and high blood pressure. They then tested the drug on <em>C. elegans </em>and found that it increased wild-type worm lifespan. Additionally, they found that metolazone did not extend lifespans in worms in whom the genes <em>atfs-1, ubl-5, </em>and <em>nkcc-1</em> were mutated (non-working). The former two genes are known to be essential for UPR<sup>mt</sup> function, suggesting that metolazone is acting on the UPR<sup>mt</sup> pathway. The third gene, <em>nkcc-1</em>, “encodes” a protein that is part of a protein family targeted by metolazone in its usual function as an anti-hypertension drug. The fact that metolazone did not increase the lifespans of <em>nkcc-1</em> mutated <em>C. elegans </em>suggests that the drug may need to block the <em>nkcc-1</em> protein to activate the UPR<sup>mt</sup> pathway. Furthermore, metolazone “induced” <em>hsp-6 </em>(<em>Hspa9</em> in humans) expression in HeLa cells (a human cell line commonly used in biological research), suggesting that the drug’s UPR<sup>mt</sup>-related effects possibly span multiple species.</p></div></div><div><figure><p><img width="438" height="297" src="https://www.impact.science/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/FIGURE_1_OSAKC_3-e1609992340163.jpg" data-src="https://www.impact.science/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/FIGURE_1_OSAKC_3-e1609992340163.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" data-srcset="https://www.impact.science/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/FIGURE_1_OSAKC_3-e1609992340163.jpg 438w, https://www.impact.science/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/FIGURE_1_OSAKC_3-e1609992340163-300x203.jpg 300w" data-sizes="(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px" srcset="https://www.impact.science/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/FIGURE_1_OSAKC_3-e1609992340163.jpg 438w, https://www.impact.science/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/FIGURE_1_OSAKC_3-e1609992340163-300x203.jpg 300w"></p></figure></div><div><p>Scientists found that <em>C. elegans</em> administered metolazone lived longer than those that were not given the drug. This suggests that metolazone, despite being an anti-hypertension drug, can be used in anti-aging research | Image courtesy: Eriko Kage-Nakadai, Osaka City University</p></div><div><div><p>When asked about the broader significance of her work, Dr. Kage-Nakadai comments, <em>“What is particularly exciting is that we tested already available approved drugs here, and we have revealed the potential of repurposing existing drugs for aging control. Worms always give us many hints.”</em></p><p>As the researchers state, this work is just the start, but it opens up a new road to a future of anti-aging drugs. Perhaps a future where humans live longer than the expected 120 years is one step closer to becoming a reality.</p><p><strong>***</strong></p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Reference</strong></p><p>Title of original paper: Metolazone upregulates mitochondrial chaperones and extends lifespan in <em>Caenorhabditis elegans<br>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It started as an outright clone, later evolved on its own, quite interesting way. I’m talking of Weibo.</p>
<p>Weibo started in 2009, and a year later already had 100 million users. Chinese people are very online, and they very much enjoy the sort of casual, easy dopamine release that comes from microblogging. The Japanese are also avid Twitter users, incidentally, while they never had much of a blogosphere. The language also helps: 150 Chinese characters amount to about triple that in English, so you can say quite a lot.</p>
<p>As usual in China, there’s little regulations, and little enforcement of existing regulations, so once Weibo came in it was very free and open. It was the first national forum of public opinion that the Chinese had ever seen. It became huge almost instantly, and of course the most popular part of it was political debate. Everyone and their mother had become a political pundit on Weibo, rather amusingly forgetting they lived in a Communist single-party state. For a couple years people shat on their mayors, their governors, this or that politician, this or that policy, or even the Communist party itself. The American Embassy joined the party with their famous Air Quality reports (at the time air quality in China was really awful and the government refused to release figures), which were promptly retweeted by 300 million boomers with added comments on how much better America was at everything.</p>
<p>Well that situation couldn’t last. China was at the moment undergoing a rather big leadership transition (Xi Jinping assumed power in late 2012), so the massive agitation going on at Weibo went on undeterred. But governments, certainly the Chinese government, might be slow, but once they get moving they’re unrelenting. In 2013 China decided to crack down on free speech on Weibo, and crack down they did. Famous accounts which had been too edgy politically got visits by police, if not outright arrested. Some were jailed, others had to make public proclamations of loyalty to Socialist values. We’re talking of people with tens of millions of followers; China is a big country.</p>
<p>Once the big guys were dealt with pour encourager les autres, the masses were targeted with the beginning stages of what has now become a very sophisticated apparatus of keyword censorship. In Weibo today you just can’t search what you want. If there’s a rumor that Xi Jinping has farted this morning, the word “fart”, “frt”, “f4rt” and all permutations that might come up are all promptly banned from searching at any sizable Chinese social media. That’s step 1: stop the thing from going viral. Step 2 is deleting already existing mentions of the fart. The thing. That takes time but they have an army of censors (which Weibo was forced to hire at their expense) to take care of that. Step 3 is banning you from tweeting about the fart, but that’s a last resort, as it’s the most annoying and harder to implement.</p>
<p>Soon enough Weibo just became unusable. Most people up there were on the platform precisely to shitpost on politics, to be edgy, to shit on the government, to be a viral pundit, retweeted by 50 million people at least once in their lives. The new regulations were so oppressive that most people just left. Not to some other similar platform. There had been some at the beginning but they all lagged off and eventually were killed, and the government wouldn’t allow a new microblogging site. When Weibo was censored people just left, period. They abandoned the public square. They mostly retreated to WeChat, the national instant messaging app. Some didn’t get the message and started being edgy on their public statuses, but most just retreated to private chat groups, where they could be safe from the prying eyes of government. The public square was killed, on purpose, and it never recovered.</p>
<p>Well, not quite. After politics were banned from Weibo, only the most inane stuff was allowed to remain. Mostly celebrities and PR accounts, and the odd clueless boomer. But it’s been years now, so plenty of people who need an easy internet exposure but have no intention to talk politics are still on Weibo, many producing quite decent content. A lot of aspiring intellectuals have also learned what is politically correct and what not and have managed to survive. Plenty still get banned mercilessly after some innocent mishap though, as Carl Zha (by all indications a paid propagandist for the government) who lost 10 million followers after dissing some Chinese fighter jet or something. But the platform is lively again, if in a more boring, sanitized way. Half a generation of youngsters have grown up without knowing what legal shitposting was like, and so just don’t do it. You can’t miss what you’ve never known.</p>
<p>Now, America isn’t China, so there’s no guarantee that the situation will evolve in the same way. Maybe Parler or Gab manage to survive the multi-pronged assault by every single part of the tech stack, and they thrive as a hotbed of right wing activism. I don’t find it very likely though. I see Twitter becoming a sanitized platform where only government-approved speech is allowed, and most people will be fine with that. I’ll stay on Twitter if only to follow a bunch of academic linguists who I find interesting. Also Japanese Twitter has its charm, as Twitter censorship is much, much weaker in exotic languages.</p>
<p>So to recap: I think we should do what the Chinese did, which is retreat to private groups. So go to Telegram, to Urbit if you’re smart.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Anti-cheat development is, by nature, reactive; anti-cheats exist to respond to and thwart a videogame’s population of cheaters. For instance, a videogame with an exceedingly low amount of cheaters would have little need for an anti-cheat, while a videogame rife with cheaters would have a clear need for an anti-cheat. In order to catch cheaters, anti-cheats will employ as many methods as possible. Unfortunately, anti-cheats are not omniscient; they can not know of every single method or detection vector to catch cheaters. Likewise, the game hacks themselves must continue to discover new or unique methods in order to evade anti-cheats.</p><h2 id="the-reactive-development-cycle-of-game-hacking"> <a href="#the-reactive-development-cycle-of-game-hacking">The Reactive Development Cycle of Game Hacking</a></h2><p>This brings forth a reactive and continuous development cycle, for both the cheats and anti-cheats: the opposite party (cheat or anti-cheat) will employ a unique method to circumvent the adjacent party (anti-cheat or cheat) which, in response, will then do the same.</p><p>One such method employed by an increasing number of anti-cheats is to execute core anti-cheat functions from within the operating system’s kernel. A clear advantage over the alternative (i.e. usermode execution) is in the fact that, on Windows NT systems, the anti-cheat can selectively filter which processes are able to interact with the memory of the game process in which they are protecting, thus nullifying a plethora of methods used by game hacks.</p><p>In response to this, many (but not all) hack developers made (or are making) the decision to do the same; they too would, or will, execute their hack, either wholly or in part, from within the operating system’s kernel, thus nullifying what the anti-cheats had done.</p><p>Unlike with anti-cheats, however, this decision carries with it numerous concessions: namely, the fact that, for various reasons, it is most convenient (or it is only practical) to execute the hack as an unsigned kernel driver running without the kernel’s knowledge; the “driver” is typically a region of executable memory in the kernel’s address space and is never loaded or allocated by the kernel. In other words, it is a “manually-mapped” driver, loaded by a tool used by a game hack.</p><p>This ultimately provides anti-cheats with many opportunities to detect so-called “kernel-mode” or “ring 0” game hacks (noting that those terms are typically said with a marketable significance; they are literally used to market such game hacks, as if to imply robustness or security); if the anti-cheat can prove that the system is executing, or had executed, unsigned code, it can then potentially flag a user as being a cheater.</p><h3 id="analyzing-a-threads-kernel-stack"> <a href="#analyzing-a-threads-kernel-stack">Analyzing a Thread’s Kernel Stack</a></h3><p>One such method - the focus of this article, in fact - of detecting unsigned code execution in the kernel is to iterate each thread that is running in the system (optionally deciding to only iterate threads associated with the system process, i.e. system threads) and to initiate some kind of stack trace.</p><p>Bluntly, this allows the anti-cheat to quite effectively determine if a cheat were executing unsigned code. For example, some anti-cheats (e.g. BattlEye) will queue to each system thread an APC which will then initiate a stack trace. If the stack trace returns an instruction pointer that is not within the confines of any loaded kernel driver, the anti-cheat can then know that it may have encountered a system thread that is executing unsigned code. Furthermore, because it is a stack trace and not a direct sampling of the return instruction pointer, it would work quite reliably, even if a game hack were, for example, executing a spin-loop or continuous wait; the stack trace would always lead back to the unsigned code.</p><p>It is quite clear to any cheat developer that they can respond to this behavior by simply running their thread(s) with kernel APCs disabled, preventing delivery of such APCs and avoiding the detection vector. As is will be seen, however, this method does not entirely prevent detection of unsigned code execution.</p><h3 id="copying-out-then-analyzing-a-threads-kernel-stack"> <a href="#copying-out-then-analyzing-a-threads-kernel-stack">(Copying Out, Then) Analyzing a Thread’s Kernel Stack</a></h3><p>Certain anti-cheats - EasyAntiCheat, in particular - had a much more apt method of generating a pseudo-stacktrace: instead of generating a stack trace with a blockable APC, why not copy the contents of the thread’s kernel stack asynchronously? Continuing the reactive cheat-anti-cheat development cycle, EasyAntiCheat had opted to manually search for instances of nonpaged code pointers that may have been left behind as a result of system thread execution.</p><p>While the downsides of this method are debatable, the upside is quite clear: as long as the thread is making procedure calls (e.g. x86 call instruction) from within its own code, either to kernel routines or to its own, and regardless of its IRQL or if the thread is even running, its execution will leave behind detectable traces on its stack in the form of pointers to its own code which can be extracted and analyzed.</p><h2 id="callouts-continuing-the-reactive-development-cycle"> <a href="#callouts-continuing-the-reactive-development-cycle">Callouts: Continuing The Reactive Development Cycle</a></h2><p>Proposed is the “callout” method of system thread execution, born from the recognition that:</p><ol><li>A thread’s kernel stack, as identified by the kernel stack pointer in a thread’s ETHREAD object, can be analyzed asynchronously by a potential anti-cheat to detect traces of unsigned code execution; and that</li><li>To be useful in most cases, a system thread must be able to make calls to most external NT kernel or executive procedures with little compromise.</li></ol><h3 id="the-life-cycle-of-the-callout-thread"> <a href="#the-life-cycle-of-the-callout-thread">The Life-cycle of the Callout Thread</a></h3><p>The life-cycle of a callout thread is quite simple and can be used to demonstrate its implementation:</p><ul><li>Before thread creation:<ul><li>Allocate a non-paged stack to be loaded by the thread; the callout thread’s “real stack”</li><li>Allocate shellcode (ideally in executable memory not associated with the main driver module) which disables interrupts, preserves the old/kernel stack pointer (as it was on function entry), loads the real stack, and jumps to an initialization routine (the callout thread’s “bootstrap routine”)</li><li>Create a system thread (i.e. PsCreateSystemThread) whose start address points to the initialization shellcode</li></ul></li><li>At thread entry (i.e. the bootstrap routine):<ul><li>Preserve the stack pointer that had been given to the thread at thread entry (this must be given by the shellcode)</li><li>(Optionally) Iterate the thread’s old/kernel stack pointer, ceasing iteration at the stack base, eliminating any references/pointers to the initialization shellcode</li><li>(Optionally) Eliminate references to the initialization shellcode within the thread’s ETHREAD; for example, it may be worth changing the thread’s start address</li><li>(Optionally, but recommended) Free the memory containing the initialization shellcode, if it was allocated separately from the driver module</li><li>Proceed to thread execution</li></ul></li></ul><p>In clearer terms, the callout thread spends most of its time executing the driver’s unsigned code with interrupts disabled and with its own kernel stack - the real stack. It can also attempt to wipe any other traces of its execution which may have been present upon its creation.</p><h3 id="the-usefulness-of-the-callout-thread"> <a href="#the-usefulness-of-the-callout-thread">The Usefulness of the Callout Thread</a></h3><p>The callout thread must also be capable of executing most, if not all, NT kernel and executive procedures. As proposed, this is effectively impossible; the thread must run with interrupts disabled and with its own stack, thus creating an obvious problem as most procedures of interest would run at an IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL. Furthermore, the NT IRQL model may be liable to ignore our setting of the interrupt flag, causing most routines to unpredictibly enter a deadlock or enable interrupts without our consent.</p><p>A mechanism to allow for a callout thread to invoke these routines of interest, the callout mechanism, is therefore used to:</p><ol><li>Provide a routine which can be used to conveniently invoke (“call out”) an external function; and in this routine,</li><li>Load the thread’s original/kernel stack pointer;</li><li>Copy function arguments on to the kernel thread’s stack from the real stack;</li><li>Enable interrupts;</li><li>Invoke the requested routine (within the same instruction boundary as when interrupts are enabled);</li><li>Cleanly return from the routine without generating obvious stack traces (e.g. function pointers);</li><li>Load the real stack pointer and disable the interrupt flag, and do so before returning to unsigned code; and</li><li>Continue execution, preserving the function’s return value</li></ol><p>While somewhat complicated, the callout mechanism can be achieved easily and, to a reasonable degree, portably, using two widely-available ROP gadgets from within the NT kernel.</p><h3 id="the-usefulness-of-iretq"> <a href="#the-usefulness-of-iretq">The Usefulness of IRET(Q)</a></h3><p>The constraint of needing to load a new stack pointer, interrupt flag, and interrupt pointer within an instruction boundary was immediately satisfied by the IRET instruction.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, the IRET (lit. “interrupt return”) instruction is intended to be used by an operating system or executive (here, the NT kernel) to return from an interrupt routine. To support the recognition of an interrupt from any mode of execution, and to generically resume to any mode of execution, the processor will need to (effectively) preserve the instruction pointer, stack pointer, CPL or privilege level (through the CS and SS selectors; and while they have a more general use-case, this is effectively what is preserved on most operating systems with a flat memory model), and RFLAGS register (as interrupts may be liable to modify certain flags).</p><p>To report this information to the OS interrupt handler, the CPU will, in a specific order:</p><ol><li>Push the SS (stack segment selector) register;</li><li>Push the RSP (stack pointer) register;</li><li>Push the RFLAGS (arithmetic/system flags) register;</li><li>Push the CS (code segment selector) register;</li><li>Push the RIP (instruction pointer) register; and, for some exception-class interrupts,</li><li>Push an error code which may describe certain interrupt conditions (e.g. a page fault will know if the fault was caused by a non-present page, or if it were caused by a protection violation)</li></ol><p>Note that the error code is not important to the CPU and must be accounted for by the interrupt handler. Each operation is an 8-byte push, …</p></div></div>

It’s a blunt but powerful tool for punishing people who would use your platform to incite violence or commit other crimes. But building healthy, happy communities requires much more than removing their worst users. You don’t have a healthy media ecosystem just because Donald Trump no longer dominates it.</p><p>With that in mind —&nbsp;and in an effort to turn our attention to some constructive ideas after a terrifying week —&nbsp;today I want to talk about an effort to design better digital spaces. For those of you who work on platforms, or hope to someday, I hope it will spark a sense of what else could be possible in your work. And for those of us who live and work on these platforms, I hope the ideas shared here give us a better sense of what we could and should demand from the digital world. </p><p>The ideas come from <a href="https://newpublic.org/">Civic Signals</a>, a new nonprofit organization dedicated to building “flourishing, public-friendly digital spaces.” It’s led by Eli Pariser, author of the 2011 bestseller <em>The Filter Bubble</em> and the co-founder of Upworthy; and Talia Stroud, director of the Center for Media Engagement at the University of Texas at Austin. For the past two years, they led an inquiry into what makes for good digital spaces. And on Tuesday, the first day of their inaugural <a href="https://newpublic.org/festival">New Public Festival</a>, they released the results of their research. (<a href="https://newpublic.org/signals">You can find it all here</a>.)</p><p>The research began with the observation that in the offline world, healthy communities have traditionally been served by thriving public spaces: town squares, libraries, parks, and so on. Like digital social networks, these spaces are open to all. But unlike those networks, they are owned by the community rather than a corporation. As you would expect, that difference results in a very different experience for the user.</p><p>Public spaces display a number of features that build healthier communities, according to researchers. “Humans have designed spaces for public life for millennia,” they write, “and there are lessons here that can be helpful for digital life.”</p><p>Here’s a list&nbsp;(emphasis theirs). These spaces:</p><blockquote><ul><li><p>Develop <strong>programming</strong> – social activities – that draw different groups in, without over-optimizing for any one group</p></li><li><p>Offer visual <strong>cues as to what kinds of behavior are invited</strong> in the space</p></li><li><p>Are designed to be physically accessible and <strong>attractive to many different populations</strong></p></li><li><p>Engage <strong>stewards, leaders, and maintainers</strong> who can do the labor of community-building&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Are designed in <strong>partnership with the communities that use them</strong>.</p></li></ul></blockquote><p>Save for the third bullet point on that list, these are not features that I would associate with any of our largest social platforms. And that begins to explain, I think, the rot we find throughout them. Giant, rudderless communities left to imagine for themselves what they ought to do on a platform, or how they ought to behave, often turn on one another. </p><p>Imagine if a Facebook, or a Reddit, or a YouTube offered actual programming to these communities —&nbsp;constructive, creative tasks that go beyond individual fundraisers or the creation of content. Would they not wind up with services that they were more proud of? </p><p>It’s relatively easy to imagine what this might look like. Over the past couple of months, I’ve been captivated by the story of <a href="https://variety.com/2021/legit/news/ratatouille-musical-actors-fund-1234881445/">the TikTok users who took it upon themselves to write a musical inspired by the Pixar film </a><em><a href="https://variety.com/2021/legit/news/ratatouille-musical-actors-fund-1234881445/">Ratatouille</a></em>. It happened spontaneously — and raised $1.9 million for the Actors Fund —&nbsp;but there’s no reason other platforms couldn’t similarly goad their users into creativity, philanthropy, or other ends more compelling than the traditional like, comment, and share.</p><p>On Monday, I attended a virtual briefing with Pariser and Stroud to learn about their findings. While they began with drawing analogies to the physical world, their research ultimately explored the possibilities contained within digital-only spaces as well. Ultimately, the team identified 14 design principles for building better digital spaces. The principles are grouped into four categories:</p><ul><li><p>Welcoming new users to the space and to conversations within it.</p></li><li><p>Helping people to understand the world.</p></li><li><p>Connecting people across hierarchies and divides.</p></li><li><p>Enabling people to act together.</p></li></ul><p>What I love about these principles is that they take a point of view on human behavior. Facebook’s mission “to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together” reads somewhat similar to the bullet points above, but is ultimately much less prescriptive about how the network ought to be used. The same could be said of Twitter’s mission to “serve the public conversation.”</p><p>The centerpiece of the Civic Signals research is a survey of more than 10,000 platform “super users” around the world about how well they believe existing social networks live up to the design principles identified in the research. The results are a mixed bag, as you would expect —&nbsp;Facebook ranked high for cultivating a sense of belonging and inviting everyone to participate, but low for showing people reliable information or ensuring people’s safety. Twitter ranked high on building bridges between groups, but low for showing reliable information.</p><p>For Pariser and Stroud, the lesson is that better digital spaces are both necessary and possible. The question is whether the principles they’ve identified can be incorporated into existing platforms, or will need to be baked into a new project from scratch. And should that new project be a traditional venture-backed startup, or a digital public space managed by a government or nonprofit community? </p><p>When I asked them, they told me that they welcome experimentation. “We need private actors <em>and</em> more public platforms if we want all these needs to be met,” Pariser told me. </p><p>But perhaps because none has yet succeeded on a grand scale, it’s the prospect of a public digital space that intrigues me the most. It intrigues Pariser, too. </p><p>“If you look at physical communities, there’s a reason that libraries are libraries and not venture-backed bookstores,” Pariser said. “They do different things. And those functions are really important as well.”</p><p>Stroud noted that no existing platform had performed well across the board in its survey, suggesting that there could be significant demand for the sort of spaces envisioned by Civic Signals.</p><p>“And some of these are really base-level things that you would want in a space,” Stroud said. Things like protecting users’ safety, or their data, or simply making them feel welcome when they join. “I think there’s a lot of opportunity for innovation.”</p><p>The New Public Festival continues online Wednesday and Thursday.

Frank Pallone Jr. (N.J.), the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee.</p><p>Twitter and Facebook “were letting the president say things that ultimately resulted in incitement of this mob that attacked the Capitol, and I’m glad they’ve taken action now,” Pallone added in an interview. “But this opens up a whole issue of how are they policing the Internet to prevent false information and incitements of violence.”</p></blockquote><p><strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225096/facebook-pause-freeze-political-spending-microsoft">Facebook</a></strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225096/facebook-pause-freeze-political-spending-microsoft">, </a><strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225096/facebook-pause-freeze-political-spending-microsoft">Google</a></strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225096/facebook-pause-freeze-political-spending-microsoft">, and </a><strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225096/facebook-pause-freeze-political-spending-microsoft">Microsoft</a></strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225096/facebook-pause-freeze-political-spending-microsoft"> paused all political donations in the wake of the Capitol attack</a>.

For most of us, that’s not a big deal. We have our whole lives ahead of us to work, so taking a few months off to “find yourself” can be completely justifiable.</p><p>Well, let’s just say that wasn’t the case for me.</p><p>I spent sleepless nights scouring job postings for any company that might be interested in what little I had to offer. I smacked that “Upload Resume” button around like it was my arch nemesis, but made sure to carefully upload the proper file format before doing so.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A01-Uploading-Resume.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A01-Uploading-Resume.png" alt="upload PDF for resume" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A01-Uploading-Resume.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A01-Uploading-Resume-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A01-Uploading-Resume-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A01-Uploading-Resume-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A01-Uploading-Resume-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>My days consisted of nothing but napping, eating, uploading, and submitting. To put it mildly, I was in a state of panic to find some sort of work.</p><p>Some might have viewed this obsessive job search as an impressive character trait. It may have masqueraded as a signal of ambition, an indicator that I was a guy that had his priorities straight.</p><p>The truth, however, was far from that. I wasn’t driven by some magnificent search for purpose, or the nagging desire to provide value to society. I was driven by something far less chivalrous:</p><p>My intense, terrifying fear of being homeless.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A02-Thinking-of-Homelessness.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A02-Thinking-of-Homelessness.png" alt="fear of homelessness" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A02-Thinking-of-Homelessness.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A02-Thinking-of-Homelessness-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A02-Thinking-of-Homelessness-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A02-Thinking-of-Homelessness-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A02-Thinking-of-Homelessness-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>For the longest time, this fear is what drove my panicked desire to find stable, well-paying work (regardless of how <a href="https://moretothat.com/pointless-job/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pointless it was</a>). I thought that as long as I could save some money with each paycheck, I wouldn’t have to sleep in the streets if something went awry.</p><p>Some of you may understand this fear, while others may view it as deeply irrational. I know people from wealthy backgrounds who have this fear, and people raised on welfare that don’t. My family didn’t have much money growing up, but that doesn’t quite justify the existence of this strain of fright.</p><p>Regardless of its origin, this fear was very much alive in me throughout my twenties, and it framed my perspective of money. Instead of viewing money as a generator of wealth, I saw it as an immediate safety net that (barely) kept me away from living on freeway on-ramps. The more of it I had, the more relief and distance it gave me from the streets.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A03-Safety-Net.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A03-Safety-Net.png" alt="falling into money safety net" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A03-Safety-Net.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A03-Safety-Net-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A03-Safety-Net-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A03-Safety-Net-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A03-Safety-Net-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>Well, many years have passed since then, and fortunately, I no longer have this fear.<span title="It took some time and life experience to reshape this perspective, but chief among them was the realization that being homeless was more about the poverty of love than the absence of money. As the bonds with my loved ones strengthened and took shape, this truth grew apparent and faded that fear out of my mind.">1</span> However, that doesn’t mean that I no longer think about money. It’s the <a href="https://moretothat.com/how-money-forever-changed-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">greatest story humanity has ever subscribed to</a>, so it will always be a central character in the theater of everyday life. What has changed isn’t money itself, but the way in which it colors the way I view the world.</p><p>Life is almost always a framing problem, and wealth is no exception to this. To say that money is complicated is a cliche worthy of a thousand eye rolls, but when it comes to our ongoing relationship with it, I find that it’s quite simple to explain and distill. At any given moment, our journey falls along a vertical spectrum with three main phases:</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B01-The-Money-Spectrum-smaller.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B01-The-Money-Spectrum-smaller.png" alt="more to that - the money spectrum" width="1500" height="1820" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B01-The-Money-Spectrum-smaller.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B01-The-Money-Spectrum-smaller-247x300.png 247w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B01-The-Money-Spectrum-smaller-844x1024.png 844w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B01-The-Money-Spectrum-smaller-768x932.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B01-The-Money-Spectrum-smaller-1266x1536.png 1266w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B01-The-Money-Spectrum-smaller-610x740.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>This is what I call <span>The Money Spectrum</span>, and it represents the wide variety of views we have about the almighty dollar/euro/whatever throughout our lives. Money can be a difficult thing to talk about because it invokes a blend of weird emotions, and this amorphous slushie of feelings can be hard to express through the crude tool of language.</p><p>The purpose of the Money Spectrum is to take this formless slushie and build it into a concrete model that we can all understand. The first step to solving a problem is to articulate it clearly, and that’s what this spectrum is here to do.</p><p>Each of the three phases represent a specific purpose money has for us, with Phase 1 being the ground level of this journey up the tower. We will go into what each of these three phases are soon, but before we do, keep in mind that this is a spectrum, meaning that we will find ourselves sliding along the scale at any time.</p><p>It’s entirely possible that someone will be 100% immersed in Phase 1, but it’s more likely that they will be closer to Phase 1 than Phase 2, and will share characteristics of both areas. This is an important distinction that we will make later on in this post, but for now, remember that our relationship with things are rarely absolutes, and money is no exception to this rule.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A04-Everything-is-a-spectrum.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A04-Everything-is-a-spectrum.png" alt="everything is a spectrum" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A04-Everything-is-a-spectrum.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A04-Everything-is-a-spectrum-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A04-Everything-is-a-spectrum-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A04-Everything-is-a-spectrum-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A04-Everything-is-a-spectrum-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>Let’s begin our journey up the Money Spectrum with this question: when you take a look at your bank account balance, what do you feel?</p><p>Well, if you’re a part of the 28% of Americans that have <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/banking/savings/financial-security-june-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">no emergency savings whatsoever</a>, the answer to that question will likely be a combination of fear and anxiety. When the sole purpose of money is to provide for the basic necessities of life, then your relationship with it will be a shaky one. Scarcity creates fragility, and it is this situation that opens the doors to Phase #1.</p><h3>Phase #1: Survival</h3><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B02-Entrance-to-Phase-1.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B02-Entrance-to-Phase-1.png" alt="Phase 1 - Survival" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B02-Entrance-to-Phase-1.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B02-Entrance-to-Phase-1-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B02-Entrance-to-Phase-1-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B02-Entrance-to-Phase-1-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B02-Entrance-to-Phase-1-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>One might say that we all share some space in this part of the spectrum. Ultimately, all the necessities of life require payment of some kind: the food we put in our mouths, the clothes we walk around in, the roof over our heads, etc. Without money we wouldn’t have any of these things, so it’s fair to say that it is a requisite of survival for all of us, right?</p><p>Well, not quite.</p><p>While it’s true that money is required to have these basic necessities, that doesn’t mean that we all fear the loss of these necessities equally. A low-income household and an upper middle-class family may both rent property, but the former may worry incessantly about next month’s payment, while the latter may not. Both understand the importance of money, but have different ideas of how their survival could be impacted by the lack of it.</p><p>The difficult thing about the word “survival” is how subjective it tends to be, as humans are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">more reactive to loss than to gain</a>. If a billionaire experienced a sudden reversal in fortune and couldn’t afford his ten-bedroom house anymore, it’s quite possible that he’d say his very survival was being threatened.</p><p>To remove this fog of subjectivity, let’s zoom in on the Survival part of the spectrum and break it down. When I use the word “survival” in this post, I’m simply referring to one’s ability to exist and to have one’s health. In the illustration below, I’ve separated the section out into its smaller constituents, with the level of poverty increasing the lower you go.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B03-Subsections-of-Phase-1.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B03-Subsections-of-Phase-1.png" alt="the stages of survival" width="1500" height="1520" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B03-Subsections-of-Phase-1.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B03-Subsections-of-Phase-1-296x300.png 296w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B03-Subsections-of-Phase-1-1011x1024.png 1011w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B03-Subsections-of-Phase-1-768x778.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B03-Subsections-of-Phase-1-610x618.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>At the lowest level, you have no money or access to food, and you are literally starving to death. This is more likely a function of national/civic infrastructure than an individual’s lack of money, as this is quite rare in any first-world country. However, it is still largely a function of having no fiscal resources, and this is the worst place one can find themselves in as a result of that.</p><p>A step up would be the lack of shelter, or homelessness. This is where one’s fears regarding survival can start feeling real, despite the fact that they are probably nowhere near it (my own fear was a good example of this). This likely happens because most of us are vividly familiar with the problem of homelessness, and have grown up seeing real-life evidence of it everywhere.</p><p>I have clear childhood memories of my parents interacting with the homeless, and you probably do as well. Homelessness is an ever-present window into the difficulties of the human condition, and it reminds you of what can be possible when things go wrong. When we think about our survival being threatened, this familiar sight is where the mind can point to, regardless of how distant that place actually is.</p><p>The next few steps up the spectrum have to do with one’s idea of survival once they have their basic necessities (food/water, shelter, and clothing). Survival is no longer a relentless exercise in acquiring these necessities, but more so a strong commitment in maintaining them. And of course, the fuel that keeps the resource engine running is money.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B04-Money-as-fuel-for-basic-necessities.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B04-Money-as-fuel-for-basic-necessities.png" alt="money fuels basic necessities" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B04-Money-as-fuel-for-basic-necessities.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B04-Money-as-fuel-for-basic-necessities-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B04-Money-as-fuel-for-basic-necessities-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B04-Money-as-fuel-for-basic-necessities-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B04-Money-as-fuel-for-basic-necessities-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>In order to sustain the health of oneself and one’s family, a consistent stream of income is needed, and this generally comes in the form of paid employment. Keep in mind that toward the upper-end of the Survival phase, you are no longer fighting for existence; you are fighting for preservation. You want the flow of money to be predictable, something you can count on every few weeks to sustain the level of basic resources you need.</p><p>A job provides this sense of security, and when you view money as a means for survival, holding this job is all that matters. It doesn’t matter how much you hate your job or how terrible the working conditions may be; as long as the number of hours you work result in a predictable deposit amount, you’ll succumb to it.</p><p>But if this pattern continues and time runs in your favor, there’s a point in which the lines between the Survival phase and Phase #2 (which I’ll reveal shortly) start getting blurry.</p><p>At what point does your job provide you with enough money to feel a sense of security? Is it when you’re no longer living paycheck-to-paycheck and you’re able to save some money each month? If that’s the case, what do your savings have to look like for you to feel a sense of relief? $2,000? $10,000? $30,000?</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B05-Savings-in-Phase-1.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B05-Savings-in-Phase-1.png" alt="how much savings is enough" width="1500" height="1520" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B05-Savings-in-Phase-1.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B05-Savings-in-Phase-1-296x300.png 296w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B05-Savings-in-Phase-1-1011x1024.png 1011w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B05-Savings-in-Phase-1-768x778.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B05-Savings-in-Phase-1-610x618.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>Toward the upper end of this phase, survival becomes more about your mindset and less about your reality. You are well past the place where you risk sleeping in the streets, but you may continue to operate under the belief that it could happen at any time. This traps you into a limited way of thinking, and paralyzes your potential for growth.</p><p>When you’re in a survival mindset, you will always feel like you’re barely holding onto what you have. Whether that’s $1,000 or $100,000, nothing you have can adequately push away the fears you have about sliding down the spectrum. This may be the result of parental conditioning, personal experience, or any number of reasons, but the longer you view money as a means for survival, the less willing you will be to take the risks required to lead a fulfilling life.</p><p>Risk is usually accompanied with the emotion of fear, and if you’re operating on survival mode, you will be scared to do anything uncertain, no matter how small that risk actually is:</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/E01-Fear-vs-Risk-in-Survival-Mode.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/E01-Fear-vs-Risk-in-Survival-Mode.png" alt="high survival - high fear" width="1500" height="1500" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/E01-Fear-vs-Risk-in-Survival-Mode.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/E01-Fear-vs-Risk-in-Survival-Mode-300x300.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/E01-Fear-vs-Risk-in-Survival-Mode-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/E01-Fear-vs-Risk-in-Survival-Mode-150x150.png 150w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/E01-Fear-vs-Risk-in-Survival-Mode-768x768.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/E01-Fear-vs-Risk-in-Survival-Mode-610x610.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>With this level of consistent fear, you won’t do anything outside of your comfort zone.

				<p>So my last blog post, <a href="https://patrobinson.github.io/2016/11/05/docker-in-production/">Docker in Production: A retort</a>, generated a lot of comments. One of them was “Why shouldn’t you run a Database in Docker?” I’ve seen this questions a few times, but rarely reply because it’s such a long answer. But here goes.</p>

<p>EDIT: I’ve been made aware I’m not being clear that I am referring to running a database in a container management solution, like Kubernetes. The issues laid out below don’t relate to just running your database in docker with no shared storage or ability to start it automatically on a different node.</p>

<h2 id="kelsey-hightower-told-you-not-to">Kelsey Hightower told you not to</h2>

<p>He’s a smart guy, he’s worked at CoreOS and now works at Google. He has done some fantastic talks on Docker, Kubernetes and System Administration in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/Nosa5-xcATw?t=1080">Here’s him talking about it</a></p>

<h2 id="distributed-systems-are-hard">Distributed systems are hard</h2>

<p>Like really hard. But that’s ok when your application is stateless, because when it all goes to shit you just reboot things and they magically get better. But when your database gets fubar you can end up with permanent corruption. The most complex part of a distributed system is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance#The_Byzantine_Generals.27_Problem">Byzantine Generals problem</a>, which describes the problem of how we determine what is the source of truth and how do we know for certain it is the only source of truth. There are various solutions to this problem, usually implemented in the storage engine of databases. Some databases do this well, mostly NoSQL databases where it’s possible to shard data across multiple nodes by not supporting a JOIN operation. Traditional relational databases do not do this well, they generally only work  in a master-slave configuration. There are ways to run them in master-master configuration but you need a very specific skill type to execute this. If you’re doing this, well why are you reading my blog post? You know better than I do.</p>

<p>If you cannot determine what is the master node, which involves some kind of conensus algorithm and an odd number of nodes to vote on it, then you will end up with data loss and/or corruption.</p>

<h2 id="volume-management-for-docker-is-still-in-its-infancy">Volume management for Docker is still in it’s infancy</h2>

<p>There isn’t a well respected solution for how to do volume management for Docker clusters right now. Some people use NFS, but it lacks any kind of locking support on files (see <a href="http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/locking.html">this blog</a> for more details on linux file lock support). So you cannot guarentee that another system is not writing to your files.</p>

<p>GlusterFS is a recent successor to NFS, that offers much better performance, clustering and scalability. However it has several known issues that render locking unreliable.<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1194546">1</a> <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1287099">2</a></p>

<h2 id="you-lied-to-us-i-can-total-run-my-nosql-database-in-docker">You lied to us! I can total run my NoSQL database in Docker</h2>

<p>The answer here is it really depends on the underlying technology. As stated, there is no solution for filesystem level replication of data (except in a few proprietary solutions like AWS’s flagship database Aurora, VMware File System and Google File System, none of which tackle this specific use case). So instead we must rely on the storage engine of the database to do clustering and replication for us. Some are well known for their support of this (etcd, ElasticSearch and Riak KV to name a few), but it needs to be considered on a case by case basis to evaluate how well the particular database deals with this problem, because it’s so easy to get wrong.</p>

<h2 id="with-great-knowledge-comes-great-responsibility">With great knowledge comes great responsibility</h2>

<p>Now you know why there is significant anxiety to running databases in Docker, you have the power to make the decision for yourself.</p>

<p>If you find yourself wanting to learn more I highly recommend Pintrest’s blog on <a href="https://engineering.pinterest.com/blog/sharding-pinterest-how-we-scaled-our-mysql-fleet">how they sharded their MySQL Cluster</a>. They use Zookeeper, similar to etcd, to keep the configuration of which data lives in which MySQL database. This provides a highly available, consistent store. But they still recommend you “only read/write to the master… It simplifies everything and avoids lagged replication bugs.”</p>

<p>I’ve yet to see a blog post about somebody containerising their MySQL server and how it went really well.</p>

<h2 id="edit-some-solutions-to-the-problems-i-have-presented-here">EDIT: Some solutions to the problems I have presented here</h2>

<p>Some people have pointed out a couple of solutions to the problem presented here. One is the Kubernetes <a href="http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/petset/">PetSet</a> concept. While still in Alpha (so obviuosly not fit for Production), this looks to be solving the exact problem of ensuring one and only one master exists at any one time.</p>

<p>Uber also <a href="https://eng.uber.com/dockerizing-mysql/">blogged about their dockerizing of MySQL</a> which is a very similar solution to the Kubernetes approach. They are defining the cluster topology up front, which guarentees a single master. They don’t talk about how they generate the master, but since that obviously comes from another source it’s likely highly consistent.</p>

<p>So today we still can’t run Docker inside a container cluster, but there are some good solutions on the roadmap.</p>

<p>Check out my <a href="http://patrobinson.github.io/2017/12/16/should-i-run-a-database-in-kubernetes/">follow up post</a> on this ∂subject.</p>

<p>If you have done enough of that kind of programming, you’ll immediately see how Zig is tackling relevant problems, but if you don’t have such experience, then the front page could very easily look like a never-ending list of things you don’t have an opinion about.</p>

<p>When the Zig project started, its audience was almost exclusively people with a lot of relevant experience, since those would be the only ones able to evaluate the promise and limits of the newborn language.</p>
<p>Today we’re at a point where Zig is becoming increasingly compelling for people coming from all layers of the stack. People have written <a href="https://github.com/Hejsil/mecha" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">parser combinators</a>, <a href="https://github.com/prime31/zig-gamekit" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">2d game rendering libraries</a>, <a href="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/futureproof/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a live editor for GPU shaders</a>, and much more. </p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong: all these projects have been developed by early adopters who wanted to try <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/buggy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a new and exciting</a> ecosystem. Zig is not yet stable, and won’t be for a while, but we’re getting there, and in the meantime Zig is already delivering big time on at least one promise: <strong>making it possible to learn more about programming without having to first buy into vast amounts of accidental complexity</strong>.</p>
<p>This redesign had two main goals and, as always, a few practical constraints. When it comes to constraints, it’s mostly my web design and project management skills, and the scope that can be addressed in no more than a couple of months, since we needed a new website <em>now</em> and not one year from now. Let’s now take a look at the goals.</p>
<h2 id="a-friendlier-first-impression"><a href="#a-friendlier-first-impression" aria-label="a friendlier first impression permalink"></a>A friendlier first impression</h2>
<p>The first goal addressed stems directly from the introduction of this blog post: we wanted to make the website more appealing to people that are looking at Zig as an opportunity to learn more about programming. For this reason, the lengthy breakdown has been moved to the Learn section and, in its place, we now have three short paragraphs that highlight some of Zig’s major features, followed by a code sample that gives you a first taste of the syntax. </p>
<p>Above the main introduction we still have the same slogan as before:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zig is a general-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining <strong>robust</strong>, <strong>optimal</strong>, and <strong>reusable</strong> software.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andrew did an outstanding job at formulating it and I believe it’s the one bit of the entire website that should probably never change.</p>
<p>Next to the slogan there’s a new cluster of buttons. This is where I wanted to come up with an interesting compromise: we follow the popular trend of putting a big call to action for new users, but we also use that block of space to create a single hotspot where regulars can get access to critical information. </p>

  </figure>
<p>My hope is for the big button to make new visitors become aware of that block and that, over time, checking there for docs and new releases just becomes muscle memory. That said, I know we’ll have to tweak the design once the auto-generated docs for the standard library become good enough for the front page.</p>
<p>Below everything I just described, we introduce the community and the Zig Software Foundation. The Zig project has grown to a point where governance matters and we want to show we’re doing everything the right way, up to the point of having formed a <a href="https://ziglang.org/zsf/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">nonprofit organization with a clear scope and mission statement</a>.</p>
<h2 id="internationalization"><a href="#internationalization" aria-label="internationalization permalink"></a>Internationalization</h2>
<p>The second goal of this redesign was to open the door to hosting multiple translations of the website. Having an i18n-enabled website is beneficial for multiple reasons: it helps with the first goal (i.e. help a wider range of programmers get started with Zig), it’s a good way of getting more use out of the informative materials we’ll progressively add to the website, and it’s also well aligned with the mission of the Zig Software Foundation. Lastly, I’m personally invested in the idea that we must ensure we don’t leave it to third parties to be the sole owners of all content available in a given language, as we’ve already seen bad actors exploit their position to implement a form of cultural arbitrage.</p>
<p>We’re well aware that keeping up with translations to multiple languages can quickly become an effort black hole. For this reason, I’ve tried to make sure the tooling would help in making the process as smooth as possible (more on that later), and I’ve also made sure to clarify in the design how translations are community-provided and thus best-effort.</p>

<p>At the moment of publication, the website can only offer <a href="https://ziglang.org/translations/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">an Italian translation</a> written by me. Italian was chosen out of necessity (i.e. it’s the only other language I speak), but it served the purpose of making me try out the ergonomics of producing a translation, and it can also act as documentation for others.</p>
<p>Finally, I should point out that there are some parts of the website we don’t plan to translate, like the News section, for example. This is another choice made out of necessity: we want to restrict translations to content with a long shelf life to reduce the amount of effort, but I don’t exclude that one day we might have enough resources to get rid of this compromise.</p>
<h2 id="implementation-details"><a href="#implementation-details" aria-label="implementation details permalink"></a>Implementation details</h2>
<p>The new website is statically generated by <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Hugo</a>. I also considered <a href="https://www.getzola.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Zola</a>, but its i18n support is not complete yet. The website lists a number of Zig code snippets, with relative output. Andrew originally implemented a program to produce release notes and language reference. That program takes in code samples, applies syntax highlighting, runs the code, and reports the output as HTML (it even retains colors from the terminal). I took the original code and packaged it as a tool with a more general interface. I called it <a href="https://github.com/kristoff-it/zig-doctest" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">zig-doctest</a> and it can be easily integrated with all kinds of static content generation tools.</p>
<p>Now a successful CI build of the <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ziglang/zig</a> repository triggers a build of the website, allowing us to catch outdated code examples much more easily. This addresses concerns raised in the past by people that would occasionally stumble upon a broken code sample.</p>
<p>Testing all code snippets is not instant as some tests include running the executable and capturing its output, so I made sure to integrate with Hugo’s caching system. I also noticed that Hugo processes tags sequentially within the same page, so I also <a href="https://github.com/kristoff-it/hugo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">added to it</a> a warmup routine that makes sure to parallelize the testing when loading the development server the first time.</p>
<p>The result is a very enjoyable development experience that only depends on Zig and two additional executables (Hugo and doctest) to be able to develop the Zig website locally, resulting in an acceptable experience for potential contributors. </p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="conclusion permalink"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope this post explains adequately the intent of this work and the practical limits of its execution. There’s still more work to do, but this seems a reasonable milestone for a first release, so I’m looking forward to working alongside the community to improve and add translations to the website.</p>
<p>For the next iteration I’ll work on improving accessibility, but first I have to focus on <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/track/zig_programming_language/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">FOSDEM, since we have a Zig dev room</a> and I have a bunch of duties to attend to. </p>
<p>When I first discovered Zig, I saw it as a way for me to learn more about all the aspects of programming I missed when working with interpreted and/or garbage-collected languages. Turns out I got to learn that <a href="https://ziglang.org/news/announcing-zig-software-foundation/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">and much more</a>, and I can’t tell you how excited I am about what’s to come. Despite everything, 2020 was a great year for Zig, and I fully expect 2021 to be even better.</p></div></div>]]>

<p><em>This is a guest post from Allie Cooper. Enjoy.</em></p>



<div><p>It’s one thing to be able to write good code, but professional written communication is something else entirely. The ability to efficiently and authentically communicate using written language is an often ironically underrated skill in software development.</p><p>This is something that new developers need to get over very quickly. “Obsessions with patterns and algorithms don’t serve anyone’s mission by themselves,” explains&nbsp;<a href="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2020/11/09/create-value-for-people/">engineer and career coach Minh Pham</a>. “While coding might be your latest skill set, it is by no means an engineer’s only skillset. Remember that at the end of the day, it doesn’t matter if your code is ugly, fancy, verbose or concise – the value you create matters. Strive to be an excellent communicator, a quality teammate, and an outstanding human.” In today’s increasingly digitized workplace, achieving these qualities means honing your professional written communication skills.</p><p><strong>Writing is Essential to Software Development</strong></p><p>Any veteran developer can tell you that non coding-related writing is part and parcel of the daily grind, which includes writing tons of bug reports, notes for yourself, documentation for co-workers, and other technical discussions over chat or e-mail. You might also be tasked with explaining technicalities in ways that can be easily understood by clients.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.inc.com/encyclopedia/written-communication.html">And as Inc points out</a>, all of this generates a permanent record of any and all significant ideas, incidents, and other facts pertinent to how you’ve handled the job. In software development, the way you write and communicate over work platforms defines a great majority of your work history.</p><p>While writing code defines your raw ability as a software developer, your written professional correspondence tells the story of your ability to work with others in an inherently collaborative and complex field. Today, the sudden digital migration brought on by the global health crisis has only made professional writing a more integral skill for thriving in the new and increasingly web-based workplace. This is as true for experienced developers as it is for those who are looking to pick up the skills necessary for the job, which brings us to our next point.</p><p><strong>The Future of Coding Education is Written and Online</strong></p><p>From basic coding courses to advanced degree programs, more and more future developers are learning essential skills through online means. And the pandemic has only increased their numbers. For instance,&nbsp;Code Platoon Coding Bootcamp online basic coding courses&nbsp;have allowed the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs to continue offering software development skills training for veterans as well as their spouses. And for safety reasons, all classes have been moved online. </p></div>



<div><p>Meanwhile top universities have also made this switch to training software specialists online.&nbsp;Maryville University’s online masters in software development&nbsp;is an advanced degree program that’s 100% web-based as well, with the perspective of producing future software consultants, UX designers, web developers, and DevOps engineers. And while these programs do include video conferencing classes, the majority of the work is through written communication. As natives to online work, the developers trained in these online programs are already developing the writing skills necessary to thriving amid the current digital migration.</p><p>In short, the field of software development is only getting more competitive and web-based. And while there’s no shortage of genius code writers for companies to cherry-pick from online universities and coding courses, the combination of a great coder and a great online communicator remains rare.</p><p><strong>Practice Makes Perfect</strong></p><p>Whether you’re already coding for a living or still learning the skill, you already have plenty of opportunities to hone your professional writing skills. Strive to be succinct and straightforward with every chat message or e-mail before hitting send. Put yourself in other people’s shoes – think about how the message you wrote will affect you if you were the one to receive it. Remember that every unnecessary word only muddles already complex conversations about technical specifications. Grammar is important, but so is writing with the perspective of being as empathic and as concise as possible – which can also allow you to develop a writing style that won’t require grammatical gymnastics. Never play to your emotions and always write with a collaborative mindset. The better you can communicate with the written word, the more value you can bring to any software development effort.</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div href=""><p>In this article I will focus on a topic widely debated by people who design engineering workflows between Ops and developers: Is there a systematic approach that can balance the maintainability of the system, the velocity at which features get shipped and the freedom of the developers?</p><p>Let's steal the concept of the Project Management Triangle and adapt it to organizing work between developers and ops. The Project Management Triangle states that quality is affected by scope, budget and time. Basically, for a given quality you can choose 2 of "complete", "fast" or "cheap". We'll call our triangle&nbsp; “the ulgy triangle of engineering process design”. It says that for a given cost, you can trade off velocity, maintainability and developer freedom. I find that optimizing for “Maintainability and Velocity'' is the winning strategy. Reaching this combination requires a new way of organizing work between the ops and the application development team.</p><p>We need to be careful though, strictly optimizing for the combination Maintainability and Velocity can lead to a significant decrease in conversations between ops and developers which in turn leads to silos. This risk has to be mitigated by regular, scheduled internal discussions around optimal workflow designs. Good teams agree on standard operating procedures supported by their internal tooling setup but keep the conversation going to continuously optimize.</p><p><span id="hs-cta-wrapper-cbd2acbb-3460-41d9-bc43-6fa6b1d316b2"><span id="hs-cta-cbd2acbb-3460-41d9-bc43-6fa6b1d316b2"><!--[if lte IE 8]><div id="hs-cta-ie-element"></div><![endif]--><a href="https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/5890440/cbd2acbb-3460-41d9-bc43-6fa6b1d316b2"><img id="hs-cta-img-cbd2acbb-3460-41d9-bc43-6fa6b1d316b2" height="628" width="1200" src="https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/5890440/cbd2acbb-3460-41d9-bc43-6fa6b1d316b2.png" alt="Webinar: How much freedom should developers have in the perfect DevOps setup?"></a></span></span></p><p>‍<br></p><h2>The ugly triangle&nbsp;</h2><p>In an ideal world, I would want to work in an engineering team that works with high velocity, everybody could use the methods they prefer without bothering too much with transactional conventions. And the best thing would be: our setup would remain easy to maintain. Unfortunately my experience over the past ten years tells me that this is just a dream. In the real world a team can choose any of the following combinations: Freedom + Velocity, Velocity + Maintainability and Maintainability and Freedom for a fixed team size (i.e. cost).<br></p><p>Let’s go through the individual elements to try to understand and force-rank their importance.<br></p><p><strong>Velocity</strong> is my personal number one. By far. Much too often, as teams grow, they slow down. I loved Jason Warner’s mantra-like quote when we recently chatted: “when you slow you die”. <a href="https://humanitec.com/blog/jason-warner-why-github-built-their-own-internal-developer-platform">(Actually consider reading this interview because he says tons of stuff that is relevant if you like this article).</a> Speed means you’re faster than your competition in shipping awesome stuff, it means you can react to customer demand or to that bug that keeps hindering people from buying, on black friday. But we can also look at the sheer numbers, for instance the graphics from McKinsey’s study across 431 businesses and they’ll tell us: there is a significant correlation between engineering velocity and business outcomes as well as sheer innovation power of a business.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5c73bbfe3312822f153dd310/5fe1c79f70fc6ee802e19974_LPpwoN2XGixETWqOUhZG-IJ5I99sXbBCPmYVVKpht8UIVzD9mxroHevOVWhh6HAXxGRTDJ8REquDL2WAUivmEiPEnwuVi0uMTcMMPvs1PRXFVc4X6pwnaiofFoKYsPR1mjUunbNe.png" alt=""></p><figcaption><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/developer-velocity-how-software-excellence-fuels-business-performance" target="_blank">McKinsey and Company, Development velocity - how software excellence shapes business outcomes, Correlating revenue and developer velocity.</a></figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5c73bbfe3312822f153dd310/5fe1c79f6e26a6103cf19b8d_YmSXBY5GjquY0CMgCBgOXPa1DkY8v3BC3Gp5iu6xbJBel0eKEi7Ne51TLEZj-4Cs9zu2PnO35oHIkutcPbEAlUzi7CLmtfgRCBtHzaujS-BAi34RkQ3Cm5yfQrPU0YDKaeR1jjOp.png" alt=""></p><figcaption><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/developer-velocity-how-software-excellence-fuels-business-performance" target="_blank">Graphic: McKinsey and Company, Development velocity - how software excellence shapes business outcomes, Velocity correlates with ability to innovate.</a></figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>As the first rule in business is to stay in business I believe it’s fair to assume this is priority #1.<br></p><p><strong>Maintainability</strong> is non-negotiable for so many reasons. Hard to maintain systems lead to technical debt and so eat up vast amounts of resources. What does this mean in practice? I recently chatted to Paolo Garri, Director of Technology at Sport1, a German broadcaster. They had 400 unstructured scripts in their setup. And unstructured means several languages and formats (bash, YAML, python, etc.) and a complete mess in the way these scripts and manifests themselves were structured. This led to key-person dependencies, time sunk into maintaining these scripts and overwhelming internal documentation. The impact on the Ops team was severe: time you put into maintenance is time you lose for innovation. Setups that are hard to maintain usually don’t allow for developer self-serving which in turn puts ops under pressure because they are busy keeping up with manual requests from the team.</p><p>Let’s move away from an n=1 and look at the broader data-set. First of all let’s check what share the cost (and subsequently developer life-time) of maintenance has as a percentage of the total cost (and life-time) of a product. To do this let’s look at a small meta-analysis of what authors say about the percentage of maintenance cost of total cost:<br></p><p><strong>Author</strong></p><p><strong>Maintenance as a % of Build Cost</strong></p><p><a href="http://galorath.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/software_total_ownership_costs-development_is_only_job_one.pdf" target="_blank">Daniel D. Galorath: 75%</a></p><p><a href="http://courses.cs.vt.edu/csonline/SE/Lessons/LifeCycle/Lesson.html#refs">Stephen R. Schach</a>: 67%</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_maintenance#cite_note-2">Thomas M. Pigoski</a>: &gt;80%</p><p><a href="http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/The_60/60_Rule">Robert L. Glass</a>: 40% – 80%</p><p>f &gt;90%</p><p>Although there is quite a lot of variance, it’s probably fair to assume that the percentage of build cost spent on maintenance is somewhere between 40%-90%. That&nbsp; is a significant chunk. To call maintainability a vital impact factor we should look at how code-quality (maintainability) impacts cost. In other words: does it pay off to optimize for maintainability of code in order to reduce future cost? If not, the proportions of build cost eaten up by maintenance would just be a necessary evil.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5c73bbfe3312822f153dd310/5fe1c79fb11c53f63b52a4fb_vGpYCibENVJo6wueiW2yEfvzKcrpQAqQwRJFi7zQE9GZ_LYDKXQq7zeMozV6Jvw9agu1aWLRX1zndoNsf-jc9YX3FIykfF8y5yx4FsQWwBi9Hh4feSUCdvHv8wUgplN8o6fKc9fx.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Rob Waller, mapping maintainability against cost, <a href="https://dev.to/robdwaller/the-code-maintainability-test-5df3#:~:text=Code%20maintainability%20is%20a%20fundamental,difficult%20to%20add%20new%20features." target="_blank">here.</a></figcaption></figure><p>As you can see: as maintainability increases, costs fall. Maintenance costs never fall to zero but they do fall dramatically as a codebase improves. Admittedly “maintainability” is a vague and imprecise variable and we need to accept the general trend rather than specific analysis.<br></p><p><strong>Freedom</strong>, well what does this actually mean? Well what I mean by this more specifically is the freedom&nbsp; to choose tools and technologies that are part of the developer / ops workflow. (I’m not talking about the langues developers use to write the apps and services they are developing - we’ll focus on the developer / ops workflows.) Let's look specifically at configuration management as an example.<br></p><p>A high degree of freedom in this sense means an individual team-member is not only entirely free on how to express configurations but also on how to get those running in the target infrastructure. Zooming in on the Kubernetes ecosystems in this world it would be entirely up to her whether she wants to define configs as Helm Charts, a Kustomize patch or vanilla Kubernetes manifests. She would also be free to choose&nbsp; how to update the target resource as long as the desired outcome would meet the expectation.<br></p><p>A low degree of freedom would mean the developer could not choose how to write configurations. There would be a strict baseline schema and she could only apply limited changes to this schema. She would then use internal tooling that would update the target resource for her.&nbsp;</p><p>The conclusions we can draw from the above example (and sadly there isn’t sufficient research to actually back those up with data) are the following:&nbsp;</p><p>Freedom of choice affects maintainability negatively. Meaning if you allow teams to randomly choose how they manage configurations and stich processes together with scripts the maintainability is affected. So: a high degree of freedom leads to a high degree of variance to understand, document and ultimately maintain. The more freedom the less maintainability.</p><p>Restriction of freedom thus seems inevitable. How important is it really that every developer can write the container specifications or the helm-charts the exact way she wants? How does this change the overall picture? Does this make your team more attractive to applicants? Not really! After all, application developers are more and more specialized in their respective field. A react developer cares about typescript much more than about terraform and frankly, that’s ok.<br></p><h2>Be very careful when restricting freedom</h2><p>With this force-ranking it becomes clear that the winning combination is Maintainability and Velocity. At the same time this implies that we will have to restrict freedom. But restricting freedom is a dangerous endeavor. You’re taking away context and choice while relying on the opinion of a few what the right thing to do is.<br></p><p>If we’re looking at common models how teams design the intersect between developers and operations (and thus fiddle with freedom) three patterns come to mind:<br></p><p><strong>Pattern #1:</strong> <em>You build it and I run </em>it or <em>the zero-freedom pattern.</em> In this pattern there is strict separation of concerns. Application developers write their code, maybe elements of the configuration. They then throw the package over the fence where ops picks it up and runs it. This model is antiquated. Practitioners of the latest DevOps methodology would probably agree that this is not the way to go. It might lead to better maintainability, maybe a higher velocity but it also leads to strange and misaligned incentives for both developers and ops.. In this model the team has zero freedom. This is definitely not what I mean when I vote for the maintainability-velocity combination.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5c73bbfe3312822f153dd310/5fe1c79f9bd7dd904cf42400_wiEl_EB4hPzpk-MS134_eBnRhDan7Bga2lNihFlIwaJxOL3bHO3DApSv3foCGlMxW3buv8dYVHvxP5MYViS1FbUN13wu5E5vdNxI_EBBxEf_rrpz1nrBisoYLLIXHk-XKEhv1aT0.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>Pattern #2:</strong> <em>You build it, you run it and I don’t exist </em>or <em>the total freedom pattern.</em> In this pattern there are no operators at all. Some (in my opinion) misinterpret this as the purest form of DevOps. Developers not only have to handle their applications, but also look after the underlying infrastructure (i.e. the cluster, managed databases etc). This setup leads to a very high degree of freedom. Everyone does everything and especially has to do everything, there really is no choice. While this approach works for very small teams of highly trained engineers it almost consistently fails in practice if it comes to scaling teams, especially in an enterprise context. The reason is that developers tend to specialize as they move through their careers. For example, senior front end developers who win are those who specialize in (for example) TypeScript with React. That’s what they will be benchmarked against, not their ability to handle DevOps related tasks. This pattern leads to huge pressure on the ops team through requests from developers raining down on them. This reinstates pattern #1 with the downsides of missing structure. Now you get the requests from …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At work I contribute to a moderately-sized monorepo at 70 thousand files,
8-digit lines of code and hundreds of PRs merged every day. One day I
opened a remote buffer at that repository and ran <code>M-x find-file</code>.</p><p><code>find-file</code> is an interactive function that shows a narrowed list
of files in the current directory, prompts the user to filter and scroll
through candidates, and for a file to open.</p><p>Emacs froze for <em>5 seconds</em> before showing me the <code>find-file</code> prompt. Which
isn’t great, because when writing software, opening files is actually
something one needs to do all the time.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/find_file_linux.png"></figure><p>Luckily, Emacs is “the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time
display editor”, and comes with profiling capabilities: <code>M-x profiler-start</code>
starts a profile and <code>M-x profiler-report</code> displays a call tree showing how
much CPU cycles are spent in each function call after starting the profile.
Starting a profile and running <code>M-x find-file</code> showed that all time was being
spent in a function called <code>ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code>, which was being
called by <code>file-name-at-point-functions</code>, an <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html%5Fnode/emacs/Hooks.html#:~:text=A%20few%20hooks%20are%20abnormal,are%20used%20in%20some%20way.">abnormal hook</a> run when <code>find-file</code>
is called.</p><p>If you're familiar with Vim you can think of Emacs <i>hooks</i> as
Vim <i>autocommands</i>, only with much better ergonomics.</p><p>I checked the documentation for <code>ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code> with <code>M-x describe-function ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code> and it didn’t seem
to be something essential, so I removed the hook by running <code>M-x eval-expression</code>, writing the form below, and pressing <code>RET</code>.</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">(<span>remove-hook</span> <span>'file-name-at-point-functions</span> <span>'ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</span>)
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>This solved the immediate problem of Emacs blocking for 5 seconds every
time I ran <code>find-file</code>, with no noticeable drawbacks.</p><div><p>As I write this I attempt to reproduce the issue by re-adding
<code>ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code>
to
<code>file-name-at-point-functions</code>.
I can't reproduce it anymore. The initial issue might have been</p><ul><li>caused by having manually mutated the Emacs environment via ad-hoc code
evaluation (drifting from the state defined in configuration)</li><li>caused by settings or packages that aren't in my configuration anymore</li><li>fixed by settings or packages that were recently added to my
configuration</li><li>fixed by some recent package upgrade</li></ul><p>Or some combination of the above. I have no idea exactly what.
Which is to say: maintaining Emacs configurations is complicated.</p></div><p>I could now navigate around and open files. The next thing I tried in this
remote git repository was searching through project files. The great
<em>projectile</em> package provides the <code>projectile-find-file</code> function for that,
but I had previously given up making projectile perform well with remote
buffers; given how things are currently implemented it seems to be
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=projectile+tramp">impractical</a>. So I installed the <em>find-file-in-project</em> package for use on
remote projects exclusively: <code>M-x package-install find-file-in-project</code>.</p><p>Most Emacs commands are accessible via key combinations, with defaults
that can be customized to be anything you want. I'll stick to referencing
command names themselves instead of their default keybindings.</p><p>Both <code>projectile-find-file</code> and <code>find-file-in-project</code> (aliased as <code>ffip</code>):</p><ul><li>show a narrowed list of all project files in the minibuffer</li><li>prompt the user to filter and scroll through candidates</li><li>open a file when <code>RET</code> is pressed on a candidate.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/projectile_find_file_linux.png"></figure><p>To disable projectile on remote buffers I had the following form in my
configuration.</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">(<span>defadvice</span> <span>projectile-project-root</span> (<span>around</span> <span>ignore-remote</span> <span>first</span> <span>activate</span>)
  (<span>unless</span> (<span>file-remote-p</span> <span>default-directory</span> <span>'no-identification</span>) <span>ad-do-it</span>))
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>Which causes the <code>projectile-project-root</code> function to not run its usual
implementation on remote buffers, but instead return <code>nil</code> unconditionally.
<code>projectile-project-root</code> is used as a way to either get the project root for
a given buffer (remote or not), or as a boolean predicate to test if the
buffer is in a project (e.g., a git repository directory). Having it return
<code>nil</code> on remote buffers effectively disables projectile on remote buffers.</p><p>Emacs
<i><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Advising-Functions.html">advices</a></i> are a way of modifying the behavior of existing functions without
having to redefine them. They serve a similar purpose as hooks, but are
more flexible.</p><p>I then wrote a function that falls back to <code>ffip</code> when projectile is
disabled and bound it to the keybinding I had for <code>projectile-find-file</code>,
so that I could press the same keybinding whenever I wanted to search for
projects files, and not have to think about whether I’m on a remote buffer
or not:</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1

<code>ivy--insert-minibuffer</code> and 9% of the time—roughly 3 whole seconds!—
garbage collecting. I had <code>garbage-collection-messages</code> set to <code>t</code> so I could
already tell that Emacs was GCing a lot; enabling this setting makes a
message be displayed in the echo area whenever Emacs garbage collects. I
could also see the Emacs process consuming 100% of one CPU core while it was
frozen and unresponsive to input.</p><p>The <code>profiler</code> package implements a

ignore it for now.</p><p>As I get deep in drilling down on <code>ivy--insert-minibuffer</code>, names in the
“Function” column start getting truncated because the column is too narrow.

We design building toys, plush animals, and active play toys. We manufacture them in Cambodia, Vietnam, China, and the USA (not as much as we’d like), and then we sell them mainly online.

For companies which sell on Amazon, this fairly typical. Two years ago, it was 98.1%. It’s risky to have so much of your sales concentrated in a single platform, but we’ve at least made progress. As <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/amazon-needs-a-competitor-and-walmart-aint-it-5997977b77b2">explained here</a>, it’s really challenging for companies like our own to not be dependent on Amazon for revenue.</p></div><div data-aspect-ratio="60.82036775106082" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1609697572806_11785"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1609697572806_14361"><div><p>The desire to get more sales off-Amazon doesn’t just come from the risk that they suspend our company from their platform. It’s also about the cost of selling there relative to other channels. If we sell $100 worth of product on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/viahart">our Amazon store</a>, on average, we get $48.25 back. At <a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?query=viahart&amp;redirect=false">our Walmart.com store</a>, we get $54.50 and on <a href="https://www.ebay.com/str/viahart">eBay store</a>, we get $57.50 back. On <a href="https://viahart.com/">our website (which could use a bath!)</a>, by virtue of not having a commission and by having much lower per unit shipping costs driven by larger orders (the more you ship, the cheaper it is to ship per unit), we get $83.10 back!</p><p>What’s driving those cost differences between the big marketplaces Amazon, eBay, and Walmart? It’s not shipping. It costs us roughly the same to ship out of our warehouse as it does for us to use Amazon’s FBA. eBay’s has slightly lower commissions, but the main reasons for the cost differences between these marketplaces are:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Refunds - It could be Amazon’s customer service or perhaps the customers themselves, but Amazon grants more refunds (2.6% of revenue) than either Walmart (1.9%) or famously seller friendly eBay (1%)</p></li><li><p>Storage - It costs a lot of money to store your products in Amazon’s fulfillment centers. We spent 2.4% of our Amazon revenue on storage. Amazon’s service was very spotty this year, but being able to reach 99.99% of America within 1-2 days is pretty awesome and this is a big driver of why Amazon owns 93.4% of our sales.</p></li><li><p>Advertising - Depending on what website A/B testing they’re doing, as many as 6 out of the top 7 results in an Amazon search can be advertising.  Even when a customer searches for your brand, if you want to be seen before your competition, you need to pay Amazon. We paid them 3.55% of our Amazon revenue in 2020. As less competitive marketplaces, we did not see the need to pay for advertising on eBay or Walmart. </p></li></ol></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1609697572806_20928"><div>

At that level of margin, moving your sales from Amazon to eBay would result in a 38% improvement in profits, which is huge. Shifting those sales from Amazon to one’s own website would represent a more than 3x increase in profits! Of course, if this were easy, we would have done it already. Unfortunately, getting traffic to one’s website is oftentimes a costly affair and it could be expected that a good portion of those profits would go to Facebook or Google.</p><p>Logistics and Covid-19 or Why It’s Better to Be Lucky Than Good</p><p>When the lockdowns first hit in the United States, it caused a massive shift in spending from brick-and-mortar to e-commerce. When government assistance arrived, it turbocharged online consumer spending even further. So for almost everyone in the e-commerce industry, 2020 was the best year they’ve ever had.</p><p>That said, it was a logistics nightmare, all year. And as a result, the rewards of this e-commerce boom were not spread evenly across all channels throughout the year.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1609697572806_31343"><div>

One way to establish social proof is to have a lot of reviews for your item. Again, it’s not just the quality of the reviews, but the quantity that is important to customers trying to make a decision. Our older items had a lot of reviews, given that they had been sold since 2014. However, Amazon implemented a change. They’ve lowered the bar to reviewing, by offering the new rating feature.</p></div><div data-aspect-ratio="32.077625570776256" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1609697572806_52634"><div>

This past weekend, on January 9th, we celebrated 10 years since <a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/commit/337c3f2d569a42ebd5fcab6fef18c5e012f9be5b">the first commit to the Elixir repository</a>. While I personally don’t consider <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> to be 10 years old yet - the language that became what Elixir is today <a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/commit/6052352b6281752b905b30eb5b08fac0f51f68cd">surfaced only 14 months later</a> - a decade is a mark to celebrate!</p>
<p>
The goal of this post is to focus on the current state of some projects in the ecosystem and then briefly highlight a few of the exciting efforts coming over the next months.</p>
<h2>
Recap: The language goals</h2>
<p>
When I started working on Elixir, I personally had the ambition of using it for building scalable and robust web applications. However, I didn’t want Elixir to be tied to the web. My goal was to design an <em>extensible</em> language with a diverse ecosystem. Elixir aims to be a general purpose language and allows developers to extend it to new domains.</p>
<p>
Given Elixir is built on top of Erlang and Erlang is used for networking and distributed systems, Elixir would naturally be a good fit in those domains too, as long as I didn’t screw things up. The Erlang VM is essential to everything we do in Elixir, which is why <em>compatibility</em> has become a language goal too.</p>
<p>
I also wanted the language to be <em>productive</em>, especially by focusing on the tooling. Learning a functional programming language is a new endeavor for most developers. Consequently their first experiences getting started with the language, setting up a new project, searching for documentation, and debugging should go as smoothly as possible.</p>
<p>
Extensibility, compatibility, and productivity are the goals we built the language upon.</p>
<h2>
Recap: Elixir in production</h2>
<p>
Last year we started <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/cases.html">a series of articles on companies using Elixir in production on the official website</a>. As of today, we have 7 production cases listed with more coming this year! Overall it is very exciting to see many different companies using a variety of business models and industries running Elixir in production.</p>
<p>
Companies like <a href="https://www.brex.com/">Brex</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/06/23/growing-with-elixir-at-brex/">case</a>), <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/08/real-time-communication-at-scale-with-elixir-at-discord/">case</a>), <a href="https://getdivvy.com/">Divvy</a>, <a href="https://www.podium.com/">Podium</a>, and <a href="https://salesloft.com/">SalesLoft</a> have reached <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn_(finance)">“unicorn status”</a> and rely heavily on Elixir. Startups like <a href="https://www.joinblvd.com/">Boulevard</a> (<a href="https://soundcloud.com/elixirtalk/episode-166-feat-sean-stavropoulos">podcast</a>), <a href="https://community.com/">Community</a>, <a href="https://duffel.com/">Duffel</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/12/10/integrating-travel-with-elixir-at-duffel/">case</a>), <a href="https://www.ockam.io/">Ockam</a>, <a href="https://www.mux.com/">Mux</a>, <a href="https://ramp.com/">Ramp</a>, <a href="https://remote.com/">Remote</a>, and <a href="https://www.v7labs.com/">V7</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2021/01/13/orchestrating-computer-vision-with-elixir/">case</a>) also use Elixir and have received funding in the last year or two. Elixir is also used within known brands and enterprises such as <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/">Bleacher Report</a>, <a href="https://www.change.org/">Change.org</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/27/delivering-social-change-with-elixir-at-change.org/">case</a>), <a href="https://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/09/24/paas-with-elixir-at-Heroku/">case</a>), <a href="https://www.pagerduty.com/">PagerDuty</a>, <a href="https://www.pepsico.com/">PepsiCo</a>, and <a href="https://www.therealreal.com/">TheRealReal</a>.</p>
<p>
There is also a special category of startups that run Elixir alonside an open source model, such as <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible Analytics</a>, <a href="https://app.supabase.io/">Supabase</a>, <a href="https://logflare.app/">Logflare</a> (<a href="https://runninginproduction.com/podcast/11-logflare-is-a-log-management-and-event-analytics-platform">podcast</a>), and <a href="https://hex.pm/">Hex.pm</a> (<a href="https://runninginproduction.com/podcast/19-hexpm-is-elixirs-official-package-manager">podcast</a>) itself. Still on the open source front, you will find projects like <a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</a> and <a href="https://changelog.com/">Changelog</a>. There also many small scale and hobby projects that use Elixir for a productive and joyful development experience.</p>
<h2>
Recap: Diverse ecosystem</h2>
<p>
Today, Elixir has a diverse ecosystem that works on a wide range of domains and industries. Let’s take a look at some examples.</p>
<h3>
Web</h3>
<p>
Most developers are familiar with using Elixir for web development thanks to <a href="https://phoenixframework.org/">the Phoenix web framework</a>. Phoenix gained traction in the ecosystem because it was the first to fully leverage the language and the platform for building real-time applications besides the usual MVC (Model-View-Controller) offering.</p>
<p>
It all started with Phoenix Channels, as a bi-directional communication between clients and servers, and Phoenix PubSub, which uses Erlang’s distributed compatibilities to broadcast messages across nodes. As far as I know, Phoenix was the first major web framework to provide a multi-node web real-time solution completely out-of-the-box. Regardless if you are using one node or ten nodes, everything just works, with minimal configuration and dependencies.</p>
<p>
Phoenix has matured a lot since its first stable release. Phoenix v1.2 included <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Presence.html">Phoenix Presence</a>, that allows developers to track which users, IoT devices, etc are connected to your cluster right now. No databases or external dependencies required! This is one of the problems that look deceptively simple at first, but once you outline all scalability, performance, and fault-tolerance requirements, it <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/11/17/real-time-collaboration-with-elixir-at-slab/">becomes quite complex</a>. Luckily, Phoenix is running on a platform that excels at these problems, and I am not aware of any other framework that provides such a lean and elegant solution as part of its default stack.</p>
<p>
Most recently, <a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view">Phoenix LiveView</a> was released and brought new ways to build rich, real-time user experiences with server-rendered HTML, inspiring developers to attempt similar solutions for other languages and frameworks. You can read the <a href="https://dockyard.com/blog/2018/12/12/phoenix-liveview-interactive-real-time-apps-no-need-to-write-javascript">original announcement</a> or <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/build-a-real-time-twitter-clone-in-15-minutes-with-live-view-and-phoenix-1-5">learn how to build a real-time Twitter clone in 15 minutes</a>. As part of the <em>Live</em> family, we have also announced <a href="https://twitter.com/josevalim/status/1250846714665357315">Phoenix LiveDashboard</a>, making monitoring and instrumentation a first-class citizen for Phoenix applications.</p>
<h3>
Embedded and IoT</h3>
<p>
While I always expected Elixir to shine for building web applications, I was taken by surprise when I heard about the <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves platform</a> for creating high-end embedded applications. However, once I learned their premise, it all made sense: writing embedded systems <em>is</em> complicated. Reasoning about failures is hard. So what if we could leverage the decades of lessons learnt by Erlang/OTP to design embedded applications? What if a fault on the Wi-Fi driver could be fixed by having a supervisor simply restart it? After all, the first major use of Erlang/OTP was in an embedded system, the Ericsson AXD301 ATM switch.</p>
<p>
Nerves brings the Elixir ecosystem and the battle-tested Erlang VM to edge computing, providing a rich developer experience using proven technology. Nerves started as a one step process for turning an Elixir project into a complete software image for common hardware devices. Today, Nerves is being used in production in industrial automation, machine learning, consumer electronics and more, with <a href="https://farm.bot/">Farmbot</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/08/20/embedded-elixir-at-farmbot/">case</a>) and <a href="https://www.rosepoint.com/">Rose Point Navigation</a> being two of the most notable examples.</p>
<p>
The Nerves team also created <a href="https://www.nerves-hub.org/">NervesHub</a>, a fully open-source device management system. Combining all these technologies makes Elixir a comprehensive language for building end-to-end IoT platforms.</p>
<h3>
Data ingestion and pipelines</h3>
<p>
Shortly after Elixir v1.0 was released, the Elixir Core Team and I started looking into abstractions for tackling data ingestions and data pipelines in Elixir. We ran through a couple designs until we eventually <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2016/07/14/announcing-genstage/">landed on GenStage</a>: a behaviour for exchanging data with back-pressure between Elixir processes and external systems. For an introduction, make sure to check out <a href="https://youtu.be/srtMWzyqdp8?t=242">my keynote introducing both GenStage and Flow</a>.</p>
<p>
Today, almost 5 years later, GenStage has been used by many industries and has become one of the factors driving Elixir adoption. For example, you can read how both <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/08/real-time-communication-at-scale-with-elixir-at-discord/">Discord</a> and <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/27/delivering-social-change-with-elixir-at-change.org/">Change.org</a> have built systems on Elixir and GenStage that handle spikes and run at massive scale.</p>
<p>
However, GenStage was just the beginning. In 2019, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOExnT1PYjs">we announced Broadway</a>, which is a higher-level abstraction on top of GenStage that makes building data ingestion pipelines a breeze. We originally released with Amazon SQS support. Nowadays, RabbitMQ, Google Cloud PubSub, Apache Kafka, and other sources (known as producers in Broadway terms) are also available.</p>
<h3>
Audio/Video streaming</h3>
<p>
Since the Erlang VM was designed for scalable network processing, one can expect to also be an excellent platform for audio and video streaming. However, if you also wanted to process and transform those streams on the fly, the situation becomes much more complicated as you likely have to integrate with native code.</p>
<p>
Luckily, the tables have turned when Erlang/OTP 20 was released a couple years ago with the so-called Dirty NIFs. The Erlang VM always had the ability to invoke native code, but this native code could not run for long, as to not interfere with the preemptive features of the Erlang runtime. Dirty NIFs allow developers to tag native code either as IO or CPU bound, which runs on specific threads. Between ports (I/O based), NIFs, Dirty NIFs, and remote nodes, developers now have many options to interface with native code with different performance and reliability guarantees. That’s exactly the foundation the <a href="http://www.membraneframework.org/">Membrane Framework</a> builds on top of.</p>
<p>
Membrane was extracted from RadioKit, a startup aiming at disrupting the radio broadcasting industry. Originally it focused on processing and mixing audio. Later, <a href="https://www.swmansion.com/">Software Mansion</a> acquired the framework and provided stable funding and a solid team to help it grow into a full-scale framework. Currently, it allows developers to process, transmit, broadcast, and transform audio and videos streams on the fly. Whether you are building a Twitch clone, a VOD application or a video conferencing system, Membrane provides a growing set of high-level abstractions and pre-made modules so you don’t have to dive into idiosyncrasies of particular codecs, protocols, and formats. </p>
<h2>
Looking ahead: what is coming in 2021</h2>
<p>
The year of 2021 looks very exciting for the Erlang Ecosystem and the Elixir community. In this section, we are going to mention some of the things we expect to see in 2021.</p>
<h3>
Erlang/OTP 24 with JIT</h3>
<p>
In September 2020, <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/2745">Lukas Larsson and the Erlang/OTP team</a> announced a JIT compiler for the Erlang VM called BeamAsm. How faster the JIT will be in practice depends on your application but the results posted in the announcement are promising. To quote Lukas:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
If we run the JSON benchmarks found in the <a href="https://github.com/devinus/poison/tree/master/bench">Poison</a> or <a href="https://github.com/michalmuskala/jason/tree/master/bench">Jason</a>, BeamAsm achieves anything from 30% to 130% increase (average at about 70%) in the number of iterations per second for all Erlang/Elixir implementations. For some benchmarks, BeamAsm is even faster than the pure C implementation <a href="https://github.com/davisp/jiffy">jiffy</a>.  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>
More complex applications tend to see a more moderate performance increase, for instance, RabbitMQ is able to handle 30% to 50% more messages per second depending on the scenario.  </p>
</blockquote>

However, with the development of technology, the support has included more and more new functions, and its importance has grown. The COVID-19 pandemic also contributed to the development of IT support. In this article, we will figure out why IT support is important for business, why its quality directly affects the company’s profits, and what the prospects for this area are.</span></p>
<h2><span>The historical value of IT support</span></h2>
<p><span>The responsibilities of this service have grown in number steadily as technology, methodologies, and customer relationships have evolved.</span></p>
<p><span>Today, the main functions of the IT help desk include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>technical support for the company’s employees;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>support of external clients – users of the company’s products;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>maintenance of the company’s infrastructure and its applications/products;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>control over the execution of requests at the agreed service levels;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Call Center/Help Desk;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>work with the Service Desk system;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>filling the knowledge base;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>monitoring the quality of the company’s IT services;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>communication with clients, employees, contractors.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>And this is without a lot of smaller tasks that differ depending on the specifics of a company. Most of them are hidden from prying eyes like the underwater part of an iceberg.</span></p>
<p><span>Despite the deepness of modern IT support, there is an opinion that this support for both employees and customers does not have an essential impact on the financial performance of the company. This point of view has been formed over decades, so no wonder that changing it is very difficult. But the world does not stand still, and changes have affected this function of the business as well.</span></p>
<p><span>It is the support service that is often the first point of contact between customers and a company, and it has great potential to take their relationship to the next level. Modern IT support specialists are no longer bearded geeks in sweaters who speak incomprehensible tech jargon.</span></p>
<p><span>Nowadays, a qualified IT support specialist is a person with a high level of sociability and empathy, as well as teamwork and problem-solving skills. Such a specialist is constantly evolving and puts the needs of the client first. And they can give the business something more than solving clients’ problems and advising them.</span></p>
<h2><span>COVID-19: a tragedy or a chance?</span></h2>
<p><span>The coronavirus pandemic directly affected the development of IT support services, just as it affected all businesses across the world. From the digital transformation era perspective, these changes present a tremendous opportunity for CEOs around the world.</span></p>
<p><span>The pandemic has greatly accelerated the global development of digital processes. Companies that managed to implement digital solutions in time have already seen practical benefits for their businesses. Those that hadn’t, realized their oversight with the beginning of the transition of the whole world to remote work. There is no doubt that the trend will not decline but, vice versa, only grow in the coming years.</span></p>
<p><span>This opens up new opportunities and forces businesses to be more flexible, including in IT processes. In addition, the massive transfer of IT teams around the world to remote work has opened the eyes of companies to the effectiveness of remote support. More and more companies are announcing their plans to work in this mode at least for the whole of 2020, and some are organizing this process on an ongoing basis.</span></p>
<p><span>The work of IT support is going to a new level and increasing the value of the outsourcing format. Outsourcing companies often have a higher level of process maturity and a larger pool of resources than internal IT teams. Moreover, outsourcing services also actively introduce new digital approaches and change their models in accordance with modern customer requirements. Their flexibility is now extremely high, and the benefits of using their services are maximized.</span></p>
<p><span>These companies operate at agreed levels of service, so the client can be confident in the quality of service they will receive and how much it will cost. Both </span><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/customer-service-support/insights/trending-topics/coronavirus-impact"><span>Gartner</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/digital-transformation/articles/delivering-customer-service-during-COVID-19.html"><span>Deloitte</span></a><span> are reporting the increased value of outsourcing services during the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span>There are many examples of successful transfer of customer service to outsourcing companies, including by such well-known entities as Microsoft, Dell, Ford Motor Company, CISCO, General Electric, American Express. Cost reduction remains one of the major reasons for such transfers, but </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/operations/articles/global-outsourcing-survey.html"><span>Deloitte research shows</span></a><span> that modern companies are concentrating more on the overall value they can get from the outsourcing services instead of just cost savings.</span></p>
<h2><span>The digital future of IT support services</span></h2>
<p><span>Digital transformation is primarily perceived as the introduction of new technologies and communication channels in the work with clients. More and more companies are implementing chatbots, virtual assistants, notifications via messengers, polls via social networks, etc. Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Big Data are also increasingly used to create additional customer benefits in IT services.</span></p>
<p><span>But even this is not enough to get the maximum benefits of the current period of digital transformation. Now the most important thing is to change how the operating model of IT support works with clients. All operational processes need to be improved to meet the new service requirements that are put forward by today’s customers.</span></p>
<p><span>IT support teams should reorient from their usual performance indicators to those that are more important for the business:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Net Promoter Score</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Customer Lifetime Value</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Customer Profitability.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>The new benchmarks for the IT support function should be aimed at increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty by creating additional benefits for them. And IT support team leaders should reconsider processes much more often. This will ensure that the quality of their teams’ work meets the current requirements of clients.</span></p>
<p><b>Additional features of the support service that add value to your business:</b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Analyzing customer needs and behaviors</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Identifying key touchpoints of customers</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Growing customers’ loyalty through a personalized experience</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Demonstrating to customers how they can get the best from the new digital solutions</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Providing fast feedback about the efficiency of new methods and technologies</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span>All this makes it obvious that there is a need for urgent changes in the operational approaches of IT support for every company that wants to achieve maximum success in working with clients. The old approaches are hopelessly outdated, and the competition is higher than ever before. At the same time, the scale of the ongoing digital changes is enormous and brings many benefits to the business.</span></p>
<p><span>Those companies that adapt to the demands of the new era faster than others will be the first to maximize their competitive advantages. And clients, for their part, will tend to work with those companies that are actively implementing digital solutions in their work for the sake of the clients’ convenience. This is a win-win situation.</span></p>
<h2><span>Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span>The transformation has already affected all aspects of the business: sales, marketing, development, and so on. But the support service has one big advantage over all others: it historically has the maximum flexibility necessary to work effectively with customers. In a fast-paced world, support teams who work directly with customers on a daily basis are used to changing their approaches and tools as soon as required.</span></p>
<p><span>Since customers now more than ever dictate to companies the level of service they receive, the willingness of organizations to respond quickly to these requirements plays center stage. And here, the flexibility of customer service specialists and their developed software skills will be more useful than ever.</span></p>
<p><span>The determination to act and change is needed for one more reason. Digital transformation is not the last of the key trends affecting the business environment. It will be followed by other trends, also critical for business development. The sooner companies start implementing technological innovations, the sooner they will have the opportunity to be among the leaders in their field.</span></p>
<p><span>This mindset is now more important than ever for leaders who determine the strategy for support services for the coming months and years. Today, clients are very demanding and highly value quality service. The opportunities that have opened up for companies in the current era of digital transformation may be exactly the accelerator that many of them dream of. The only question is who is ready to change quickly for the benefit of clients and for the sake of their future – in practice, not just in words.</span></p>

</p>

<p>The first publication of the first VideoLAN NuGet package dates back to April 1st, 2018 (no joke!). We have been steadily adding new packages since then to cover all platforms supported by both LibVLC and .NET.</p>

<p>Today, we actively publish and maintain <strong>15 NuGet packages</strong>, 6 of which  actually containing native platform-specific code. The remaining 9 packages are managed C# DLLs composed of the main binding (<a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/LibVLCSharp/">LibVLCSharp</a>) and various GUI toolkit integrations for getting users up and running quickly.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Xamarin.Android</li>
  <li>Xamarin.iOS</li>
  <li>Xamarin.tvOS</li>
  <li>Xamarin.Mac (Cocoa)</li>
  <li>Windows Classic (WPF, WinForms, GTK)</li>
  <li>Windows Universal (UWP for Desktop, mobile and Xbox)</li>
  <li>Linux including desktop, server and Raspberry Pi (GTK)</li>
  <li>Xamarin.Forms</li>
  <li>Uno Platform (UWP, Android, iOS)</li>
  <li>Avalonia (Windows, macOS, Linux)</li>
</ul>

<p>LibVLCSharp counts about <strong>19 contributors</strong>, with most people doing one-off contributions and mainly 2 active maintainers (<a href="https://github.com/jeremyVignelles">Jérémy</a> and myself). I’d like to thank each of them for their valuable OSS contributions!</p>



<p>Many exciting things! More game engine integrations, ongoing LibVLC 4 support, interop performance improvements and plenty of new integrations, samples and features are yet to be implemented.</p>

<p>We have a diverse and (mostly) well-defined <a href="https://code.videolan.org/videolan/LibVLCSharp/-/issues">backlog</a> of both features to implement and bugs to fix, with a varying degree of difficulty, and always welcome new contributors. We are available on the <a href="https://discord.gg/3h3K3JF">LibVLC community Discord server</a> (320+ members).</p>

<p>I recently mass refactored our production codebase at work. And I did so without the fear of breaking things. It was a full-stack refactor, and I did changes to our apps, test code and DevOps code. After finishing the mass refactor, I did zero manual testing. So, how did I do this? With the help of automated testing like this, of course:</p>

<p>In the rest of this article, I will give you a sense of how large refactors are done in production codebases of large enterprise products. I will talk more about the product that I worked on more in a moment. I will also explain the tools and technologies that helped me in the process of mass refactoring.</p>

<h2 id="what-did-i-do">What Did I Do?</h2>
<p>I have refactored our large production codebase over the span of four months. I did this refactor module by module and product by product. I have probably touched our entire tech stack during this (hence the importance of being a full-stack engineer!). I made changes to our clients (mobile and desktop) in their UI and core code. I adapted our tests code to the changes that I’ve done to the product. I have also changed our DevOps code extensively, to accommodate the changes I’ve done to the product and test code. Following animation is from my method chaining article, which was partly inspired by the changes that I did to our test framework. If you want to check out the full article, it is in the resources section above.</p>

<video width="790" height="300" controls=""><source src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/media/method_chaining.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<p>Changes were mostly technical (i.e. swap one JSON library with another, adapt the code to new UI libs, use method chaining in test code etc.) so correctness of the changes from product management perspective was not entirely relevant. However, verifying that functionality remained the same, and everything continued to work in production as-is was #1 priority. Further code level changes that I’ve done is not the point of this article so I won’t dig deeper. I did most of my refactors using IntelliJ IDEA, which supports all the programming languages we use and has enormous refactoring capabilities. We also have a ton of static code analyzers, linters, and code reformatters built into our continuous-integration process, which was also very helpful in detecting defects at code level early on. Finally, our code peer-review process using pull-requests has the most important code quality assurance factor.</p>

<p>After I was done with the refactors, I made zero manual testing on our products. Neither did I have any fear of breaking things during this mass refactor. And oh boy, did break things! So why was I not fearful of breaking things? Because I knew that I could identify and fix what I broke during the refactoring process. I will talk more about our quality assurance tech in a moment.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-our-product">What is Our Product?</h2>
<p>Our product is a large enterprise VPN software. It has been under development by a large team for the last 5+ years, so it has a considerably complex codebase. It has key hardware integrations, so reliability is quite important. When you integrate software and hardware features, you get a large surface area for bugs. Testing the hardware integrations is incredibly daunting since you need to get the hardware in test to the right state to test things correctly every time. In addition, we have clients for all major desktop and mobile OSes, and a vast DevOps infrastructure to automate the assembly of these clients. I want to leave a bit of mystery here, as I will write a separate article on what I do in my day-to-day work.</p>

<h2 id="why-was-i-so-confident">Why Was I So Confident?</h2>
<p>As a senior engineer, it is my duty to initiate and take on riskier projects. When done right, a large refactor and a refresh of the codebase can make working with the products a joy again. While initiating this mass refactor project, I was fully confident that I would not end up destroying our products, as I knew that a considerable number of automated end-to-end tests that I implemented over long years got my back. Also, I have recently created a mobile device farm, extending our end-to-end testing coverage to mobile devices. As you can see in the following photo, I have Android devices on the left and iOS devices on the right, and a MacBook as the host. All the connected devices are controller by the host machine:</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/how-i-mass-refactored-our-production-codebase-without-fear/media/device_farm.jpg" alt="My Device Farm Implementation"></p>

<p>Mass end-to-end testing like this, also known as acceptance testing, makes mass refactoring a less worrisome task. However, you still have to trigger tests every time you complete a part of your refactor and make sure to fix any broken tests or features. Depending on the test suite size and availability of automation hardware, this might take days. Of course, to verify the full correctness of my refactors, I had the run the entire test suite, and not just the end-to-end tests. Our unit and integration test coverage is also solid and they run on our CI servers as a part of our build process. Especially having integration tests that verify our software design decisions were invaluable, including our API endpoints and other 3rd party software integrations. Especially when dealing with our software’s modules written in scripting languages (JavaScript, Python, etc.), our unit tests came in quite handy. I depend on those unit tests to verify that I broke none of the expected input/output types, as the compiler cannot do it for me in a dynamic programming languages</p>

<p>Before going into device farms, let me briefly mention automated testing.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-automated-testing">What is Automated Testing?</h2>
<p>In summary, automated testing has three main parts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Unit testing. Unit testing tests the smallest sections of your code, which is mostly going to be your functions. You can even have multiple tests per function based on the behavior of your functions. And there are some great frameworks for it like NUnit, JUnit, Mocha, etc. which will help you organize your tests better.</li>
  <li>Integration testing. As the name suggests, integration testing tests the integration of your software components. For instance, one integration test can test the integration of multiple functions, classes, or even modules. You can use the same unit testing frameworks that I mentioned above for integration testing too.</li>
  <li>End-to-end (acceptance) testing. This is the endgame. End-to-end testing is where you test your product just like an end-user would do. You simulate real user interactions with your product using end-to-end testing frameworks like Selenium, Appium, etc. More on this in the next section.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have a complete video on software quality assurance where I describe how software companies test their products, starting with unit tests and going all the way to end-to-end (acceptance) testing level. If you want to see it, link to it is in the resources section above.</p>

<h2 id="device-farms-and-test-labs">Device Farms and Test Labs</h2>
<p>Now comes the fun part. This is where you get to play with your products on real devices. Of course, you don’t want to play with the devices indefinitely; you want to automate that process. For my device farm implementation for our products, I used Appium, which uses Selenium’s WebDriver protocol for all clients. Appium can control both web apps and native apps. It can even control hybrid web UI + native core apps (i.e. Electron apps). A single Appium server instance running in a host machine can control all the connected devices, and the apps and browsers installed on those devices:</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/how-i-mass-refactored-our-production-codebase-without-fear/media/appium_architecture_diagram.png" alt="Appium Architecture Diagram"></p>

<p>In my implementation, I connected all our mobile devices to a single host machine via a USB hub, and the host machine is controller by Appium:</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/how-i-mass-refactored-our-production-codebase-without-fear/media/device_farm_usb_hub.jpg" alt="Device Farm With USB Hub"></p>

<p>Now let’s watch my device farm implementation in live-action in our office:</p>

<video width="790" height="300" controls=""><source src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/media/device_farm.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<p>As you can see, I have both Android and iOS devices connected to a single MacBook. Everything except for one power-hungry tablet is going through the USB hub. It is a little messy, but it has been working great. When someone triggers an automated test run, one of the devices is selected at random for the given platform. Then the entire test suit runs on that device, and the test results are collected. There is quite a bit of room for improvement, but this, along with our similar setup for desktop clients, enabled me to make extensive changes to our sensitive production codebase with confidence.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize that automated testing on real devices is substantially better than manual testing in the long run. You will save a ton of time via automation like this, and you can keep expending your testing coverage for your optimum quality assurance needs. You really don’t need to take the route that I took and implement all these yourself. You can utilize ready-to-use device farms provided by Google Firebase Test Lab, Amazon Device Farm, etc.:</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/how-i-mass-refactored-our-production-codebase-without-fear/media/firebase_test_lab.png" alt="Firebase Test Lab"></p>

<p>However, if you choose to implement your own device farm, remember that a lot of the publicly available device farms were born from internal implementations as I did. So you can always provide parts of your infrastructure as a service if you ever decide to go IaaS/SaaS route.</p>

<p>As a bonus in my implementation, people can RDP into the main test machine and control the phones remotely for manual testing when needed. Also, there are …</p></section></div></div>

<h2 id="how-do-i-use-foam">How do I use Foam?</h2>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> is a tool that supports creating relationships between thoughts and information to help you think better.</p>

<p><img src="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/assets/images/foam-features-dark-mode-demo.png" alt="Foam kitchen sink, showing a few of the key features"></p>

<p>Whether you want to build a <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/">Second Brain</a> or a <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/">Zettelkasten</a>, write a book, or just get better at long-term learning, <strong>Foam</strong> can help you organise your thoughts if you follow these simple rules:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a single <strong>Foam</strong> workspace for all your knowledge and research following the <a href="#getting-started">Getting started</a> guide.</li>
  <li>Write your thoughts in markdown documents (I like to call them <strong>Bubbles</strong>, but that might be more than a little twee). These documents should be atomic: Put things that belong together into a single document, and limit its content to that single topic. (<a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/#principles">source</a>)</li>
  <li>Use Foam’s shortcuts and autocompletions to link your thoughts together with <code>[[wiki-links]]</code>, and navigate between them to explore your knowledge graph.</li>
  <li>Get an overview of your <strong>Foam</strong> workspace using a [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/features/graph-visualisation.md" title="Graph Visualisation">graph-visualisation</a>] (⚠️ WIP), and discover relationships between your thoughts with the use of [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/features/backlinking.md" title="Backlinking">backlinking</a>].</li>
</ol>

<p>Foam is a like a bathtub: <em>What you get out of it depends on what you put into it.</em></p>

<h2 id="whats-in-a-foam">What’s in a Foam?</h2>

<p>Like the soapy suds it’s named after, <strong>Foam</strong> is mostly air.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The editing experience of <strong>Foam</strong> is powered by VS Code, enhanced by workspace settings that glue together [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recommended-extensions.md" title="Recommended Extensions">recommended-extensions</a>] and preferences optimised for writing and navigating information.</li>
  <li>To back up, collaborate on and share your content between devices, Foam pairs well with <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</li>
  <li>To publish your content, you can set it up to publish to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> with zero code and zero config, or to any website hosting platform like <a href="http://netlify.com/">Netlify</a> or <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>⚠️ Foam is still in preview. Expect the experience to be a little rough.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These instructions assume you have a GitHub account, and you have Visual Studio Code installed.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Use the <a href="https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template">foam-template project</a> to generate a new repository. If you’re logged into GitHub, you can just hit this button:</p>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template/generate" data-icon="octicon-repo-template" data-size="large" aria-label="Use this template foambubble/foam-template on GitHub">Use this template</a></p>

    <p><em>If you want to keep your thoughts to yourself, remember to set the repository private, or if you don’t want to use GitHub to host your workspace at all, choose <a href="https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template/archive/master.zip"><strong>Download as ZIP</strong></a> instead of <strong>Use this template</strong>.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository">Clone the repository locally</a> and open it in VS Code.</p>

    <p><em>Open the repository as a folder using the <code>File &gt; Open...</code> menu item. In VS Code, “open workspace” refers to <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces">multi-root workspaces</a>.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When prompted to install recommended extensions, click <strong>Install all</strong> (or <strong>Show Recommendations</strong> if you want to review and install them one by one)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>After setting up the repository, open <code>.vscode/settings.json</code> and edit, add or remove any settings you’d like for your Foam workspace.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> doesn’t have features in the traditional sense. Out of the box, you have access to all features of VS Code and all the [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recommended-extensions.md" title="Recommended Extensions">recommended-extensions</a>] you choose to install, but it’s up to you to discover what you can do with it!</p>

<p>Head over to [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes/recipes.md" title="Recipes">recipes</a>] for some useful patterns and ideas!</p>

<h2 id="call-to-adventure">Call To Adventure</h2>

<p>The goal of <strong>Foam</strong> is to be your personal companion on your quest for knowledge.</p>

<p>It’s currently about “10% ready” relative to all the features I’ve thought of, but I’ve only thought of ~1% of the features it could have, and I’m excited to learn from others.</p>

<p>I am using it as my personal thinking tool. By making it public, I hope to learn from others not only how to improve Foam, but also to improve how I learn and manage information.</p>

<p>If that sounds like something you’re interested in, I’d love to have you along on the journey.</p>

<p>Aurora is an <a href="https://cloud.netapp.com/blog/aws-cvo-blg-aws-databases-the-power-of-purpose-built-database-engines" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AWS database</a>&nbsp;service that is compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL, but uses an innovative database engine behind the scenes. Applications that currently use MySQL/PostgreSQL can be migrated to Aurora with minor or no changes.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>An Aurora database instance can store between 10 GB—64 TB, with data divided into 10 GB blocks and distributed on different disks.</p>
<p>Aurora offers easy scalability—storage is scaled automatically when the database grows, and to support more read requests, you can create up to 15 Aurora Read Replicas.</p>

<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">
<p>Relational Database Service (RDS) is a managed database service that supports several popular database engines, including: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, MariaDB, and Oracle.</p>
<p>RDS can help you perform a wide range of database management tasks, including data backup and recovery, patching, and migrations.</p>
<p>RDS automatically backs up database instances, captures daily snapshots of data, preserves transaction logs, and enables point-in-time recovery. Additionally, the service automatically patches database engine software.</p>
<p>To improve the reliability and availability of workloads, RDS enables replication of databases with automated failover across several availability zones.</p>

<h2 id="sub_2">AWS Aurora vs RDS: Feature Comparison</h2>
<p>Here are a few ways Aurora compares to Amazon RDS.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p><strong>Amazon RDS</strong> improves I/O performance by using SSDs for database storage. You can choose between two SSD storage options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Optimized OLTP</strong>—storage is optimized for high I/O transaction database workloads. Each database instance can support up to 30,000 IOPS.</li>
<li><strong>General purpose</strong>—cost effective hardware offering 3 IOPS per stored GB.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Amazon Aurora</strong>&nbsp;improves on the performance of standard MySQL by 5x, and improves on standard PostgreSQL by 2x, with the same hardware configuration. Aurora is a new database engine built to make the most of available compute capacity, memory, and network bandwidth.</p>
<h3>Storage</h3>
<p><strong>Amazon RDS</strong> can provision storage up to 6TB, on-demand without downtime.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon Aurora</strong> automatically increases storage from a minimum of 10 GB to a maximum of 64 TB, in increments of 10 GB, based on current usage—you do not need to pre-configure storage. Storage scaling does not affect database performance.</p>
<p>However, for MySQL, Aurora only supports the InnoDB storage engine. Tables are automatically converted if they use another storage engine.</p>
<h3>Replication</h3>
<p><strong>Amazon RDS </strong>allows up to five live database copies, known as read replicas. RDS failover is done manually, so some data loss may occur.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon Aurora</strong> also provides read replicas, which share the same data volume as the original database instance. Up to 15 read replicas are supported. Failover is done fully automatically with no data loss. It also supports creating a highly available database cluster with synchronous replication across multiple availability zones.</p>
<h3>Backup</h3>
<p><strong>Amazon RDS</strong> performs a daily snapshot of your database, and saves transaction logs to allow point-in-time recovery. The snapshot occurs during a backup window you can specify. While the snapshot is being taken, storage I/O may be interrupted while data is copied, affecting database performance. Backups are saved to S3 with very high durability.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon Aurora</strong> backups are continuous, incremental backups that do not affect database performance. Also, there is no need to take frequent snapshots to enable point in time recovery.</p>
<h2 id="sub_3">Amazon RDS or Aurora? Factors to Consider Before Choosing</h2>
<p>We covered a feature by feature comparison of the two database services. Here are some other important considerations before you select the service that is right for you.</p>
<p><strong>Availability</strong></p>
<p>Especially for production databases, <a href="https://cloudian.com/guides/backup-cloud-storage/data-backup-in-depth/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">data backup </a>is a critical consideration. Aurora offers higher availability and better resilience than RDS, due to its unique storage model, and ability to perform continuous backups and restore with a very low recovery point objective (RPO).</p>
<p><strong>Database engine support</strong></p>
<p>Aurora only supports MySQL and PostgreSQL. If you need to run other database engines, such as SQL Server, you will need to opt for RDS.</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong></p>
<p>Aurora is generally more expensive than RDS for the same workloads. RDS is priced based on type and size of instance and EBS volume. Aurora pricing is mainly based on instance size and storage is billed according to actual usage. Keep in mind read replicas represent an extra cost in both platforms.</p>
<h2 id="sub_4">AWS Aurora and RDS with Thundra</h2>
<p>Thundra provides deep insights into the microservice applications. Todays’ distributed applications are developed and served on the cloud, and modern tools like Thundra enable developers to trace their apps and debug the code easily. Thundra instruments in a plug and play fashion and automatically traces the requests made to Aurora and RDS databases. You can understand what the query is and the duration of the query made to the database. Thundra provides data privacy by enabling the users to mask their sensitive data inside the calls. <a href="https://blog.thundra.io/which-database-should-i-choose-for-my-serverless-applications" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Check this blog post</a> where we discuss which database to choose for cloud applications.</p></span>

<h2>Reverse Engineering The Great Escape</h2>

<p><dfn>The Great Escape</dfn> is a classic 1986 prison break game for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum">48K ZX Spectrum</a>. I've spent a considerable amount of time reverse engineering its routines and documenting its workings while simultaneously reimplementing it as portable C code. The following pages describe the process I went through.</p>

<p>This is an expanded-upon write-up of some of what I can dimly recall saying while presenting <a href="http://slides.com/dpt/the-great-escape/#/">these slides</a> to my team at INSIDE Secure (formerly Metaforic, now called <a href="https://www.verimatrix.com/">Verimatrix</a>) in Glasgow at a talk in January 2016.</p>

A lot has changed for me. I gave up management by quitting my job as a Director of Engineering and took a job as just a good ol' Software Engineer at <a href="https://ghostinspector.com/">Ghost Inspector</a>. A lot of reasoning went into that decision, but to sum it up: I was sick of commuting and managing. Considering what's happened in the last year, I'm glad I made that choice!</p><p>As a lifelong introvert, I was being drained on a daily basis by having to manage other people. I had been juggling that while still coding for about four years straight. During that time, I was a user of Ghost Inspector, so when the opportunity opened up, I jumped at the chance to work there and I'm so glad that I did.</p><p>What attracted me to Ghost Inspector was the product, but what has kept me here is the amazing work environment. There may be bigger, more exciting challenges in the job market, but working here is without a doubt the best job I've ever had! For most of my career, I jumped from company to company, looking for that "hockey stick growth". But what I eventually realized is that I'd rather have stability and trust. At previous startups, we were only stable for the few months after the most recent funding round.&nbsp;<a href="https://ghostinspector.com/about/">Justin and the rest of the team</a>&nbsp;have built a business that grows at a very sustainable pace. We're only beholden to our customers, not venture capital investors. The only deadlines are the ones we set for ourselves, and those are pretty rare.</p><p>The typical Agile process used by most software companies creates a lot of meetings that, in my opinion, are not respectful of a software developer's time. The majority of meetings are focused on determining what they should work on, when they should start, and how long it should take. A system designed around tracking velocity with points, will heavily incentivize speed and efficiency. So now all those meetings talking about work, instead of doing it, feel like impediments to completing points. I have worked at places that handle this better than others, but there's always that underlying pressure that creates at least a bit of animosity around meetings.</p><p>We have a completely different process at Ghost Inspector. I would describe our software development methodology as Agile-lite -- we take the few good parts and leave the rest behind. We have a backlog of epics and stories with all the good features we want to deliver to our customers. However we&nbsp;<strong>don't do sprints</strong>. Without sprints, we're able to skip all the other Agile rituals that I personally loath. Here's a list of all the&nbsp;<a href="https://dzone.com/articles/types-of-meetings-in-scrum-and-agile">meetings we don't do</a>. No sprints means no sprint planning. No points means no estimation meetings. Without a product owner needing to constantly check the velocity of every story, we don't need to give a status update every day. We generally only meet once a week. Thankfully, not once do I remember anyone saying the word "blocker".</p><p>I've lost track of the amount of time wasted on just scheduling meetings at previous companies. Even the daily status was always hotly debated. Too early and all the night owls are grumbling. Too late and you risk interrupting the flow of the early birds. I can't tell you how nice it is to stop thinking so much about&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;we work and instead just think about the actual work. My levels of stress have been reduced to an extremely low level while working here. The meetings we do have feel particularly important and useful and I welcome them!</p><p>As a developer, I have all the autonomy I could ever wish for. There are constant opportunities to learn new skills. We don't work on the bleeding edge by any means, but we have a diverse set of projects that allow us to experiment with new technologies. Here's a truncated list of all the different projects I've worked on in the last year and a half:</p><ul><li><a href="https://ghostinspector.com/blog/continuous-integration-testing-for-wordpress/">a WordPress plugin with e2e tests in Docker on CI</a></li><li>two-factor authentication using Auth0</li><li>rebuilt the browser extension in React.js</li><li>built a user-facing search engine with Elasticsearch</li><li>added API endpoints to export to CSV (with documentation!)</li><li>created a deploy script with an <a href="https://github.com/nanovazquez/yargs-interactive">interactive CLI</a> and GitHub action checks</li><li>wrote <a href="https://ghostinspector.com/blog/ghost-inspector-wordpress-plugin/">several</a> <a href="https://ghostinspector.com/blog/develop-wordpress-plugin-with-webpack-and-react/">different</a> <a href="https://ghostinspector.com/blog/automated-ui-testing-for-wordpress/">blog</a> <a href="https://ghostinspector.com/blog/continuous-integration-testing-for-wordpress/">posts</a></li></ul><p>All of this is possible because we have a rock-solid customer base, a stable system for our application, a team who trusts and respects each other, and a CEO who enables us to do our best work. I'm really happy to have joined the team.</p><p>Follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/simpixelated">Twitter</a> and don't hesitate to send me a message if you have any questions about moving from management back to individual contributor, or using the good parts of agile, or how to avoid meetings!

<hr>

<p>Email is a powerful tool that is an inextricable part of everyone’s lives.
Despite countless valiant efforts to kill it and replace it with something
better, email continues to live on in more or less the same form it has had
since the 1990s. Technology that endures this long deserves a fair amount of
attention and praise.</p>

<p>There are two main reasons why email continues to be useful today. It is simple
to use, and it is not owned or controlled by a single company. Every attempted
replacement has failed at excelling in either one or both of those qualities.
Simple tools can often be extended in ways that the original authors never could
have imagined in the beginning. And because users are in control of the core
functionality, new use cases can be explored completely independently.</p>

<p>Computer users have a tendency to over-generalize when solving problems. In
other words, when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. In
this post, we are going to be looking at a lot of nails that can probably be
hammered down with email. At a fundamental level, email clients are tools
designed for storing and retrieving sequences of messages which can contain
arbitrary data. Looking at it this way, it is not difficult to imagine a variety
of use cases that can be accomplished with minimal amounts of scripting.</p>

<p>I do seriously think that email is a solid tool for a lot of these purposes, and
in fact use it as such for a few of these purposes every day. However, the main
purpose of this post is exploration, not general advice.</p>

<h2 id="to-do-list-one-that-you-actually-check">To-Do List (One That You Actually Check)</h2>

<p><img src="http://zanneth.com/assets/post-assets/email/todo-list.png" alt="To-Do List"></p>

<p>The first use case is pretty obvious, and it is one that likely a large number of
people already employ on a daily basis.</p>

<p>By far the single most important productivity discovery that I made in my life
is <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2006/01/04/email-dmz">Inbox Zero</a>. Inbox Zero is
the simple idea that your email inbox should contain only a list of messages
that require some sort of action. Once the action associated with those messages
is completed, the message is archived or moved to a different folder. I have
been using Inbox Zero for years now and I rarely forget to do anything
important after integrating it into my life.</p>

<p>Need to remember to pack for your flight next week? You probably already got a
confirmation about your reservation in your email. Leave it in your inbox until
you are finished preparing for your trip, and archive it when you are done.</p>

<p>How about one-off reminders that are not associated with messages already in
your inbox? Just send an email to yourself with the action item in the subject
line. Use the body of the message to write down any notes you want, and reply to
the message to keep a record of additional notes if you need them.</p>

<p>What about periodic reminders that repeat on some interval, like reminding
yourself to pay a bill on time every month? Write a simple script that sends you
an email about it and schedule it to run once a month. At the end of each month,
you will have a new to-do item in your inbox with an actionable task in the
subject line.</p>

<p>The great part about using email as a to-do list is that you are already
checking it with some degree of regularity. Smartphone apps or web-based to-do
lists quickly lose their value the moment users lose interest or switch to using
something else. They also frequently become buggy or overburdened with features
that don’t add any value. This will never be a problem with email because you
can always use your favorite client as long as it continues to work with the
standard protocols. Syncing across multiple devices is a given, since your email
is already doing this.</p>

<h2 id="news-reader">News Reader</h2>

<p><img src="http://zanneth.com/assets/post-assets/email/rss2email.png" alt="RSS"></p>

<p>RSS is a really elegant and simple way to subscribe to a feed of updates from
your favorite websites. Since the early 2000s, RSS has been integrated into a
lot of different services all across the net, and serves as the foundation for a
variety of different web-based content platforms such as podcasts.</p>

<p>In order to actually use RSS, you need a client that is capable of aggregating
entries from multiple different feeds and displaying them in some manner.
Managing a list of entries, tracking read or unread state, and displaying HTML
content is exactly what every email client is already good at doing.</p>

<p>I like using <a href="https://github.com/rss2email/rss2email">rss2email</a> for this.
rss2email delivers stories from my feeds into a special mailbox on my email
server that I check approximately every morning. Since the end result is just
IMAP messages stored on my email server, I can read them using my favorite
email client on whatever device I happen to be using that day.</p>



<p><img src="http://zanneth.com/assets/post-assets/email/update-blog.png" alt="Updating a Blog"></p>

<p>Setting up a frictionless workflow for updating your personal website can be
rather difficult, especially if you want to be able to do it while on-the-go and
away from your usual workstation.</p>

<p>If you are maintaining a blog on a personal website or for a business, the focus
should primarily be on the content itself and not on writing markup, updating a
source control repository, or publishing static content to a file server or
database. At the end of the day, you want to be able to write your content in a
message and send it to your server to publish.</p>

<p>Writing rich-text or plain-text content, saving drafts, and publishing that
content to a server is the perfect job for an email client. Your email client
can even allow including inline images sent as attachments, or links that point
to other websites. Once you are done writing your post, send it to a special
email address that activates a script on the other end to convert your email
message into a blog post. <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x135.html">PGP</a>
can be used by both the client and the server to ensure that it is actually you
who is authoring the blog post and not someone else. Forget about OAuth or
anything more complicated than that.</p>

<p>Social media feeds can be updated in a similar manner. All of your server-side
functionality can be multiplexed using different email addresses for each
service. For example, you can use <code>blog@mydomain.com</code> to send updates to your
blog, and <code>mastodon@mydomain.com</code> to publish toots on your
<a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a> account. Writing the code for this is a
breeze, since your favorite programming language already has libraries for
dealing with SMTP and IMAP.</p>

<h2 id="a-user-interface-to-a-search-engine-or-database">A User Interface to a Search Engine or Database</h2>

<p>It’s pretty simple to build an API for a web service these days. However,
choosing the right library or designing the right API can sometimes be an
unnecessary burden when working on a personal project that only has one or two
users.</p>

<p>Email can be used as an interface between a user and a web service when the
input and output are simple enough.</p>

<p>For example, imagine that you have a file server with a large amount of photos
stored on it and you want to be able to search those photos and retrieve them at
random. The server could use machine learning libraries such as Tensorflow to
categorize the photos and attach metadata on them.</p>

<p>Instead of building a custom web-based user interface for this, you could use
email instead. The user sends an email with the search term in the subject line,
such as “pizza”, to a special email address that corresponds to the file server
containing the photos. Just like in the previous example, PGP or S-MIME can be
used as an authentication mechanism to ensure that only authorized users can
access the photos being requested. Once the server has collected a search
result, it replies to the query email with matching photos attached as MIME
parts. The email server keeps a record of previous queries, along with their
returned results as replies, in an easily displayable and searchable format.</p>

<h2 id="the-only-limit-is-your-imagination">The Only Limit is Your Imagination</h2>

<p>Connecting email accounts to small shell scripts is a simple but powerful
concept that can unlock a wide variety of different applications. You can build
these apps with the comforting knowledge that they are all based on federated
and robust protocols used by hundreds of different email clients which have
stood the test of time.</p>

<p>Using the rich text editing features of your email client, combined with a
hierarchical organization system based on folders, allows you to do a lot of
tasks that have previously been accomplished using buggy and monolithic tools.
Privacy and security issues that plague web-based tools can be effectively
avoided when using email, because you are in control of both the client and
the server. You also get syncing to multiple devices for free, since IMAP was
designed to facilitate managing email from multiple clients at once since the
beginning.</p>

<p>I’m always interested in learning about new uses of email. If you know about
some of these yourself, send me an email about them.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">






<p> In an announcement that has stunned the computer industry, Ken
Thompson, Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan admitted that the Unix
operating system and C programming language created by them is an
elaborate prank kept alive for over 20 years. Speaking at the recent
UnixWorld Software Development Forum, Thompson revealed the following:</p>

<p> "In 1969, AT&amp;T had just terminated their work with the
GE/Honeywell/AT&amp;T Multics project. Brian and I had started work with an
early release of Pascal from Professor Niklaus Wirth's ETH Labs in
Switzerland and we were impressed with its elegant simplicity and power.
Dennis had just finished reading 'Bored of the Rings', a National Lampoon
parody of the Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. As a lark, we decided
to do parodies of the Multics environment and Pascal. Dennis and I were
responsible for the operating environment. We looked at Multics and
designed the new OS to be as complex and cryptic as possible to maximize
casual users' frustration levels, calling it Unix as a parody of Multics,
as well as other more risque! allusions. We sold the terse command
language to novitiates by telling them that it saved them typing.  </p>

<p> Then Dennis and Brian worked on a warped version of Pascal, called
'A'.  'A' looked a lot like Pascal, but elevated the notion of the direct
memory address (which Wirth had banished) to the central concept of the
"pointer" as an innocuous sounding name for a truly malevolent construct.
Brian must be credited with the idea of having absolutely no standard I/O
specification: this ensured that at least 50% of the typical commercial
program would have to be re-coded when changing hardware platforms.  </p>

<p> Brian was also responsible for pitching this lack of I/O as a feature: 
it allowed us to describe the language as "truly portable". When we found
others were actually creating real programs with A, we removed compulsory
type-checking on function arguments. Later, we added a notion we called
"casting": this allowed the programmer to treat an integer as though it
were a 50kb user-defined structure. When we found that some programmers
were simply not using pointers, we eliminated the ability to pass
structures to functions, enforcing their use in even the simplest
applications. We sold this, and many other features, as enhancements to
the efficiency of the language. In this way, our prank evolved into B,
BCPL, and finally C.  </p>

<p> We stopped when we got a clean compile on the following syntax: 
<code>for(;P("\n"),R-;P("|"))for(e=C;e-;P("_"+(*u++/8)%2))P("|
"+(*u/4)%2);  </code>

</p><p> At one time, we joked about selling this to the Soviets to set their
computer science progress back 20 or more years.  </p>

<p> Unfortunately, AT&amp;T and other US corporations actually began using
Unix and C. We decided we'd better keep mum, assuming it was just a
passing phase. In fact, it's taken US companies over 20 years to develop
enough expertise to generate useful applications using this 1960's
technological parody. We are impressed with the tenacity of the general
Unix and C programmer. In fact, Brian, Dennis and I have never ourselves
attempted to write a commercial application in this environment.  </p>

<p> We feel really guilty about the chaos, confusion and truly awesome
programming projects that have resulted from our silly prank so long ago." 
</p>

<p> Dennis Ritchie said: "What really tore it (just when ADA was catching
on), was that Bjarne Stroustrup caught onto our joke. He extended it to
further parody Smalltalk. Like us, he was caught by surprise when nobody
laughed. So he added multiple inheritance, virtual base classes, and later
...templates. All to no avail. So we now have compilers that can compile
100,000 lines per second, but need to process header files for 25 minutes
before they get to the meat of "Hello, World".  </p>

<p> Major Unix and C vendors and customers, including AT&amp;T, Microsoft,
Hewlett-Packard, GTE, NCR, and DEC have refused comment at this time. 
</p>

<p> Borland International, a leading vendor of object-oriented tools,
including the popular Turbo Pascal and Borland C++, stated they had
suspected for Windows was originally written in C++. Philippe Kahn said:
"After two and a half years programming, and massive programmer burn-outs,
we re-coded the whole thing in Turbo Pascal in three months. I think it's
fair to say that Turbo Pascal saved our bacon". Another Borland spokesman
said that they would continue to enhance their Pascal products and halt
further efforts to develop C/C++.  </p>

<p> Professor Wirth of the ETH Institute and father of the Pascal, Modula
2, and Oberon structured languages, cryptically said "P.T. Barnum was
right." He had no further comments.  </p>

January 13, 2021 | https://cp4space.hatsya.com/2021/01/08/the-neural-network-of-the-stockfish-chess-engine/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://cp4space.hatsya.com/2021/01/08/the-neural-network-of-the-stockfish-chess-engine/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						<p>Last time, we <a href="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/2020/12/13/shallow-trees-with-heavy-leaves/">briefly mentioned</a> the high-level differences between Stockfish and Leela Chess.</p>
<p>To recap, Stockfish evaluates about 100 million positions per second using rudimentary heuristics, whereas Leela Chess evaluates 40 000 positions per second using a deep neural network trained from millions of games of self-play. They also use different tree search approaches: Stockfish uses a variant of alpha-beta pruning, whereas Leela Chess uses Monte Carlo tree search.</p>
<p>An important recent change to Stockfish was to introduce a neural network to evaluate the positions in the search tree, instead of just relying on hardcoded heuristics. It’s still much simpler than Leela Chess’s neural network, and only slows down Stockfish to exploring 50 million positions per second.</p>
<p>The real cleverness of Stockfish’s neural network is that it’s an <strong>efficiently-updatable neural network (NNUE)</strong>. Specifically, it’s a simple feedforward network with:</p>
<ul>
<li>a large (10.5M parameters!) input layer, illustrated below, that can utilise two different levels of sparsity for computational efficiency;</li>
<li>three much smaller layers (with 17.5k parameters in total) which are evaluated densely using vector instructions;</li>
<li>a single scalar output to give a numerical score for the position, indicating how favourable it is for the player about to move.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything is done using integer arithmetic, with 16-bit weights in the first layer and 8-bit weights in the remaining layers.</p>
<h3>The input layer</h3>
<p>Let’s begin by studying the first — and most interesting — layer. Here’s an illustration I made using Wolfram Mathematica:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nnue-initial.png" alt="" width="640" height="760" srcset="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nnue-initial.png 640w, https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nnue-initial-253x300.png 253w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></p>
<p>The inputs to the layer are two sparse binary arrays, each consisting of 41024 elements. It may seem highly redundant to encode a chess position using 82048 binary features, but this is similar to <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2016/06/wide-deep-learning-better-together-with.html">an approach</a> (called ‘feature crosses’) used in recommender systems.</p>
<p>What are the two sparse binary arrays, and why do they have 41024 features? My preferred way of interpreting these two arrays are as the ‘worldviews’ of the white king and the black king. In particular, the differences are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coordinate systems:</strong> because black and white pawns move in opposite directions, the two players need to ‘see the board from opposite angles’. This already happens in regular (human) chess because the two players are seated opposite each other at the chessboard, so one player’s ‘top’ is the other player’s ‘bottom’. If you imagine each player numbering the squares from top to bottom, left to right, then any physical square would be called <em>n</em> by one player and 63 − <em>n</em> by the other player.</li>
<li><strong>Piece types:</strong> instead of viewing the pieces as black or white, a player sees it as either ‘mine’ or ‘theirs’. The 10 non-king piece types are thus {my pawn, their pawn, my knight, their knight, my bishop, their bishop, my rook, their rook, my queen, their queen}.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason for these ‘player-relative coordinate systems’ is that it means that Stockfish can use the same neural network irrespective of whether it’s playing as white or black. The network uses <em>both</em> your king’s worldview and your enemy king’s worldview for evaluating a position, because they’re both highly relevant (you want to protect your own king and capture your enemy’s king).</p>
<p>So, why does each worldview have 41024 features? It can be seen as an outer product (or tensor product) of:</p>
<ul>
<li>a 64-element feature encoding the position of the king whose worldview this is, in their own coordinate system. This is ‘one-hot encoding’, where exactly one of the 64 entries is ‘1’ and the other 63 entries are ‘0’.</li>
<li>a 641-element feature encoding, for each of the 64 × 10 ordered pairs (square, piece-type), whether or not that square is occupied by that piece. The 641st element is unused, and is (according to the <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Stockfish_NNUE">Chess Programming Wiki</a>) apparently a result of the network being ported from Shogi to chess.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the two 64-by-641 outer product matrices* is then flattened (the matrix is ‘reshaped’ into a vector with the same entries) to yield the corresponding 41024-element ‘sparse worldview’. In the input layer, each of the two 41024-element sparse worldviews are then affinely transformed to form a 256-element ‘dense worldview’.</p>
<p><strong>*Important note:</strong> the 41024-element sparse binary arrays are never explicitly materialised, either as a 64-by-641 matrix or as a 41024-element vector. The Stockfish NNUE effectively ‘fuses’ the construction of these sparse vectors with the subsequent affine transformation (described below), updating the 256-element dense worldviews directly when the configuration of pieces on the chessboard is modified.</p>
<p>There are <strong>two levels of sparsity</strong> which are utilised when computing this affine transformation from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7B41024%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbb{R}^{41024}" title="\mathbb{R}^{41024}"> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7B256%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbb{R}^{256}" title="\mathbb{R}^{256}">, allowing the network to be efficiently evaluated many times in a tree search:</p>
<ul>
<li>the 41024-element implicit vectors are themselves sparse: the number of nonzero elements is equal to the number of non-king pieces on the board.</li>
<li>moving a piece typically changes very few of the entries of the vector: if it’s a regular non-king move, only 2 entries change; if it’s a non-king move with capture, then 3 entries change.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s this second aspect which warrants the name ‘efficiently updatable’: when a move is made (or unmade, since we’re doing a tree search), we only need to add/subtract a few 256-element matrix columns from the resulting ‘dense worldview’ to update it.</p>
<p>Unless a king is moved, this (2 or 3 vector additions/subtractions) beats summing all of the matrix columns corresponding to nonzero entries (up to 30 vector additions), which in turn unconditionally beats doing a regular dense matrix-vector multiplication (41024 vector additions). That is to say, the second-level sparsity is about 10 times more efficient than the first-level sparsity, which is in turn about 1000 times more efficient than naively doing a dense matrix-vector multiplication.</p>
<p>The two dense worldviews are concatenated according to which player is about to move, producing a 512-element vector, which is elementwise clamped to [0, 127]. This elementwise clamping is the nonlinear activation function of the input layer, and (as we’ll describe) the hidden layers use a similar activation function. We can think of this as a ‘clipped ReLU’, which is <a href="https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/blob/master/src/nnue/layers/clipped_relu.h">exactly what the Stockfish source code calls it</a>.</p>
<h3>The remaining layers</h3>
<p>The two hidden layers each use 8-bit weights and 32-bit biases. The activation function first divides the resulting 32-bit integer by 64 before again clamping to [0, 127], ready to be fed into the next layer. The output layer also uses 8-bit weights and 32-bit biases, but with no nonlinear activation function.</p>
<p>The first hidden layer takes 512 inputs (the clamped concatenated worldviews) and produces 32 outputs. The second hidden layer takes those 32 values as inputs, and again produces 32 outputs. The output layer takes those 32 values as inputs, and produces a single scalar output.</p>
<p>Since these subsequent layers are applied to dense vectors, they can’t use the same ‘efficiently updatable’ approach as the input layer; that’s why they’re necessarily substantially smaller. They can, however, use hardware vectorisation instructions (SSE/AVX) to apply the linear transformation and activation function.</p>
<p>This scalar output is then <a href="http://www.talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=75506&amp;start=9">further postprocessed</a> using other Stockfish heuristics, including taking into account the 50-move rule which isn’t otherwise incorporated into the evaluation function.</p>
<p>Observe that the neural network doesn’t actually have complete information, such as whether a pawn has just moved two squares (relevant to <em>en passant</em>), whether a king is able to castle, and various other information pertaining to the rather complicated rules for determining a draw. This is okay: the network is only being used as a cheap approximate evaluation for a position; when deciding what move to make, Stockfish performs a very deep tree search and only uses this approximate evaluation in the leaves.</p>
<p>Equivalently, you can think of this as being a massive refinement of the approach of ‘look a few moves ahead and see whether either player gains a material or positional advantage’, using a neural network as a much more sophisticated position-aware alternative of crudely ‘counting material’.</p>
<p>This is a neural network, so the weight matrices and bias vectors of the layers were learned by training the network on millions of positions and using backpropagation and a gradient-based optimiser. Of course, for supervised learning, you need a ‘ground truth’ for the network to attempt to learn, which seems somewhat circular: how do you even gather training data? The answer is that you use the classical version of Stockfish to evaluate positions <strong>using the deep tree search</strong>, and use that as your training data.</p>
<p>In theory, you could then train another copy of the NNUE using the NNUE-enhanced Stockfish as the evaluation function, and then iterate this process. Leela Chess does the same thing: its current network is trained on positions evaluated by using deep lookahead with the previous network as the leaf evaluation function. Note that the construction of the training data is orders of magnitude more expensive than training the network with this data, as you’re doing thousands of evaluations of the previous network (owing to the deep tree search) to construct each item of training data for the new network.</p>
<h3>Further reading</h3>
<p>The network is <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Stockfish_NNUE">described and illustrated</a> on the Chess Programming Wiki, which also has tonnes of references to forum discussions and other references. The first description of an NNUE was a Japanese paper by Yu Nasu (who suggested it for the board game Shogi instead of chess); the paper has <a href="https://github.com/asdfjkl/nnue">since been translated</a> into English and German. There’s also the Stockfish source code, which is very well organised (there’s <a href="https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/tree/master/src/nnue">a directory</a> for the NNUE) and clearly written.</p>

<p>This is a video of The Action Lab’s James Orgill painting the entire interior of a room he made out of insulation board with the world’s blackest commercially available paint, Musou black, which absorbs 99.4% of light. He then turns on an overhead light bulb to see what it looks like inside. It looks…weird. My eyes did not like that. Of course my eyes don’t like much besides being closed and napping if we’re being perfectly honest. Although occasionally they do request I push on them really hard with the fleshy parts of my palms below the thumbs until I get a headache and see all sorts of painful colors and patterns, but that’s rare. </p>
<p>Keep going for the video, the reveal and experimenting begins at 3:30.</p>

        <p id="6595f0c7-f94b-4772-8c12-22b107c82c47">End-user databases are all the buzz these days — Notion, Airtable, Coda, Roam, etc. These products have made it possible for people to model information in a way that feels more natural and intuitive to the way we experience it in our daily lives.</p>
        <p id="69014b56-b04f-4baf-be70-2c0ba0ad30e9">I love building products like Notion, but building these kinds of products is hard. For two reasons:</p>
        <ol id="3c07bc59-4c8a-4b48-bdb0-1bf930336c2e" start="1">
          <li>Most people don't have the technical literacy about databases and information architecture to actually automate and organize their lives with these tools.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol id="d5625fcf-2e32-45ce-acc4-d73e1d38d037" start="2">
          <li>The databases we have today aren't well-suited for dynamic user-generated filters and sorts.</li>
        </ol>
        <p id="aa0edb68-c072-4214-acf9-8e6e243900dd">This second challenge is more technical and I will hide all of these programmer-related details behind a toggle so you don't have to read them if you'd like.</p>
        <ul id="33a92bec-cc3c-4881-9fda-d91198d3ffee">
          <li>
            <details>
              <summary>🤖 Technical Details</summary>
              <p id="64d9a82d-8237-4a9f-b83f-eb9eae786157">Underneath any end-user database is <em>another</em> database and so much complexity arises from the challenge of building a database inside a database. Solutions to this problem vary widely and make some sort of trade-off between scalability (performance) and complexity.</p>
              <p id="9dd2cc1a-1eb6-4af8-9c22-d486c3e9dc99">Some applications load the entire end-user database in-memory. This creates long initial load times, but really performant interactions once the application loads. There are obvious scalability issues with this approach, but it is fairly simple to implement.</p>
              <p id="e10696df-1d8a-47ff-9365-701d9ff58d00">Other applications resort to O(n) scans on the server to fetch data and filter/sort records in memory with a few caching and indexing optimizations when convenient. The problem here is that users can create their own columns and filters dynamically. If your cloud application is backed by a SQL database, for example, it’s worrisome to allow users to edit the database schema and create an unbounded number of tables and indexes. Thus, you must resort to filtering records in-memory.</p>
              <p id="30d92414-92a1-4469-99ba-643219826c94">If you're dedicated to O(log n) queries, you'll need to build indexes yourself (unless there's some amazing database I am unaware of). On every write, you can compute what indexes need to be updated and you write to a NoSQL database to incrementally update a cached query result. This can lead to a good solution, but it comes at the cost of consistency. Now that you're building your own indexes outside of the database, writes are no longer transactional and you lose the guarantee of being able to read your own write.</p>
              <p id="c04b352e-bd9a-44ad-ba88-17ac5cc502ff">Another solution is to have a separate database for every user and allow users to edit the schema of their own isolated database. This allows writes to be transactional, but creates other kinds of collision problems (i.e. dealing with merge conflict) when you want users to be able to collaborate. With separate databases for each user, you're also doing a lot more computing labor, especially if the same records are shared amongst many people.</p>
              <p id="7c45a3a9-7051-4386-a53f-d246c9ba7310">Long story short, existing databases are not great for building end-user databases.</p>
              
            </details>
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p id="f41a9378-fc1b-4ea2-a13a-cb918178cff3">I plan to address this first reason by giving you a mental model of what databases are and a first-principles understanding of how they work.</p>
        <p id="1d0ea7ea-6760-43cc-a728-4b3a1d7efe3b">I'll introduce databases as an abstract concept and then we'll work through a real-world example to explore how databases leverage sorting and filters to lookup information quickly.</p>
        <p id="088e64ab-1cbd-49c2-85e5-ac16a93efcfa">By the end, I hope to show you how these information architecture concepts are immensely powerful and totally approachable for non-technical people. </p>
        <p id="69cf1cd2-0e55-4a55-8d70-a407a8cba1e3">Lastly, I want to convince you that software based on these concepts will be far superior to anything we use today for end-user database applications. If these concepts are interesting to you, <a target="_blank" href="mailto:ccorcos@gmail.com">please reach out</a>! I love sharing ideas. 😁</p>
        
        <p id="a546e1c2-8a2d-4d3a-8d6b-0e74b0f867f0">Databases are filing cabinets.</p>
        <p id="437c4e5d-072f-4e2c-a690-f23c26fa06f4">Databases don't have to be so complicated. If you strip away all the fancy semantics, you end up with something simple and familiar.</p>

        <p id="aef2d2df-d75a-43cf-a023-943585a6f450">Dictionaries, calendars, and filing cabinets are particularly useful because they represent information in a sorted order, making it possible for us to retrieve information quickly and efficiently using a process called <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">binary search</a>. Databases are no different, they're also containers of sorted information.</p>

        <h2 id="b5562604-4d38-4feb-84bd-6f536aea58cc">What is sorted information?</h2>
        <p id="2238e190-e73f-43c3-96d3-44daa545e966">Alphabetical, numerical, compound, lexicographical Encodings.</p>
        <p id="e4db1ca2-03e3-4767-883b-83b12f484fd6">The simplest way to sort something is alphabetically (a.k.a <em>lexicographically</em>) and this is how words are sorted in the dictionary. But we often find ourselves sorting by more than one property. For example, a contact list is often sorted by last name, <em>then</em> first name. This is called a <strong>compound sort</strong>. </p>
        
        <p id="3f686c5c-6eed-4ad6-8eb3-73168fa60be6">For example, notice that "Thomas Robins" should come before "Charlie Robinson" when sorting this way and that a compound sort is fundamentally different from simply joining the words together and then sorting.</p><pre id="82947e67-674e-4edd-8b12-6d7a800dee7a"><code>// Compound Sort: Last, First
Robins, Thomas
Robinson, Charlie

// Joining the words, then sorting: Last + First
RobinsonCharlie
RobinsThomas</code></pre>
        
        <p id="c545d059-b2b0-4678-8fd4-40aa6d7bdafd">We do this kind of compound sorting all over the place. Dates, in particular, are compound sorted by year, <em>then</em> month, <em>then</em> day.</p><pre id="cc0fb85d-ab5f-4e44-8947-0a504713b758"><code>January 10, 2019
...
December 28, 2019
...
August 26, 2020
...</code></pre>
        <p id="ef7175d9-a258-4f95-afe7-0ce9b274df54">Notice that this kind of sorting isn't exactly alphabetical. The months in a year are definitely not sorted alphabetically — each month has an underlying order within a year. Even days of the month aren't alphabetically sorted — they're numerically sorted.</p>
        
        <p id="9d475882-2657-4dc0-a0d4-7e8456c1a201">Numerical sorting is different from alphabetical sorting because alphabetical sorting compares letter-by-letter. For example, if we sorted numbers alphabetically, then 10 would come before 2 because the first digit "1" is before "2".</p><pre id="e4876df9-d390-4c6e-b0a8-c3201a7e43fa"><code>// Alphabetical Sort

        <p id="934e9af4-eb81-43ab-8dd1-9d973c87eb93">A simple way to represent numbers in a way that can be sorted alphabetically is to put zeros at the beginning of the number. This works well for small numbers with a known maximum size such as the months in a year. </p><pre id="245e5864-d979-4b11-944c-eb6a46ade312"><code>// Zero-padded numbers representing months in a year.

        <p id="becf436f-03a3-4bad-a0f7-519f75156d75">And in fact, we can represent dates in a way that can be sorted alphabetically using <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601 date format</a>. </p><pre id="6c4b1b11-3f63-4789-b0d5-4e0145fc9750"><code>2019-01-10

        <p id="82017443-040f-4acf-9810-23cd870f9c5e">Representing dates this way is convenient because it doesn't require domain knowledge to understand how to sort them. There are an infinite number of things that can be sorted arbitrarily: a deck of cards, the status of a project, your rock collection—they are all just different types of things.</p>
        <p id="7ddb731a-5ae6-4745-8134-9dc166ec26f4">In general, lexicographical encodings are important because they allow databases to store arbitrary information in the correct order without needing additional knowledge about the type of information that is being sorted.</p>
        
        <ul id="9983c3de-f661-4eb5-82a0-54f7af61c590">

              <p id="5339e8c2-5d28-41fe-8f64-fca7f3df92c3">You've probably experienced frustration with this when looking at files in your filesystem. <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_sort_order">Natural sort</a> solves this problem elegantly by representing both alphabetical and numerical sort at the same time.</p>
              <p id="22c8cbba-c26b-4fb1-8f46-f50abce95449">Representing numbers as lexicographically sortable is another interesting challenge, particularly very large and very small numbers. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ealmansi/elen/blob/master/resources/elen.pdf">Elen</a> is an interesting approach for encoding floating precision numbers.</p>
              <p id="31067abe-ad6c-4491-b84a-825c02101577">Tuples can be represented as compound sortable by separating each item with null-byte (and escaping null-bytes inside each item).</p>

        <p id="e0f0bb9b-fa2a-4b90-9201-a13005754346">You can think of databases much in the same way you think of system filing cabinets. To explore this analogy further, let's imagine that you are in charge of administering a police department where you keep track of a variety of information about every police officer in your region — name, badge number, address, and precinct, among other details.</p>
        
        <p id="60068181-62be-45e4-979e-b7a04b4d0ed9">As the administrator of this information, you're responsible for making sure that everything is up to date and easily accessible.</p>
        
        <p id="244c9ed1-6e90-4a3b-a370-59fa67d0cd5f">To keep things simple, you start by keeping all officer information in a filing cabinet sorted by badge number. This makes it easy to retrieve information about any officer based on their badge number, for example when an officer gets promoted or moves to a new address.</p>
        
        <figure id="7b5ff822-3bb7-4db6-b9a1-3872565c69bb"><img src="https://ccorcos.github.io/filing-cabinets/assets/Filing_cabinets_8.png">

        <h2 id="c78d6501-da7f-4633-b2e4-4a429cfd0008">Read/Write Trade-off</h2>
        <p id="e6dfff08-0cd8-4af5-96b2-448a8a05302c">How we copy information into other cabinets.</p>
        <p id="47066dd1-5373-4fac-8a18-0a29a5703390">One day, the police chief asks you for the address of every officer in the 60th precinct.</p>
        <p id="46c18841-1de6-4cd9-a084-cb39b033b939">With all of this information in a single filing cabinet sorted by badge number, this is a painful request because you have to scan through every file and check if each officer is in the 60th precinct.</p>
        <p id="9fb77909-54eb-4ecb-9059-10642f19e8f1">Maybe this is just a one-time request so you can labor over it and be done with it, but the police chief says that every month he wants to mail a bonus check to every officer in the precinct with the most arrests. If you're going to have to do this every month, maybe it's worthwhile to make this job a bit faster.</p>
        
        <p id="da5b845b-2a98-48f0-a688-857dd844a990">To solve this problem, you create another filing cabinet where you sort all officers by precinct. To keep things simple, you photocopy all of the information in the <em>Badge #</em> cabinet over to the <em>Precinct</em> cabinet. Now when the chief asks you to get the address of every officer in a precinct, you can use this new filing cabinet to quickly retrieve …</p></div></div>

January 12, 2021 | https://www.onefinance.com/welcome-simple-users-were-answering-faqs/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.onefinance.com/welcome-simple-users-were-answering-faqs/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>^ One is not affiliated with Simple in any way.</p><p>With the recent Simple closing news, many users were left scrambling to look for a new home. You aren’t stranded or alone; we’re here to welcome you all to One! There have been many questions and requests coming into One, so we gathered all the ones Simple users have asked the most.</p><h3>How does a Simple account compare to a One Pocket?</h3><p>At One, Pockets hold your money. When you create your One account your money will be stored in Pockets, similar to how they were organized at Simple.</p><p>When you first get started, you’ll have a few default Pockets. A Pocket for spending: Spend Pocket, another for savings: Save Pocket and you’ll have a special Pocket to automatically save: Auto-Save Pocket. <a href="https://www.onefinance.com/features/#autosave">The Auto-Save Pocket</a> will need to be toggled “on” but it’s there, ready to be used.</p><p>Easily create free and unlimited Pockets around your life and your people. There’s no limit to how many Pockets you can create in your <a href="https://www.onefinance.com/features/">One account</a>. Each pocket has its own account and routing number, so you can transfer funds directly in and out of Pockets from external sources (example: to pay bills).&nbsp; You can also share individual Pockets with other One users. You’ll also have the flexibility to choose which Pocket is debited when you use your One card by assigning your card to it in the One app. Adjust what Pocket your card points to at any time!</p><p>P.S. We’re actively working on new upgrades to One that will include enhanced features similar to Simple’s Safe-to-Spend and Expenses and Goals.</p><h3>Does One connect to Mint?</h3><p>At the moment, One is not available with Mint but is available on any budgeting tool that utilizes the Plaid exchange network.</p><h3>When will Mint add One?</h3><p>Mint prioritizes what financial institutions to add based on user demand. If you’d like to see One work with Mint, please follow below for a step-by-step guide on how to request it directly with the Mint team.</p><p>Mint users can request One to be added by:</p><ol><li>Logging into your Mint account through their desktop website. The app does not support requesting a new bank.</li><li>Click “+ Add Accounts” button on the top navigation bar.</li><li>Type in a few random letters (typing “One Finance” here will result in hundreds of incorrect results).</li><li>Click “Request support for your bank” button.</li><li>Type “One Finance” in the Bank name field.</li><li>Copy and paste our website URL into the bank web address field: <a href="https://www.onefinance.com/">https://www.onefinance.com</a></li><li>That’s it!</li></ol><p>We appreciate your support and hope to move up in the line fast if enough requests for One come through!</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="http://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog_Pockets.png" alt="" width="5136" height="1401" srcset="https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog_Pockets.png 5136w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog_Pockets-300x82.png 300w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog_Pockets-1024x279.png 1024w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog_Pockets-1536x419.png 1536w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog_Pockets-2048x559.png 2048w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog_Pockets-1600x436.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 5136px) 100vw, 5136px"></p><h3>Does One offer joint accounts?</h3><p>One offers something even better, Pocket sharing! You can create and share as many Pockets as you’d like with any One user(s). This feature helps you get hyper-organized with your finances especially with the ability to slice and dice your finances so you can control who and what Pocket you share. For example: partners can each have their own separate One account but share one or more Pockets with each other for shared expenses like rent, groceries, car payments etc. They’ll both be able to access only the funds within the Shared Pockets while their main One account funds stay separate. Ditch the constant requests for bill splitting and continually ping ponging money back and forth through another app.</p><h3>Can I move money between Pockets? How long does it take? Is there a limit to the amount of transfers?</h3><p>Yes! It’s easy to move money between Pockets under the “Move Money” tab in the One App. It’s instant, and there’s no limit to the amount of transfers that can be done between your Pockets.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="http://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog_Chart-1.png" alt="" width="4608" height="2836" srcset="https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog_Chart-1.png 4608w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog_Chart-1-300x185.png 300w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog_Chart-1-1024x630.png 1024w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog_Chart-1-1536x945.png 1536w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog_Chart-1-2048x1260.png 2048w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog_Chart-1-1600x985.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 4608px) 100vw, 4608px"></p><h3>What does APY and APR mean? <b>Why does One have higher rates than other brands?</b></h3><p>The Annual Percentage Yield, or “APY”, is a percentage rate reflecting the total amount of interest paid to you on your account. Our APYs are based on the interest rates we offer and how often interest compounds (interest on the amounts you contribute plus any interest you have already earned).</p><p>The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is the amount you pay each year to borrow money, including fees, expressed as a percentage.</p><p>One is able to offer higher rates because as a digital banking service we don’t have the traditional overhead that brick and mortar banks have. Instead of keeping the cost savings, we put it back into our product offerings, such as the 3.00% APY* One users enjoy in their Auto-Save Pocket, and the 1.00% APY* we provide on existing savings balances (up to $25k for our paycheck direct deposit customers). We’re able to maintain these industry-leading rates to our customers for two primary reasons. First, we focus on generating revenue through interchange (essentially card spending activity, which is driven by the expense that businesses pay to accept credit and debit cards) and fairly priced credit and lending, instead of fees like traditional banks. Second, our savings products are designed to help build, and rebuild, financial wellness, a big component of which is emergency savings and a cushion for unexpected expenses. For customers with very large existing savings balances looking for a place to park their money just to earn returns, we may not be the best option, and that is okay. We are focused on helping to improve and maintain financially healthy habits for our customers, while offering the most compelling and best priced spending, saving and credit options in the market.</p><h3>Can a One account receive a wire transfer?</h3><p>Yes! All One accounts can accept wire transfers but are not able to send wire transfers. One accounts can also receive international wire transfers. Please <a href="https://help.onefinance.com/hc/en-us/requests/new">contact</a> our team for additional information needed to accept an international transfer.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="http://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/group.png" alt="" width="5136" height="2387" srcset="https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/group.png 5136w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/group-300x139.png 300w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/group-1024x476.png 1024w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/group-1536x714.png 1536w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/group-2048x952.png 2048w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/group-1600x744.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 5136px) 100vw, 5136px"></p><h2>Your feedback is our fuel | One updates coming soon</h2><p><span>There’s been a lot of great feedback from Simple users and we’re actively listening, combing through every post and working to update One. Our team is reprioritizing to make sure we fill in the biggest gaps first so our new friends from Simple can feel less anxiety and regain their financial peace of mind. Here’s a quick list of top requested updates (in no particular order) and how we’re approaching them:</span></p><h3>Recurring Transfers</h3><p><strong>Request Level:</strong> High<br><strong>Status:</strong> Currently working on<br><strong>Availability:</strong> Shortly</p><p>You’ll recognize this feature as “funding schedule.” It’s automating the funding of expenses and goals. We completely agree this is a feature One needs STAT. Manually allocating funds whenever new money lands in your One account is not fun.</p><p>Right now, you can allocate up to 10% of your <a href="https://www.onefinance.com/direct-deposit/">paycheck direct deposit</a> (up to $1,000/month) to automatically deposit into your Auto-Save Pocket. You’ll earn 3.00% APY* in the Auto-Save Pocket.</p><p>Our team imagines that an early version of the recurring transfers feature will allow a user to set similar rules for what money ends up in which created Pocket. Example: $100 to Grocery Pocket on the 3rd of every month.</p><h3>Virtual Cards For Every Pocket</h3><p><strong>Request Level:</strong> Medium<br><strong>Status:</strong> In queue<br><strong>Availability:</strong> Launch first pass in Q1</p><p>This feature will help One users who have a very tight management around their recurring expenses. You’ll be able to set up dedicated Pockets, each with a unique virtual card number to pay these recurring bills. Example: a dedicated card to pay for your “Streaming TV” Pocket bill only. We’re also planning to support these cards later in Apple Wallet and Google Wallet to make spending even easier.</p><h3>Configurable Overdraft</h3><p><strong>Request Level:</strong> Medium<br><strong>Status:</strong> Currently working on<br><strong>Availability:</strong> Launching Q1</p><p>Currently, the only Pocket that has overdraft protection is the default Spend Pocket. This Pocket comes with a built-in <a href="https://www.onefinance.com/features/#creditLine">Credit Line</a> in case your account dips below zip. We’re currently working on allowing any created Pocket to be auto-filled by available funds in the Spend Pocket when funds aren’t available to fill the transaction in the other Pocket. This update will take a lot of guesswork out of bill payments, including payments that have different amounts each month.</p><h3>MFA/2FA</h3><p><strong>Request Level:</strong> Medium<br><strong>Status:</strong> Currently working on<br><strong>Availability:</strong> Shortly</p><p>We recognize that multi-factor authentication is an important security feature and are actively working to get this up and running.</p><h3>Remote Check Deposit</h3><p><strong>Request Level:</strong> High<br><strong>Status:</strong> Currently working on<br><strong>Availability:</strong> Launch in February</p><p>Grandparents send checks, the landlord still wants a check, work pays you with a check…love them or hate them checks are still a part of daily banking. The ability to deposit checks with your mobile device is in the works.</p><h3>Mail A Check</h3><p><strong>Request Level:</strong> Medium<br><strong>Status:</strong> In queue<br><strong>Availability:</strong> Coming soon!</p><p>We will soon support the ability to “cut a check” all within the One app. Users will be able to fill in the details and we’ll handle the printing and mailing of the physical check, free of charge! This feature will be in lieu of traditional paper checkbooks. Let’s be honest, those thick books just collect dust in a drawer and only have 1 or 2 taken out anyway.</p><p>We’re excited to bring these features to life, and know they’ll be a huge step towards getting you back to the kind of stress-free workflows you worked so hard to fine-tune over the years with Simple. Thank you so much for all your feedback! We can’t stress this part enough…keep it coming! With your help, we can continue to constantly improve One.</p> </div></div>]]>

<p><strong>Here’s a transcript from Tim Ferriss’s interview with Marcus Aurelius:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tim: Thanks for joining me, Marcus. Or should I use your title: Caesar?</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: You may call me Marcus. I do not stand on ceremony.</p>
<p>Tim: Fair enough. So, I want to start at the beginning. What is Stoicism?</p>
<p>Marcus: Stoicism is a philosophy of life. It is a way of looking at the world. It is about seeing clearly what is in front of us and feeling what is in our hearts. It is about doing what is right, no matter what the cost. It is about living according to nature and treating others with kindness and respect.</p>
<p>Tim: I like that. So, what is the goal of Stoicism?</p>
<p>Marcus: The goal of Stoicism is to live a good life, a life in accordance with nature.</p>
<p>Tim: What does that mean?</p>
<p>Marcus: It means doing what we ought to do, not doing what we want to do. It means acting rationally, not emotionally.</p>
<p>Tim: Ok, so how do we do that?</p>
<p>Marcus: By paying attention to what is in our power and not worrying about the rest.</p>
<p>Tim: That’s a great answer, but what does it mean?</p>
<p>Marcus: It means we have control over our actions, our judgments, and our feelings. It means we can choose how we respond to events outside of our control. It means we can choose what to think.</p>
<p>Tim: I like that. So, how do you apply Stoicism to life?</p>
<p>Marcus: By facing the world with a smile and acting with justice, kindness, and honesty.</p>
<p>Tim: I like that too. So, can you give me an example?</p>
<p>Marcus: Sure. When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they can’t tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own—not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands, and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: These are obstructions.</p>
<p>Tim: That’s a great passage. So, how do we deal with adversity?</p>
<p>Marcus: By recognizing that it is nothing more than what it is: a thing that can be endured.</p>
<p>Tim: That’s hard.</p>
<p>Marcus: It is, but it is also liberating.</p>
<p>Tim: How do you mean?</p>
<p>Marcus: The things that cause us suffering are those that are out of our control. Death, illness, poverty, dishonor, slander, and all such things. If you accept that they are fated to happen, they will lose their power over you.</p>
<p>Tim: That’s a powerful idea. So, how do we deal with pain?</p>
<p>Marcus: The first step is recognizing that pain is an opinion, not a fact. The second is accepting that it can’t be changed. The third is being thankful that it isn’t worse.</p>
<p>Tim: That’s a great way of putting it. So, what’s the best way to deal with other people?</p>
<p>Marcus: Be kind. Everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.</p>
<p>Tim: What about those who are unkind?</p>
<p>Marcus: They are like children, who are unkind not by choice but because they don’t know better.</p>
<p>Tim: How do we deal with external events that we can’t control?</p>
<p>Marcus: We accept that we have no control over them.</p>
<p>Tim: I like that. I have a question. I’ve heard it said that Stoicism is a cold and emotionless philosophy.</p>
<p>Marcus: That’s not true. Stoics feel all the emotions—they just don’t allow those emotions to determine their behavior.</p>
<p>Tim: So, you’re saying that Stoics don’t repress their emotions?</p>
<p>Marcus: No. The Stoic does not indulge her emotions, but she feels them fully and completely.</p>
<p>Tim: What about death?</p>
<p>Marcus: Death is nothing to us. When we exist, death is not yet present. And when death is present, then we no longer exist. It doesn’t concern us at all.</p>
<p>Tim: That’s a great answer. So, can you sum up Stoicism for me?</p>
<p>Marcus: Sure. I can tell you that it is the art of living. It is about seeing clearly, doing good, and facing adversity. It is about accepting what cannot be changed and freeing yourself from the things that cause you suffering. It is about being strong and kind. It is about seeing the world as it is, not as you want it to be.</p>
<p><strong>Tim: I like that. For a small change of topic, there are a few questions I like to ask. As you may know I’m a huge fan of books and read dozens of them every year. What is the book (or books) you’ve given most as a gift, and why? Or what are one to three books that have greatly influenced your life?</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: I’m a big fan of biographies, especially those of the great philosophers and statesmen. I like to read about how others have dealt with adversity and challenges. I also love history books, especially those of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Tim: I like that. What about books you’ve read recently that you would recommend?</p>
<p>Marcus: I’ve been reading The Obstacle is the Way by Ryan Holiday. It’s about how to turn obstacles into advantages.</p>
<p>Tim: That sounds good. I’ll check it out. What about books that have greatly influenced your life?</p>
<p>Marcus: The Enchiridion by Epictetus.</p>
<p>Tim: I guess you like Roman philosophers. What about favorite quotes?</p>
<p>Marcus: I have many favorites.</p>
<p>Tim: Give me some.</p>
<p>Marcus: “It is difficult to fight against one’s natural impulses.”</p>
<p>“Accept life as it comes.”</p>
<p>“The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.”</p>
<p>“How much time he saves who does not look to see what his neighbor says or does or thinks.”</p>
<p>Tim: I like those. What about favorite movies or TV shows?</p>
<p>Marcus: I’m a big fan of many of the HBO series, such as Rome, The Sopranos, and Game of Thrones.</p>
<p><strong>Tim: What purchase of $100 or less has most positively impacted your life in the last six months (or in recent memory)? My readers love specifics like brand and model, where you found it, etc.</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: I’m a big fan of the Moleskine notebooks. I just ordered the new “junior” version.</p>
<p><strong>Tim: How has a failure, or apparent failure, set you up for later success? Do you have a “favorite failure” of yours?</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: I failed at many things early in my life. I failed as a student, as an athlete, and as a politician. I failed as a husband and a father. But each failure taught me something about myself and the world. I learned from these failures and became a better man for it.</p>
<p><strong>Tim: If you could have a gigantic billboard anywhere with anything on it — metaphorically speaking, getting a message out to millions or billions — what would it say and why? It could be a few words or a paragraph.</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: “You have power over your mind—not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.”</p>
<p><strong>Tim: What is one of the best or most worthwhile investments you’ve ever made? (Could be an investment of money, time, energy, etc.)</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: Travel. I’ve visited many countries and have learned much from others.</p>
<p><strong>Tim:What is an unusual habit or an absurd thing that you love?</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: I love to swim. I’ve done it every day for years.</p>
<p>Tim: What is the best advice you’ve ever received?</p>
<p>Marcus: I have no talent for drinking. I must therefore leave it alone.</p>
<p>Tim: I like that. So, what’s a personal habit that contributes to your success?</p>
<p>Marcus: I write in a journal every single day</p>
<p><strong>Tim: In the last five years, what new belief, behavior, or habit has most improved your life?</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: I’ve adopted a no-complaining policy. I used to complain all the time about everything. This doesn’t mean I don’t have complaints—it means I keep them to myself.</p>
<p><strong>Tim: What advice would you give to a smart, driven college student about to enter the “real world”?</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: Educate yourself. Read as much as you can. Surround yourself with people who are better than you. Don’t waste time on jealousy or resentment. Don’t let your emotions control you. Find a cause that is bigger than yourself and devote yourself to it.</p>
<p><strong>Tim: What are bad recommendations you hear in your profession or area of expertise?</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: “Your gut doesn’t matter.” You must learn to trust your gut and use it to navigate the world.</p>
<p>“It’s too late for this.”</p>
<p>“You’re too old for that.”</p>
<p>“You’ll never be able to do that.”</p>
<p><strong>Tim: In the last five years, what have you become better at saying no to (distractions, invitations, etc.)? What new realizations and/or approaches helped? Any other tips?</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: I’ve learned that it’s better to give a small amount of time to many people than a lot of time to a few people.</p>
<p><strong>Tim: When you feel overwhelmed or unfocused, or have lost your focus temporarily, what do you do? (If helpful: What questions do you ask yourself?)</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: I take a break and do some exercise. Then, I get back to work.</p>
<p>Tim: If you were to start again, what would you do differently?</p>
<p>Marcus: I would have studied philosophy much earlier in life. It has changed everything for me.</p>
<p>Tim: If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be? (There’s no right answer. I’m just curious.)</p>
<p>Marcus: I would like to be able to read other people’s minds. I’m pretty good at understanding what others are thinking, but I’d like to be able to read their thoughts directly.</p>
<p>Tim: One last question: What does success mean to you?</p>
<p>Marcus: Finding a purpose larger than yourself and devoting your life to it.</p>
<p>Tim: Thank you, Marcus, I really enjoyed this.</p>
<p>Marcus: It was a pleasure.</p>
<p>If you liked this conversation, I think you’ll like my book, Tools of Titans: The Tactics, Routines, and Habits of Billionaires, Icons, and World-Class Performers. In the book I deconstruct world-class performers’ routines and habits you can apply to your</p>

<p>Hello 👋&nbsp;</p>

<p>I know you like to use WhatsApp, I use WhatsApp as well. One of the most important things in WhatsApp that differentiates itself from other messaging apps like Viber, Messenger and Telegram is WhatsApp’s privacy.</p>
<p>WhatsApp chats are end-to-end encrypted. Which means once you hit the send button on your phone, WhatsApp scrambles the message so no one in the middle can read it, not even WhatsApp themselves can read what you send. Therefore called end-to-end encryption.</p>
<p>You get this feature as soon as you install and start using WhatsApp, while you need to enable end-to-end encryption on other chat apps that you use (Telegram, Messenger etc). So you are at risk of the app creator, your government reading your messages.</p>

<p><strong>However, starting&nbsp;from February 8th, WhatsApp is changing is policies, to loosen some of it’s privacy features because Facebook (the company that owns WhatsApp) plans to make money out of WhatsApp.<p>This including sharing your data with advertisers, companies, and businesses that might chat on WhatsApp.</p></strong></p>
<p>You might have already got this message asking you to agree to these new terms, and if you agree with it, you are agreeing to share your data with other companies.</p>

<p>Even though we are not sure whether WhatsApp or businesses can read your messages or not after the&nbsp;February 8th&nbsp;because the message is very vague, this update coming&nbsp;on February 8th&nbsp;means that&nbsp;<strong>WhatsApp is not safe anymore, and should not to be used for private communications.</strong></p>
<h2>Why use Signal?</h2>
<p>Signal is a chat app, just like WhatsApp. But unlike WhatsApp Signal is a non profit organization, which meansSignal does not have to sell your messages and information to advertisers like WhatsApp is planning to do in order to make money.<br>Signal also enables end-to-end encryption by default, so your chats are safe just like WhatsApp.<br>People like Elon Musk and others have asked everyone to switch to Signal once WhatsApp announced their new privacy policy about selling your data.</p>

<h2>What you miss by using signal instead of WhatsApp?</h2>
<p><strong>Basically nothing.&nbsp;</strong>Signal has everything that you love in WhatsApp.</p>
<ul><li>Groups ✅</li><li>Voice calls ✅&nbsp;</li><li>Video calls ✅</li><li>Stickers ✅</li><li>Statuses 🅾️</li></ul>
<p>You won’t miss anything by using Signal instead of WhatsApp.</p>
<p><strong>So I suggest everyone to download and try Signal, hopefully you will be able to replace WhatsApp if you care about your privacy, and may be try switching your friends over to Signal</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Download Signal</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<a href="https://signal.org/download/">https://signal.org/download/</a></li><li><strong>Signal for iOS</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms</a></li><li><strong>Signal for Android devices</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/lk/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669">https://apps.apple.com/lk/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669</a></li></ul>

<p>Interestingly, public materials about the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/drawbridge/">Drawbridge</a> variant used on SQL Server are few and far between.</p>



<p>So <a href="https://threedots.ovh/slides/Drawbridge.pdf">here</a> is a slide deck about me working with Drawbridge from several years back. I’ve updated parts of it later on, keeping up partially with more recent SQLPAL versions.</p>



<p>Since I made that slide deck, lots of things happened… which will maybe be a subject for a story or two some day.</p>

    <figcaption>Unfolded Studio - The Platform for Geospatial Analytics</figcaption>
  </figure><p>Today we are delighted to officially unveil <a href="https://studio.unfolded.ai/">Unfolded Studio</a>,
our take on what the next generation geospatial analytics and visualization platform should look like.</p><p>We, the Unfolded founding team, originally met at Uber around 2015 as we started building out what has now become a suite of
leading open source geospatial technologies, including kepler.gl, deck.gl and H3. </p><p>By 2019, theis this technology stack had become quite mature,
and we realized that an extraordinary geospatial platform
could be built on top of it, so we came together to found Unfolded,
a new geospatial company with a mission to build the next generation of geospatial analytics.</p><p>Our mission is to enable effortless geospatial and temporal data analytics at
massive, planetary scales, and to share insights through geospatial visualizations
that inspire with their beauty and fluidity.</p><h2>Why Geospatial Platforms?</h2><p>Geospatial datasets are unique among data sets, in that they can be presented
in the context of maps and the physical world, rather than just as abstract graphs.
This makes it possible for viewers to quickly comprehend and draw valuable insights
from datasets that are orders of magnitude larger than would normally be possible.</p><p>Unfortunately visualizing data on maps is complicated. Ingesting, processing
and interacting with geospatial datasets is computationally and
technically demanding, especially when datasets become large,
and users typically need to solve numerous problems before insights can be reached. </p><p>For a geospatial platform like Unfolded Studio,
each of these problems represents an opportunity to help our users.</p><h2>Enter Unfolded Studio</h2><p>Our view is that any geospatial analytics platform worth considering today
must offer its users a range of critical core features:</p><ul><li>Effortless map creation</li><li>Strong exploratory visualization</li><li>Powerful geospatial analytics to help users uncover insights</li><li>Seamless cloud storage for geospatial data</li><li>Single-click map publishing </li><li>Easy ingestion of key geospatial data formats</li><li>Automation for getting data into and out of the tool</li><li>Ways to build custom applications on top of maps</li></ul><p>Note that Unfolded Studio is designed to handle not only these core geospatial data management tasks,
but more importantly is architected to address what we consider to be the hard problems in geospatial analytics.
We will share our thoughts and roadmaps around this in a follow-up blog post.</p><h3>Powerful Visualization Layers</h3><figure>

				<p><em>Alternative title: Young NB Yells At The Cloud</em></p>
<p><strong>Note that this absolutely isn’t vetted for technical accuracy.</strong>
<strong>It’s probably also not a very coherent post altogether.</strong>
<strong>I just needed to get this off my chest.</strong></p>
<p>Ever since late 2019, I’ve been using a Google Pixel 2 as my day-to-day
cellphone. While I’ve known that it didn’t respect my privacy, per the Google
tradition of being creepy and generally terrifying, I wasn’t <em>entirely</em> aware of
this phenomenon until Google told me when I registered my rooted Nook Tablet
with their services in 2014. The fact that this has been recorded six years
later was enough to set me off on a path to de-Googlify my Google phone.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://blog.knightsofthelambdacalcul.us/img/2020-01-28-1.png"> 
</figure>

<p>The first option I found was <a href="https://github.com/dan-v/rattlesnakeos-stack">RattlesnakeOS</a>, which is basically just AOSP built
on EC2. While it seemed like a competent option, and it likely is, I didn’t want
to set up an AWS account and pay $5/mo to build it, as I’m already paying $10/mo
on my current servers (including the one hosting this website). In addition,
there’s <a href="https://grapheneos.org/">GrapheneOS</a>, which is the continuation of the ill-fated CopperheadOS
(which effectively died Because Capitalism^TM after CopperheadOS was
commercialized, effectively killing the project altogether). I opted for the
latter as I wouldn’t have to set up my own build infrastructure on AWS, and the
fact that GrapheneOS decidedly had more features directly geared towards a
“hardened” Android experience, regardless of de-Googlification.</p>
<p>This of course, would be wonderful… if not for a critical roadblock.</p>
<h2 id="trying-to-unlock-the-bootloader">Trying to unlock the bootloader</h2>
<p>Here’s how it went down:
“Hey, are you able to unlock the boot-loader?”</p>
<pre><code data-lang="nil"> Λ ~ fastboot flashing get_unlock_ability
(bootloader) get_unlock_ability: 1
OKAY [  0.000s]
</code></pre><p>(read: “yeah, sure”)</p>
<p>“Okay, <em>can</em> you unlock the boot-loader?”</p>
<pre><code data-lang="nil"> λ ~ fastboot flashing unlock
FAILED (remote: 'Flashing Unlock is not allowed')
fastboot: error: Command failed
</code></pre><p>(read: “No, because I’m not able to.")</p>
<p>…so I’m left with Schrödinger’s bootloader (and not the cat from Digital Devil
Saga). Wonderful! Furthermore, I’m not the only one with this issue; not only do
some carriers lock down your ability to OEM unlock, but Google Play Services’
anti-theft protection makes it impossible to do so without an internet
connection, <em>and</em> some refurbished Pixel devices (mine being case-in-point) just
<a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/pixel-2/help/unlock-bootloader-refurbished-pixel-2-t4017557">don’t cooperate</a>, regardless as to whether or not it <em>should</em> work.</p>
<p>My experience with Google support on this topic basically boiled down to “why
are you even trying to unlock the bootloader, you idiot”, so that’s out of the
question. I’d imagine they’re probably not super happy about me stealing profits
from them by trying to escape their ecosystem.</p>
<p>On a happier note, I came across this person on Freenode’s channel #grapheneos,
which eased the tension due to them not breaking character:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="nil">       hazel1 │ hi yes okay so.
       hazel1 │ i'm on a pixel 2 non-xl, `fastboot flashing get_unlock_ability` returns 1, but `fastboot flashing unlock` says "Flashing Unlock is not allowed"
       hazel1 │ no idea where to go from here.
TheJollyRoger │ Avast! Did ye enable OEM unlocking in the OS under developer options?
       hazel1 │ i did, yes, that's what `fastboot flashing get_unlock_ability = 1` meant
       hazel1 │ also i appreciate your dedication to character.
       hazel1 │ i'm on linux, if that's important, and i'm running these commands as root.
TheJollyRoger │ Shiver me timbers, I be stuck too. Maybe someone else on this here tub will know.
</code></pre><h2 id="why-this-is-stupid">Why this is stupid</h2>
<p>This is where I turn this tech rant into a political rant, as I have no
self-control.</p>
<p>Per the majority of things that happen in the modern tech industry, this is, of
course, a byproduct of capitalism. The fact that carriers or refurbishers <em>can</em>
lock you out of customizing your own device is in it of itself terrifying, on
the merit that it’s an effective paywall to gain control of the hardware you own
— or rather, should own. While I’m a firm believer in security, and a firm
believer that the majority of people have devices that work well enough for them
(given that they’re not privacy conscious…), I’m also under the impression
that <em>people should have control over the things they own</em>. Capitalism, in the
name of profit, contradicts that scheme.</p>
<p>The fact that your carrier owns your phone, or your phone manufacturer owns your
phone, or Google owns your phone, etc, applies in bounds here. While the
saying is generally “if it’s free, you’re the product”, the fact that you’re
<strong>still</strong> the product when buying an expensive device speaks volumes about the
technological ecosystems we tend to depend on in 2020. I should be able to
unlock the bootloader without a second thought, but the fact that some
refurbisher owns the rights to do that with the device I should own, and not me,
worries me deeply.</p>
<p>I shouldn’t have to worry about whether some random thing I say is going to be
used against me in some creepy fashion three weeks later in an ad that shows up
on a torrent site when I’m trying to scrape the web for some obscure piece of
software that nobody uses or some movie that nobody watched.</p>
<p>I’m well aware that this point has been regurgitated. I’m well aware this post
doesn’t actually make much sense. But regardless, I’m scared that Google has
this much control, and I’m scared that I’m unable to remove it.</p>
<h2 id="follow-up--2020-01-29--and-a-potential-explanation">Follow-up (2020-01-29) and a potential explanation</h2>
<p>So apparently this is by design, which pretty much confirms my theory. Great.
Per a user on the <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/14920605?hl=en">Pixel Phone Help “official support forum”:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Update: I was able to get a reply from the higher levels in Google and they
simply informed the man handling my case, to his astonishment, that the
refurbishment process is intentionally locking the bootloader and that is the
way they designed it to operate. No options were given to me to remedy the
issue and I was asked if there was anything else I wanted to discuss before
they ended the call.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>This is ridiculous if true.</strong> Not only does it compound on my existing complaint
of bootloader unlocks being behind a paywall, which is already ridiculous, but
it means that even <strong>if</strong> you go through a paywall, any device defect could lead
to a permanently locked bootloader (such as my case). Even more ridiculous is
that Google’s factory Pixel images require a bootloader unlock to flash, meaning
that this locks users out of potential support options.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the theory of a refurbished device just being an unlocked
carrier edition phone is true (despite my CID being all zeroes), this is just
<em>negligence</em>.</p>
<p>Even if 99.3\% of users should <em>never</em> have to touch this option, the fact that
Google not only sends refurbished phones, but RMAs of unlockable phones with
this defect is astounding. It attests to the fact that what you own is not truly
yours even moreso than this just being a coincidence — it’s an explicit
hostile action towards the privacy-focused by Google. The former glory of Nexus
devices of being “the modder’s phone” has been changed drastically upon a vision
of a more popular “Google phone”; again, driven by capitalism.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><span><p>From the invention of the steam engine, to incandescent light, to radio, computation, and the internet, a familiar story unfolds:</p><p>In a small pocket of the world, a group of people produce immense innovation, changing the world as we know it.</p><p>Different times, different places, same story. If anything, “changing the world as we know it” is an understatement. It might be fairer to say that the <em>majority</em> of the wealth and security that we enjoy today, comes from these little pockets. </p><p>Without the steam engine, or electricity, or computers, our world would be different in kind. Many more people would be burdened by toil, many an idea would be impossible, and many a person would be dead from disease. It boggles the mind to think that these innovations took place in areas no larger than a few neighborhood blocks.</p><p>The latest place, of course, was Silicon Valley. From Intel, to Apple, to Microsoft, to Netscape, to Amazon, to Google, technology invented here continues to ripple around the world. </p><p>But, we’re facing some dangerous headwinds.</p><p>The ingredients that made Silicon Valley prosperous are beginning to disappear. For the young and ambitious hacker, it’s unaffordable to live there, and the cultural atmosphere has become stifling.</p><p>Yet our need for innovation has never been greater. From centralization to addiction, Big Tech itself has produced second order-consequences. We need solutions that protect the future of our society. And this pales in comparison to the largest problem at hand: we still have billions of people below the poverty line. There is no way for everyone to enjoy the standard of living that western people enjoy, without massive changes in technology.  </p><p>This is both daunting, and thrilling. We have big problems ahead, but humanity has managed to solve them time and time again. What are we going to do now?</p><p>One way, is to proliferate the ideas that made these areas of innovation so special. Can we reverse the trend in Silicon Valley? Even better, what if we had one thousand more Silicon Valleys of 2003, or Pittsburgs of the 1880s, or the Londons and Paris’ of the 1700s? </p><p>Throughout my life I’ve lived in about 5 cities across 3 continents, with at least 4 starkly different societal structures. Most recently I spent 6 years in Silicon Valley, where I was lucky enough to experience some of what made this place so special. </p><p>When I reflect, there are certainly ingredients I’ve noticed that made Silicon Valley stand apart from any other place I’ve lived in. I want to share them with you.</p><p>The most important ingredient I noticed was risk appetite, and a love for risk takers. </p><p>It’s surprising this isn’t a standard thing. Don’t we all respect Elon Musk? Sort of. We respect the successes, but our revealed preferences show something different. </p><p>Here’s how you can tell:  Pick a city, and ask the average student what they want to do after they graduate.</p><p>Most will say they want a prestigious job at a big company. In some even more unfortunate places, it’s that they want a prestigious and cushy job…in politics. </p><p>This doesn’t bode well for their risk appetite. But can you blame them? Imagine if the same undergraduate student has a love interest. What would the grandma say if they found out that the suitor wants to “make a rocket that flies to the moon?”. How would this suitor compare to the “deputy director of X bank”?</p><p>This attitude is shared across continents and cultures, revealing a generally conservative cultural attitude towards risk.</p><p>Now, it does vary. Being different is bad but not terrible in Germany, while it’s unbearable in Japan. Yet, by and large most places are on the “still bad” side of the spectrum.</p><p>Why does it happen this way? There may be good cultural reasons. For most of our history there was little variation in productivity. Being different didn’t get you much, outside of potential exile. </p><p>But things have changed. Technology brings extreme variation in productivity. Innovation necessarily lies in doing what hasn’t been done before. And there’s a reason why many good things <em>haven’t</em> been done before: either they look dumb, foolish, or impossible.</p><p>To exploit those opportunities, you need talented people “foolish” enough to try to build on these opportunities, and capitalists “foolish” enough to invest money in them. </p><p>Conservative risk outlooks make this impossible. It’s frustrating to see. Outside of the stigma, there isn’t much downside for the talented undergraduate student — they don’t have kids to support. And likewise for the capitalist — the amount to invest is insignificant. Just when life is the <em>least</em> risky for both, stigma prevents their action.</p><p>This is not the case in Silicon Valley. Starting a startup, even failing, only makes you a better engineer and a better candidate for greater things here. And there’s no shortage of angel investors who are ready to make a bet and write it off completely, if they believe in the slightest chance of upside. </p><p>Why? Because ambition is lauded here. </p><p>When you say you want to get to the moon, people take you seriously. An environment like that nourishes the adventurer in a person’s soul. </p><p>So, what do we do? How do we bring this kind of risk loving attitude to different cultures? </p><p>I think it’s going to be hard, but it’s not impossible. Ideas tend to spread non-linearly. </p><p>What kind of content is available in your society? Are there gripping case studies that you can share? Can you build up small pockets of like-minded people? How can you make an ambitious outlook virtuous and laudable?</p><p>Whichever city can solve for these questions, has a gold-mine on their hands. </p><p>Risk appetite, however, has a necessary side effect. </p><p>Innovation requires thinking up unintuitive ideas. You have to question the status quo. A common question you need ask is: why does X <em>really</em> have to be this way? </p><p>Well, ask this questions enough times, and you’ll discover an idea that’s unpopular in whatever zeitgeist you live in. What do you do if you have an idea like that? </p><p>In some places, the penalty is so severe, that it’s dangerous to even think of an idea like this, let alone say it. </p><p>And this becomes tragic, because when you silence dissenting ideas, you stop innovation too. There is no way to follow innovative reasoning without some dissenting ideas popping up.</p><p>When you realize this, it’s no surprise that most pockets of innovation tended to stem from western cultures. Freedom of speech, common law courts, and liberty from oppression gives a person the necessary space to think.</p><p>One kicker is, that space is unbelievably attractive to a thinker: to let your mind roam is thrilling. This means that spaces like this build on themselves: people want to move there.</p><p>So, you need civil freedoms. But you can’t stop there. You need freedom to think, but you also need freedom to <em>build</em>. </p><p>This requires an open regulatory environment. If regulation is too restrictive, it selects for the kind of company that can make it through legal hurdles: large, bureaucratic, and lawyered up. Small, innovative startups that are likely to fail will die at birth.</p><p>How do you know if your city has an enough regulatory environment? Here’s how you can tell. </p><p>Just answer these questions: How quickly can you incorporate a business? Can you hire and fire someone easily? Can you accept payments easily? What kind of permits do you need to work on crypto, autonomous driving, or drones? </p><p>If you answered in the negative, this is a bottleneck for forming a pocket of innovation in your city. Each question you answer in the positive improves your city’s chances by a magnitude. If you answer entirely in the positive, you have a city that looks incredibly attractive to great thinkers and great doers.</p><p>The most critical remaining ingredient is talent. Technology is the medium of innovation, and it requires deep expertise. So how do you get these experts? Let’s put ourselves in the mind of these experts. </p><p>One immediate upside they’ll see already, is that your city has an environment where they can think freely, and it’s possible for them to try ambitious ideas without stigma.  That’s already an unbelievably attractive proposition. </p><p>But this itself isn’t enough for talent to flourish. Talent looks for other talent. Great thinkers want to be around other great thinkers. From Princeton to Bell Labs to Palo Alto, innovators clump together. So, you need to manufacture such a clump. How could you do it? </p><p>Traditionally, the solution is to nurture a great technical university. Build a place where the smartest people can gather and work on ambitious ideas. If you have that, you have a prime ingredient. </p><p>Is there anything special you need to do with this university, outside of just making admission selective? I think so. The place has to be livable enough for the professors, and fun enough for the students to stick around after.</p><p>One heuristic to know you have a city that’s livable enough, is to answer this question: Do you have any areas where folks don’t need to use cars? If you have a walkable pocket in your city, you have a place where thinkers will thrive.</p><p>Aside from investing in a good technical University, and a walkable area, what else can you do?</p><p>The most exciting development, is to turn your city into a kind of startup itself. Choose a group of technical thinkers that other hackers look up too. These are now your customers. The goal is to get them to move to your city. If you can do that, others will follow. </p><p>How do you get them to move? Well, these folks are not used to friendly governments, and are accessible on twitter. Reach out, offer to help, do the schlep work, and a movement can start. Mayor Suarez kicked this offw and has shown what’s possible. If I was a Mayor of any other city, I’d be studying this thoroughly.</p><p>If you can get a clump to form, now you have tinder. All you need to do is to add spark.</p><p>That spark is capital. I put this last, because if you have all of the above, capital will flock to you. In todays world, money is starving for assets. Many an angel investor dreams of …</p></span></p></div></div></div></div>

          <p>I have seen a significant uptick of people posting or joining the forums and using belligerent language, making unilateral demands and insulting the process that is open source software. “The fact you haven’t done x is stupid”. “How can you write a piece of software that doesn’t do y?”. “It’s 2021 and you still can’t make a program do z, how pathetic”. Not exact words, but accurate sentiments.</p>
<p>Please don’t do this. Please be nice.</p>
<p>The Signal team, as with any open-source team, are not infinite resources to pour down the drain. Every hour they spend on their job working for Signal, every hour they spend after work helping out, every hour a volunteer puts into forum support and bug investigation, is an hour consumed. To receive insults and vitriol in return is corrosive. It is unfair and it is not in the spirit of giving, of making something and offering it for free.</p>
<p>You’re receiving this for free, this great software which is made by people who <em>literally care</em> about your privacy. They don’t know you, and they sure don’t know what you talk about on Signal, and yet they put in a lot of effort for this. Not to make wads of cash. Not to sell you to advertisers for your social life to be analysed and abused.</p>
<p>The developer for the Mastodon software Fedilab recently <a href="https://framagit.org/tom79/fedilab/-/issues/498" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">revealed he has been burnt out</a> and I’ve read elsewhere it was because people were screaming hate at him for a principle he upheld - which was that his software would not censor people screaming hate at each other. I’m sure you can appreciate the painful irony here. (Please note that his stepping down seems to be for real, the specific reasons I’ve gave are speculation). I, for one, chose his software specifically because it did not censor, because whilst I believe a service can censor if it chooses, software must remain neutral. (If you wish to discuss this, perhaps let’s do that on another thread).</p>
<p>Don’t be that person. Don’t jump on issues making demands. Don’t pile on forum threads that make some users’ opinions very clear as it is, and throw your bellicose howling in there too. Don’t insult the developers or their priorities, their choices. They are real people who have a finite capacity for work and for abuse. Add a thumbs up to an issue, add a heart to a forum request. Post only if you can materially add to the discussion, else use a reaction. Post in the spirit and the letter of the <a href="https://community.signalusers.org/guidelines">community guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>Please be nice.</p>

          <p>We as old community members should also be reminded to be nice even when other people are not nice.<br>
I can talk of myself (and think many other here feel the same) that sometimes when a wave of people hits and behave bad I am angry and I should be nicer to other people.</p>
<p>So to us, even when we have people misbehave and maybe even spaming or other stuff we should still try to be serious and nice to each other :)</p>

        <p>Taking a risk of offending people is not a means to push your opinion. There is no law against it, but there are community guidelines against it.<br>
Pushing the buttons of other people, you full well know that sooner or later you will push a button that triggers something. That’s why we don’t push each others buttons in the first place. you can always make your point without being rude.</p>

          <p>This is a great example of what not to say.</p>

<p>This is not cool, and you have kind of missed the point entirely.</p>
<p>As the post says, the people behind the non-profit app are spending time out of their days to help everyone get the best out of the app. Of late, with the influx of users requesting (and demanding!) features akin to WhatsApp and the other monstrosities, it’s likely to take its toll.</p>
<p>I appreciate what you are saying, to a degree. I also don’t think your post should be ‘hidden’ as it’s been reported by the Cancel-Culture-Community. I firmly believe that if you say something, you own that! As you will expect, people are entitled to reply to that to support or rebut. That’s called a conversation. So you shouldn’t be denied that. That said, the Community Guidelines are what they are. And if we disagree, we can chose not to participate.</p>
<p>In summary, the bottom line is being aware of the unkindness towards those trying to help. Berating developers for not having something featured isn’t likely to inspire ‘will’. Neither is your post. But then you have every right to say what you have said and others have the right to reply to it accordingly. In my opinion, anyway.</p>

          <p>Firstly. Thank you to Signal Devs. I think you’re all doing an amazing job and I will be signing up to donate, even if it is a small amount.</p>
<p>One thing I want to say to the Signal Dev Team. I bet that 99% of your user base appreciate all the hard work you are doing and want to support you in any way they can, myself included, even if just morally. Please don’t let that 1% of intolerant users discourage you from all the great input you have.</p>
<p>I am a great supporter of free speech even if something is “offensive” but posters must also realize the difference between <strong>“saying something offensive”</strong> and <strong>"hate speech"</strong></p>

<p>You might have the right to say what you want, but free speech isn’t about interrupting a conversation about football yelling about zebras. Free speech is about tolerance, about a productive and focused conversation –that’s why there’re guidelines, and why guidelines are there to be tolerated.</p>

<p>I was one of the flaggers. I am fine with someone disagreeing with me and refuting or rebutting what I’ve said. I even tolerate them doing so rudely if their points are salient. (A few hours later I usually come back and +1 their post with begrudging flouncing) If their first post on a forum is flaming someone without addressing a single one of their points in a coherent or sensible way, misrepresenting the letter and spirit of the conversation and acting generally in bad-faith, then I will flag that as it’s not a conversation, it’s just pointless screaming. If they also break the rules then they’re definitely getting a flag.</p>
<p>Flagging/reporting a post is not cancel culture at all. Flagging a rude, abusive or entirely unconstructive post is doing your bit as a member of the community to weed out bad behaviour and bad actors. I urge everyone to flag anyone posting in bad faith, or breaking the rules. Flag it all and let the pages written by people who detract from the conversation burn.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<article>
    <p>Everyone knows good code is easy to maintain, but that also means anyone can maintain it. That’s no bueno for the individual developer who wants a little job security. Writing overly complex code that nobody else can maintain let alone read, will ensure your company holds onto you, and will give you more bargaining power come raise time.</p>
<p>We’re going to work with a simplified example for the rest of this article. Imagine your boss has asked you to write a program that will count from 1 to 9 and print out the number, along with if it is even. A valid output would be as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">1 is even: False
2 is even: True
3 is even: False
4 is even: True
5 is even: False
6 is even: True
7 is even: False
8 is even: True
9 is even: False
</code></pre></div><p>Your boss might’ve said this would be part of the test suite for the NPM package <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-even">is-even</a> but you stopped listening about halfway through to figure out how many story points this would be on the next sprint.</p>
<p>Oh well, sounds easy enough right? Any developer worth their salt knows a simple for loop could solve this problem.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (int i = 1; i &lt; 10; i++) {
  Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {i % 2 == 0}");
}
</code></pre></div><p>But as correct as this solution might be, it doesn’t guarantee us job security which is after all the most important principle of good code.</p>
<p>Time to add a little complexity to ensure no one else will dare touch the code, or try to understand it.</p>

<p>Just so we’re all on the same page, a for loop is comprised of a statement, and a body.</p>
<p>The statement is the portion which sits atop the loop and is within parenthesis. It’s divided into three parts. Each of which is separated by a semi-colon.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for(initializer; condition; iterator) {}
</code></pre></div><ol>
<li>initializer: The initializer is the first part, and usually instantiates a variable. Say <code>int i = 0;</code></li>
<li>condition: The condition is the middle portion and is checked each pass of the loop to ensure it’s true. When the condition tests false, the loop is exited.</li>
<li>iterator: The last portion is the iterator, this is typically used to increment the loop variable ex: <code>i++</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>All 3 parts of the statement are optional, and an empty for loop <code>for (; ;) { }</code> will act like an infinite while loop <code>while(1) { }</code>.</p>
<p>The body is the portion of the loop below the statement. Usually surrounded by curly braces, unless it’s one line (as they’re optional then). I should also mention that the body is optional too.</p>
<p>Let’s go ahead and start writing our <em>ahem</em> abomination.</p>

<p>First off we’ve got some domain logic operating inside the for loop body. The ternary that detects if the number is even: <code>i % 2 == 0</code>. Let’s go ahead and squeeze it into the for statement because after all that’s where it belongs.</p>
<p>We’re going to need an extra variable to hold a <code>isEven</code> flag. But, there’s a bit of a problem. C# only allows for defining multiple variables of the same type in one line. So while the following is perfectly valid:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for(int a = 0, b = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {}
</code></pre></div><p>This is not:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for(int a = 0, bool isEven = false; i &lt; 10; i++) {}
</code></pre></div><p>But that’s okay because we’ll slap it in a value tuple and deconstruct it.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for(var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i &lt; 10; i++) {}
</code></pre></div><p>Now that’s beautiful.</p>
<p>With the bool instantiated we just need to recalculate it each time in the iterator. Thankfully C# is cool with assigning multiple variables of different types on the same line.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i &lt; 10; i++, isEven = i % 2 == 0) { }
</code></pre></div><p>And now our for loop body has been devoided of any logic. It’s clean and concise.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i &lt; 10; i++, isEven = i % 2 == 0) { 
  Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}");
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>I’d argue <code>i &lt; 10</code> is too readable. Since the condition just needs to be a boolean we can substitute it with anything we please provided it evaluates to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. Which basically makes it a no-brainer to swap it out with a switch expression.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i switch { 10 =&gt; false, _ =&gt; true }; i++, isEven = i % 2 == 0) { 
  Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}");
}
</code></pre></div><p>The switch expression will still run our loop from 1 to 9 as intended. Each iteration of the loop it’ll see which case it matches i against. The underscore (or discard) is equivalent to the default case of a switch statement. Therefore while i is not 10 it’ll return true which means keep running the loop, and once it hits 10 the switch will return false saying it’s time to stop.</p>
<p>But we can take this a step further and add erroneous cases. As long as the switch never hits said cases it doesn’t mess with the logic.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i switch { 10 =&gt; false, 14 =&gt; true, 69 =&gt; false, 420 =&gt; true,_ =&gt; true }; i++, isEven = i % 2 == 0) { 
  Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}");
}
</code></pre></div><p>And on top of that they don’t even have to be in order. Also note that erroneous cases can return <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. This is extra important to add another layer of confusion.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i switch { 14 =&gt; false, 69 =&gt; true, 10 =&gt; false, 420 =&gt; true, _ =&gt; true }; i++, isEven = i % 2 == 0) { 
  Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}");
}
</code></pre></div><p>For the finishing touch let’s kick it up a notch. A switch case has to be a literal or constant, which removes the usages of methods, and the such but still leaves math on the table.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i switch { 14 * 4 =&gt; false, 69 * 250 / 84 =&gt; true, 10 =&gt; false, 420 =&gt; true, _ =&gt; true }; i++, isEven = i % 2 == 0) { 
  Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}");
}
</code></pre></div><p>I recommend leaving the math a fifth grade level. We want to give the reader a flash back to their day in grade school learning their multiplication tables.</p>
<p>Oh and did I mention we can add some math and more to the return values? After all they just need to be booleans.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i switch { 14 * 4 =&gt; false, 69 * 250 / 84 =&gt; 8 / 2 == 4, 10 =&gt; false, 420 =&gt; 7 * 6 == 92, _ =&gt; true }; i++, isEven = i % 2 == 0) { 
  Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}");
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>We’re not done yet. Our solution is optimal, but everyone knows that a 1 line solution is <strong>always</strong> better. Right now you’re either begging for mercy or thinking there’s no way it’s possible. Even if we removed the brackets it’s still 2 lines.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i switch { 14 * 4 =&gt; false, 69 * 250 / 84 =&gt; 8 / 2 == 4, 10 =&gt; false, 420 =&gt; 7 * 6 == 92, _ =&gt; true }; i++, isEven = i % 2 == 0)
  Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}");
</code></pre></div><p>But if there’s a will there’s a way.</p>
<p>Our next magic trick is going to involve a little inspiration from JavaScript. Have you ever heard of a self invoking function? It’s basically a function declaration that immediately executes itself.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">(function () {
  console.log("foo");
})();
// prints "foo" to the console
</code></pre></div><p>And while we may be in the .NET world, who’s to say we can’t borrow a little inspiration?</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">new Action(() =&gt; Console.WriteLine("foo"))();
// prints "foo" to the console
</code></pre></div><p>Let’s take our new found knowledge and replace the iterator of our loop. Because after all when all you’ve got is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i switch { 14 * 4 =&gt; false, 69 * 250 / 84 =&gt; 8 / 2 == 4, 10 =&gt; false, 420 =&gt; 7 * 6 == 92, _ =&gt; true }; (i, isEven) = new Func&lt;int, (int, bool)&gt;((i) =&gt; (i + 1, !(i % 2 == 0)))(i)) {
    Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}");
}
</code></pre></div><p>This is the little bit we added.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">new Func&lt;int, (int, bool)&gt;((i) =&gt; (i + 1, !(i % 2 == 0)))(i)
</code></pre></div><p>A Func&lt;&gt; is the same thing as an Action except it can have parameters, and a return value. In our instance, the function takes an int parameter, and returns a value tuple containing an int, and bool. Make sure you name your function parameters the same as the variable being passed in.</p>
<p>The real reason why we added in the self invoking function isn’t to make it more confusing. No. We just needed a new location to place our <code>Console.WriteLine()</code> call.</p>
<p>That my friends is how we can achieve our glorious one liner solution.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i switch { 14 * 4 =&gt; false, 69 * 250 / 84 =&gt; 8 / 2 == 4, 10 =&gt; false, 420 =&gt; 7 * 6 == 92, _ =&gt; true }; (i, isEven) = new Func&lt;int, (int, bool)&gt;((i) =&gt; { Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}"); return (i + 1, !(i % 2 == 0)); })(i));

</code></pre></div><p>Here’s the self invoking function for those who somehow have trouble reading our work of art.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">new Func&lt;int, (int, bool)&gt;((i) =&gt; { Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}"); return (i + 1, !(i % 2 == 0); }(i)
</code></pre></div>
<p>We could take things further, but before doing some I’d recommend assessing the rankings of your co-workers. If you work alongside a lot of junior devs, it’s probably sufficient, but if you work with more senior developers we could always break out a few more tricks. I’ll leave this as an exercise for the reader.</p>
<p>With everything coded up, and testing good, it’s time to commit your masterpiece and send off some requests for code reviews. Come to think of it it’s probably about time to head on home as this likely took most the day. Go home and enjoy some brews. Because tomorrow when your boss calls you into his office it’s gonna be for that promotion you’ve been wanting.</p>
<p>PS: If anyone is hiring an entry level code obfuscator please let me know.</p>

<p>Thank you Chris Cattano for pointing out I had a logic error in the code bits after switching to the self invoking function. The program was incorrectly reporting which numbers were odd. Turns out even I fell prey to the complexity.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>The Mac has always been very different from its close relative, iOS, especially when it comes to what a user is or is not allowed to run on their system. Even with the introduction of Apple Silicon, Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10686/?t=1161">has made it very clear</a> that the Mac is still the Mac, and is still <em>hackable</em>, even when running on the new architecture.</p><p>What this means for us developers is that, when targeting the Mac platform, we have choices: we can distribute our apps independently, outside the Mac App Store, through the Mac App Store exclusively, or through both at the same time.</p><p>This article is my brain dump on the subject. It is meant to be a guide on the things that you’ll need to know about when distributing a Mac app outside the App Store, rather than a how-to tutorial. My hope is that having everything listed here will help demystify the process for beginners, and the descriptions of my own process will be useful as starting points.</p><h2>App Store x Direct: pros and cons</h2><p>All of these choices come with their pros and cons, and depending on which type of Mac app you’re making, you might not be able to have it in the Mac App Store to begin with. An example of that is my app <a href="https://v2.airbuddy.app/">AirBuddy</a> which, in order to provide deep integration with Apple’s wireless devices, needs to run a system agent and use some private APIs, which would never be allowed in the App Store. The same goes for many other types of apps which simply wouldn’t work with the restrictions of the Mac’s sandbox.</p><p>For those who do have that choice, I’ve compiled a list of what I believe to be the pros and cons between shipping through the Mac App Store or shipping directly.</p><h3>Mac App Store pros</h3><ul><li>Apple handles the distribution, billing and licensing for you</li><li>The app is easier to find and install for most users</li><li>Potential to get featured by Apple and reach more customers</li><li>Can use features such as Sign in With Apple which are not available for apps distributed outside the Mac App Store</li></ul><h3>Mac App Store cons</h3><ul><li>Have to pay a 15% or 30% cut of all sales to Apple, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/">depending on how much you make in a year across all apps</a></li><li>Every single update, no matter how minor, has to go through App Review and has the potential of being rejected for arbitrary and random reasons</li><li>Can’t unlock the full potential of macOS because of the strict sandboxing requirements</li><li>Can’t do paid upgrades</li></ul><h3>Direct distribution pros</h3><ul><li>Ship updates whenever you want, no need to wait for them to be reviewed and no fear of random rejections</li><li>Unlock the full potential of macOS with system extensions, daemons, no sandboxing, private API, and more</li><li>Keep a higher percentage of your sales</li><li>Do paid upgrades or other business models which are not allowed in the App Store</li><li>Live without the constant fear that your app will suddenly become a problem for Apple and be threatened with removal from the App Store</li></ul><h3>Direct distribution cons</h3><ul><li>Have to handle licensing, distribution, and updates (it’s not that hard, you’ll see)</li><li>Not as easy to do consumable or non-consumable in-app purchases (no StoreKit)</li><li>Can’t use some Apple services such as Sign in With Apple (others such as CloudKit still work just fine)</li></ul><h2>A note on Catalyst and SwiftUI</h2><p>With the introduction of Catalyst, we’re now seeing many new Mac apps being released, since it’s a lot easier to take an existing iPad app and turn it into a Mac app. Apps ported to macOS through Catalyst are not required to be released in the App Store, even if their counterpart on iOS is.</p><p>Additionally, there is currently no TestFlight for macOS (one of my wishes for 2021), so if you’d like to distribute beta builds of a Catalyst app, you’ll have to do that outside the Mac App Store, and it is not that different from distributing a production app.</p><p>A lot of what I’m presenting here will also apply for Catalyst apps — they’re Mac apps, after all — but some might require additional hacking in order to work around the fact that Apple doesn’t want you to use the entirety of AppKit directly from within a Catalyst app. With a bit of work though, you can make a Catalyst app very Mac-capable, including <a href="https://www.highcaffeinecontent.com/blog/20190607-Beyond-the-Checkbox-with-Catalyst-and-AppKit">support for AppleScript</a> and other features.</p><p>For SwiftUI apps targeting the Mac, there should be no major differences with the distribution process, since you can use all features of the macOS API in a SwiftUI app without requiring a lot of hacking like it does for Catalyst apps.</p><h2>Distribution</h2><p>Distribution of an app involves two parts: actually uploading, storing and serving the app binary and its updates somewhere, and also producing the right package that will work for your users.</p><h3>Hosting</h3><p>The first major step with getting your Mac app in the hands of users without the App Store is to figure out how to distribute its binary. No App Store means that you’ll have to host your app’s binaries and updates somewhere on the internet and provide a link for your users to download it.</p><p>There are several ways you can go about this. For an open-source app, you can use Github releases and even host your app’s update feed in the Github repo. That’s how I distribute the <a href="https://github.com/insidegui/WWDC/releases">WWDC app for macOS</a>.</p><p>For my commercial apps, I’ve been using <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html">Backblaze B2</a> for storage of both the app binaries, delta updates and update feed, and proxying all requests through <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> so that I can have a custom domain for the downloads/updates and also add filtering, caching and logic on the server if needed.</p><p>B2 is an extremely affordable provider (I rarely pay over US$1 in a month). Most Mac apps are not that large in size, so even if your app is downloaded a lot, it’s unlikely that you’ll end up having to pay a lot of money for storage/bandwidth. Another popular option is using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> buckets, but their control panel gives me nightmares so I prefer to use B2 which is a lot simpler (and less expensive).</p><p>I haven’t automated the publishing step for my app releases as of yet, so to upload a new release I just use <a href="https://panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a> as a client for my B2 buckets. Speaking of that, before we even get to upload a release to whatever provider we’ve chosen, there’s a very important step: getting the right file to put out there.</p><h3>Notarization and packaging</h3><p>When exporting an archived app from within Xcode, we get two main options for distribution: App Store Connect and Developer ID. To distribute apps without the App Store, you’re going to be using Developer ID.</p><p>The same developer account you use for distributing apps to the Mac App Store can be used to sign your apps for Developer ID distribution. The certificate itself is different, but Xcode will auto-generate and install one for you during the process of exporting the archive if you haven’t done so yet.</p><p>Since macOS Catalina, all apps distributed directly to users must be notarized by Apple, otherwise they won’t launch by default. This process uploads your app to Apple, which will then run automated malware checks and “staple” your binary with a special signature that will allow it to run. This is not App Review, it’s an automated check to prevent malware from being distributed through this method, and it is also a way for Apple to flag a single binary for malware, instead of a developer’s entire account, should it become compromised at some point.</p><p>Whether or not you notarize the binary directly from within the Xcode organizer will depend on which packaging method you’ll be using to distribute your app. We can’t just upload a <code>.app</code> directory to a server and let users download that, we have to turn it into a flat file. The simple way to do that is to just zip the app and distribute it as a zip file, but I’ve found through experience that distributing the app as a DMG file reduces support requests by quite a bit.</p><p>You’ve probably seen DMGs before when downloading Mac apps. They’re disk images that are mounted by macOS when double-clicked in Finder, and they can also provide some artwork instructing the user to drag the app into their Applications folder. This makes it easy for a user to figure out what to do, and it also reduces the chances that a given user will be running your app from their Downloads folder or some other random place like that.</p><p>If you’re going to be distributing your app as a DMG, you should just export it using the Developer ID option in Xcode, without notarization, then notarize the DMG itself. There’s no option in Xcode to export a DMG, so you’ll have to use a third-party tool. The one I like to use is <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/create-dmg">create-dmg</a>. I’ve also created and open-sourced <a href="https://github.com/insidegui/dmgdist">dmgdist</a>, a tool that automates the process of creating, uploading and stapling the DMG so that you can get the image ready to be distributed by running a single command.</p><p>To distribute the app as a zip file, the process is simpler: pick the upload option from Xcode after selecting “Developer ID” and it’ll produce a notarized version of your app, which you can then zip up and distribute directly.</p><h2>App updates</h2><p>Another aspect of the App Store is that it also handles app updates. Whenever we upload a new version to App Store Connect and it gets approved, users receive the update in the App Store. For apps distributed directly, we need to replicate that somehow.</p><p>The best way to do that — and the most common — is to use <a href="https://sparkle-project.org/">Sparkle</a>. It’s been around for many many years and is pretty much the official way to distribute updates for Mac apps distributed outside the Mac App Store.</p><p>Sparkle is currently living a double life of sorts. You can either use the “legacy” version of Sparkle or use a more modern “v2” branch which includes many improvements such as the ability to update sandboxed apps. I still use the “legacy” version because it’s the one that I’m familiar with and I find that integrating the more modern version is still a bit more complicated. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.</p><p>The process of generating an app update usually goes as follows: ensure that with every update you increase the app’s version (of course), produce the package as described before (Sparkle can handle zips, DMGs and installer packages), then use the <code>generate_appcast</code> tool to update the feed. After doing that, upload the deltas, the package for the new version, and the updated AppCast …</p></div></article></div>

                <div>
                    <p>Over one year ago, I decided to quit my data science job and pursue my <a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/">bootstrapped data science side-project</a> full time. It was a hard decision to make, but once I quit and was freed from the corporate nine to five, my life turned to complete bliss.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>That bliss lasted about two weeks before it reverted back to the mean. Honeymoons exist in all facets of life, and bootstrapping a business does not make you impervious to Mondays. Rather every day just became a Thursday. But more on that later...</p><p>I wanted to reflect on this past year plus of bootstrapping and add in some frameworks for why anyone reading this on the fence of quitting their job for their side-hustle should do so. Quitting was one of the hardest decisions that I had to make, but the best one I went through with. It's also a decision that many people should not do. </p><p>But for the small percentage of the people out there, bootstrapping a startup can be an awesome thing. You resign yourself to make trades. </p><p>You trade a steady stream of work and meetings for flexibility in your own time and hours. You trade your current monthly salary now for no income but with future options of money. And you trade office externalities and politics for taking full control of how your career might turn out. </p><p>And ultimately if those trades and values are worth it, then quitting your job can make sense in a very real way. </p><h2 id="how-it-got-started">How it got started</h2><p>On November 1st 2019, I officially quit my job as a data scientist at Nextdoor after working there for exactly a year. I had started a side project called Interview Query with my co-founder, Shane, six months prior. </p><p>Interview Query started out as an email newsletter that each day sent a user a data science interview question, and then the solution the next day if the user upgraded to premium. Over the past year we’ve built the product into a fully-fledged data science course, questions database, and became the de-facto data science interview prep resource.<br></p><figure><img src="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-18.png" alt="Interview Query SQL" srcset="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-18.png 600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/image-18.png 1000w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-18.png 1364w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>An example of a SQL interview question we would send out. If you paid for premium, we would send a detailed explanation + solution the next day.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The first time someone purchased a subscription in June of 2019, my co-founder Shane was convinced it was a stolen credit card. It took five more customers before he truly believed that we were not just a test platform for fraudsters. And we watched in fascination as our newsletter grew from $60/mo in revenue to $3,000/mo in revenue. <br></p><figure><img src="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-19.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-19.png 600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/image-19.png 1000w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-19.png 1258w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>And while $3K/mo was a lot of money, it still wasn’t enough to constitute quitting our jobs. Shane was working part-time on it while also working a software engineering job. And I was also a pretty senior data scientist making <a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/blog-data-science-salaries">$160K/year</a>. So an apples to apples comparison of going from to $14K/month to $1.5K/month didn’t really seem worth it. </p><p>But direct income &nbsp;isn’t the only comparison you have to make. </p><h2 id="opportunity-cost">Opportunity Cost</h2><p>The hardest jump to make is almost always on money. Money has always had significance to me. I was born and raised as a Chinese American which meant money was and still is an intrinsic part of my identity. The comedian <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_KpLrHCAx0">Ronnie Chieng does a funny bit</a> on what money means to Chinese people.</p><blockquote>“Do you know what the direct translation of <em>Happy New Year</em> in Mandarin is? Hope - you - get - rich. <strong>That's not Happy New Year!</strong>"</blockquote><p>To my Chinese parents, they could have added an addendum of - <em>Hope you get rich while working a stable job with low risk.</em> For with all monetary pursuits, the equation that works best within typical Chinese American families is:</p><p><em>Current income * very stable job * years of working = <strong>Best Possible Outcome Ever</strong></em></p><p>It’s a pretty linear expectation of wealth that requires a normal day to day grind and the advantages of compound interest. But the equation never really took into account tweaking the risk factor. What happens when your current income drops and risk tolerance increases? </p><p>This was the pivotal question that made it difficult for me to quit. But a month before I ended up leaving, I met up with my old startup boss at a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/08/monster-snaps-up-tinder-for-jobs-app-jobr/">company where we exited into an acquisition</a>. I told him about the dilemma I was in, and he illustrated a newer way of looking at it. </p><blockquote>If you have a product that’s making $3K/month and you can grow that into $5K/month in a few months by working full time on it, you have to realize that the <strong>actual added value of growing your business</strong> is turning it from $36K/year in revenue to $60K/year in revenue.<br></blockquote><p>This realization helped me understand the <strong>value investment of full-time work. </strong>Money and finances can be traded for time and investment in a business in ways that you can't when you work a job. Work your ass off for a year at any FAANG type of tech company and your boss will reward you with a 15% raise. Work hard on your business and double your monthly revenue after a year, <strong>well your business also just doubled in value. </strong></p><p>So the opportunity cost of trading a job that made me $160K/year didn’t seem that bad anymore if I could at least <strong>forecast a rate of growth that would be worth my time and investment</strong> as if I was working another full time job. </p><p>And at least on my own business, I’d enjoy the work. </p><h2 id="flexibility-and-values">Flexibility and Values</h2><p>Everything gets destroyed when you bulldoze a building. The walls, the appliances, even parts of the foundation. And while throwing a wrecking ball into the corporate 9-5 felt gratifying, picking up the pieces to rebuild <strong>exactly how I would work</strong> took just as much careful planning and thought. </p><p>Balancing structure and life is important when bootstrapping. A lifestyle business allows you flexibility in how you would like to run your business. Before I quit my job, I talked to a career coach (ironically employed by the company) who encouraged me to figure out my values - and try to see if quitting allowed me to prioritize them accordingly.</p><p>Eventually I realized it did when I wanted to re-prioritize my activity list from:</p><ol><li><em>Data science job</em></li><li><em>Surfing</em></li><li><em>Side-Hustle (Interview Query)</em></li><li><em>Friends and Relationships</em></li><li><em>Random data projects</em></li></ol><p>to</p><ol><li><em>Surfing</em></li><li><em>Interview Query</em></li><li><em>Friends and Relationships</em></li><li><em>Random data projects</em></li><li><em>Things I don’t want to do but have to do to make money</em></li></ol><p>This clear order of change in my lifestyle made me realize that valuing flexibility was extremely important. It was also something I couldn't attain in my day job.</p><p>For example, when an amazing swell approaches Ocean Beach now, I reschedule meetings, log off, and go surfing. Shane and I both have trust that I'm going to finish the work that needs to get done. But if I were to receive a meeting at my old job that conflicted or I didn't want to attend - there was no way around it. </p><p>As controllers of our own fate, we make it a priority to cut down all the things we don’t want to do, and hire for those roles. If we need vacation time, then we take it.</p><p>But on that note of flexibility comes the other way - how flexible can we be while still working? And how much did we really want to work in general?</p><h2 id="financial-independence-of-sorts">Financial Independence of Sorts</h2><p>In February of 2020, Interview Query was churning out a consistent $9K/month in revenue. We tripled revenue by increasing our distribution and had transitioned from the email newsletter to building a very simple interface for viewing all of the interview questions and solutions. It was also enough to now cover my rent and general expenses.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-22.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-22.png 600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/image-22.png 1000w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/image-22.png 1600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w2400/2021/01/image-22.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/questions/bank-fraud-model">Our current interface - much improved from before</a></figcaption></figure><p>And better yet we still weren’t even working that much. I had taken a long vacation in New Zealand and Shane was still working part time. For a moment, it seemed like it was going to be a 4-hour work week kind of business that we could maintain without adding new product features. </p><p>But realistically, <strong>I had nothing else to work on</strong>. I still hadn’t gotten any of my other side-projects off the ground at the time. Surfing season was slowly ramping down. I looked around at what I was doing and realized that this project was the only one working and growing on its own. So why not invest to work on it?</p><p>One of my favorite ice breakers is asking people what they would do with their life if they received $10,000/month forever. Kind of like a basic<strong> </strong>(wealthy) income. Many people say travel (<em>which seems illogical given the extent of traveling for the rest of your life</em>), others say they’d make music, volunteer full time, work on making furniture, even working at a boba shop.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-20.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-20.png 600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-20.png 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Our New Zealand van!</figcaption></figure><p>It’s a thought experiment on the idea of financial independence (FIRE). And at its core, the question is asking about what you would practically do for the rest of your life if money wasn’t an issue. The current existence of career advancement is fueled by a never-ending competition in monetary and title status. But if those were all stripped away, what would be left to complete life satisfaction?</p><p>I realized there was nothing else I wanted to do but build a startup anyway. Of course money will always matter and I inherently want to grow the business bigger and bigger. But what happens when it’s just a question of: <em>what do I do with my time when my expenses are accounted for and I want to be productive?</em></p><p>Many people in the FIRE community seem to be at loss when they finally achieve their financial freedom. They grind at a job for 15 years to finally quit and reach the same elation that I felt for maybe a few weeks or even months to suddenly fall back into a depression of sorts. Their life has no purpose after hitting their number. Which makes sense, because for 15 years <strong>all they knew about was the grind</strong> and <strong>all they thought about was hitting their number</strong>.</p><p>I personally love startups and businesses. Building and running companies requires the experience and skillset to get better at doing so. And so the question posed that helped me understand things was: </p><p><em>Would you rather be completely financially independent at age X and then quit your job to try a startup, or get good at building startups now and be a complete pro at age X instead?</em></p><h2 id="buy-futures-in-yourself">Buy Futures in Yourself</h2><p>The first few weeks after quitting my job I enjoyed the classic freedom and flexibility I had …</p></div></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img alt="nRF9160 Feather Test CLI" src="https://www.jaredwolff.com/testing-hardware-using-rust/images/Screen_Shot_2021-01-06_at_10.30.55_AM.png" data-src="images/Screen_Shot_2021-01-06_at_10.30.55_AM.png"></p><p>Rust has grown on me over the past year. I consumed <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/" target="_blank">The Book</a> while on a plane ride in February of last year <em>right</em> before Covid hit. It has basically been all downhill since. 😅</p><p>Since then, i’ve designed a (very alpha) <a href="https://github.com/jaredwolff/eagle-plm" target="_blank">CLI based MRP system</a>, e-commerce backend for <a href="https://www.jaredwolff.com/store/" target="_blank">my static website</a>, CLI based tester and firmware for my nRF9160 Feather test fixture. Yea, all in Rust.</p><p>In this article, i’ll be sharing details about how I developed the CLI and ATSAMD based tester for the <a href="https://www.jaredwolff.com/store/nrf9160-feather/" target="_blank">nRF9160 Feather</a>. By the end this should give you confidence that you can also develop your own firmware and software 100% in Rust!</p><p>Let’s get started.</p><h2 id="sprinkle-some-rust-in-your-firmware">Sprinkle some Rust in your firmware</h2><p><img alt="nRF9160 Feather tester hardware render" src="https://www.jaredwolff.com/testing-hardware-using-rust/images/feather-tester_v14.png" data-src="images/feather-tester_v14.png"></p><p>As mentioned earlier, I designed my tester hardware (pictured above) to use an ATSAMD microcontroller. I had a few reasons why I chose the ATSAMD21:</p><ol><li>It has a <strong>ton</strong> of pins. (ATSAMD21J18A-MFT has 52 to be exact!) This was going to be important in order to connect to and control everything about the DUT (Device under test) in the tester.</li><li>SAMD21 series is also ubiquitous and plentiful elsewhere. It also happens to have great support in the form of the <code>atsamd-hal</code> crate. (<a href="https://github.com/atsamd-rs/atsamd" target="_blank">Link</a>)</li></ol><p>While there is some test firmware on the DUT itself, there’s a bunch of exciting stuff happening on the tester side. But before we do, let’s chat about the bootloader.</p><h3 id="first-thing-you-should-do">First thing you should do</h3><p>After lots of tinkering I realized that one of the first things you should do on any SAMD based project is get the UF2 bootloader loaded. Since loading it onto my test board <strong>I haven’t used my debug probe.</strong> (Rust makes this extremely easy since it eliminates 80% of the stupid mistakes i’d otherwise make in C)</p><p>Here’s a quick primer on how I got my board working:</p><ol><li><p>I cloned the UF2 repo:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">git clone https://github.com/microsoft/uf2-samdx1
</code></pre></div></li><li><p>Created a folder called <code>circuitdojo_feather_tester</code> within the <code>boards</code> directory.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">cd uf2-samdx1
mkdir boards/circuitdojo_feather_tester
</code></pre></div></li><li><p>I created <code>board.mk</code> and <code>board_config.h</code></p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">cd boards/circuitdojo_feather_tester
touch board.mk
touch board_config.h
</code></pre></div></li><li><p>Using the already existing boards in the <code>boards</code> folder, updated the contents of <code>http://board.mk</code> and <code>board_config.h</code>. First <code>board.mk</code> to define what chip I was targeting:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c">CHIP_FAMILY <span>=</span> samd21
CHIP_VARIANT <span>=</span> SAMD21J18A
</code></pre></div><p>Then <code>board_config.h</code> for all the configuration bits:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>#ifndef BOARD_CONFIG_H
</span><span>#define BOARD_CONFIG_H
</span><span></span>
<span>#define VENDOR_NAME "Circuit Dojo"
</span><span>#define PRODUCT_NAME "Feather Tester"
</span><span>#define VOLUME_LABEL "BOOT"
</span><span>#define INDEX_URL "https:</span><span>//www.jaredwolff.com/"
</span><span></span><span>#define BOARD_ID "SAMD21G18A-Feather-v0"
</span><span></span>
<span>#define USB_VID 0x16c0
</span><span>#define USB_PID 0x27dd
</span><span></span>
<span>#define LED_PIN PIN_PA22
</span><span></span>
<span>#endi
</span></code></pre></div></li><li><p>Then using the instructions in the Readme, build the code:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">make BOARD<span>=</span>circuitdojo_feather_tester
</code></pre></div><p>I used the toolchain that comes with NCS v1.4.1. I did have to make a change to the Makefile for everything to compile without borking. Turns out my toolchain was newer than expected. Fortunately adding <code>Wno-deprecated</code> inside the Makefile to the <code>WFLAGS</code> variable fixes this problem.</p></li><li><p>Once complete it will dump your binary/hex files to <code>build/&lt;your board name&gt;</code></p></li><li><p>Then I flashed the bootloader using <code>pyocd</code> like so:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">pyocd flash -t ATSAMD21J18A -f <span>4000000</span> bootloader-circuitdojo_feather_tester-v3.4.0-65-gdf89a1f-dirty.elf --format elf
</code></pre></div><p><code>pyocd</code> is just one of many ways to load firmware. The <a href="https://github.com/atsamd-rs/atsamd" target="_blank"><code>atsamd-rs</code> repo</a> has a ton more options.</p></li></ol><p>Once programmed, hit the reset button twice in quick succession to enable bootloader mode. (I believe this is consistent across all other boards using the UF2 bootloader. Correct me if i’m wrong!) This will cause the bootloader to remain active so you can transfer new firmware.</p><p>On a scale from easy to painful, this was defintiely on the easy side of the spectrum. The folks at Microsoft and contributors like Adafruit made this process <em>really simple.</em></p><h3 id="hey-my-name-is-hal">Hey, my name is HAL</h3><p><img alt="Compiling Rust firmware" src="https://www.jaredwolff.com/testing-hardware-using-rust/images/Screen_Shot_2021-01-10_at_12.37.34_PM.png" data-src="images/Screen_Shot_2021-01-10_at_12.37.34_PM.png"></p><p>As of this writing, every different hardware platform has some type of independently created HAL (hardware abstraction layer). Atmel’s SAMD differs slightly from nRF and that differs from the STM32s of the world. The nice thing is as long as they conform to the higher level APIs, you can use something like the <a href="https://github.com/mvirkkunen/usb-device" target="_blank">USB crate</a> which supports ATSAMD and STM32.</p><p>The fastest way to get started with your own ATSAMD based board to create your own board definition. You can find a <strong>ton</strong> of example in the <code>boards</code> directory. Many off the shelf boards are already supported which makes for one less thing you need to do!</p><p>If you do find yourself with a custom board, you can copy one of the already existing boards that is closest to yours. For instance I used <code>feather_m0</code> as the base for my tester board. I tweaked <code>memory.x</code> and <code>src/lib.rs</code> to my liking.</p><p>There’s even a cool way to define pins so you can easily access them later. For for instance if you have a pin named <code>FLASH_EN</code> and it’s mapped to pin port B, pin 8 you can simply reference it later on using the <code>Pins</code> struct like <code>pins.flash_en</code>. (More below..)</p><p>The ATSAMD repo is going through some slow and steady improvements. There are even some nice additions to the <a href="https://github.com/atsamd-rs/atsamd/pull/371" target="_blank">board support</a> area that i’m excited about and testing. While it’s mostly useable, it is rough in some areas (especially related to documentation).</p><p><em>Big shoutout to Bradley who has been spearheading these improvements. If I were to do any of this, i’d be surprised it would be working by then of it.</em> 😅</p><h3 id="dont-be-unsafe">Don’t be <code>unsafe</code></h3><p>When I first started developing the test firmware, I notice that I was using <code>unsafe</code> a lot. While in hardwareland using <code>unsafe</code> is not uncommon, from a readability and risk for increased errors perspective, it can get hairy.</p><p>There is a cool solution around this and that’s where <code>rtic</code> enters the picture. <code>rtic</code> is a new spin on how to write firmware in Rust. Instead of having the familiar <code>main</code> function, it works differently. Here’s the features from <a href="https://github.com/rtic-rs/cortex-m-rtic" target="_blank">the Github page</a>:</p><ul><li><strong>Tasks</strong>&nbsp;as the unit of concurrency [^1]. Tasks can be&nbsp;<em>event triggered</em>&nbsp;(fired in response to asynchronous stimuli) or spawned by the application on demand.</li><li><strong>Message passing</strong>&nbsp;between tasks. Specifically, messages can be passed to software tasks at spawn time.</li><li><strong>A timer queue</strong>&nbsp;[^2]. Software tasks can be scheduled to run at some time in the future. This feature can be used to implement periodic tasks.</li><li>Support for prioritization of tasks and, thus,&nbsp;<strong>preemptive multitasking</strong>.</li><li><strong>Efficient and data race free memory sharing</strong>&nbsp;through fine grained&nbsp;<em>priority based</em>&nbsp;critical sections [^1].</li><li><strong>Deadlock free execution</strong>&nbsp;guaranteed at compile time. This is an stronger guarantee than what’s provided by&nbsp;<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html" target="_blank">the standard&nbsp;<code>Mutex</code>abstraction</a>.</li><li><strong>Minimal scheduling overhead</strong>. The task scheduler has minimal software footprint; the hardware does the bulk of the scheduling.</li><li><strong>Highly efficient memory usage</strong>: All the tasks share a single call stack and there’s no hard dependency on a dynamic memory allocator.</li><li><strong>All Cortex-M devices are fully supported</strong>.</li><li>This task model is amenable to known WCET (Worst Case Execution Time) analysis and scheduling analysis techniques. (Though we haven’t yet developed Rust friendly tooling for that.)</li></ul><p>While all these features and capabilities seem great, so what gives?</p><p>Well, for starters there’s no <code>main</code> function. 🙀</p><p>Here’s what a basic blinky app looks like using some of the new BSP (Board support packages) I mentioned earlier:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>#![deny(unsafe_code)]</span>

        }
    }
};
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>init</code> function is where you would normally put anything you’d normally put in an Arduino <code>setup</code> function. We’re setting up pins and peripherals. If you want to use them later on though, you’ll need to create an entry in <code>Resources</code>. This is also where you store any type of static mutable data structures that you need elsewhere in your firmware.</p><p>The <code>idle</code> function is similar to the <code>loop</code> function in Arduino. It’s important though that if you want a loop, you have to implement it. Here’s the warning in the <a href="https://rtic.rs/0.5/book/en/by-example/app.html?highlight=loop#idle" target="_blank"><code>rtic</code> documentation</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Unlike init, idle will run with interrupts enabled and it’s not allowed to return so it must run forever.</p></blockquote><p>You don’t <strong>need</strong> to use an <code>idle</code> function though. If you don’t, your microcontroller will go to sleep. This is ideal for battery powered applications that need to sleep as much as possible.</p><p>In <code>rtic</code> every work function gets a <code>Context</code> variable. It allow you to access resources that are pertinent to that function’s purpose. Access is only granted though when you add a resource like below:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>#[idle(resources=[led_pass, delay]</span>)]
</code></pre></div><p>If <code>resources</code> was not set like above, I would not be able to use <code>led_pass</code> or <code>delay</code> within the function!</p><p>While this is a simple example, when you start using static resources like fixed size vectors you’ll be happy you chose to use <code>rtic</code>. The <a href="https://github.com/japaric/heapless" target="_blank"><code>heapless</code></a> crate has been extremely useful for setting size contrained elements that you’d normally be able to use with Rust’s <code>std</code> lib.</p><p>While <code>heapless</code> implements a few very handy types, the <code>Vec</code> and <code>spsc</code> imlementation have been <em>extremely</em> useful. If you’re looking for <code>std</code> conventions for embedded, no need to look further. Get started with <code>heapless</code> with their great documentation <a href="https://japaric.github.io/heapless/heapless/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h3 id="the-confusion-ensues">The confusion ensues</h3><p>One thing that may be confusing …</p></div></div>

  <div>
    
    

<p>Open Source Security, Inc is proud to announce its funding of a full-time and 
public development effort of a <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a> front-end for <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>.
In this blog post, we'll detail the motivations for our involvement and the benefits the public will reap
as a result of this effort.</p>

<h2>A Security Need</h2>

<p>In July of last year, shortly after my virtual <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Kza6fdkSU">presentation</a> at the Linux Security Summit 
North America entitled <a href="https://grsecurity.net/10_years_of_linux_security.pdf">"10 Years of Linux Security - A Report Card"</a>, we put out a 
<a href="https://twitter.com/spendergrsec/status/1283005179135221761">call</a> to other 
companies interested in funding a GCC front-end for Rust.

The motivation for this arose
from outreach from Nick Desaulniers of Google on <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAKwvOdmuYc8rW_H4aQG4DsJzho=F+djd68fp7mzmBp3-wY--Uw@mail.gmail.com/T/">LKML</a> 
to discuss the possibility of Rust support in the Linux kernel at the upcoming Linux 
Plumbers Conference.  One obvious hurdle mentioned immediately was that the kernel is most 
commonly compiled with GCC, while Rust currently requires rustc/LLVM.  According to reports of
the resulting discussion, kernel 
developers were open to the idea of allowing the kernel to be built with GCC and the Rust 
portions with LLVM, as long as the two were ABI compatible.</p>

<p>Such discussions appeared to sidestep a more fundamental issue however: the security 
viability of a mixed assembly/C/Rust execution environment and how cohesive security 
functionality could be provided while mixing different compilers with different 
implementations/availability of said functionality.  The importance of this topic, though apparent 
on reflection, was formalized just recently in a paper by Michalis Papaevripides and Elias 
Athanasopoulos of the University of Cyprus entitled <a href="https://www.cs.ucy.ac.cy/~eliasathan/papers/tops20.pdf">"Exploiting Mixed 
Binaries"</a>.  In it, they detail how the overall security of an execution 
environment can be reduced by the introduction of code written in Rust or that of another 
language where the same binary-level security is not provided by the compiler.  An excerpt from page 3 of the paper makes the impact clear:</p>

<blockquote>
"We experimentally show that CFI can be bypassed using Rust/Go code for developing clearly 
more straight-forward exploits than current state-of-the-art CFI bypasses [57, 70]. Our 
exploits do not rely on respecting the statically computed Control-flow Graph (CFG) for 
bypassing the enforced CFI and are much simpler to implement. [ ... ]
Again, we stress here that in the absence of the safe part (Rust/Go code), the unsafe part 
cannot be trivially exploited."
</blockquote>

<p>
The same exact scenario above was one of the motivations for Microsoft to recently push for their
<a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/08/17/control-flow-guard-for-clang-llvm-and-rust/">Control Flow Guard (CFG) support</a>
in Clang and Rust (see the heading of "Rust linked with C/C++").
</p>

<p>As the source of the GCC plugin infrastructure in the Linux kernel and nearly all of the GCC plugins adapted
for inclusion in the upstream Linux kernel, we too immediately spotted the importance of this problem and set out
to ensure both those plugins as well as the security features built-in to GCC itself are able to instrument code
from all languages supported by the Linux kernel with compatible and consistent security properties.</p>

<h2>Funding Process</h2>

<p>So despite not expecting Rust code to land in the Linux kernel in the near future, we reached out to other 
companies as mentioned above to pull together funding for the GCC front-end effort.  None of the leads 
came to fruition, so we as a company decided to bootstrap the process, in the hopes that as progress in the work
is observed, others would join in.  Further, we wanted to offer funding under the same terms we would want as developers, 
across the entire spectrum: stability, salary, benefits, ownership, etc -- not token compensation or bounties 
that treat those working on free/open source software for the public as somehow <em>less</em> than 
developers of proprietary code.  To that end, we decided to fund the first year of a full-time
developer for the work ourselves.</p>

<p>If the failed experiment of the Core Infrastructure Initiative (<a href="https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/">CII</a>) taught us anything, it's that
one finds dedicated and competent developers for some work not among whoever happens to apply, but 
among those already involved in the work as a passion project.  This led us to reach out 
to <a href="https://thephilbert.io/">Philip Herron</a>, who we noticed was <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs">already working</a> on a GCC front-end for Rust with involvement
of external contributors.  We were extremely pleased to hear Philip was interested in performing the work 
full-time.</p>

<p>News of our outreach eventually extended to the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/steering.html">GCC Steering 
Committee</a>, who contacted us to coordinate efforts.  They were very helpful in recommending to us <a href="https://www.embecosm.com/">Embecosm</a>, a UK-based company with deep experience and involvement in 
GCC/LLVM development, among many other areas.  Embecosm graciously offered to contribute to the effort by 
handling Philip's employment and, at no cost to us, providing project management services to help ensure the project's success.  
The location, expertise, and sharing of our vision of doing right by the developer couldn't have been a 
better match.</p>

<h2>Vendor-Neutral, Developed in the Open</h2>

<p>To make sure the project remains vendor-neutral and in the public interest, Open Source Security, Inc. will not own any of the copyright over the code developed through its funding.
All relevant GCC code for the project is GPLv3-licensed and copyright is assigned, as required for upstream GCC inclusion, to the Free Software Foundation (FSF).  The work is being performed in the open, with Philip providing public monthly status updates on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/Reporting">https://github.com/Rust-GCC/Reporting</a>.  Reports are already available for the months of November and December.
</p>

<h2>Get Involved</h2>

<p>For more information about the "how" of this effort, Embecosm has prepared a 
blog at <a href="https://www.embecosm.com/2021/01/12/gcc-rust-how-it-can-be-achieved/">https://www.embecosm.com/2021/01/12/gcc-rust-how-it-can-be-achieved/</a> that we encourage 
all those interested to read.  To get involved in contributing technical work to the 
effort, Philip can be found on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/the_philbert">@the_philbert</a> or committing to the project's Github repository at <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs">https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-w-id="9dfc6912-3fe0-bf1a-3d6f-bb95ffba0a17"><p>The <a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod">SOLID principles</a> are Object Oriented Programming (OOP) principles designed for writing Clean Code. According to Robert C. Martin’s “<a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">Clean Code</a>” book, in order to keep a good software development pace, it’s important for a team to write Clean Code. By implementing ugly code, you can surely come up with decent results quickly, but in the long run, your project will end up crashing into a wall.<br></p><p>It is known that a software dies when it’s no longer possible to understand it or add new features to it in a reasonable period of time. Keeping things clean is crucial to successfully convey any software project. This line of thought applies especially to machine learning projects that involve taking solutions from research or academic projects and implementing them into a production environment.<br></p><p>Research code is known to be dirty. Why? Because it’s often directed towards one goal only: making proofs of concept (POC) as quickly as possible. In this case, there’s not much incentive to keep one’s code clean. But if you plan on building a maintainable and scalable product, dirty code will not last long.</p><p>‍<br></p><p><strong>“SOLID”, you said? </strong><br></p><p>Here are the SOLID principles, in addition to the Tell Don't Ask (TDA) principle which is also relevant.<br></p><ul role="list"><li>S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).<br>	Every class has one responsibility only.</li><li>O: Open-Closed Principle (OCP). <br>	Classes are closed to modification and open to extension.</li><li>L: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP). <br>	Subtypes should be properly interchangeable with the base type.</li><li>I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP). <br>	Separate interfaces across your objects rather than implementing only a big one.</li><li>D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP). <br>	Depend on abstractions instead of concrete implementations.</li><li>Also: Tell Don’t Ask (TDA). <br> Don’t manage an object from the outside, rather tell it what to do.<br></li></ul><p>Let’s dive deeper into these concepts.</p><p><strong>S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</strong><br></p><p>This principle states that every class has one responsibility only. For instance, if you’re tempted to name a class SomethingAndSomethingElse, it’s a sign that the class should probably be split into two.<br></p><p>Separating classes to give them one responsibility each will ease things when time comes to change code. Not only it will be easier to implement changes, but the different parts will be more reusable and malleable. It‘s an easy and safe way to code successive prototypes. It also makes the test protocol smoother by allowing to test one thing at a time. So when an error pops up, you can easily pinpoint the problem.<br></p><p>In addition, when several developers work together on the same project, respecting the SRP reduces the chances of two developers stepping on each other’s toes (modifying the same object at the same time). Imagine that the SomethingAndSomethingElse class has the responsibility of doing two different tasks (the task Something and the task SomethingElse) and that these tasks need to be refactored. If two developers take care of one task each, they will find themselves modifying the same object at the same time, which will probably cause a conflict in the code when the time comes to merge the two solutions in the project. On the other hand, if SomethingAndSomethingElse is split into two classes in respect of SRP, the two developers can work on two different objects thus avoiding the conflict. Handling conflict in code is generally time consuming and very prone to bugs. This phenomenon should be avoided as much as possible.<br></p><p>Let’s apply SRP to a machine learning context. Suppose we have a class named MyNormalizerAndMyModel. This design pattern is most likely to be too rigid, too specific and not malleable. Here’s what could (and should) be done. First, a class named MyModel would be made. If you think it’s part of the job of MyModel to normalize data, a method named ‘’normalize’’ would be implemented inside of it. If not, another class named MyNormalizer (which would inherit from the same superclass as MyModel) should be implemented. This class would implement the method ‘’normalize’’. Another class named MyPredictor could then be implemented which would ingest data and one or more models to make predictions. MyPredictor would therefore represent what is called a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33091376/python-what-is-exactly-sklearn-pipeline-pipeline">Pipeline</a>. It could encapsulate objects of type MyNormalizer, MyModel, etc. Other models could be implemented and used in the pipeline by simply swapping MyModel with another class representing another model. This way, it is easy to reuse some objects in different contexts without having to duplicate code or modify an existing model (also see Open-Closed Principle - OCP).<br></p><p>Using a framework like <a href="https://github.com/Neuraxio/Neuraxle">Neuraxle</a> (which is open source) greatly facilitates the construction of pipelines.<br></p><p>This principle also applies to data loading. It’s better to give the responsibility of loading data to a class apart from our machine learning algorithm. You would want to pass already loaded and crunched data to a pipeline made of model instances, so that the source of the data and the way to load it (there can be a lot) would not matter for the pipeline. This is also closely related to the Dependency Inversion Principle - DIP.<br></p><p>Another example of properly respecting the SRP in Machine Learning pipelines is to let each step of a pipeline define its own way to initialize itself, to save itself, and to delete itself. This is especially important when implementing deep learning for instance. In that case, some of the pipeline steps might use GPUs as others might use CPUs (<a href="https://www.neuraxle.org/stable/scikit-learn_problems_solutions.html#problem-initializing-the-pipeline-and-deallocating-resources">Such resource management is handled by Neuraxle’s pipelines</a>). It’s therefore important for each step to be able to manage itself. Managing the specifics of each step of a pipeline from outside the pipeline would break not only the SRP but also the Tell Don’t Ask (TDA) principle.<br></p><div><p>Now, suppose that you’re trying to find the best hyperparameters for the different models of a pipeline (this process is called <a href="https://www.neuraxio.com/en/blog/automated-machine-learning-automl/2020/02/22/your-data-scientisti-is-a-mom-(seriously).html">Automated Machine Learning - AutoML</a>). In such a case, it is crucial for each object inside a pipeline to be able to manage its own loading, saving, initialization and deletion in order to effectively allocate and deallocate resources. It would be a nightmare to manage that process outside the model or worst, outside the pipeline. A major default of scikit-learn is its inability to manage this process. It’s also important to respect the SRP and OCP when serializing and saving machine learning pipelines containing code that can’t be saved natively by the python interpreter (e.g.: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41567895/will-scikit-learn-utilize-gpu">here</a> is how Neuraxle solves the issue of using GPU resources, making use of proper abstractions that respects SRP and OCP).</p></div><p><strong>O: Open-Closed Principle (OCP)</strong><br></p><p>This principle states that a class should be closed to modification, and open to extension. Which means that if a new functionality has to be added to a project, you shouldn’t have to go back to existing classes to edit stuff that is already working.<br></p><p>The most obvious example of not respecting this principle is to include long if/else statement chains (switch cases) in a single piece of code. Having too many if/else encapsulated in such a blob is called “poor man’s polymorphism”. Polymorphism is the ability for an object to inherit from others and take other forms in order to provide different functionalities. Rather than coding a lengthy if/else block at a particular point in a pipeline, it’s advised to implement an abstract class that is open to modifications (to polymorphism, in this case). All the different cases supposedly handled by an if/else block can then be incarnated by as many different sub-classes as needed, all inheriting from the previously built abstract class. Such a sub-class can then override certain methods of its parent abstract super-class as you see fit. By doing that, there’s no need to modify the abstract super-class or any of its sub-classes when implementing new functionalities. You would just implement a new sub-class inheriting from the same super-class, and inject it where you see fit (see the section about the DIP for more information about injection).<br></p><p>Let’s illustrate that principle with the example of loading data as a step of a machine learning pipeline. It’s certainly not a good idea to simply implement a function called “load_data” which would have a huge if/else block to cover all the possible cases like fetching data from a local repository, an external repository, an SQL table, a CSV file, an S3 bucket, etc. It would be better to implement an abstract class called DataLoader (or DataRepository). It would then be possible to implement as many concrete subclasses as needed to mimic the different ways of loading data. When the time comes to add a data loading step in a pipeline, the right sub-class (inheriting from DataLoader) suiting the context could be picked, so the pipeline doesn’t go through a useless chain of if/else statements to decide how to load data.<br></p><p>Here is another example to take this concept a step further. In compliance with OCP, it is possible to implement an effective strategy for choosing the right hyperparameters in a machine learning pipeline. Imagine that at a certain stage of a pipeline, you have to choose between the preprocessing method A and the preprocessing method B. The most tempting strategy (without considering OCP) would undoubtedly be to implement a full pipeline using method A and to implement another full pipeline using method B. We would then switch from one pipeline to another directly in the main file using a for loop. At first glance, this sounds like a good idea and it is the approach that most programmers and/or researchers in data science would recommend. The problem is that as new methods and models are to be implemented and tested, the main file must be modified to include a bigger and bigger polymorphism. This approach will therefore most likely generate a poor man's polymorphism directly in the main file. The main file is actually the worst place to implement this kind of polymorphism because it is outside the source project and its code is not …</p></div></div>

			<p>This is a tale of the intersection between thermal physics, cosmology, and a tiny
amount of computer science to answer a seemingly innocuous question: “How strong does
a password need to be for it to be physically impossible to brute-force, ever?”</p>
<p><a href="#conclusiontldr">TLDR</a> at the bottom.</p>
<p><em>Note: this post contains equations. Since none of the equations were long or
complex, I decided to just write them out in code blocks instead of using images or
MathML the way Wikipedia does.</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I realize that advice on password strength can get outdated. As supercomputers grow
more powerful, password strength recommendations need to be updated to resist
stronger brute-force attacks. Passwords that are strong today might be weak in the
future. <strong>How long should a password be in order for it to be physically impossible
to brute-force, ever?</strong></p>
<p>This question might not be especially practical, but it’s fun to analyze and offers
interesting perspective regarding sane upper-limits on password strength.</p>
<h2 id="asking-the-right-question">Asking the right question</h2>
<p>Instead of predicting what tomorrow’s computers may be able to do, let’s examine the
<em>biggest possible brute-force attack</em> that the laws of physics can allow.</p>
<p>A supercomputer is probably faster than your phone; however, given enough time, both
are capable of doing the same calculations. If time isn’t the bottleneck, energy
usage is. More efficient computers can flip more bits with a finite amount of energy.</p>
<p>In other words, energy efficiency and energy availability are the two fundamental
bottlenecks of computing. What happens when a computer with the highest theoretical
energy efficiency is limited only by the mass-energy of <em>the entire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe">observable
universe</a>?</em></p>
<p>Let’s call this absolute unit of an energy-efficient computer the MOAC (Mother of All
Computers). For all classical computers that are made of matter, do work to compute,
and are bound by the conservation of energy, the MOAC represents a finite yet
unreachable limit of computational power. And yes, it can play Solitaire with
<em>amazing</em> framerates.</p>
<p>How strong should your password be for it to be safe from a brute-force attack by the
MOAC?</p>
<h3 id="quantifying-password-strength">Quantifying password strength.</h3>
<p>A good measure of password strength is <strong>entropy bits.</strong> The entropy bits in a
password is a base-2 logarithm of the number of guesses required to brute-force
it.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>A brute-force attack that executes 2<sup>n</sup> guesses is certain to crack a
password with <em>n</em> entropy bits, and has a one-in-two chance of cracking a password
with <em>n</em>+1 entropy bits.</p>
<p>For scale, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES-256</a>
encryption is currently the industry standard for strong symmetric encryption. As the
name suggests, its keys have 256 bits of entropy; if your password has more than 256
entropy bits, then the AES-256 encryption algorithm is the bottleneck.</p>
<p>To calculate the entropy of a password, I recommend using a tool such as
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity16/technical-sessions/presentation/wheeler">zxcvbn</a>
or <a href="https://keepassxc.org/">KeePassXC</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>Define a function <code>P</code>. <code>P</code> determines the probability that MOAC will correctly guess
a password with <code>n</code> bits of entropy after using <code>e</code> energy:</p>
<pre><code>P(n, e)
</code></pre>
<p>If <code>P(n, e) ≥ 1</code>, the MOAC will certainly guess your password before running out of
energy. The lower <code>P(n, e)</code> is, the less likely it is for the MOAC to guess your
password.</p>
<h2 id="caveats-and-estimates">Caveats and estimates</h2>
<p>I don’t have a strong physics background.</p>
<p>When estimating, we’ll prefer higher estimates that increase the odds of it guessing
a password; after all, the point of this exercise is to establish an <em>upper</em> limit on
password strength. We’ll also simplify: for instance, the MOAC will not waste any
heat, and the only way it can guess a password is through brute-forcing. Focusing on
too many details would defeat the point of this thought experiment.</p>
<p>I won’t address any particular encryption algorithms; this is just a pure and simple
brute-force attack given precomputed password entropy. Furthermore, quantum computers
can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm">Grover’s algorithm</a> for
an exponential speed-up; to account for quantum computers using Grover’s algorithm,
calculate <code>P(n/2, e)</code> instead.</p>
<p>Obviously, I’m not taking into account future mathematical advances; my crystal ball
broke after I asked it if humanity would ever develop the technology to make anime
real.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s always a non-zero probability of a brute-force attack guessing a
password with a given entropy. Literal “immunity” is impossible. Lowering this
probability to statistical insignificance renders our password practically immune to
brute-force attacks.</p>
<h2 id="computation">Computation</h2>
<p>How much energy does MOAC use per guess during a brute-force attack? In the context
of this thought experiment, this number should be unrealistically low. I settled on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KT_(energy)"><code>kT</code></a>. <code>k</code> represents the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_constant">Boltzmann
Constant</a> (about
1.381×10<sup>-23</sup> J/K) and <code>T</code> represents the temperature of the system. Their
product corresponds to the amount of heat required to create a 1 nat increase in a
system’s entropy.</p>
<p>A more involved approach to picking a good value might utilize the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%E2%80%93Einstein_relation">Plank-Einstein
relation</a>.</p>
<p>It’s also probably a better idea to make this value an estimate for flipping a single
bit, and to estimate the average number of bit-flips it takes to make a single
password guess. If that bothers you, pick a number <code>b</code> you believe to be a good
estimate for a bit-flip-count and calculate <code>P(n-b, e)</code> instead of <code>P(n, e)</code>.</p>
<p>What’s the temperature of the system? Three pieces of information help us find out:</p>
<ol>
<li>The MOAC is located somewhere in the observable universe</li>
<li>The MOAC will be consuming the entire observable universe</li>
<li>The universe is mostly empty</li>
</ol>
<p>A good value for <code>T</code> would be the average temperature of the entire observable
universe. The universe is mostly empty; <code>T</code> is around the temperature of cosmic
background radiation in space. The lowest reasonable estimate for this temperature is
2.7 degrees Kelvin.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> A lower temperature means less energy usage, less energy
usage allows more computations, and more computations raises the upper limit on
password strength.</p>
<p>Every guess, the MOAC expends <code>kT</code> energy. Let <code>E</code> = the total amount of energy the
MOAC can use; let <code>B</code> = the maximum number of guesses the MOAC can execute before
running out of energy.</p>
<pre><code>B = E/(kT)
</code></pre>
<p>Now, given the maximum number of passwords the MOAC can guess <code>B</code> and the bits of
entropy in our password <code>n</code>, we have an equation for the probability that the MOAC
will guess our password:</p>
<pre><code>P(n,B) = B/2ⁿ
</code></pre>
<p>Plug in our expression for <code>B</code>:</p>
<pre><code>P(n,E) = E/(2ⁿkT)
</code></pre>
<h3 id="calculating-the-mass-energy-of-the-observable-universe">Calculating the mass-energy of the observable universe</h3>
<p>The MOAC can use the entire mass-energy of the observable universe.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Simply stuff
the observable universe into the attached 100% efficient furnace, turn on the burner,
and generate power for the computer. You might need to ask a friend for help.</p>
<p>Just how much energy is that? The mass-energy equivalence formula is quite simple:</p>
<pre><code>E = mc²
</code></pre>
<p>We’re trying to find <code>E</code> and we know <code>c</code>, the speed of light, is 299,792,458 m/s.
That leaves <code>m</code>. What’s the mass of the observable universe?</p>
<h3 id="calculating-the-critical-density-of-the-observable-universe">Calculating the critical density of the observable universe</h3>
<p>Critical density is smallest average density of matter required to <em>almost</em> slow the
expansion of the universe to a stop. Any more dense, and expansion will stop; any
less, and expansion will never stop.</p>
<p>Let <code>D</code> = critical density of the observable universe and <code>V</code> = volume of the
observable universe. Mass is the product of density and volume:</p>
<pre><code>m = DV
</code></pre>
<p>We can derive the value of D by solving for it in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann_equations">Friedman
equations</a>:</p>
<pre><code>D = 3Hₒ²/(8πG)
</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>G</code> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant">Gravitational
Constant</a> and <code>Hₒ</code> is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law">Hubble Constant</a>. <code>Hₒd</code> is the rate of
expansion at proper distance <code>d</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s assume the observable universe is a sphere, expanding at the speed of light
ever since the Big Bang.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> The volume <code>V</code> of our spherical universe when given its
radius <code>r</code> is:</p>
<pre><code>V = (4/3)πr³
</code></pre>
<p>To find the radius of the observable universe <code>r</code>, we can use the age of the universe
<code>t</code>:</p>
<pre><code>r = ct
</code></pre>
<p>Hubble’s Law estimates the age of the universe to be around <code>1/Hₒ</code></p>
<h3 id="solving-for-e">Solving for E</h3>
<p>Let’s plug in all the derived values into our original equation for the mass of the
observable universe <code>m</code>:</p>
<pre><code>m = DV
</code></pre>
<p>Remember when I opened the article by saying that none of the equations would be long
or complex?</p>
<p>I lied.</p>
<pre><code>m = (3Hₒ²/(8πG))(4/3)π(ct)³
m = c³/(2GHₒ)

E = mc²
E = c⁵/(2GHₒ)
</code></pre>
<p>Yay, we found an expression for the total energy the MOAC can consume!</p>
<h2 id="final-solution">Final Solution</h2>
<pre><code>P(n,E) = E/(2ⁿkT)
P(n, c⁵/(2GHₒ)) = c⁵/(2GHₒ*2ⁿkT)
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s copy and paste the values for those constants from Wikipedia and Wolfram Alpha:</p>
<ul>
<li>c = 299,792,458 m/s</li>
<li>G ≈ 6.67408×10<sup>-11</sup> m³/kg/s²</li>
<li>Hₒ ≈ 2.2×10<sup>-18</sup> Hz (uncertain; look up the Hubble tension)</li>
<li>T ≈ 2.7 K</li>
<li>k ≈ 1.3806503×10<sup>-23</sup> J/K</li>
</ul>
<p>Plugging those in and simplifying:</p>
<p><strong>P(n) ≈ 2.21×10<sup>92</sup> / 2<sup>n</sup></strong></p>
<p>Here are some sample outputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>P(256) ≈ 1.9×10<sup>15</sup> (password certainly cracked after burning 1.9
quadrillionth of the mass-energy of the observable universe).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>P(306.76) ≈ 1 (password certainly cracked after burning the mass-energy of the
observable universe)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>P(310) ≈ 0.11 (about one in ten)</p>

<p>If your threat model is a bit smaller, simulate putting a smaller object into the
MOAC’s furnace. For example, the Earth has a mass of 5.972×10²⁴ kg; this gives the
MOAC a one-in-ten-trillion chance of cracking a password with 256 entropy bits and a
100% chance of cracking a 213-bit password.</p>

<p>According to KeePassXC’s password generator, each of the following passwords has an
entropy between 330 and 340 bits.</p>
<p>Using the extended-ASCII character set:</p>
<pre><code>¦=¦FVõ)Çb^ÄwÎ¡=,°m°B9®;&gt;3[°r:t®Ú"$3CG¨/Bq-y\;
</code></pre>
<p>Using the characters on a standard US QWERTY layout:</p>
<pre><code>%nUzL2XR&amp;Tz5hJfp2tiYBoBBX^vWo3`g6H#JSC#N6gWm#hVdD~ziD$YHW
</code></pre>
<p>Using only alphanumeric characters:</p>

<p>An excerpt from a religious text with a trailing space:</p>
<pre><code>I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, 
</code></pre>
<p>Don’t use actual excerpts from pre-existing works as your password.</p>
<h2 id="conclusiontldr">Conclusion/TLDR</h2>
<p>Question: How much entropy should a password have to ensure it will <em>never</em> be
vulnerable to a brute-force attack? Can an impossibly efficient computer–the
MOAC–crack your password?</p></section></article></div>
