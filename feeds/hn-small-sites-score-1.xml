<p>Base plotting is as old as R itself yet for most users it remains mysterious.
They might be using <code>plot()</code> or even know the full list of its parameters but most never understand it fully.
This article attempts to demystify base graphics by providing a friendly introduction for the uninitiated.</p>

<h2 id="deconstructingaplot">Deconstructing a plot</h2>

<p>Quickly after learning R users start producing various figures by calling <code>plot()</code>, <code>hist()</code>, or <code>barplot()</code>.
Then, when faced with a complicated figure, they start stacking those plots on top of one another using various hacks, like <code>add=TRUE</code>, <code>ann=FALSE</code>, <code>cex=0</code>.
For most this marks the end of their base plotting journey and they leave with an impression of it being an ad-hoc bag of tricks that has to be learned and remembered but that otherwise is hard, inconsistent, and unintuitive.
Nowadays even experts who write about base graphics<a href="#cn:1" id="cnref:1" title="see citation"><sup>(1)</sup></a> or compare it with other systems<a href="#cn:2" id="cnref:2" title="see citation"><sup>(2)</sup></a> share the same opinion.
However, those initial functions everyone was using are only wrappers on top of the smaller functions that do all the work.
And many would be surprised to learn that under the hood base plotting follows the paradigm of having a set of small functions that each do one thing and work well with one another.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the simplest example.</p>

<pre><code>plot(0:10, 0:10, xlab = "x-axis", ylab = "y-axis", main = "my plot")
</code></pre>

<figure>
<img src="http://karolis.koncevicius.lt/posts/r_base_plotting_without_wrappers/figure/plot.svg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>The <code>plot()</code> function above is really just a wrapper that calls an array of lower level functions.</p>

<pre><code>plot.new()
plot.window(xlim = c(0,10), ylim = c(0,10))
points(0:10, 0:10)
axis(1)
axis(2)
box()
title(xlab = "x-axis")
title(ylab = "y-axis")
title(main = "my plot")
</code></pre>

<p>Written like this all the elements comprising the plot become clear.
Every new function call draws a single object on top of the plot produced up until that point.
It becomes easy to see which line should be modified in order to change something on the plot.
Just as an example let’s modify the above plot by: 1) adding a grid, 2) removing the box around the plot, 3) removing the axis lines, 4) making axis labels bold, 5) turning the annotation labels red, and 6) shifting the title to the left.</p>

<pre><code>plot.new()
plot.window(xlim = c(0,10), ylim = c(0,10))
grid()
points(0:10, 0:10)
axis(1, lwd = 0, font.axis=2)
axis(2, lwd = 0, font.axis=2)
title(xlab = "x-axis", col.lab = "red3")
title(ylab = "y-axis", col.lab = "red3")
title(main = "my plot", col.main = "red3", adj = 0)
</code></pre>

<figure>
<img src="http://karolis.koncevicius.lt/posts/r_base_plotting_without_wrappers/figure/plot2.svg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>In each case to achieve the wanted effect only a single line had to be modified.
And the function names are very intuitive.
A person without any R experience would have no trouble saying which element on the plot is added by which line or changing some of the parameters.</p>

<p>So, in order to construct a plot various functions are called one by one.
But where do we get all the names for those functions?
Do we need to remember hundreds of them?
Turns out the set of all the things you might need to do on a plot is pretty limited.</p>

<pre><code>par()          # specifies various plot parameters
plot.new()     # starts a new plot
plot.window()  # adds a coordinate system to the plot region

points()       # draws points
lines()        # draws lines connecting 2 points
abline()       # draws infinite lines throughout the plot
arrows()       # draws arrows
segments()     # draws segmented lines
rect()         # draws rectangles
polygon()      # draws complex polygons

text()         # adds written text within the plot
mtext()        # adds text in the margins of a plot

title()        # adds plot and axis annotations
axis()         # adds axes
box()          # draws a box around a plot
grid()         # adds a grid over a coordinate system
legend()       # adds a legend
</code></pre>

<p>The above list covers majority of the functionality needed to recreate almost any plot.
And for demonstration <code>example()</code> can be used to quickly see what each of those functions do, i.e. <code>example(rect)</code>.
R also has some other helpful functions like <code>rug()</code> and <code>jitter()</code> to make certain situations easier but they are not crucial and can be implemented using the ones listed above.</p>

<p>Function names are quite straightforward but what about their arguments?
Indeed some of argument names, like <code>cex</code> can seem quite cryptic.
But the argument name is always an abbreviation for a property of the plot<a href="#cn:3" id="cnref:3" title="see citation"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.
For example <code>col</code> is a shorthand for “color”, <code>lwd</code> stands for “line-width”, and <code>cex</code> means “character expansion”.
Good news is that in general the same arguments stand for the same properties across all of base R functions.
And for a specific function <code>help()</code> can always be used in order to get the list of all arguments and their descriptions.</p>

<p>To further illustrate the consistency between arguments let’s return to the first example.
By now it should be pretty clear, with one exception - the <code>axis(1)</code> and <code>axis(2)</code> lines.
Where do those numbers: <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> came from?
The numbers specify the positions around the plot and they start from <code>1</code> which refers to the bottom of the plot and go clockwise up to <code>4</code> which refers to the right side.
The picture below demonstrates the relationship between numbers and four sides of the plot.</p>

<pre><code>plot.new()
box()
mtext("1", side = 1, col = "red3")
mtext("2", side = 2, col = "red3")
mtext("3", side = 3, col = "red3")
mtext("4", side = 4, col = "red3")
</code></pre>

<figure>
<img src="http://karolis.koncevicius.lt/posts/r_base_plotting_without_wrappers/figure/positions.svg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>The same position numbers are used throughout the various different functions.
Whenever a parameter of some function needs to specify a side, chances are it will do so using the numeric notation described above.
Below are a few examples.</p>

<pre><code>par(mar = c(0,0,4,4))        # margins of a plot: c(bottom, left, right , top)
par(oma = c(1,1,1,1))        # outer margins of a plot
axis(3)                      # side where axis will be displayed
text(x, y, "text", pos = 3)  # pos selects the side the "text" is displayed at
mtext("text", side = 4)      # side specifies the margin "text" will appear in
</code></pre>

<p>Another important point is vectorization.
Almost all the arguments for base plotting functions are vectorized.
For example, when plotting rectangles the user does not have to add each point of each rectangle one by one within a loop.
Instead he or she can draw all the related objects with one function call while at the same time specifying different positions and parameters for each.</p>

<pre><code>plot.new()
plot.window(xlim = c(0,3), ylim = c(0,3))

rect(xleft = c(0,1,2), ybottom = c(0,1,2), xright = c(1,2,3), ytop = c(1,2,3),
     border = c("pink","red","darkred"), lwd = 10
     )
</code></pre>

<figure>
<img src="http://karolis.koncevicius.lt/posts/r_base_plotting_without_wrappers/figure/rect.svg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>Here is another example producing a check board pattern.</p>

<pre><code>plot.new()
plot.window(xlim = c(0,10), ylim = c(0,10))

xs &lt;- rep(1:9, each = 9)
ys &lt;- rep(1:9)

rect(xs-0.5, ys-0.5, xs+0.5, ys+0.5, col = c("white","darkgrey"))
</code></pre>

<figure>
<img src="http://karolis.koncevicius.lt/posts/r_base_plotting_without_wrappers/figure/checkboard.svg" alt="">
</figure>

<h2 id="constructingaplot">Constructing a plot</h2>

<p>One of base R graphics strengths is it’s flexibility and potential for customization.
It really shines when the user needs to follow a particular style found in an existing example or a template<a href="#cn:4" id="cnref:4" title="see citation"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.
Below are a few illustrations demonstrating how different base functions can work together and reconstruct various types of common figures from scratch.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Annotated barplot of USA population growth over time.</p>

<pre><code>x &lt;- time(uspop)
y &lt;- uspop

plot.new()
plot.window(xlim = range(x), ylim = range(pretty(y)))

rect(x-4, 0, x+4, y)
text(x, y, y, pos = 3, col = "red3", cex = 0.7)

mtext(x, 1, at = x, las = 2, cex = 0.7, font = 2)
axis(2, lwd = 0, las = 2, cex.axis = 0.7, font.axis = 2)
title("US population growth", adj = 0, col.main = "red2")
</code></pre>

<figure>
<img src="http://karolis.koncevicius.lt/posts/r_base_plotting_without_wrappers/figure/barplot.svg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>In this case for each rectangle four sets of points had to be specified: x and y for the left bottom corner plus x and y for the top right corner.
In the end, even so this is a more complicated example, we still added all the different pieces of information using single function calls to <code>rect()</code>, <code>text()</code>, and <code>mtext()</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Parallel coordinates plot using the “iris” dataset.</p>

<pre><code>palette(c("cornflowerblue", "red3", "orange"))

plot.new()
plot.window(xlim = c(1,4), ylim = range(iris[,-5]))
grid(nx = NA, ny = NULL)
abline(v = 1:4, col = "grey", lwd = 5, lty = "dotted")

matlines(t(iris[,-5]), col = iris$Species, lty = 1)

axis(2, lwd = 0, las = 2)
mtext(variable.names(iris)[-5], 3, at = 1:4, line = 1, col = "darkgrey")

legend(x = 1, y = 2, legend = unique(iris$Species), col = unique(iris$Species),
       lwd = 3, bty = 'n')
</code></pre>

<figure>
<img src="http://karolis.koncevicius.lt/posts/r_base_plotting_without_wrappers/figure/parallel.svg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>In this example we used a special function <code>matlines()</code> that draws one line for each column in a matrix.
We also did a few other things that were novel so far: changed the default numeric colors via <code>palette()</code>, and used factor levels for specifying the actual colors within <code>matlines()</code> and <code>legend()</code>.
Changing palette allows us to customize the color scheme while passing factors for the color arguments guarantees that the same colors are consistently assigned to the same factor levels across all the different functions.</p></li>
<li><p>Dot plot of death rates in Virginia in 1940.</p>

<pre><code>colors &lt;- hcl.colors(5, "Zissou")
ys     &lt;- c(1.25, 2, 1.5, 2.25)

plot.new()
plot.window(xlim = range(0,VADeaths), ylim = c(1,2.75))

abline(h = ys, col = "grey", lty = "dotted", lwd = 3)
points(VADeaths, ys[col(VADeaths)], col = colors, pch = 19, cex = 2.5)
text(0, ys, colnames(VADeaths), adj = c(0.25,-1), col = "lightslategrey")

axis(1, lwd = 0, font = 2)
title("deaths per 1000 in 1940 Virginia stratified by age, gender, and location")

legend("top", legend = rownames(VADeaths), col = colors, pch = 19, horiz = TRUE,
       bty = "n", title = "age bins")
</code></pre>

<figure>
<img src="http://karolis.koncevicius.lt/posts/r_base_plotting_without_wrappers/figure/dotplot.svg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>In this graph the groups were stratified by gender, age, and location
For each group the y-axis hights were chosen manually and <code>col()</code> function was used to repeat those heights for all numbers within the matrix.</p></li>
<li><p>Dual coordinate plot using the “mtcars” dataset.</p>

<pre><code>par(mar = c(4,4,4,4))
plot.new()
box()

plot.window(xlim = range(mtcars$disp), ylim = range(pretty(mtcars$mpg)))
points(mtcars$disp, mtcars$mpg, col = "darkorange2", pch = 19, cex = 1.5)

plot.window(xlim = range(mtcars$disp), ylim = range(pretty(mtcars$hp)))
points(mtcars$disp, mtcars$hp, col = "forestgreen", pch = 19, cex = 1.5)

axis(1)
axis(2, …</code></pre></li></ul></div>

Your podcast roadmap is the first thing you will do before recording your podcast.&nbsp;</p><p>Who, why, where, and when are some questions that MUST be asked as the idea of starting a podcasting strikes your mind. <br></p><h3>Who is your podcast audience?</h3><p>In our opinion, the number one reason why podcast fail is because the creators don't think enough about whom they plan to add value too. Without this step... a watered down, useless podcast is produced and the creators give up after three months as they don't up generating the audience they thought they would.<br></p><p>If you don’t know who you are going to address, it is almost like trying to find Planet Earth in the Milky Way galaxy...<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f60836640ce25f514e1c4da/5fbd3f47921868483fddd15e_Y5KIrS6TN5P4qjIcOYNclGE3emYsPzGUGj278uDDE169-G973GyhRWPE-GIN_TvWWTIYp6Qxrb0K5k73p_ULFQn73DecQ3rSVAwPrwcgf0JgCB-dL4VIrn5TKR489NOrNcw61NQ.gif" alt=""></p></figure><p>For instance, a podcast about horror movies would be valued by the people who have this same passion. A podcast about <a target="_blank" href="https://podcasts.bcast.fm/confessions-of-a-b2b-marketer">B2B marketing</a> will add value to B2B marketers looking to up their game.</p><p><em>What do you know about and who can you add value too?</em><br></p><p>This is the question that you MUST ask.<br></p><p>Be sure to look at possible podcast competitors… if there are already many podcasts in your niche this suggests that there is demand for a show like yours… but it may be hard to get subscribers.<br></p><p>If there are no podcasts in your chosen subject area then there may be low demand, but low competition means it should be easier to generate an audience! <br></p><h3>What should my podcast be about?</h3><p>This is closely linked to the last section...<br></p><p>One basic premise of content marketing is to feed potential customers with the information they need BEFORE they need to buy your product or service. If you are the person or business providing this information you move your customers towards buying AND allow them to build trust in you.<br></p><p>This will mean that when they come to buy... they buy from you.<br></p><p>Now of course, you need to be able to add value on this topic or have a network of people that can add value on this topic.<br></p><p>This is the sweet spot: the ability to add value with the information and the ability to monetise the information.<br></p><h3>What should I call my podcast?</h3><p>A podcast about fitness training with the name "The Sarah Clay Show" will leave you in despair, as many people will not click as they care about fitness training, not you Sarah ;)<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f60836640ce25f514e1c4da/5fbd3f48f7fb0b0b7ccec927_C3B45_7_X_KgW7acbxX6ENXn_Eq80fDN351YmmAc4_MXfSPaihp8h8zm-wqTBFXPRGOSNtRVWbE2ytrsW2EyS2NpQQ_v3qamJwp9WQVoQ0_0gVQSLaDpBQ6Il6fNz5FVf798nkY.gif" alt=""></p></figure><p>Naming your podcast in this way is helpful when you already have a fanbase or audience through other mediums. <br></p><p>Instead, your podcast name will be both "descriptive and memorable".<br></p><p>Your target audience will reach you if your podcast name is organic and contains words related to your podcast subject. Your podcast should appear in search results for queries around your niche.<br></p><p>And when we say memorable, it means a person who looked for ‘fitness training podcast’ and clicked on your podcast, will only come back to listen to the same podcast if your podcast name is memorable.<br></p><p>So, the recipe for podcast name is: "descriptive and memorable".<br></p><p>As an example...<br></p><p>We run a podcast for a client called <a href="https://www.fame.so/case-study/leading-mobile-growth-with-storemaven" target="_blank">Mobile Growth &amp; Pancakes:</a><br></p><ul role="list"><li>Descriptive - Mobile Growth!</li><li>Memorable - Pancakes!<br></li></ul><h3>How long should each episode be?</h3><p>How long is a piece of string? ;)</p><p>When deciding how long a podcast episode should be... many top podcast producers refer to a person's average commute: 20 to 30 minutes. But in reality, your podcast episode length depends only on your audience, and your subject.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If your content is easily summarised in a short podcast of 15 minutes, that is the best episode length for you.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If your content needs over an hour of time to be presented, then it is the ideal length.&nbsp;</p><p>The second factor is your audience. One audience may absorb small chunks of 5 to 10 minutes whilst another audience may be happy to listen to a 2-hour-long interview.&nbsp;<br></p><p>While deciding how long your podcast episode should be... the answer really leads to another question: how long can you add value for?</p><p>That is the length of your episodes and not a second longer.<br></p><h3>Show Format</h3><p>Your show format might be the personal choice of the podcast producer, or it might be based on the requirements of a target audience. A podcast format sets a standard for what your audience should expect from your show.&nbsp;</p><p>There are really just a few show formats:</p><ul role="list"><li>Interview based - each episode features a guest</li><li>Monologue based - just you talking!</li><li>Short tips - small, actionable tips</li><li>Story based - telling a story within an episode or a season</li></ul><p>You need to choose the format that best suits you as a podcast host and your audience.</p><p>This is also a good opportunity for differentiation... if all the shows in your niche are interview based, you could gain traction fast with a more actionable tips based podcast.</p><h2>Step 2 - Pre-Production</h2><p>After answering the basic questions of the podcasting roadmap, now it’s time to set up your podcasting playground. Equipment, environment, and guests... We cannot cover how to produce a podcast without talking about pre-production.&nbsp;</p><h3>Essential Equipment</h3><p>The sound quality of your podcast highly depends on your choice of equipment. As a start, a USB mic, a laptop, and an internet connection are good to take off. But, over time you will need to progress to more complex equipment to achieve greater quality audio.<br></p><p>Before you make an investment in recording equipment, it is good to take a test drive with basic equipment. Once you are confident that your content is engaging the audience and you are enjoying this experience, then you should improvise to upgrade your podcast setup with more professional equipment.&nbsp;<br></p><p>This is what you will need to start with:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>A laptop</li><li>A microphone for voice recording</li><li>Audio Interface- It allows you to playback your voice recordings by cancelling all the background noise&nbsp;</li><li>A pair of headphones</li></ul><p>And more advanced equipment:</p><ul role="list"><li>A pop filter to eliminate the air blast when you say words with the sound of “t”, “p”, “b”</li><li>A mixer- more of post-production equipment, but it helps you to control music and sound levels&nbsp;</li><li>Mic stand- secondary, but it gives you more flexibility and eases to record your podcast&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Recording Environment&nbsp;</h3><p>While you are recording your podcast sitting at your local café, no matter how good your content is... the surrounding noise and chatter will destroy the audio experience of your listeners. Similarly, recording your podcast with a table and chair in an empty room of 330 sq. feet will do nothing except generate an unpleasant echo.&nbsp;<br></p><p>A nice balance is important when your surrounding environment is concerned. A moderately furnished room with a quiet environment will enhance your podcast’s quality. We don’t mean that you need a soundproof room, but a calm space with minimal background noises.</p><h3>Scheduling Guests&nbsp;</h3><p>One important to-do in setting up the stage is scheduling your guests if your podcast format requires so. Unplanned and clueless podcasting might be more hectic as well as you might end up with a clumsy and unorganised podcast where you don’t know what you have to talk about to your guest.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In your podcast preparations, you should schedule your guests so that you have enough time to research about them, their work, or particular topics you would be discussing.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For booking your guests, you can go with communicating with them over email and get the time when they are easily available. We typically recommend booking guests in using scheduling software such as Calendly...</p><p>‍<br></p><h2>Step 3 - Production</h2><p>The playing field for your podcast is set up...When you are recording your podcasts, you must be equipped with all the necessary ammunition. Now, it is time to get to the crux of the question of<strong> how to produce a podcast</strong>. </p><p>Here are a few things you should really take note of before you place yourself in the hot seat that is being a podcast host.&nbsp;</p><h3>Scripting Every Episode</h3><p>Scripting your whole podcast episode and sticking to it rigidly will fade the natural touch of your podcast. It may sound like a puppet show.&nbsp;<br></p><p>But, a completely unprepared podcast could also turn out to be a complete shambles.<br></p><p><em>Then... how to produce a podcast that has a good balance of natural touch and organisation?</em></p><p>You should make an outline of important topics or things you have planned to discuss in an episode. This tip is extremely important when you are doing a solo podcast. Because there is a lot more chance of getting lost and go off-road in this case.<br></p><p>However, if you have a podcast format where guests are invited, key points or questions you are going to ask your guests in a written form can help you to stay on track. But, have a flexible approach because your guest might go around to share an interesting experience. Make sure to go along with your guest instead of being too stiff and sticking to the outline.&nbsp;</p><h3>Share Questions with Guests</h3><p>You should send notes or an outline to your scheduled guest for every episode. It will help your guest to know what to expect, get prepared to answer the questions. Instead of sending scripted questions, we like to send rough discussion points...</p><p>This will help the guest prepare but not script answers... this is crucially important to cultivating …</p></div></div></div>

<p>Career moves like starting a new role are challenging, can often be unnerving, and for sure requires leveling up. <img title=":computer:" alt=":computer:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4bb.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>A few months back, I accepted an offer with another business group at Intel. To me, it was a great way of exploring new opportunities within the company and experiencing another flavor of its engineering culture. This new role was a scale-up from my previous one, a lot of new areas for me to contribute, learn, and explore.</p>

<p>What helped me tackle this was defining how I onboarded in the new role. In this article, I am sharing the framework and ideas from my onboarding learnings.</p>

<h2 id="onboarding-done-right">Onboarding done right</h2>

<p>A well-defined onboarding is crucial to provide team members with the resources they need to succeed and ensure their expectations match the reality of the organization. It also clears any confusion about the role. Not having the right onboarding experience can often lead to not clearly understanding the new work environment leading to one as the wrong fit for the team.</p>

<p>Usually, onboarding has two distinct &amp; complementary components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>General Onboarding</strong>: Getting familiar with the company culture, vision, mission, value, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Role-specific Onboarding</strong>: Acquire the knowledge, skills, and behaviors to master the role effectively and efficiently.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Joining a new team brings in a plethora of information and emotions and can be quite stressful. If you are reading this as someone who needs to onboard a team member, I highly encourage taking some time to think through the prep work covering basics for onboarding. At the end of the article, I have listed some useful resources for the same.</p>

<p>The focus of this article is someone (particularly a software engineer) who will be onboarding a new role.</p>

<h2 id="the-onboarding-template-page_with_curl">The onboarding template <img title=":page_with_curl:" alt=":page_with_curl:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4c3.png" height="20" width="20">
</h2>

<h4 id="1-set-expectations-with-yourself">1. Set expectations with yourself</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>No one can hit their target with their eyes closed.” ― Paulo Coelho <img title=":sparkles:" alt=":sparkles:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2728.png" height="20" width="20"></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The most important thing is setting expectations for your new role. Sure, you have done quite some assessment before accepting the offer. However, this step talks about goal setting before your first day.</p>

<h3 id="2-set-clear-expectations-with-your-manager">2. Set clear expectations with your manager</h3>

<p>Well, you have cracked the role owing to your strengths and the value you potentially bring to the team. Hence, it is vital to discuss the expectations of onboarding with your manager. A few questions to ask:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What do you suggest I focus on for my first week and month in this team?</li>
  <li>How can I learn more about the project(s)?</li>
  <li>Is there a team ‘how-to’ document I can refer to?</li>
  <li>Who is my dedicated buddy for onboarding?</li>
  <li>What accesses a new member needs to request?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-create-a-plan">3. Create a plan</h3>

<p>Now that you have a fair idea of the expectations, chart out an onboarding plan. It helps to list out activities to not be overwhelmed and create a to-do list to cover all essential tasks.</p>

<h3 id="4-meet-with-as-many-team-members-as-to-familiarize">4. Meet with as many team members as to familiarize</h3>

<p>In the pre-covid world, face to face introductions were much easier. It’s not quite the same in a remote environment.
Make it a point to proactively reach out to as many team members/ stakeholders and set introductory 1:1s to learn about them, get a preliminary idea of the project, learn more about their preferred working times/ style, etc. This is an opportunity to get started on the technical details about the systems, projects, etc., and also provides a window into other team members’ interests.</p>

<h3 id="5-work-with-your-buddy-on-the-team">5. Work with your buddy on the team</h3>

<p>“There is no such thing as a stupid question!”</p>

<p>It can be a bit daunting to ping someone with a question that feels stupid to ask even if it is not. A dedicated buddy on the new team makes it easier to figure out the correct point of contact for your questions. A buddy can help understand communication dynamics within and across the teams, help understand the company/ team abbreviations &amp; acronyms, guide you on your tasks, etc.</p>

<h3 id="6-ask-questions-a-lot-of-them">6. Ask questions.. A lot of them</h3>

<p>Your imposter syndrome sure will not kick in until the first week or two. Maybe it won’t kick in at all. But if you are venturing out for something new, more often it does. A great tip for dealing with this is to be fearless and ask questions (<em>again..there are no stupid questions..</em>). The more you can familiarize yourself with the new team, the project, and the business, the better. It may not all make sense to you all at once but keep notes. Eventually, it will all come together.</p>

<p>It also helps to schedule regular 1:1s with members of your team and driving the agenda on things you wish to understand in the project.
Another great way to learn fast is to shadow experienced team members on tasks, understand their thought process, watch them debug issues, understand their communication style.</p>

<h3 id="7-read-the-documentation-and-code">7. Read the documentation and code</h3>

<p>The best way to learn is to read the documentation and code. The information you have heard from your teammates will now start making more sense. Additionally, this will help you recognize potential improvements in the documentation/ codebase for future contributions.</p>

<h3 id="8-contribute">8. Contribute</h3>

<p>The best way to learn is to do. Nothing beats the feeling of your first commit in the new project- be it a bug fix, a small feature enhancement, documentation improvements, etc. Channel your doer mindset and look for ways to make things better.</p>

<h3 id="9-seek-feedback">9. Seek feedback</h3>

<p>In a loop of continuous improvement, nothing triumphs feedback. Seek constructive feedback from your manager, your teammates on what you did better and what are your blind spots. Where can you improve as well as discuss what challenges you are facing and how can you address them?</p>

<p>Good feedback is a two-way conversation. Not only should you receive feedback but also provide it. Be open to sharing what you learned through the onboarding process, what can potentially improve for the future, how did your team members help you feel comfortable with the process, etc.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Owning your onboarding can contribute to your success in the role and can bring joy. <img title=":smile:" alt=":smile:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f604.png" height="20" width="20"> <img title=":chart_with_upwards_trend:" alt=":chart_with_upwards_trend:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4c8.png" height="20" width="20"> I hope these tips and ideas can help new engineers navigate the onboarding successfully.</p>

<p><strong>M</strong>astic gum is resin&nbsp;from&nbsp;the Mastic tree found on the Greek island Chios. It's been labelled as a superfood because of its numerous health&nbsp;properties- which we'll talk about in just a bit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;But in the last 5 years its popularity has skyrocketed for&nbsp;a reason no Greek farmer could have ever expected.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><em>It can sharpen your jawline</em></strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;People are catching on to an old BodyBuilder method for building muscle in the jawline- chewing mastic gum! Because it's 10x harder than regular gum it's basically like taking your jaw to the gym.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Apparently this is relatively well-known in Hollywood and the BodyBuilding space. Now it's&nbsp;making its way into the mainstream. More on that later. First you've got to understand where it comes from to know why it's so special:</p>

<meta charset="utf-8">

<p><em>Mastic gum from the Greek island Chios</em></p>


<meta charset="utf-8">

<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><strong>T</strong>he people of Chios have&nbsp;cultivated and harvested mastic or "Mastiha" for over 2500 years. The hot and humid climate is ideal for the 6-month, laborious process.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0340/7226/4840/files/mastic-gum-from-chios_0706dfc7-3e37-472b-9669-5ec2e9f92bad_480x480.jpg?v=1607283273" alt="Farmers harvesting chios resin"></p>
<p><em>Farmers harvesting Mastic on the Greek island Chios</em></p>

<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Every 4-5 days, several&nbsp;cuts are made in the trees to slowly drain the resin. It takes roughly 15-20 days for the crystal to solidify and fall off. Because of the way it falls from the tree and it's shape, these small pieces of resin are called "Tears of Chios". The farmers then collect these small teardrops and wash them in natural spring water.</p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<h3><strong>It&nbsp;has a refreshing pine/cedar flavour.</strong></h3>



<p><strong>M</strong>astic's earliest identified uses was as chewing gum- the additional benefits were yet to be discovered.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mastic producing villages&nbsp;were fortresses,&nbsp;bordered by huge walls. The only way to enter these villages was by ladder, designed to shield the resin from invaders.</p>
<p>I'm not exaggerating when I say: <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chios_massacre"><strong>wars were fought over mastic gum</strong></a>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;During the Ottoman rule of Chios in the 1800s, mastic was <strong>worth its weight in Gold.&nbsp;</strong>In todays gold prices that means 1 piece would cost $59.14</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Luckily for us, it doesn't cost that much. But with its growing popularity, maybe someday it might. Let's talk about <em>why </em>it's selling out around the world:</p>



<p><strong>T</strong>he ancient Mediterraneans loved mastic and thought it had "magic" healing properties. Thanks to modern science we know today how that "magic" works. Here's the 7 main health benefits we use it for today:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a href="#dental">Aids Dental Health</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#inflammation">Anti-Inflammatory</a></strong></li>
<li>
<strong><a href="#cholesterol">Lowers Cholesterol &amp;</a></strong><strong>&nbsp;Blood Sugar</strong>
</li>
<li><strong><a href="#biotic">Anti-Biotic&nbsp;/ Anti-Fungal</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#digestion">Soothes Digestion &amp; Heartburn</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#cancer">Cancer Preventative</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#asthma">Asthma Treatment</a></strong></li>
</ol>

<h3><b>Here's The "Magical" Ingredients (Skip If Boring)</b></h3>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span>Mastic gum is composed of several bioactive compounds responsible for its numerous health benefits. These include <em>triterpenic acids</em> (TAs) such as <em>isomasticadienolic acid</em> as well as triterpenes. These are natural antibiotics that also act as strong anti-inflammatories.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mastiha naturally&nbsp;contains large percentages of organic compounds like Terpenoids, which add to its aromatic element. The main active Terpenoids include&nbsp;<em>alpha-pinene</em> (40%), <em>beta-myrcene</em>, <em>beta-pinene</em>, <em>limonene</em>, and <em>beta-caryophyllene</em>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Alpha-pinene</em> is also found in pines and rosemary. It's what gives Mastic a fresh pine/cedar flavor.&nbsp;As well as providing a strong woody aroma, it's also a potent topical antiseptic. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;Unlike regular chewing gums, which are</span><span>&nbsp;filled with artificial coloring and flavors, <strong>mastic gum&nbsp;is 100% natural.</strong></span></p>


<h2 id="dental"><span>1. Aids Dental Health (Prevent Cavities)</span></h2>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><strong>T</strong>here are&nbsp;multiple studies about Mastic gum and its positive effect on dental health.&nbsp;A <span><a href="https://meridian.allenpress.com/angle-orthodontist/article/77/1/124/58081/Short-term-Effect-of-Mastic-Gum-on-Salivary">2007 study</a>&nbsp;</span>found that chewing&nbsp;mastic gum may potentially help prevent teeth cavities by&nbsp;reducing bacteria in the mouth and the pH of saliva.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0340/7226/4840/files/Tooth-decay-diagram_b8ee88bd-931a-4d5d-b51e-ad0d796e9211_480x480.jpg?v=1607283312" alt="Diagram of tooth decay"></p>
<p><em>Mastic gum has been shown to reduce the build-up of plaque</em></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;After chewing mastic gum for 15 minutes, participants in the study were found to have lower levels of&nbsp;</span><em>lactobacilli</em> and <em>S Mutans</em> in the oral cavity. The rate of bacteria levels even remained low even 2.25 hours later. This same effect was further supported by&nbsp;a&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4281189/">2014 study</a></span>.</p>
<p>What this means for you is:</p>
<h3><strong>Mastic Gum Prevents Cavities And Bad Breath</strong></h3>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;There's no need to worry about chewing a random resin that came from a tree in Greece- it's recommended by dentists!</p>
<p>Just chew it&nbsp;like a regular piece of gum and chuck it when you're done.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>WEIRD FACT:&nbsp;</strong>you can swallow mastic gum! It can be broken down by your stomach like any other food because it's 100% natural.</em>&nbsp;</p>


<meta charset="utf-8">
<h2 id="inflammation"><strong>2. Anti-Inflammatory (Heal Faster)</strong></h2>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span><strong>M</strong>astic's anti-inflammatory properties may help with autoimmune illness&nbsp;and chronic inflammation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;It decreases the levels of various inflammatory substances and blocks inflammatory pathways. It also aids the activation of neutrophils which is a type of white blood cell.</span></p>

<meta charset="utf-8"><br>
<h2 id="cholesterol">
<span>3.&nbsp;Lower Cholesterol &amp; Blood Sugar&nbsp;</span>(Healthier Heart)</h2>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span><strong>O</strong>ur modern lazy-lifestyles and unnatural diet have made high cholesterol and high blood sugar levels commonplace. These two things increase the risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Some studies suggest that chewing mastic gum could help&nbsp;restore these levels.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;A <span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2047487315603186">2015 study</a></span>&nbsp;conducted&nbsp;<span>with</span>&nbsp;156 healthy individuals found that daily mastic consumption lead to lower total cholesterol levels. These results were observed after 8 weeks.</p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In a <span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2047487315603186">2016&nbsp;study</a></span>, people who took mastic&nbsp;in some form also experienced lower blood glucose levels which are&nbsp;sometimes associated with high cholesterol levels. Mastic was found to have&nbsp;a greater effect on people who are overweight or obese.</p>


<meta charset="utf-8">
<h2 id="biotic"><strong>4. Anti-Biotic / Anti-Fungal (Good For Everything)</strong></h2>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><strong>B</strong>alancing our body's bacteria is a crucial function of our diet. Mastic has anti-fungal and anti-inflammatory properties that&nbsp;serve as a&nbsp;cure for several ailments.</p>

<h3>Soothing Stomach Ulcers</h3>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span>Mastic&nbsp;has been shown to&nbsp;help in treating symptoms of peptic ulcers (stomach ulcers).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;A well-known <span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1440-1681.1984.tb00864.x">study</a>&nbsp;</span>conducted in 1984 on 38 people demonstrated that 1 gram of mastic gum taken daily, results in reduction of ulcer symptoms in less than 2 weeks.</p>

<h3><strong>Reducing Helicobacter Pylori Bacteria In The Stomach</strong></h3>
<p><span>Helicobacter pylori bacteria infections are a major risk factor that can contribute to stomach ulcers. If left unchecked, t</span>hese bacteria&nbsp;may potentially lead to stomach cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mastic gum's antibacterial capabilities against&nbsp;<i><span>H. pylori </span></i>have been shown to mitigate these risks. A<span> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0944711309002396?via%3Dihub">study</a></span>&nbsp;from 2010, found that mastic gum destroyed&nbsp;H. pylori colonies faster than a placebo in a 14 day period.</p>


<meta charset="utf-8">
<h2 id="digestion">
<strong>5.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Soothes Digestion &amp; Heartburn</strong>
</h2>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span><strong>M</strong>astic gum's most common use (for health purposes) throughout history has been as a cure for digestive problems.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;One<span> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1440-1681.1984.tb00864.x">study</a></span> found that 1g of mastic gum a day, led to fewer stomach aches and heartburn in volunteers. If you read <span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=mastic+gum&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2">Amazon</a></span> reviews for Mastiha and mastic gum, you will find hundreds of cases where it has cured men and women's ulcers and digestion problems:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0340/7226/4840/files/amazon-review-for-mastic-gum_480x480.png?v=1607283351" alt="Amazon review of mastic gum"></p>
<p><em>Mastic gum is an almost "magical" cure for stomach ulcers&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>

<h3>Helps Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)</h3>
<p>New research presented in <span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4367210/">2015 review</a></span> suggests that mastic gum can help with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn’s disease.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;A study conducted on 60 people with IBD found that individuals who consumed mastic in any form had&nbsp;measurable improvements in their IBD inflammation markers such as&nbsp;</span><span>decreased levels of IL-6 and C-reactive protein. This was over a 3 week period.</span></p>


<meta charset="utf-8">
<h2 id="cancer"><strong>6.&nbsp;Cancer Preventative</strong></h2>
<p><span><strong>R</strong>esearchers</span>&nbsp;are currently investigating mastic gum’s role in inhibiting the growth of prostate cancer. According to a<a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cncr.21935"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>2006 study</span>,</a> mastic gum can inhibit an androgen receptor that could have an effect on the development of prostate cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mastic&nbsp;has been shown to weaken the function of the androgen receptor in&nbsp;these&nbsp;cancer cells. More recent<span>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4951764/"><span>laboratory studies</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;have uncovered more about how this effect works.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5476564/">Research from 2017</a>&nbsp;</span>suggests that mastic&nbsp;may also help suppress the growth of tumors that can lead to colon cancer. Researchers found that mastic inhibited the increase of colon cells. It has been show to&nbsp;inhibit the growth of colon carcinoma tumors.</p>


<meta charset="utf-8">
<h2 id="asthma"><strong>7. Asthma Treatment</strong></h2>
<meta charset="utf-8"><meta charset="utf-8">
<p><strong>M</strong>astic gum's anti-inflammatory properties may make it useful in treating<span>&nbsp;allergenic asthma</span>. This type of asthma often includes airway inflammation, eosinophilia, and airway hyper-responsiveness.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In a<span>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1165/rcmb.2010-0212OC">2011 study</a></span></span><span>&nbsp;conducted&nbsp;</span>on mice, mastic gum significantly inhibited eosinophilia, reduced airway hyper-responsiveness, and blocked the production of inflammatory substances. It had a positive effect on lung fluid and lung inflammation. In vitro tests found that mastic gum inhibited cells that react negatively to allergens and cause airway inflammation.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;These results are promising but further studies are needed to determine efficacy in human cases.</p>


<meta charset="utf-8">

<p><span><strong>G</strong>enerally well-tolerated and 100% natural, mastic and&nbsp;doesn't have any major reported side effects. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;In some rare cases, it may cause dizziness, headache, or an upset stomach. These cases are likely due to increased tension in the muscles surrounding your skull because mastic gum is so much harder than what we are accustomed to chewing.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Start with a small quantity and see how your body reacts to it</strong>.&nbsp; Once you're sure there's no&nbsp;negative&nbsp;effects you can gradually increase the dose.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;It's always possible to have an allergic reaction to something new</span><span>. So monitor how you feel and consult a doctor if you're concerned.</span></p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span>You shouldn’t take mastic gum if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding.</span>&nbsp;</p>

However, I had never been oncall before I joined Linkedin and the impact of a system outage that affects thousands of engineers made the first week of oncall pretty overwhelming.</p><p><img src="https://ronaknathani.com/blog/2020/11/what-i-wish-i-knew-about-incident-management/then-with-caption.gif" alt="first week of me handling production issues"></p><p>But things got better overtime.</p><p>In this post, I would like to share the incident management practices I have picked up over the years as an SRE at Linkedin that help me keep calm under pressure and effectively drive incidents to resolution.</p><p><img src="https://ronaknathani.com/blog/2020/11/what-i-wish-i-knew-about-incident-management/now-with-caption.gif" alt="present me handling production issues"></p><h2 id="what-this-post-is-not-about">What this post is not about</h2><p>In this post, I am not going to talk about how to debug linux or distributed systems or the various debugging tools.

I was meeting smart engineers and learning new things. It wasn’t until my first oncall rotation that I started thinking <em>what if there’s an outage and I need to fix it?</em></p><p><img src="https://ronaknathani.com/blog/2020/11/what-i-wish-i-knew-about-incident-management/anxious.gif" alt="anxiety before first week of oncall"></p><p>Now, don’t get me wrong. LinkedIn has really good systems in place for monitoring/alerting, triaging issues and a very well defined process for incident response. Those are absolutely critical. And to prepare, I had shadowed our oncall the week prior and even had an experienced team member shadow me to guide and help me out, but still, I was anxious.</p><p>Here’s what I wish I had known.</p><ul><li><a href="#before-oncall-starts">Before oncall starts</a><ul><li><a href="#oncall-handoff">Oncall handoff</a></li><li><a href="#organizing-slack-during-an-oncall-week">Organizing Slack during an oncall week</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#signal-vs-noise">Signal vs Noise</a><ul><li><a href="#trust-but-verify---not-all-alerts-are-created-equal">Trust, but verify - not all alerts are created equal</a></li><li><a href="#declaring-an-incident">Declaring an incident</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#communication-during-an-incident">Communication during an incident</a><ul><li><a href="#the-incident-title-and-scoping-the-impact">The incident title and scoping the impact</a></li><li><a href="#establish-communication-channels-and-an-incident-lead">Establish communication channels and an incident lead</a></li><li><a href="#communicate-changes-to-the-system">Communicate changes to the system</a></li><li><a href="#provide-regular-updates">Provide regular updates</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#incident-response-is-a-collaborative-process">Incident response is a collaborative process</a><ul><li><a href="#get-help-early">Get help early</a></li><li><a href="#working-with-others">Working with others</a></li><li><a href="#video-conferencing-is-your-friend">Video conferencing is your friend</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#towards-a-resolution">Towards a resolution</a><ul><li><a href="#looking-at-changes">Looking at changes</a></li><li><a href="#keep-calm-and-carry-on---one-step-at-a-time">Keep calm and carry on - one step at a time</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#learning-from-the-incident">Learning from the incident</a></li></ul><h2 id="before-oncall-starts">Before Oncall Starts</h2><h3 id="oncall-handoff">Oncall handoff</h3><p>Before an oncall week starts, I talk to the person who is currently oncall to get context on any incidents that happened during the week or any weird bugs that were discovered in our stack. It gives me perspectives on issues that could be getting carried over from the previous week and any critical changes I should be aware of.
Although you can’t plan for all that happens during an oncall week, a proper handoff helps you prepare for it.</p><h3 id="organizing-slack-during-an-oncall-week">Organizing Slack during an oncall week</h3><p>As an SRE on LinkedIn’s container scheduler and deployment infrastructure team, our users are engineers at LinkedIn. We use Slack for internal communication and we have certain channels where users share issues they are experiencing with the tooling or to get our oncall’s attention. During an oncall week, I star these channels and organize my sidebar so that I can easily notice messages from our users and distinguish them from the other messages I receive. As an optional tip - I also like to mute/leave channels that I am not actively participating in to reduce clutter.</p><p>As compared to a normal week, I spend more time on Slack when I am oncall - responding to people, answering support requests, helping users with tooling. These Slack notifications can create a little bit of distraction, however, considering all our users are internal, a rise in messages on our channels can also indicate that something might be wrong with our system and our alerting hasn’t caught it yet.</p><p><img src="https://ronaknathani.com/blog/2020/11/what-i-wish-i-knew-about-incident-management/slack-pings.gif" alt="slack pings during oncall"></p><h2 id="signal-vs-noise">Signal vs Noise</h2><h3 id="trust-but-verify---not-all-alerts-are-created-equal">Trust, but verify - not all alerts are created equal</h3><p><img src="https://ronaknathani.com/blog/2020/11/what-i-wish-i-knew-about-incident-management/trust-but-verify-you-must.jpg" alt="trust-but-verify-you-must"></p><p><i>This is something I learned during my interview at LinkedIn and it has been very applicable in my experience since.</i></p><p>In early days of oncall and incident management, it is very common to feel as if things are on fire when any alert gets triggered. Over time, I have realized that gaining context and verifying that the alert is actually indicating an issue helps with the right next steps. It is important to distinguish signal from noise because:</p><ul><li>An alert could be non-actionable as it was recently configured with a threshold that’s making it too noisy</li><li>The monitoring stack is down and the alert is being triggered because the configuration treats a lack of data points as an issue</li><li>Your service is operating perfectly fine, however, the traffic tier routing requests to your service had an issue</li><li>Timer on a deliberately silenced alert expired and the alert started triggering</li></ul><p>I have experienced all of the above at some point in time. Now when I either receive an alert or a user reports an issue, I check our services (metrics, logs, reproduce the reported problem etc.) to verify that the issue is real.</p><h3 id="declaring-an-incident">Declaring an incident</h3><p>Not all actionable alerts result in an incident. To be effective at identifying the ones that do, it is extremely crucial to think about the bigger picture of mitigating the issue than be overwhelmed by the technical task of resolving the alert.</p><p>Some of the qualitative measures that help make this differentiation is to consider whether an issue requires coordinating the fix with other teams or whether the issue is impacting customers or violating an SLO. If any of the conditions are true, declare an incident. It is always better to declare an incident early in the process than waiting too long.</p><p>At LinkedIn, we have defined guidelines for all teams about what warrants an incident along with different levels of severity. This takes guesswork out of the picture, and provides a shared understanding to every team member.</p><h2 id="communication-during-an-incident">Communication during an incident</h2><h3 id="the-incident-title-and-scoping-the-impact">The incident title and scoping the impact</h3><p>Every incident gets a title. I didn’t realize it initially, but giving an incident a title forces one to define the problem and communicate it to the stakeholders very succinctly. When communicating to stakeholders, <strong>scoping the incident is very important</strong>. What I mean by scoping is identifying how big the impact is - which environment is impacted, is the impact limited to a region or is it global, how many customers are impacted, etc. For instance, “the login feature on the site is not working” vs “the login feature on the site is not working for traffic originating from Asia Pacific” say two very different things.</p><h3 id="establish-communication-channels-and-an-incident-lead">Establish communication channels and an incident lead</h3><p>We heavily rely on Slack to communicate during an incident. A dedicated slack channel helps focus all the energy and inputs from everyone in one place. It helps the incident lead collect data about symptoms that the users are experiencing and also captures a log of considered/discarded hypotheses and any changes made to the system. Once the Slack channel is created, establish an incident lead and let everyone know who is driving the incident forward.</p><p>Eslablishing explicit comms channels for reporting and identifying issues and establishing an incident lead reduce the delay in action and disambiguate any confusion.</p><h3 id="communicate-changes-to-the-system">Communicate changes to the system</h3><p>If there’s a fix you’d like to try out, let others know who are and encourage everyone to do the same. This ensures that the potential fix doesn’t make an already bad situation worse and helps catch any blind spots early. If you do end up making a change to the system after getting consensus, let others know and follow up on its effects.</p><h3 id="provide-regular-updates">Provide regular updates</h3><p>While working towards a resolution for the incident, it is very easy to get overwhelmed by the technical details and miss to communicate an update. This leads to angry leadership and annoyed customers who have no insight into what’s happening.</p><p>An update provides visibility to the customers that the issue is being worked upon and lets the leadership identify if they can help out with anything. Depending on the severity of the incident, an update every 15-30 mins serves pretty well. The update doesn’t have to be extremely detailed, rather a brief summary describing the current state and immediate next steps is sufficient. An example update:</p><blockquote><p><strong>[UPDATE]</strong> Our hypothesis about the memory leak checks out and we have validated the fix in the staging environment. We have pushed out the change and as soon as it goes through the CI pipeline, we’ll canary the new release, monitor metrics and promote the change after verifying the fix.</p></blockquote><h2 id="incident-response-is-a-collaborative-process">Incident response is a collaborative process</h2><h3 id="get-help-early">Get help early</h3><p>In my earlier days, I used to think that it was solely my responsibility to mitigate the issue, find the root cause, and roll out the fix. If I couldn’t do it, it wouldn’t reflect well on me. In reality, incident management, like much of software development, is a very collaborative process.</p><p>One of the big differences in how I approach it now is I focus on actively pulling in other engineers who could help with debugging or resolving the issue early in the process. This change in perspective has relieved me of a lot of unnecessary stress and also made me more effective at resolving incidents.</p><p>When requesting help, be specific about the task as well as the urgency. It helps others calibrate their response and manage things they might have at hand.</p><h3 id="working-with-others">Working with others</h3><p>One of the most important things while handling incidents is working with others. Considering the multi-faceted nature of an SRE role, it’s one of the most important while underrated skills.</p><p>With multiple people involved, various possibilities get shared and one of the responsibilities of the incident lead is to guide these discussions in a productive direction while filtering out the noise. One should be cautious about going down any rabbit holes and focus on stopping the bleeding first. If there’s a probable cause, share it early - it helps rule out possibilities. And it’s okay to ask questions that seem obvious, but specific questions are more helpful.</p><p>Being fearlessly curious, and keeping an open mind enables one to consider possibilities that could be overseen otherwise. Remember, you are working together as a team on sharing and ruling out hypotheses to solve a challenging problem.</p><h3 id="video-conferencing-is-your-friend">Video Conferencing is your friend</h3><p>We …</p></div></div>

<p><b>Ralph W. McGehee:</b> It's a real honor for me to be here today. I don't often say that, but I really mean it. I like to start off my talk by mentioning two things. One, please don't believe anything I'm going to tell you. The American people are so inundated by misinformation, there's absolutely no reason you should believe anything anybody tells you, particularly the evening news. Of course, with everything there is an exception, and I think in my case, I have a fairly valid exception. Because of the process that I had to go through to clear my book, I had to prove that everything I am saying is in the public domain. I still go down to the Agency about twice a month and turn in new material to let them clear it. And in doing that process, I have to produce or pull out from government documents that particular information, because they inevitably will say, "You can't say it, it's classified." And I will inevitably locate that information in the public domain.</p> 
 
<p>So if you doubt me, and I hope you will, there is a way to check up on me. Go to the library and look in the back of my book, and almost every major conclusion that I will be talking about here today will be documented to an official government document. I've drawn upon the Pentagon Papers. Are you all familiar with the Pentagon Papers? And the Senate and House investigations of the Agency and a variety of other material. So don't believe what I say, but if you want to check up on me, the information is available.</p> 
 
<p>Secondly, I'd like to say my message is basically a real downer. It is real negative, but I don't want to leave you with that impression, because I just returned from a two week speaking trip in Iowa, where I was going to testify at the court case there in Iowa City for the protesters, and in Nebraska. And I've been in Arizona and various other places speaking, and wherever you go, you find concerned groups. So I am encouraged. I know during the Vietnam War for the first ten years, we didn't even know what was going on. And then eleven or twelve years later, people began to protest. But this time in Latin America, the protest was almost instantaneous. The substructure is there. The only reason we got out of Vietnam, of course, is because of the student protests. So I am very encouraged. My message is negative, but I don't want to leave you with that impression. I am very, very encouraged.</p> 
 
<p>I think I should talk in three basic phases. One, walk you very quickly through my career with the Agency up to right now where I am today, and back up and walk you through Vietnam a little bit or walk you through my career in a little more detail, including Vietnam. Now I do that not to talk about Vietnam but because the processes that are followed today in Central America, in the Middle East and in Africa have all been used in Vietnam. I'll take out three or four incidences, and they are documented by the way, and show you that these are sort of typical of what the Agency does around the world since the very beginning in '47, what it's doing today in '86.</p> 
 
<p>Then I'll go back and review the Agency's domestic operations, and I'll do that for one purpose, because everything they were doing up to the mid-seventies they are now doing again. The only difference now is under President Reagan's Executive Order 12333 of December '81, they can do the things legally that they were doing illegally before. It's the only difference. Then I would like to talk, sort of bring it all together in Central America and talk about El Salvador, Grenada, and particularly Nicaragua, and then come to my conclusion. So that's basically the approach I'll take.</p> 
 
<p>I went to the University of Notre Dame. I played on four undefeated football teams, three national championships, and then I tried out with the Green Bay Packers. And to this day, I can't understand what's the matter with the coaches up there. When I was cut, I received a cable, "Would you be interested in an important government position similar to the State Department in function?" My football background was not irrelevant. When I went down to Washington, I found that the class before me, my class, and the class after me were basically rejects from the National Football League, not the standard concept of an intelligent (He does say "intelligent" here, I think as a joke about football players) officer.</p> 
 
<p>Well, I served in the Agency for 25 years. The first 15 or 16 years, I believed that the CIA was sort of like a missionary organization, out saving the world for democracy and religion and gathering good intelligence to help our policymakers make good decisions. When I'd go into work in the morning, I'd feel a real pride that I'm part of the great crusade to stop the international communist conspiracy. All that began to change for me in Vietnam. That's when I began protesting.</p> 
 
<p>I should mention that I served my entire 25 years in the Directorate of Operations. Now, the Agency is broken down to basically four directorates, Administration, Science and Technology, Intelligence, and Operations. Administrators administrate. Science and Technology, they devise the sophisticated collection devices and monitor the results. The Directorate of Intelligence, that's the scholars who sit and read the reports that come in from around the world and then put out the final reports. And the Operators operate. The Directorate of Operations has two basic functions, covert operations and gathering intelligence covertly.</p> 
 
<p>Since it's my contention that the Agency is little more than a covert action agency, I will dwell a little bit on it. Now, covert action operations in broadest context can be described as those operations designed to overthrow or support foreign governments. Overthrow operations have four basic components, economic warfare, political warfare, psychological warfare, and economic warfare. In my 25 years in the Agency, I served overseas in Japan, in the Philippines, in Taiwan, six years or three tours in Thailand, and two years as the chief police adviser to the head of the Vietnamese Special Police. That's the equivalent of our FBI.</p> 
 
<p>As I said, my period of protests began around the Vietnam War. I for the next period within the Agency began protesting, and having no luck with those protests, I finally left the Agency in 1977. Now, in a stroke of real irony at this particular point, because they had assigned me to the CIA’s Siberia. When you escalate your protest, you become persona non grata. In '77 in a stroke of irony, they awarded me the Career Intelligence Medal and the Honorable Service Medal. Of course, I think I know why. They knew they had a loose cannon and they wanted to kind of damp me down, appease me a little bit. And I think that was the purpose of giving them to me.</p> 
 
<p>But I also earlier had won awards, two Vietnam service awards, a commendation from the director for devising a program of counterinsurgency and intelligence, and a variety of other CIA and foreign awards. Well, when I left the Agency, I testified before the Senate and House intelligence committees and before a variety of other Senate and House committees, all related to CIA activities.</p> 
 
<p>I immediately set about writing a book about my experiences. It took me three years to research and write the book, and then like all CIA officers, when you join the Agency, you have to sign a secrecy agreement. And as I said, I must now submit everything to the CIA for pre-publication review. I did, and they came back and they said they have identified approximately 400 security violations in my manuscript. And they returned it in little bits and pieces of paper, because some of these deletions ran up to several pages in length.</p> 
 
<p>Well, to defeat this process, I went through going through the public record and pulling out the identical information. And ultimately with this effort, I got virtually everything reinstated. There are a few little specifics that I didn't get reinstated, but for the most part they were all reinstated. I did in a few cases, they had deleted some very boring information, so I said rather than fight them over this one, let's just leave this comment, "Seven words deleted." It looks a lot sexier than mine. So I didn't fight them on all of them.</p> 
 
<p>Then I went looking for a publisher, a long hard process, and finally one publisher said, "You know, you've written a nice legal brief here. You make your points and then you have your citations to your information. But boy, it's dull as mud. Who would want to read a legal brief? So we will publish it if you'll rewrite it as a autobiography," which I did. I then resubmitted it to the CIA for pre-publication review. I didn't put any more secret details in there. I just added my personal life.</p> 
 
<p>At this time, William Casey had become Director of the CIA, and they in essence told me, "We're not going to let you publish a book." And I said, "Well, you can't stop me. Everything that's in the book, you have not only cleared for other people, it's not only in the public record, but you also cleared for me before. And the laws that you operate under say you may not reclassify information once it's been declassified and released." And their response in essence, "Well, that's tough. We're doing it anyhow. There's nothing you can do about it." Well, this was a very critical period. I just didn't know what to do. I really worried about this, because if they would've stopped me with that, then I would not be able to speak to you here this evening, because everything would have been classified.</p> 
 
<p>So I called <i>The Washington Post</i>, and <i>The Washington Post</i> ran a long exposé of how the CIA was violating the law by reclassifying information that was in the public domain, a violation of the law of the land. This public exposure forced the Agency to relent, and the book was finally released. Subsequent to the release of the book, I then traveled to Cuba, where we stayed about a week, and to Grenada, …</p></div></div>

This is different from a traditional security model where all components inside of a given perimeter are regarded as safe or trusted. It was introduced as a reaction to the traditional network security model as a measure against lateral movement after a breach.</p>
</section><article><section><p>In <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/zero-trust-networks/9781491962183/ch01.html">Zero Trust Networks by Evan Gilman, Doug Barth</a>, a Zero Trust network is defined as a network built on five fundamental assertions:</p>
<ol>
<li>The network is always assumed to be hostile</li>
<li>External and internal threats exist on the network at all times</li>
<li>Network locality is not sufficient for deciding trust in a network</li>
<li>Every device, user, and network flow is authenticated and authorized</li>
<li>Policies must be dynamic and calculated from as many sources of data as possible</li>
</ol>
<p>The core of Zero Trust is to "never trust, always verify", closely related to the principle of least privilege, stating that any user, program, or process should have the bare minimum privileges necessary to perform its tasks. In order to make sure that an application works well in a Zero Trust environment, we need to minimize the risk of lateral movement by isolating potential data breaches as much as possible. In the context of application development, these five assertions can be summarized into the following guidelines:</p>
<ol>
<li>Treat all hosts as if they are Internet-facing (assertions 1-3)</li>
<li>Delegate authentication and authorization to a supporting system (assertions 4-5)</li>
</ol>
<p>Given that all hosts are regarded as Internet-facing, we need to ensure that all communication channels are secure, even if they were at some point regarded as internal. This means that we should encrypt all internal and external network traffic that we don't want to expose, including (but not limited to) traffic between applications and databases. This will make it difficult for an attacker to snoop traffic, even if he or she has gained access to an internal network.</p>
<p>By delegating authentication and authorization to a supporting system (control plane), it is possible to enable centralized access auditing and policy enforcement based on selected criteria. This means that we don't need to create complex logic to verify devices and users in each application as it will be handled by the control plane. In a more practical sense, we should opt for federated identity combined with standardized authorization protocols like <a href="https://oauth.net/2/">OAuth 2.0</a>. In modern web applications, it may be worth looking into <a href="https://jwt.io/">JWT</a> to represent claims securely.</p>
<p>Regardless of which authorization method you choose, make sure that each client that is granted access will be given its own account. Never share credentials between services or users. One account per client makes it possible to remove access if one client is compromised, and makes it possible to trace traffic back to a single source when investigating an incident, or analyzing traffic in general.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are no Zero Trust products. There are products that work well in Zero Trust environments and those that don't.
— <a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-a-zero-trust-architecture">Palo Alto Networks</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That should cover the basics.

			<p>In 1995 LEGO conducted a study to determine how to become “digital” – how to do it and what it would take. This study took place from May to October in a secret lab on the third floor of LEGO&nbsp;headquarters, Legocentret. At the end of the study LEGO&nbsp;management received a report detailing programs, people, and resources needed to move into the new paradigm. LEGO&nbsp;quickly approved the plan, and SPU-Darwin was set in motion at the beginning of the new year.</p>
<p>This website is the story of SPU-Darwin, of moving LEGO&nbsp;into the 21st century. I’m not sure yet how to tell that story, so it’s organized as a blog. This will allow me to present pieces of history as they come, without worrying about having to have everything set before presenting anything, and will allow me to experiment with presentations. Also, a great deal of leading edge science and engineering had to be developed, and those stories will require intense technical material, which might not appeal to everyone, and those entries will be separate from the general ones.</p>
<p><img alt="BKGND A" src="http://www.digitallego.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/BKGND-A-300x225.png" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://www.digitallego.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/BKGND-A-300x225.png 300w, http://www.digitallego.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/BKGND-A.png 320w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>To Darwin members: the blog structure of this website is expressly designed to allow everyone to chime in with their memories. Please do that. Periodically I’ll go through the topics and concentrate them down into organized stories. It’s my hope that this path will eventually lead to an actual publication someday, like an interactive multimedia book, but we’ll worry about that later.</p>
<p>I’m not a designer, so if you’d like to contribute anything about this website design, PLEASE do so.</p>
<p>Note: only Darwin members (which is not just LEGO employees, it’s everyone who was intimately involved – this means you, SGI and Informix and DDE) will have editing access. Everyone else can email, which will be dealt with separately.</p>

<p>The main issue here, as you can see is that this code has a significant performance impact during the call the method. Dynamic attributes are expected to be fast and simple. They shouldn’t contain any complicated logic or perform expensive calls.  </p>

<p>Over the past couple months I’ve taken time to catch myself up on all that’s happened in crypto since my time with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://onwardlabs.co/" target="_blank"><strong>Onward Labs</strong></a>, and all I can say is my goodness – the amount of experimentation and innovation has been staggering this year. This is exciting because we are seeing financial services get completely rebuilt in an internet-native way and artists are now able to make a good living creating beautiful NFTs. I’m more optimistic about the future of society because of crypto and this decade will be wild with all the mass consumer use cases that will be built.</p>



<p>At the same time, I’m concerned that the barriers to engage with crypto are higher than ever before. This is a huge problem because it limits the circle of people “in the know” to those who lucked into crypto early as well as their extended networks. It’s no secret that Silicon Valley has had a diversity problem and by comparison crypto’s diversity problem is much worse. If we want crypto to achieve the enormous potential we believe crypto has, we have to make the ecosystem more welcoming and inviting for people from all walks of life who bring their unique lived experiences with them. Then, and only then, will the conditions be set to fulfill crypto’s promise to empower people.</p>



<p>I remember when I was first learning about crypto in 2017 – what a steep learning curve it has been! In fact, every crypto expert – whether the like to admit it or not – went through a steep learning curve and we are all still learning. Now that the next crypto bull run is in full swing, I can’t help but think of the massive learning curve that the influx of newcomers to the space will face. </p>

<p>Back when I was preparing for a career in finance, I recall learning about the basics of finance on Investopedia and how great of a resource it was. I thought to myself – why isn’t there something like this for crypto? Enter <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cryptoporfavor.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Crypto Por Favor</strong></a>. I am building a platform that explains crypto topics in everyday language, meeting people where they are and not using complex crypto jargon as the industry is wont to do. I want it to be a place where anyone can come in from a crypto knowledge base of zero and build up enough awareness to be able to make well-informed decisions about how the want to participate in the evolving ecosystem. I see this as a resource for people, and over time will look to build a community of folks who want to learn among supportive peers in a place where no question is “too dumb.” Oh, and maybe I will experiment with a community token down the road to incentivize people to help build the best crypto onboarding community!</p>



<p>Would love to hear what you think as well as any requests for topics you’d like covered or features you’d like to see. Feel free to reach out on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/chris3collins" target="_blank"><strong>Twitter</strong></a>.</p>



<p>PS – you may be wondering about the rationale behind the name and branding. When I chose the name, I wanted it to evoke a sense of multiculturalism and present a casual, non-intimidating tone. Given my Latin American roots, Crypto Por Favor was a no-brainer as well as its llama mascot, an animal that is typical of the Andes region. 🦙🌄</p>

<hr>

<p>Most serious programmers have heard of Donald Knuth,
the man who coined the term <em>analysis of algorithms</em> in 1968
and pioneered many of the computer science fundamentals we use today.
Knuth is perhaps most famous for his ongoing magnum opus,
<em>The Art of Computer Programming</em>.</p>

<p>When the first volume of TAOCP was released that same year,
it was printed the way most books had been since the turn of the century:
with <em>hot metal</em> type.
Each individual letter was cast from molten lead,
then arranged into its line.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Matrixcase-bembo-16pts.jpg" alt="Monotype matrix case" height="400">
<figcaption>
A case of letter molds—or <em>matrices</em>—used by the Monotype caster,
the most commonly-used machine for printing books in the days of hot metal type.
Its main contemporary, the Linotype, molded entire lines at a time,
and was often used for printing newspapers.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These lines were clamped together to form pages of the book,
which were finally inked and pressed against paper.
By March of 1977, Knuth was ready for a second run of TAOCP, Volume&nbsp;2,
but he was horrified when he received the proofs.
Hot metal typesetting was an expensive, complicated, and time-consuming process,
so publishers had replaced it with phototypesetting,
which works by projecting characters onto film.
The new technology, while much cheaper and faster,
didn’t provide the same level of quality he had come to expect.</p>

<p>The average author would have resigned themselves to the change and moved on,
but Knuth took great pride in print quality,
especially for the mathematics in his books.
Around this time, he discovered an exciting new technology:
digital typesetting.
Instead of working with metal or film,
letters and shapes were built from tiny dots,
often packed together at over 1,000 per inch.
Inspired by this burgeoning tech and frustrated with the current state of affairs,
Knuth set off on one of the greatest yak shaves of all time.
For years, he paused all work on his books to create his own
digital typesetting system.
When the dust settled in 1978, Knuth had the first version of
<span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>It’s hard to understand how much of a revolution <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 was,
especially looking back from a time where anybody with a copy
of Word can be their own desktop publisher.
Adobe’s PDF wouldn’t exist for another decade, so Knuth
invented a device-independent format, DVI.
Scalable fonts were uncommon at the time, so Knuth created a system,
<span>METAFONT</span>
, to rasterize his characters into dots on the
page.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>
Perhaps most importantly, Knuth and his graduate students designed algorithms
to automatically hyphenate and justify lines of text into
beautifully-typeset paragraphs.</p>

<p>Here is where the timelines diverge.
In one, <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 was just the beginning.
Computer typography evolves rapidly as the decades go by,
building on Knuth’s prior work and
taking advantage of the million-fold increases we’ve seen in computing power.
Browsers, e-readers, and word processors deliver beautiful type
to every person who looks at a screen, with almost no effort from authors.</p>

<p>In the darker timeline… none of this happens.
<span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 is still some of the best we’ve got for computer typesetting.
It’s seen some impressive improvements,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>
but its core hasn’t changed much in decades.
To this day,
it doesn’t lay out more than one page at a time because 1980s computers didn’t
have enough RAM to do any better.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>
Almost no other software—except for a handful of professional layout
programs like Adobe InDesign—leverages any of the advances
<span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 made in line breaking and hyphenation.
Layout in Word, browsers, and even e-readers is a sad joke.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://assets.bitbashing.io/images/exa.png" alt="Mobile browser layout example" height="400">
<figcaption>
State of the art text layout in today's browsers. Mind the gaps.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I’m not sure what to make of this.
Maybe most people, outside a small cadre of designers and
enthusiasts, just don’t care about typography very much.
After all, the human brain is incredibly good glossing over minor details and
im<span>p</span>erfections when reading.
But even the design world seems largely unaware or indifferent to Knuth’s work.
Despite collaborations with famous type designers like Hermann Zapf,
you’ll find no mention of him in renowned books and documentaries on
the subject.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>
And parametric font families—just like the ones <span>METAFONT</span>
 offered in 1983—are
heralded in 2017 as “a new era of type design”.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>
It’s bizarre.</p>

<p>Good typography can make almost anything more enjoyable to read,
and it feels like such a shame that better layout isn’t
available to the masses
when so much of the groundwork was laid almost forty years ago.
In an age when the average American reads from a screen they keep in their pocket
dozens of times a day,
and where each one of those devices holds more processing power than you could
fit in several rooms back when Donald Knuth
wrote <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
, surely we can—and <em>should</em>—do better.</p>

December 6, 2020 | https://attacomsian.com/blog/web-storage-api-local-storage-session-storage | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://attacomsian.com/blog/web-storage-api-local-storage-session-storage">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>The HTML web storage API provides a way to store data locally within a user's browser. You can use it to securely store a large amount of data locally without impacting website performance.</p>
<p>Unlike cookies, web storage has a significantly higher storage limit (5MB vs 4KB) and the data stored is never sent to the server with every request. Therefore, the server can not manipulate the web storage data via HTTP cookies.</p>
<p>Also, the storage is bound to the origin (per domain, protocol, and port). All web pages, from one origin (with the same protocol, domain, and port), can store and access the same data. Even if you change the protocol from <code>http</code> to <code>https</code>, you can not access the data stored using the <code>http</code> protocol.</p>
<h2 id="web-storage-objects">Web Storage Objects</h2>
<p>HTML web storage provides two objects for saving data as key-value pairs in the browser:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>localStorage</code> — stores data with no expiration date that persists even after the browser window is closed. You have to explicitly remove data either programmatically or by clearing the browser's data. The data is shared among all the sessions of the same origin.</li>
<li><code>sessionStorage</code> — stores data for the duration of the page session that gets cleared automatically when the browser tab is closed. If you open multiple tabs of the same website, they will have different sessions and can not access data of each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since <code>localStorage</code> persists data with no expiration date, it is useful for storing information such as shopping cart items, user preferences (currency, dark or light color scheme), products bookmarked, or even remembering the user is logged into the website.</p>
<h2 id="methods--properties">Methods &amp; Properties</h2>
<p>Both <code>localStorage</code> and <code>sessionStorage</code> objects provide the same methods and properties because they return the same <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Open in new window">Storage</a> object.</p>
<p>The <code>Storage</code> object has just one property, <code>length</code>, that returns the number of items stored in it.</p>
<p>Here is a list of methods that you can call to manipulate web storage data:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Method</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>setItem(key, value)</code></td>
<td>Add a new key-value pair to the storage</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>getItem(key)</code></td>
<td>Retrieve a value by its key</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>removeItem(key)</code></td>
<td>Remove an item by its key</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>clear()</code></td>
<td>Delete all key-value pairs</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>key(n)</code></td>
<td>Retrieve the name of the nth key in the storage</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="web-storage-examples">Web Storage Examples</h2>
<p>Let us play with <code>localStorage</code> to get an idea of how web storage works.</p>
<h3 id="storing-data">Storing data</h3>
<p>The following example uses <code>setItem()</code> to add new key-value pairs to <code>localStorage</code>:</p>
<pre rel="javascript"><code>localStorage.setItem('id', 'ATS-456');
localStorage.setItem('email', 'john.doe@example.com');
</code></pre>
<p>Note that both key and value passed to <code>setItem()</code> must be strings. If you pass any value that is not a string, like an object or a number, the <code>setItem()</code> method will automatically convert it a string:</p>
<pre rel="javascript"><code>localStorage.setItem('visitors', 34); // stored as '34'
localStorage.setItem('user', { name: 'Alex' }); // stored as '[oject Object]'
</code></pre>
<p>For objects, you need to use the <a href="https://attacomsian.com/blog/json-parse-stringify#jsonstringify">JSON.stringify()</a> method to convert it to a string before storing into web storage:</p>
<pre rel="javascript"><code>const str = JSON.stringify({name: 'Alex'});
localStorage.setItem('user', str);
</code></pre>
<h3 id="retrieving-data">Retrieving data</h3>
<p>To retrieve the stored data in <code>localStorage</code> by key, use the <code>getItem()</code> method:</p>
<pre rel="javascript"><code>localStorage.getItem('id');     // ATS-456
localStorage.getItem('email');  // john.doe@example.com
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, you could also use the dot (<code>.</code>) donation to access keys from <code>localStorage</code> like objects:</p>
<pre rel="javascript"><code>localStorage.visitors;  // 45
</code></pre>
<p>If the key doesn't exist, a <code>null</code> value is returned by <code>getItem()</code>:</p>
<pre rel="javascript"><code>localStorage.getItem('name'); // null
</code></pre>
<h3 id="removing-data">Removing data</h3>
<p>To delete a key-value pair from <code>localStorage</code>, just pass the name of the key to the <code>removeItem()</code> method:</p>
<pre rel="javascript"><code>localStorage.removeItem('id');
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, you could also use the <code>delete</code> operator to delete a key like an object:</p>
<pre rel="javascript"><code>delete localStorage.email;
</code></pre>
<p>To remove all key-value pairs, use the <code>clear()</code> method instead:</p>
<pre rel="javascript"><code>localStorage.clear();
</code></pre>
<h3 id="iterating-over-keys">Iterating over keys</h3>
<p>To iterate over all keys stored in <code>localStorage</code>, we can use the <a href="https://attacomsian.com/blog/javascript-for-of-loop">for...of</a> loop:</p>
<pre rel="javascript"><code>const keys = Object.keys(localStorage);
for (let key of keys) {
    console.log(`${key}: ${localStorage.getItem(key)}`);
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Object.keys()</code> method returns all <a href="https://attacomsian.com/blog/javascript-object-get-all-own-properties">own properties</a> of the <code>localStorage</code> object, ignoring the <a href="https://attacomsian.com/blog/objects-prototypes-classes-javascript#prototypes">prototype</a>.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>HTML web storage API provides a mechanism to store data locally within the user's browser. Before web storage, cookies were the only option available for storing application data.</p>
<p>Unlike cookies, web storage is more secure and capable of storing a larger amount of data (5MB+, depending on the browser) without affecting the application performance.</p>
<p>Web storage is bound to the origin, which means that pages from the same origin can only access their own data.</p>
<p>Web storage provides two objects, <code>localStorage</code> and <code>sessionStorage</code>, to save data as key-value pairs in the browser.</p>
<p>The data stored in <code>localStorage</code> is permanent and shared between all tabs and windows with the same origin. It persists even after the browser is closed or the computer is restarted.</p>
<p>The <code>sessionStorage</code> object stores data temporarily until the session is active. The data is only accessible within the same tab and can not be accessed from other tabs. It gets cleared automatically once the browser tab is closed.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>Sunday December 6, 2020</p>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://planspace.org/2013/09/28/polyas-how-to-solve-it-quotes-and-comments/">How to Solve It</a>, <a href="https://planspace.org/20200716-lateral_thinking_creativity_step_by_step/">Lateral Thinking</a>, and others,
I've started to collect tactics for problem-solving. The shuffling
stuff is so that you can easily choose a random tactic to try.</p>
<p>I might do more with this and I'd love feedback/suggestions;
<a href="#contact">comment or message me</a>!</p>
<center>


</center>

<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#1" name="1">1</a>. Embrace problems</h3>
<p>The word "problem" has a negative connotation, and some problems are
hard to love. But in general, problems make life more interesting and
give us opportunities to learn, grow, and improve. Keep your problems
close.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#2" name="2">2</a>. Take care of yourself</h3>
<p>Are you hungry? Tired? Stressed? Eat well, sleep well, and look after
your mental health. Try to do something right now to make your body
and mind more effective, like stretching.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#3" name="3">3</a>. Take the pressure off</h3>
<p>What can you do to approach the problem calmly? Should you ask for
help or otherwise communicate with others? Should you make a back-up
plan or adjust your goal?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#4" name="4">4</a>. Reinforce the positive</h3>
<p>You have an opportunity for growth. You're learning. Celebrate all
progress, even small progress. Feel good about what you're doing. You
can do this.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#5" name="5">5</a>. Remove distractions</h3>
<p>Turn off the TV. Turn off your phone. Turn off notifications. Don't
check the news. Multitasking is a lie. If other thoughts come, jot
them down elsewhere to return to later.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#6" name="6">6</a>. Get inspired</h3>
<p>Why are you working on this? What's the larger goal? What are the
larger benefits? What other problems or people have done work you
admire? Appreciate and aspire to greatness.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#7" name="7">7</a>. Make a plan</h3>
<p>If you know how to attack the problem, make a plan to do that. Even if
you don't, make a plan to spend time on the problem, not all at once,
but consistently over a longer period.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#8" name="8">8</a>. Do other things</h3>
<p>Don't forget to eat and sleep, but also, spend time on complementary
and even unrelated tasks. Read a book. Tutor a student. Revisit other
things. Take a walk.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#9" name="9">9</a>. Work hard</h3>
<p>You need to focus. You need to put in time and effort. Sometimes you
have to stop looking for shortcuts and do the work. There is no royal
road. Work harder than anyone else.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#10" name="10">10</a>. Relax</h3>
<p>Take some time to change the nature of your focus on the problem. Pull
back from single-minded concentration. Don't focus on anything else
either. Relax. Don't micromanage your brain. What comes to you?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#11" name="11">11</a>. Work smart</h3>
<p>Even if you're already making progress, is there something you could
do more effectively? Can you find a better process if you reconsider?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#12" name="12">12</a>. Find support</h3>
<p>What would help you to be effective? Is there a group or team you can
join or form? What people or other resources can you engage with?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#13" name="13">13</a>. Understand the problem</h3>
<p>Do you completely understand what you're working on? Are all the
definitions clear? Does everyone involved agree on the problem
statement and objective?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#14" name="14">14</a>. Find roots</h3>
<p>What is the root cause (or causes) of the problem? Is the problem as
stated the real problem? How did the problem come to be? Keep asking
why.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#15" name="15">15</a>. Know what you know</h3>
<p>What do you know, and how do you know it? Are you sure? Could you
explain it to someone else? What do you not know, and how could you
come to know it? What else might be relevant?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#16" name="16">16</a>. Question assumptions</h3>
<p>What are you taking for granted? What is so obvius that you haven't
thought about it? What biases might be affecting your thinking? Are
there alternatives that seem "out there"?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#17" name="17">17</a>. Find similar problems</h3>
<p>Do you know a related problem? What have others done in similar
situations? How is a similar problem solved in nature, or in another
field? Can you build on work you or others have done before?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#18" name="18">18</a>. Consider quitting</h3>
<p>Is this a problem that shouldn't be solved? Is this problem the right
use of your time, right now? What if you didn't solve this particular
problem?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#19" name="19">19</a>. Get an easy win</h3>
<p>Find a task that you can succeed at in the next two minutes. It could
be getting out a pen, or opening a book. Do it, then praise yourself
for that victory. It may be easier to keep making progress afterward.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#20" name="20">20</a>. Start things cooking</h3>
<p>Many tasks involve some waiting after you initiate them, like waiting
for food to marinate, or waiting for responses to an email. Make a
point to get these things started as soon as you can.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#21" name="21">21</a>. Take a step</h3>
<p>Even if you're not sure of your whole plan, do something now. You can
always reevaluate afterward. Choose some goal that you can accomplish,
and do it now.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#22" name="22">22</a>. Do an experiment</h3>
<p>You don't have to only do things that you know will work. Try
something and see what happens. Be prepared to throw it away. You'll
learn from it and it will help you to make progress.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#23" name="23">23</a>. Guess and check</h3>
<p>A particular kind of experiment is to choose a next step, even if you
don't know that it's right, and see what happens next. Follow the
consequences forward. Even if you guessed wrong, you'll learn
something.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#24" name="24">24</a>. Write down what you’ve done</h3>
<p>Keep some log of what you've been doing, what you've tried, and what
the results have been. If you haven't been doing this, try to remember
and write down what you've done so far.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#25" name="25">25</a>. Try again</h3>
<p>Sometimes when you try something and it doesn't work, it isn't that
the approach was bad, it's that something didn't align that time. It
could be worth trying again, especially with things you tried when you
knew less.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#26" name="26">26</a>. Zoom in</h3>
<p>How close can you get to the tiniest pieces? What happens for exactly
one component? For a global problem, how does a single individual play
a part on a daily basis?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#27" name="27">27</a>. Zoom out</h3>
<p>What's the big picture? How does the problem fit into larger systems?
What's the global view? What's the long term view?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#28" name="28">28</a>. Draw a picture</h3>
<p>Make a graphical representation. It could be a sketch, a plot, a
diagram, a mind map, a flow chart. Make something you can see.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#29" name="29">29</a>. Change representations</h3>
<p>What's another way to conceptualize the problem? In math, you might
switch between numeric, geometric, and algebraic forms. You might
change domains, or phrase the problem as a story.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#30" name="30">30</a>. Use a different tool</h3>
<p>Try saying it out loud. Try typing, or writing longhand, or recording
a video. Try post-it notes or index cards. Try paper and pencil, or a
calculator, a diagramming tool, or a programming language.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#31" name="31">31</a>. Use analogy</h3>
<p>What else is this like? Can you compare to something else, even if
it's a stretch? What do the similarities and differences tell you?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#32" name="32">32</a>. Change viewpoints</h3>
<p>How does this look from different perspectives? How do different
people, pieces, places see the problem? Can you imagine yourself in
different positions?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#33" name="33">33</a>. Organize concepts</h3>
<p>What's the deep structure of this problem? Can you model the problem?
Are there axes or other ways of representing the ideas of your
problem?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#34" name="34">34</a>. Add randomness</h3>
<p>Consider something you wouldn't otherwise: a random word, WikiPedia
article, or the concept of randomness itself. Go to a museum, or a
store. Whatever you find, relate it to your problem. What could it
mean?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#35" name="35">35</a>. Talk it through</h3>
<p>Have a conversation with someone. Or imagine a conversation with
someone. Or have a conversation with yourself. Explain everything
you're thinking about.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#36" name="36">36</a>. Decompose/Recompose</h3>
<p>What are the words and ideas that you're using? Are they cliché? Are
they appropriate? What if you broke down the way you're understanding
the problem and rebuilt it? Can you articulate the problem and
solution spaces?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#37" name="37">37</a>. Get feedback</h3>
<p>Get an outside view on your problem and your work on it. Try to
solicit feedback that helps you see things you aren't otherwise
seeing.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#38" name="38">38</a>. Learn more</h3>
<p>You may not know enough to solve your problem, and you may not even
know what it is that you don't know. Keep learning! Be curious about
topics near and far. Read and study for pleasure.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#39" name="39">39</a>. Ask for help</h3>
<p>Other people can help you a lot. Put effort into finding the right
place and way to ask, and others will often put effort into helping
you.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#40" name="40">40</a>. Break it up</h3>
<p>Sometimes you can break big problems into many more manageable steps.
It may even be possible for multiple people to work on separate parts.
Regardless, pursue and celebrate partial progress.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#41" name="41">41</a>. Use inversion</h3>
<p>How might you achieve the opposite of your goal? Are there other
reversals or inversions that might be illuminating? What's the worst
case outcome? Can you avoid it?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#42" name="42">42</a>. Make a list</h3>
<p>Generate lots of ideas. What are all the options? Consider more
possibilities. What else could you make a list of?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#43" name="43">43</a>. Eliminate possibilities</h3>
<p>What can you rule out? What hasn't worked already? What's impossible?
What has to be wrong? Why is that? What are the constraints? What can
you learn from what doesn't work?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#44" name="44">44</a>. Work backward</h3>
<p>Assume you have a solution. How would it come to be? What would
immediately lead to it? Can you follow steps backward from the end?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#45" name="45">45</a>. Consider special cases</h3>
<p>Are there some specific forms of the problem that are more tractable
or help with understanding? Can you extend a method based on these?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#46" name="46">46</a>. Consider extremes</h3>
<p>What if something in your problem disappeared, or was huge? What if
the problem itself was much worse, or more minor?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#47" name="47">47</a>. Add a constraint</h3>
<p>Add a deadline for something. Can you come up with ten ideas in ten
minutes? What if you have to be done today? What if your techniques or
resources were limited? What if you couldn't use a tool you're
currently using?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#48" name="48">48</a>. Simplify</h3>
<p>In what ways could a complicated problem be made less so? What does
simplifying it mean? Can you solve the simpler problem? If so, is that
good enough, or is there a way to build on the solution?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#49" name="49">49</a>. Generalize</h3>
<p>Can you make your problem a special case of some other problem? Can
you solve that problem? Maybe a general-purpose tool or approach can
be used or adapted for your problem.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#50" name="50">50</a>. Change the goal</h3>
<p>Maybe you don't need to solve exactly the problem you started with.
What's most important? Can you focus on that? Can you compromise to
find something that you can make progress on?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>

<p>Google is the <a href="https://www.smartinsights.com/search-engine-marketing/search-engine-statistics/">most widely-used search engine</a> in the world, and the company now offers hundreds of other services and products on top of search-based advertising. Personally, I think Google has done a great job improving search over the past two decades, but we are reaching a point where Google’s interests are colliding with offering honest search results to users.</p>
<h2 id="googles-competing-services">Google’s Competing Services</h2>
<p>All the way back in 2012, Yelp’s IPO statement cited Google as both its <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/399831-yelp-has-a-google-problem">biggest asset for gaining new users as well as its biggest competitor</a>. Because the site was the largest local business review site when it went public, it gathered much of its traffic from users who use Google to search for nearby businesses - especially those without a website or strong social media presence.</p>
<p>Since Yelp launched, Google has released its own competing review aggregator, which means that if Google wanted, they could force their results to the top of the list every time. This could effectively <em>kill</em> Yelp’s ability to get new users, and raises a lot of questions about Google’s monopoly on search and its effect on internet businesses.</p>
<h2 id="smart-phones-and-search-engines">Smart Phones and Search Engines</h2>
<p>A more recent frontier in the fight against Google is on smart phones. In 2020, the Justice Department <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-monopolist-google-violating-antitrust-laws">brought a lawsuit against the search giant</a> accusing them of “anticompetitive and exclusionary practices,” related to the pressure they allegedly put on phone makers to default to their search engine.</p>
<p>Because Google owns one of the two biggest mobile operating systesm (Android), they have a lot of power to push users towards their search engine. It’s possible that this latest lawsuit could result in a large judgment against the company. A similar lawsuit <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/eu-fines-google-51b-for-abuse-of-power">filed in the European Union in 2018</a> led Google to change the way it bundles apps on Android phones.</p>
<h2 id="the-wiki-model-for-search">The Wiki Model for Search</h2>
<p>As Google’s intentions to integrate search with its own services more deeply has become clear, and I’ve been considering what a non profit search engine might look like.</p>
<p>A great model to look at for guidance is <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>, the non-profit internet encyclopedia. Could having a crowdsourced, community-funded non-profit search engine be the way to save search engines from becoming cogs in a corporate advertising machine?</p>
<h3 id="spinning-off-a-not-for-profit-search-engine">Spinning Off a Not For Profit Search Engine</h3>
<p>Realistically, it’s not likely that a new competitor will be able to enter the search engine market and make any impact on Google’s market share. But, the US Justice Department or EU could split the company up.</p>
<p>For example, they could break Google up into multiple companies like they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System">did to the telephone companies in the 1980s</a>, or Google search could be turned into a public utility. This is <a href="https://www.project-disco.org/competition/030819-antitrust-in-60-seconds-public-utility-regulation/">how electric companies became publicly supported infrastructure</a>, so it’s not impossible that it could happen again.</p>
<h3 id="how-would-a-non-profit-search-engine-work">How Would a Non Profit Search Engine Work?</h3>
<p>Essentially, a non-profit search engine would allow users to drive improvements to the algorithm by reporting bad results or collaborating on improvements.</p>
<p>I would envision a core team with many contributors - much like open-source projects hosted on Github. While the basic functionality (crawling, link-tracking, etc.) would be the same as a search engine like Google, an impartial not for profit search engine could sidestep privacy pitfalls like Google’s <a href="http://searchengineland.com/googles-results-get-more-personal-with-search-plus-your-world-107285">SPYW</a> and the aforementioned Yelp problem.</p>
<p>Of course, there is room for abuse in this system as well, but there are numerous improvements to be had in a publicly visible model like this.</p>
<h2 id="the-best-option-today">The Best Option Today</h2>
<p>The closest thing we have today is <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>, which is closed-source and for-profit, but does not store personal data. This gives users some of the privacy-focused features that a non profit search engine might provide, but doesn’t answer the potential for abuse or eventual monopoly.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OkT1Ljn.png" alt="DuckDuckGo search engine"></p>
<p>Earlier this year, I spent 3 months exclusively using DuckDuckGo as my search engine of choice. As a programmer, it was really challenging though. Google’s results have lots of context about my browsing behaviors, but DuckDuckGo doesn’t, so it takes a little massaging to get the results you might expect.</p>
<p>That said, DuckDuckGo did much better for non-technical search queries. For example, “watch Breaking Bad” takes you to a list of places you can watch the TV show “Breaking Bad.” The results are similar enough to Google’s that you probably wouldn’t notice the difference.</p>
<p>What do you think? Should there be a major player in the search engine market that is not for profit? Is it even necessary? Let me hear your thoughts on <a href="https://twitter.com/KarlLHughes">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>There’s an important trade-off you need to make in order to be more creative: you need to be willing to <em>feel</em> less productive.</p>



<p>I say “feel” instead of “be” because productivity can be a really subjective and delusive game.</p>



<p>Even though efficiency freaks like to measure everything, what usually determines whether they were productive or not is their expectations. And those tend to be very high.</p>



<p>You should definitely work on adjusting your expectations about productivity. But, in the meantime, the best thing you can do is learn how to deal with unproductive guilt.</p>



<p>Because being more creative inevitably requires engaging in “unproductive” behaviors. Like sleeping, going for a walk (without your phone) or meditating.</p>



<p>Creativity is an unconscious and organic process. A great deal of the action happens behind the scenes. And like nature, it works on its own schedule.</p>



<p>You can foster and nurture creativity. But you can’t rush it.</p>



<p>Your mind needs time and space to chew experiences and information, process them, and make novel, interesting connections.</p>



<p>“Productive” people call it procrastination. For creatives, it is the making of a new idea.</p>

<p>
The boss needed item 3 inserted into a numbered list of hundreds of items.
The intern used a mouse to select the original 3 on the screen,
then typed 4,
then selected the original 4,
then typed 5,
then scrolled down,
then selected the original 5,
then typed 6,
and so on.
Another intern sat watching the screen to make sure there were no mistakes.
</p>
<p>
I happened to be in the room for other reasons.
I remember the horror of watching the beginning of this barbaric editing process.
Those poor interns!
</p>
<p>
When I enter a list of items into the computer,
what I'm typing doesn't look like
</p>
<pre>     1. ...
     2. ...
     3. ...
</pre>
<p>
but more like
</p>
<pre>     * ...
     * ...
     * ...
</pre>
<p>
Each asterisk is a special command to the computer,
telling the computer to automatically display the next number for the reader.
The reader eventually sees
</p>
<pre>     1. ...
     2. ...
     3. ...
</pre>
<p>
but that isn't what I typed.
This small difference produces a tremendous savings of time
whenever I insert an item, or delete an item, or move an item.
</p>
<p>
If I decide later
to skip the numbers
and use bullets instead,
I tell the computer
to introduce each list item with a bullet.
This is one command covering the whole list.
There's also a command that does the same thing
for the whole document.
There isn't separate work for each item.
It's no problem if a coauthor
later wants to change bullets back to numbers.
</p>
<p>
The interns, I suppose,
would be manually changing "1." and "2." and "3."
and so on to "•" and "•" and "•" and so on.
Or maybe they would be trying to figure out
how some search-and-replace feature could do the same thing;
let's hope the document doesn't have a sentence somewhere
that talks about something that happened in the year 2001.
Or maybe the interns would be quitting and finding a better job.
</p>
<p>
[Note added 2020.12.07:
I was expecting that many of my readers
would already be accustomed to relying on the computer
for automatic numbering.
I was surprised, however,
to see some comments along the lines of "Inconceivable!"
from readers unable to imagine
how the interns could have been in a different situation,
going through such a shockingly inefficient revision process.
Here's a hint:
Each item in the list looked like a flush-left paragraph,
like the paragraphs in this blog post,
adjacent to the left margin.
The text being selected by the mouse,
for example to change "3" to "4",
was to the right of the margin,
like the rest of the text in each item.]
</p>
<p>
<b>Abstraction as a time-saver for authors.</b>
This use of asterisks
is just one example of how I'm often typing something more abstract
than what's seen by the ultimate reader.
I don't type "Figure 12" or "see [41]", for example;
I type things like "Figure \ref{network-measurements}" and "see \cite{multiplication-survey}",
and I let the computer automatically convert
"\ref{network-measurements}" and "\cite{multiplication-survey}"
into numbers to display for the reader.
</p>
<p>
With one extra command,
covering the entire document,
I can tell the computer
to include section numbers
as part of all figure numbers in the document,
so that the figures are easier for the reader to find:
e.g., Figures 3.1 and 3.2 and 3.3 are in Section 3.
With another command,
again covering the entire document,
I can tell the computer
to cite all authors by name rather than by number.
</p>
<p>
As another example,
I was recently editing a mathematical paper,
and I decided that a particular concept
would be easier for the reader to remember
if I changed the notation that I was using for the concept.
The notation was all over the paper,
but this change took just a few seconds of editing.
I had given a name to the concept,
had told the computer <i>once</i> to display this name as a particular notation,
and had then typed this name throughout the paper,
so there was only one place where I had to change the notation.
</p>
<p>
Of course one can't,
and shouldn't try to,
prepare in advance for <i>every</i> possible change to a document.
But it's not hard to prepare for the most likely changes.
This small initial effort
saves a tremendous amount of time later.
When I say "small",
I'm including the effort to select a document-creation system
that's designed to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">make this sort of thing easy</a>.
</p>
<p>
(As a side note,
programmers will recognize this strategy
as an example of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information%5Fhiding">information hiding</a>
strategy introduced by Parnas,
and will recognize that modern program-creation systems
are designed to make this easy.)
</p>
<p>
Microsoft Word isn't completely missing abstractions,
but these abstractions
are competing for user-interface resources
against features encouraging the user
to work at lower abstraction layers.
The extra effort to use the abstractions
ends up pushing users into doing something simpler,
something that just works now,
and paying heavily for this choice
later when the document is being revised.
</p>
<p>
Have I done a scientific study
<i>proving</i> that Microsoft Word
is less efficient than LaTeX?
No.
I'd love to see a careful study of this topic.
Short-term,
this would help guide new authors to make sensible choices.
Longer-term,
insights from this sort of study could be the basis for further improving
our document-creation systems.
I certainly don't think that the existing systems are perfect.
(<a href="https://cr.yp.to/writing/visual.html">Example.</a>)
</p>
<p>
Imagine, however, that a study looks only at
<i>the time for someone looking at a printout to create a document matching this printout</i>.
This would be blind to the time for subsequent edits.
This would be blind to the suffering of those interns.
This would incorrectly conclude that typing
"1. ... 2. ... 3. ..." and "see [41]"
is more efficient than typing
"* ... * ... * ..." and "see \cite{multiplication-survey}".
It <i>is</i> slightly more efficient in this limited metric,
but it is much less efficient in the metric that matters,
namely the total time spent by the user.
</p>
<p>
<b>An example of a "scientific" study.</b>
At this point you're probably thinking that
nobody could possibly miss such an obvious issue.
This brings me to the main topic of this blog post,
a 2014 peer-reviewed study
<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0115069">"An Efficiency Comparison of Document Preparation Systems Used in Academic Research and Development"</a>
by two psychologists,
Knauff and Nejasmic ("KN").
</p>
<p>
Participants in the study were given a page of text
and were given a limited time to type the page into the computer.
There were three different types of text:
</p>
<ul>
<li>simple prose with a few footnotes;
</li>
<li>a page with a complicated table of data;
and
</li>
<li>a page with many mathematical formulas.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Participants were scored
on the basis of how much text they typed and how accurately they typed it.
The time was so rushed that a significant fraction of participants
didn't finish typing the whole page,
even for the case of simple prose.
</p>
<p>
The study considered two document-creation systems:
LaTeX and Microsoft Word,
in each case with "all tools, editors, plug-ins, and add-ons"
that participants were "accustomed to using".
Of course different "add-ons" could have different efficiency,
and of course there are other document-creation systems,
but these are topics for another blog post.
</p>
<p>
The study produced many pages of results,
which I'll summarize by saying that
Word did slightly better on the prose
and much better on the table,
while LaTeX did better on the formulas.
The study authors made no effort to measure any subsequent document-editing step.
</p>
<p>
<b>Slithering from one metric to another.</b>
The fundamental mistake in the KN paper
is the change of cost metric.
</p>
<p>
The original question was how efficiently authors are creating documents:
in particular, how efficiently authors are creating academic research papers.
KN claimed in their title to be comparing "efficiency"
of "document preparation systems used in academic research".
But they then quietly changed this metric in three ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
They considered only the efficiency of an initial fragment of the document-creation process,
ignoring the time spent revising documents.
They provided no reason to believe that the efficiency of this fragment
was well correlated with what they had previously claimed to be measuring.
Nothing in their paper acknowledges
the most obvious reason for a negative correlation,
namely that slightly more work at the outset
makes revisions much easier later.
In my experience,
document-creation systems vary in how well they support this work.
</li>
<li>
KN didn't even measure the time taken for this initial fragment of the process.
Instead they imposed a rushed time limit,
and measured how incomplete and inaccurate the resulting document was.
Again they provided no reason to believe that what they measured
was well correlated with what they had previously claimed to be measuring.
Perhaps they were assuming that more mistakes will take more time to fix,
but my experience is that some types of mistakes are much easier to fix than others,
and that document-creation systems vary in the types of mistakes they encourage.
</li>
<li>
KN didn't even measure creating a <i>new</i> document,
which is what academics are actually spending their time doing.
People who were writing papers in the age of typewriters
will remember writing and editing papers <i>by hand</i>
before tediously typing the final pages,
but that was because editing a typed page
ranged from annoying
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correction%5Ffluid">white-out</a>,
or sometimes scissors and tape)
to super-annoying
(retyping the whole page).
Today the initial writing on paper is skipped,
and typing is interleaved in small chunks
with parts of the author's thought process,
making the typing process much less boring.
I'm continually re-reading
and thinking about what I just typed.
Is the error rate of the academic's modern typing process
well correlated with the error rate of the
archaic retyping process that KN measured?
Again KN provide no reason to believe this.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Did KN use the honest title
"A comparison of the unreliability of
rushed retyping of a page
using document preparation systems
that are also used for academic research and development"?
No.
Would you expect a journal to accept a paper
with such a title?
</p>
<p>
Instead they used a title …</p></div>

December 6, 2020 | https://liuliu.me/eyes/on-designing-deep-learning-library-api-in-swift/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://liuliu.me/eyes/on-designing-deep-learning-library-api-in-swift/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From the onset of implementing <a href="https://libnnc.org/">libnnc</a>, it meant to be a common ground for higher-level language bindings beyond Python. The underlying architecture has been stable for a year or so, and I have been using it for some personal projects for a while. But the raw C interface is not the easiest to use, it is the time to implement some high-level language bindings for that library.</p>

<p>The default high-level language for deep learning likely would be Python. However, I am not happy with how it performs on a typical many-core system even with things that are supposed to help. Swift, on the other hand, has no issues with saturating my many-core system and it has a reasonable <a href="https://github.com/pvieito/PythonKit">Python binding</a> to tap into the rich Python tool-kits. Not to mention the <em>calling C functions from Swift</em> path is as easy as you possibly can get.</p>

<p>This conviction resulted <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/s4nnc">s4nnc</a>, a Swift language binding for <a href="https://libnnc.org/">libnnc</a>. Because <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/s4nnc">s4nnc</a> is a pure interface to interact with the underlying deep learning library. I paid close attention to its API design. Below are some design notes around why it is, and how Swift as a language fares on such a task. If you want to read the introduction to s4nnc, feel free to visit the <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/s4nnc">GitHub homepage</a>.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-deep-learning-library-api">What is a Deep Learning Library API</h3>

<p>A good deep learning API to me, can be largely modeled after <a href="https://keras.io/">Keras</a> and <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a>. It concerns, above all, with 2 questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>How to specify a deep learning model?</li>
  <li>How to construct a training loop?</li>
</ol>

<p>Everything else is nice-to-have and largely orthogonal to these two questions (but these whistles-and-bells are a lot of hard work!).</p>

<p>A training loop consists of a repeated sequence of operations to: evaluate a model, compute gradients against the loss, apply gradients to update model parameters.</p>

<p>The details can be flexible: you could evaluate one part of the model in one round, and another part in another round; you could have different losses for different model outputs each round; you could modify the gradients, scale them, truncate them to whatever you liked; and you could apply gradients to update different model parameters with different optimizers. But at the core, I didn’t see much changes for this 3-step throughout many model training code.</p>

<p>What constitutes a model can be more interesting, but it seems we converged to a concept where a model consists of some inputs, some outputs, and some parameters. Particularly, parameters are stateful and internals to the model itself. Go beyond that, a model could have different inputs / outputs and different input / output shapes during the training loop. However, the shapes and number of parameters during the training are likely to be constant.</p>

<h3 id="basic-data-types">Basic Data Types</h3>

<p>A deep learning library operates on multi-dimensional arrays (or tensors). In Swift, a concrete tensor can be represented as a value type like <code>Array</code> itself in Swift. That means the <code>Tensor</code> type would need things such as copy-on-write to implement said value-type semantics. Extra attention needs to be paid to make sure throughout the implementation of the API, no unnecessary copy was made. This value-type choice is a bigger deal than it sounds (it sounds like a no-brainer given <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/swift">S4TF</a> made exactly the same choice) because in Python, everything is a reference type.</p>

<p>This becomes more interesting when deciding whether <a href="https://libnnc.org/tech/nnc-dy/">tensor variables</a> could be value types or not. Tensor variable is an abstract tensor type which you can compute gradients (has a <code>grad</code> property). It is bound to a computation graph, and can be the parameter to update during the training loop. While it is possible to make many functions associated with tensor variables taking <code>inout</code> parameters and marking some of tensor variables’ functions as <code>mutating</code>, the more hairy part is about updates during the training loop.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html">PyTorch</a>, an optimizer takes a list of parameters and then applies new gradients to update these parameters when <code>step()</code> method is called. This is possible because parameters are reference types in Python. Any updates to the parameters will be reflected to the model who holds these parameters. This is not possible if tensor variables are value types. In Swift, you cannot hold a reference to a value type.</p>

<p>Thus, practically, tensor variables have to be implemented as reference types in Swift.</p>

<p>Despite my best intention, it turns out most of the objects, including <code>Graph</code>, <code>Model</code>, <code>StreamContext</code> are still implemented as reference types. It is possible for some of them (for example: the <code>Model</code>) to be value types. The lack of <code>deinit</code> in <code>struct</code> requires us to wrap a reference type inside a value type to create such API. At the end of day, I don’t see much of the value from API aesthetics or performance-wise to make these value types.</p>

<h3 id="automatic-differentiation">Automatic Differentiation</h3>

<p>While Swift has <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/differentiable-programming-for-gradient-based-machine-learning/42147">a proposal for automatic differentiation</a>, the automatic differentiation right now is implemented at library level and only applicable to models and tensor variables.</p>

<p>On the API side, it is popular to have a <code>backward()</code> method on the final loss variable. The said method will compute gradients against all variables associated with the final computation of the loss.</p>

<p>This also means we need to keep track of all variables in the computation graph, unless some point is reached and we can free them. In PyTorch, such point is when the <code>step()</code> method is called.</p>

<p><a href="https://libnnc.org/tech/nnc-dy/#optimizations">libnnc early on made the decision to avoid holding vast amount of memory by default</a>. That resulted in the interface <code>backward(to tensors: Sequence&lt;Tensor&gt;)</code> where you have to specify to which tensors you compute the gradients against. Because we are doing backward-mode AD, we still compute gradients on all variables up until these tensors. But we don’t compute gradients against variables passed that point. In effect, we can rely on reference-counting to free memory associated with tensors beyond that point.</p>

<p>In return for this a bit more complex interface, you don’t have to worry about scoping to <code>no_grad</code> to avoid unbounded memory allocations.</p>

<h3 id="optimizers-in-the-training-loop">Optimizers in the Training Loop</h3>

<p>An optimizer in a deep learning library represents a particular gradient descent method associated with some parameters to update each round.</p>

<p>One particular challenge is about how to use multiple optimizers with different parameters in one round. While for simpler cases, you could call <code>step()</code> many times in one round. It may be more efficient to call <code>step()</code> once.</p>

<p>Swift makes this particular choice easier by supporting extensions on built-in types.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre><span>public</span> <span>extension</span> <span>Collection</span> <span>where</span> <span>Element</span><span>:</span> <span>Optimizer</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>func</span> <span>step</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is a good starting point to support more concise updates such as: <code>[adam1, adam2].step()</code>.</p>

<p>The same pattern can be applied if you want to support gradients with multiple losses: <code>[loss1, loss2, loss3].backward(to: x)</code>.</p>

<p>These extension methods are conditional, and type-safe in Swift.</p>

<h3 id="operators">Operators</h3>

<p>While Swift allows operator overloading and the ability to introduce custom operators, somehow the ambiguity of <code>*</code> is not addressed. We cannot have consistency with Python because <code>@</code> cannot be overloaded in Swift language. I have to resort to <code>.*</code> and <code>.+</code> for element-wise multiplications and additions.</p>

<h3 id="type-safe-functions">Type-safe Functions</h3>

<p>While Swift can enforce some type consistency, without more language level changes, we cannot deduce shapes, and would still encounter runtime errors if shape doesn’t match. Even with language-level support, we may still need an escape-hatch because some tensors could be loaded from IO. Not to mention it would be nice to support dynamic input shapes to a model while it can still statically compute its parameter shapes.</p>

<h3 id="transparent-multi-gpu-data-parallel-training">Transparent Multi-GPU Data Parallel Training</h3>

<p>One thing annoying in the raw C interface, is the transition from one GPU to multi-GPU, even with simple data-parallel models. Unable to abstract tensor to higher-level in C makes the code unnecessarily complex.</p>

<p>Fortunately, with basic generics, this is not a problem in Swift. However, to use such generics turns out to be more complicated than I expected on the library author side. If I want to avoid runtime type-check (<code>is</code> / <code>as</code> keyword), there are quite a bit of protocol / extension type dance I would need to do. This doesn’t help with Swift’s borderline hostility against protocol-associated types. Luckily, there are <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/improving-the-ui-of-generics/22814/">new proposals</a> to lift some of the restrictions (and no, <code>some</code> is not all it needs). You can see <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/s4nnc/blob/main/nnc/Functional.swift#L3">this monstrosity here</a>. At the end, I have to introduce <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/s4nnc/blob/main/nnc/Optimizer.swift#L125">some</a> <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/s4nnc/blob/main/nnc/ModelBuilder.swift#L65">runtime</a> <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/s4nnc/blob/main/nnc/Store.swift#L31">type-checks</a> to keep my sanity.</p>

<h3 id="closing-words">Closing Words</h3>

<p>I am pretty happy with the end result of <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/s4nnc">s4nnc</a>. It is small, versatile and does exactly what I set out to: an ergonomics win from the raw C interface. Generics, type-safety and reference-counting in Swift the language really made a difference in the API ergonomics. The language itself is not the fastest, but has a good balance in ergonomics, expressivity and performance. In the next blog post, I am going to detail the Swift data science workflow I had, and why we moved to this from the initial Python one. Stay tuned!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the last decade, we’ve basically been taught to deride “solutionism” — while Silicon Valley techbros were bending their genius toward figuring out ways to sell more ads or lower taxi drivers’ wages, inequality was running rampant and parents were struggling to feed their kids. Instead of trusting wizardry to solve the world’s problems, we were supposed to place our faith in politics, in mass action, and in cultural change.</p>

  <p>Except then consider what happened with COVID. Our leaders failed to fight the virus effectively, and the President actively sabotaged containment efforts. Culturally, we screeched our heads off about masks and herd immunity and “just the flu” and beach parties and school closings and bar closings and restaurant closings and dorm closings and so on and so forth. We didn’t implement strict lockdowns and we protested against lockdowns and we didn’t even obey the half-assed lockdowns we did implement. We became one of the planet’s worst-hit countries, despite having the planet’s most expensive health care system. We died in the red states, we died in the blue states. We died in droves, in hundreds of thousands. Collectively, as a society, we wrung our hands and ran in circles and screeched and died and screeched and died and screeched and died until scientists made vaccines against the virus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is this correct? In some ways, Smith stacks the deck in his favor. Scientific breakthroughs on vaccines can be produced by small groups of experts insulated from public pressure and the clown show of 21st century American politics. This was never the case with non-pharmaceutical interventions, even if I share Smith’s sense out of outrage and horror over America’s failed response to COVID.</p>

<p>Comparing them is a little akin to comparing World War II’s military-technical research achievements to the great campaigns of Europe and the Pacific War. The latter required extensive political and organizational coordination on a hitherto unprecedented scale, and buy-in from millions of ordinary people. The former were not exactly a bunch of eggheads in a seminar room, but they represent at least crudely processes that are largely autonomous from the need to attain large-scale consensus and cooperation.</p>

<p>Come next year, when we enter into the challenge of rolling out vaccines while preserving basic social distancing measures, we will get a reminder of how different these two kinds of activities are. I’m more optimistic that next year will be significantly better than 2020 was, but only guardedly. However, Smith is also on to something larger when he notes the dubious framing of how the answer to engineering our way to nirvana is supposed to be large-scale political and cultural change driven by mass popular mobilization.</p>

<p>‘Political solution’ in this framing seems to be a euphemism for either a deliberative process that harmonizes competing views or (more often) the imposition of one’s will on the body politic via political struggle. Neither look particularly promising in a polarized society in which merely putting on a piece of cloth held together with string has become a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/25/republicans-democrats-move-even-further-apart-in-coronavirus-concerns/">partisan issue</a>. Moreover, Smith <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-10-17/california-is-back-on-the-brink-of-being-a-failed-state">observes elsewhere</a> that even in my home state of California – where GOP opposition has been virtually eradicated – single-party dominance has failed to resolve basic governance issues.</p>

<p>Certainly most thoughtful critics of techno-determinism likely will say that they aren’t categorically against the use of technology, but rather criticize a particular mindset that uncritically postulates that objective solutions can be discovered to objectively framed problems and then objectively implemented and accepted by a mostly cooperative public. However, it is hard to tell if they are talking about the technologists or themselves when they make this criticism. Statements like “if only we had the political will” to do something of interest are just as naive as “if only we had the right app.”</p>

<p>Technologists are often criticized for wanting to ‘route around’ the US political system, but <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/22/key-findings-about-americans-declining-trust-in-government-and-each-other/">given</a> low institutional trust and increasingly low interpersonal trust, it is difficult to be entirely critical of that desire. The biggest problem with it is that it often devolves into fantasies of taking one’s toys and exiting into an autonomous space free of the need to gain mass consensus (seasteading!) or instituting impersonal mechanisms that suppress political resistance (make the AI president!) There are idiots. Look around. But we’re all idiots in some shape or form and we’re stuck with each other. What do we do next?</p>

<p>First, somewhat of a meta-point: indirection often is a very underrated way of creating change. Part of what this post is looking to encourage is something I sometimes refer to as the “Andrew Marshall style” of change. For decades, Marshall headed up the Office of Net Assessment (ONA) within the United States Department of Defense. Most people interested in defense and strategy, including yours truly, have in some way directly or indirectly benefited from ONA and its projects. But Marshall did so largely below the radar.</p>

<p>Demanding only autonomy, a tiny (by Pentagon standards) budget, a small office, and the freedom to report directly to the Secretary of Defense, Marshall at first glance took a rather counter-intuitive approach. But this was actually critical to his success. He was not a threat to other people’s bureaucratic rice bowls. But he preserved his own autonomy. And by slowly building up a network of relationships and becoming a hub for innovative work, ONA ended up exercising a profound influence on American national security and defense.</p>

<p>What is remarkable about Marshall’s success is that he propagated his particular institutional relationships forward through decades of changing political, economic, and bureaucratic turmoil while slowly altering the surrounding environment around him. It would be ridiculous to assert that Marshall is singularly responsible for any particular major shift in American national security and defense, but it is also very evident that ONA’s presence and persistence changed the boundary conditions of the US defense and security system.</p>

<p>While many technologists often valorize another Cold War American defense icon – John Boyd – Marshall is also a model worth emulating. Technology is complicated, frustrating, and more often than not disappointing relative to our ambitions. But it can change the boundary conditions of problems. Tweaking the boundary conditions of problems is a big part of how meaningful change can happen overall.</p>

<p>Getting 2-3 promising vaccines in under a year is a great example. Vaccines do not change the massive amount of political and institutional failures America has experienced since the COVID-19 outbreak began. However, consider the alternative world without vaccines that we were in only a short time ago. We had all of those problems but without any kind of roadmap as to how we might escape them. Now we have a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlieporterfield/2020/11/15/heres-when-experts-say-things-could-get-back-to-back-to-normal-after-coronavirus/?sh=3f66c9d936ed">hazy but nonetheless meaningful</a> idea of how long it could take to get back to normal, even if there is no really coherent shared idea of ‘normality.’ This is worth celebrating!</p>

<p>Even without a vaccine, we would be much worse off than we are now if everything from the physical network backbone to distributed work solutions did not perform well under significant stress. The Internet, also created originally in part for the purpose of scientific collaboration, enabled scientific researchers around the world to work together at breakneck speed to learn as much as possible about a novel virus and figure out how to attack it. Outside of the US and most <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/lessons-from-taiwans-experience-with-covid-19/">successfully in Taiwan</a>, governments have also found success in working together with the private sector to manage information flows during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Beyond COVID, what might this mean? Even in the best of times, the <a href="https://texaspolitics.utexas.edu/archive/html/bur/features/0303_02/muddling.html">most</a> we can often accomplish on the most intractable social problems is to <a href="https://texaspolitics.utexas.edu/archive/html/bur/features/0303_02/muddling.html">muddle through</a>. They have <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01405730">no inherent point</a> at which they officially stop being problems, and often no inherently correct shared framing. It doesn’t mean that action is pointless, but true students of politics often understand that politics is a secular activity instead of a means of bringing about religious salvation.</p>

<p>It seems unwise to stake our hopes on some kind of decisive reckoning at which political solutions will somehow materialize and then be imposed on our friends, neighbors, and co-workers. Much for the same reason that many of us find that we cannot get even members of our own family to take sensible COVID precautions no matter how much we plead, cajole, and threaten them. Still, we have also seen what happens when we simply stand still and do nothing.</p>

<p>“Techno-scientific” changes in the surrounding environment can do a number of salient things. They can provide tools we did not have before to mitigate problems. They can subtly influence or even shift the dynamics of particular interpersonal and institutional relationships and interactions. New frontiers to explore can distract people that otherwise would make trouble, and a bigger pie can make people feel more generous than they otherwise would be. While much has been made of the costs of technological disruption, breaking up established social hierarchies can be necessary for the system as a whole to survive and grow.</p>

<p>Preventing stasis and injecting more slack into the system are both means to the same end: propagating the system forward into the future. So technological “solutionism” (a term I have always disliked due to its imprecision), is both more and less important than ever. It certainly falls short of the hopes of its biggest boosters and the fears of its opponents. But if you are a technologist looking to make a difference now is as good of a …</p></div></div>

                        <p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775=""><img src="https://www.morningstar.co.uk/static/UploadManager/Assets/13697.png" alt="Graphic design of a labourer surrounded by commidites" width="1802" height="1200"></p>
<p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775="">"The new normal" has become part of our lexicon this year, in all areas of life.&nbsp;</p>
<p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775="">Will it become "normal" to wear masks during flu season? Will companies determine that workers are just as productive from home and fully embrace remote work? Will consumers permanently close the door on shopping at brick-and-mortar stores in favor of ordering groceries and supplies online?</p>
<p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775="">To investigate the means through which these shifts could happen—and the likelihood that they will—we identified three main ways the coronavirus could shape the economy long after the pandemic has subsided:</p>
<ul data-v-e8029e64="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775="">
<li data-v-e8029e64="" data-v-03c6dd16=""><strong><span data-v-76f3ace6="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-e8029e64="">Habits</span>&nbsp;</strong>could evolve, causing lasting change in consumer behaviour. As an example of the impact of habits, consider the rise of recycling in the United States over the past several decades. This shift was due in part to the advent of Earth Day in 1970 and the nationwide campaign encouraging Americans to "reduce, reuse, recycle."&nbsp;<a tabindex="0" href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2018-07/documents/2015_smm_msw_factsheet_07242018_fnl_508_002.pdf" data-v-55c87dd6="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-e8029e64="">The Environmental Protection Agency</a>&nbsp;reported that 34.7% of municipal solid waste was recycled in 2015, as compared with 6.6% in 1970.</li>
<li data-v-e8029e64="" data-v-03c6dd16=""><strong><span data-v-76f3ace6="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-e8029e64="">Fear</span>&nbsp;</strong>can make consumers reluctant to engage in certain activities—in this case, fear of the next pandemic (including a COVID-19 resurgence).&nbsp;An instance where fear led to consumer shifts is when research in the 1960s demonstrated the health risks of smoking cigarettes. This led to a permanent reduction in cigarette sales—approximately 42% of U.S. adults smoked in 1964, compared with approximately 19% in 2011.</li>
<li data-v-e8029e64="" data-v-03c6dd16=""><strong>Sunk costs</strong>, or costs that have already been incurred and cannot be recouped, could change the long-term plans of consumers and firms. A classic example of sunk costs is the Concorde. British and French manufacturers poured such exorbitant sums into developing the aircraft in the 1950s and 1960s that the jet never became profitable over the decades it was commercially available. (This was such a notorious incident that the sunk-cost fallacy is sometimes&nbsp;<a tabindex="0" href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-03909-005" data-v-55c87dd6="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-e8029e64="">also referred to as the Concorde fallacy</a>.)<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775="">We explored these three avenues to try to understand what the world could be like after COVID-19. To get a sense of how they've taken shape in the past, and what this could mean for the present moment, we considered five historical events that we believe are comparable to the COVID-19 pandemic:</p>
<ul data-v-e8029e64="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775="">
<li data-v-e8029e64="" data-v-03c6dd16="">World War II and rationing</li>
<li data-v-e8029e64="" data-v-03c6dd16="">World War II and female labor force participation</li>
<li data-v-e8029e64="" data-v-03c6dd16="">The oil price shock of the 1970s</li>
<li data-v-e8029e64="" data-v-03c6dd16="">9/11 and air travel</li>
<li data-v-e8029e64="" data-v-03c6dd16="">Pandemics of recent history</li>
</ul>
<div data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775=""><p>We analyzed the overall impact of each of these events on long-term economic behaviour, and gauged whether habits, fear, and sunk costs fundamentally changed the way people and businesses acted in their aftermath.</p><p><strong><span data-v-76f3ace6="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-4387a7d2="">What Plays the Biggest Role in Changing Consumer Behaviour?</span></strong><br data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16="">There are&nbsp;<a tabindex="0" href="https://www.morningstar.com/features/how-covid-changed-consumer-behaviors-and-company-valuations" data-v-55c87dd6="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-4387a7d2="">three key themes</a>&nbsp;that we think could affect the post-pandemic world: 1) the increase in&nbsp;<a tabindex="0" href="https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1004353/office-real-estate-isnt-going-away" data-v-55c87dd6="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-4387a7d2="">working from home</a>; 2) the future of industries that were severely hit by social distancing concerns during the pandemic, such as&nbsp;<a tabindex="0" href="https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1003630/consumer-behavior-changes-reshape-restaurant-industry" data-v-55c87dd6="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-4387a7d2="">dine-in restaurants</a>,&nbsp;<a tabindex="0" href="https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1002480/travel-and-leisure-companies-ready-as-americans-venture-out-again" data-v-55c87dd6="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-4387a7d2="">air travel</a>, hospitality, and large events; and 3) increased adoption of e-commerce and other digital services.</p><p>The exhibit below maps out how we think each of these themes will be influenced by habits, fear, and sunk costs.</p></div>
<p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775=""><img src="https://www.morningstar.co.uk/static/UploadManager/Assets/Avenues%20for%20change%208.PNG" alt="Avenues for Change" width="1136" height="619"></p>

<div data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775=""><p><span>Habits have evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of social distancing concerns, as many people have cut back on normal activities such as eating at restaurants, traveling by air, attending large events, and shopping at physical stores.</span></p><p><span>Will this short-term shift in habits lead to long-term changes in consumer behaviour? Companies and industries impacted by this reduction in demand are&nbsp;</span><a tabindex="0" href="https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1003476/33-undervalued-stocks-for-the-fourth-quarter" data-v-55c87dd6="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-4387a7d2="">underperforming in the market</a><span>, implying that investors think it will.</span></p><p><span>Many of the industries shaped by changes in habits are the same ones that could be impacted by fear of the next pandemic or a COVID-19 resurgence. It's difficult to predict how this fear will shape consumer behaviour—especially once an effective vaccine is developed and distributed—but awareness around the possibility of another pandemic may linger in people's minds. While the odds that anyone will continue to avoid eating in a restaurant because of that risk seem low, it's possible that fear may remain around the largest and densest kinds of social gatherings (such as public transit or air travel).</span></p><p><span>There's also the matter of sunk costs, which are probably the least intuitive and least discussed of the three concepts. Essentially, the pandemic has forced consumers and firms to incur costs they otherwise would not have; for instance, purchasing home office equipment to facilitate remote working. Once the pandemic is over, the impetus for the purchase decision will have disappeared, but people will still have the home office equipment, so working from home will continue to be marginally more attractive.</span></p><p><span>Sunk costs can also come in other, nonmonetary forms, like time. Consider that the surge in working from home has required extensive time on the part of managers, as they've needed to craft work-from-home capabilities, such as drawing up policies and learning the best ways to communicate with remote workers. This may not have been considered a valuable use of their time before the pandemic, but now that firms have been forced to incur this cost, the issue is no longer relevant, and the necessary work-from-home systems are in place.</span></p><p><span>Similarly, consumers also have limited amounts of time. When people turned to shopping online instead of at brick-and-mortar stores because of social distancing, previously reluctant consumers acclimated themselves to e-commerce out of necessity. Now that they've gotten more comfortable with shopping online, they might continue to do so out of convenience long after the pandemic.</span></p><p><strong><span data-v-76f3ace6="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-4387a7d2="">How Do Extreme Shocks Drive Long-Term Economic Behaviour?</span></strong><br data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16=""><span>To better understand how the world might look different after COVID-19, we used these three concepts in our analysis of the five analogous historical episodes that had a significant short-term impact on consumer behaviour.</span></p><p><span>The exhibit below maps out the degree to which each of these episodes led to fundamental long-term changes in economic behaviour, based on these three means.</span></p></div>
<p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775=""><span><img src="https://www.morningstar.co.uk/static/UploadManager/Assets/Avenues%20for%20change%208%201.PNG" alt="Five Case Studies" width="1141" height="539"></span></p>
<p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775=""><span><span>Altogether, our analysis of these historical episodes indicates that there's, at best, modest support for the idea that COVID-19 will affect long-term consumer habits.</span><p><span>Each of these shocks had some impact on short-term consumer behaviour, but more often than not, habits eventually reverted to more closely resemble previous behaviours and fear subsided sooner or later. Though each episode was unique, we note that sunk costs were the means through which a longer-term impact most frequently occurred.</span></p><p><strong><span data-v-76f3ace6="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-4387a7d2="">The Economic Impact of Food Rationing During World War II</span></strong><br data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16=""><span>Residents of the United Kingdom were subject to rationing of some combination of petrol, meat, fish, cheese, and more between 1939 and 1954. The island nation imports approximately 70% of its food and was therefore exposed to massive supply-chain disruption as a result of World War II. The rationing continued after the war as the U.K. redistributed food and resources to war-devastated countries under British control.</span></p><p><span>Did this period of deprivation have a lasting impact on consumer behaviour? The fact that it lasted for so long makes the possibility of permanent change seem more likely.</span></p><p><span>The exhibit below shows the sharp negative impact that rationing had on the demand for key food items. At their respective troughs, per capita meat consumption declined as much as 32%, fat (butter, margarine, and others) 21%, sugar 35%, and eggs 64%.</span></p></span></p>
<p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775=""><span><span><img src="https://www.morningstar.co.uk/static/UploadManager/Assets/Avenues%20for%20change%208%202.PNG" alt="U.K. Rationing" width="1142" height="741"></span></span></p>

<p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775=""><span><span>However, Britons clearly didn't get accustomed to these austere eating habits. Food consumption rebounded in the early 1950s as rationing was relaxed, and by the mid-1950s, consumption of meat, fat, sugar, and eggs was far in excess of prewar levels.</span><p><span>Therefore, wartime rationing didn't have a noticeable long-term economic impact; in general, our analysis shows that demand for rationed goods fully recovered after the war.</span></p><p><strong><span data-v-76f3ace6="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-4387a7d2="">Did World War II Advance the Rise of Women in the Workforce?</span></strong><br data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16=""><span>Also during World War II, the number of men off at war and wartime production needs led to a spike in the number of women working outside the home. These catalysts didn't last—the men came home, and those elevated wartime production levels died down—but did this episode play a role in the continued rise of women in the workforce?</span></p><p><span>Habit may have played a role in this shift as both women and their families became more accustomed to their working. Sunk costs also had some importance as firms needed to experiment with employing more women—and, by all accounts, this experiment was successful in terms of productivity.</span></p><p><span>But overall, we believe the movement toward greater female labor force participation during the war had only a modest impact on the long-term trend. The fact is that female labor participation in the U.S. was already on the rise, and the 1940s hardly stand out in terms of the trend's longer-term adoption.</span></p><p><span>The exhibit below shows that the increase during the 1940s tracks with that of other decades—about 6 percentage points, right in line with the average decade from 1930 to 1990.</span></p></span></p>

<p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775="">One could argue that the fast growth in the decades after the 1940s was jump-started by the war, but we think other factors were more important. For instance, economists have proposed the importance of:</p>

December 6, 2020 | https://luminousmen.com/post/remote-aws-certification-exam | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://luminousmen.com/post/remote-aws-certification-exam">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>In this post, I will talk about my experience with AWS certification for Solution Architect Associate and how I prepared for it.</p>
<p>AWS certification allows the developer to confirm his qualification and skills in working with AWS services. And the preparation process itself provides additional experience in working with AWS services. But besides all of this, you also get knowledge about architectural patterns that can be applied anywhere else, how solutions are built in the cloud, their limitations and problems.</p>
<hr>
<p>Documentation and videos on the AWS services pages are certainly not a bad start, but to prepare for the exam it would be very good to have experience in the cloud and system knowledge. But it is not necessary — you can catch up on online courses.</p>
<p>I personally started with "<a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/">AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate 2020</a>" from "A Cloud Guru". I passed it on Udemy, but there are other platforms, including their <a href="https://acloudguru.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02">own website</a>.</p>
<p>The course was quite good. I liked the combination of theoretical materials and practical tasks where you could get your hands dirty. I had some professional experience using AWS, so I already knew and saw many things but the course easily fills in the blanks for services that I didn't use.</p>
<p>Also, within the course, there are many links to additional resources and best practices from AWS itself. They are definitely worth taking a look. And at the end there a several exam tests with the questions from the previous year's exams. Going through them gives me an idea of what format of questions I will get at the exam.</p>
<p>However, after all the lectures and exercises, the course will probably not be enough to gain a passing score on the exam. So, in addition, closer to the exam to consolidate and systematized my knowledge, I took a short course from <a href="https://www.aws.training/Details/Curriculum?id=20685">Amazon Exam Readiness: AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate</a>. It is free and does its job well.</p>
<p>It seemed inefficient to review all the courses again in the next step. Instead, I tried to find more exam questions with detailed explanations. I found a collection of close to exam questions on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/draft/1520628/">Udemy</a>. This course is no longer accepting enrollments for some reason, but you easily can find similar ones.</p>
<p>Each question is explained in detail with an explanation of the correct options and links to the AWS documentation. Going forward, I will say that the questions are really close to the ones you can get in a real exam.</p>
<p>I spent a long time with those tests, but in the end, I began to gain more than 70%. In the process, I solved each of them twice. On average, it took me an hour and a half to perform a test and then two or three more hours to analyze it. But it was worth it to do it. I got confidence and an understanding of the logic of the questions.</p>
<h3>AWS online exam</h3>
<h4>Before the exam</h4>
<p>You can take the exam yourself either at a certified center or at home online (Pearson VUE app). Due to the fact that no other certification center close to me worked on weekends, I decided to take the exam at home.</p>
<p>The exam takes 140 minutes and consists of 65 questions. Most often you need to pick one option out of four, although there are two options out of four or two options out of six. The questions are mostly very large and describe a typical scenario for choosing the right solutions from the AWS world. A passing score of 72%.</p>
<p>The cost of certification is $150 (and for $20 you can get a trial online version).</p>
<p>There are detailed requirements and guidelines for taking the exam. Everything is quite reasonable. You need a laptop or PC with an Internet connection and a web camera. Test the connection and speed in advance. There should not be any notes, devices or any other turned on screens (even headphones cannot be used!) near you for the exam. If possible, the windows should be shut off. No one should enter the room where the exam is taken for the duration of the exam, the door must be closed. During the exam, you should look at the monitor so that there are no complaints from the examiner. You will not be able to go to the toilet or have a snack during the exam.</p>
<p>To pass the test you will need to install a special app that allows the examiner to monitor the screen, camera, and sound when taking the test. I advise you to install it in advance.</p>
<p>All this information is available before the test at <a href="http://pearsonvue.com/">pearsonvue.com</a>.</p>
<h4>Starting the exam</h4>
<p>Frankly speaking, I could not start the exam for the first time — the examiner (in terms of Pearson Vue is called a "proctor") for the first time did not appear after I waited for about an hour. Judging by the feedback on Reddit, this happens quite often, so be prepared for it. After I wrote a letter to support I was allowed to reschedule the exam.</p>
<p>On the day of the exam, 15 minutes before the appointed time, I opened the Pearson Vue application and started to fill in the necessary fields. To confirm your identity, you must take a photo of your driver's license or passport. What is interesting, you can take a photo either on the phone or on the web. More for the sake of interest, I chose the option to take pictures with a camera on the phone. After a couple of seconds, I received a link in SMS. Following the prompts, I took the picture of my license and then the pictures of the room on the four sides. After the final confirmation on the phone, a couple of seconds later the screen on the laptop changed, saying that everything is ready for the exam.</p>
<p>After about five minutes the examiner wrote to me in a chat and then called me. Before the beginning, I was asked to remove the documents from the table because there should be nothing left on the table and then asked to spin a laptop camera. I suppose — to make sure that everything in the room corresponds to the photos received earlier. I received a wish of luck and the exam started.</p>
<h4>During the exam</h4>
<p>The interface with questions was unusual at first, but then I got involved in the process and no longer paid attention to the appearance. I'm a little screwed up with the timing — I spend too much time reading and thinking about the first half of the questions. I was hurrying through the second half, sometimes I did not even finish reading the question to make it to the end.</p>
<h4>Happy ending</h4>
<p>After more than two hours of intense thinking, you could finally relax. The examiner did not connect to me anymore — the exam ended by itself. In the end, you can see the most important thing — have you passed or have not passed the exam. This happens automatically. But the number of points comes in a couple of days.</p>
<p>A couple of days later I received a nice letter "Congratulations, You are Now AWS Certified".</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Solutions Architect Associate is a relatively simple certification, which gives an overview of AWS and small technical knowledge of the most important topics. It can be passed even by people who have little to do with IT and being a programmer is certainly not a requirement.</p>
<p>But the next step — Solutions Architect Professional — is a challenge even for people with good AWS experience.</p>
<p>Many people are attracted by an increase in salary after obtaining certificates. My salary has not been affected in any way.</p>
<p>It is not a big deal to have a certificate. What people really look at is the experience and successful projects. Certification by itself does not cover many aspects that are related to real tasks. Sophisticated VPC, deployment of env through CloudFormation, ECS/EKS, VPN /Direct connect, etc...</p>
<p>But I'll repeat this is a nice addition to the resume and adds knowledge about architectural patterns, how solutions are built in the cloud, their limitations and problems.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>November 19, 2020<!-- --> • ☕️ 7 min read</p></header><p>In the <a href="https://blog.mushino.com/market-making-101:-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">last section</a> of this series we covered the very basics of market making.</p><p>We covered the fundamentals that make market making a viable strategy and introduced the adverse selection problem.   </p><p>In this article we will explore some simple ways to deal with the adverse selection problem.</p><p>Quick recap from the previous article: Adverse selection is what happens when someone is more informed than you. It’s how you end up losing money as a market maker. If you were to do a very naive market making strategy, where you simply copy the best bid and the best ask from the order book, and quote those prices yourself, you would end up losing a lot of money.</p><h2 id="the-steamroller-analogy"><a href="#the-steamroller-analogy" aria-label="the steamroller analogy permalink"></a>The steamroller analogy</h2><p>Market making is often described as “picking up pennies in front of a steamroller”. This is a surprisingly accurate analogy.</p><p>The steamroller is the market. You have no way of knowing where it’s going. It might be stationary for a while, while it’s doing its work, and then suddenly take off in one direction. If you get run over by the steamroller, you might lose a leg or two.  </p><p>The steamroller is surrounded by a huge pile of pennies. Anyone can pick up these pennies - but in order to pick them up, you must two basic rules.</p><figure>

  </figure><h2 id="the-first-rule"><a href="#the-first-rule" aria-label="the first rule permalink"></a>The first rule</h2><ul><li>Before picking up any pennies, you must purchase a ticket from the ticket seller.</li></ul><p>Why? Because picking up pennies isn’t free. The steamroller is serviced by a company, and this company requires money to run.</p><p>You can think of the company as your broker or exchange. Your broker doesn’t control the market, but they require you to commit a certain amount of capital to participate in the market. This is like buying a ticket. Once you have successfully picked up your pennies, you’ll show your ticket at the exit, and get the money that you committed back. If you get run over by the steamroller, you’ll lose your ticket, and in turn, the money that you committed.</p><p>The amount of pennies you can pick up is directly correlated to the amount of capital that you commit. If you purchase the cheapest ticket, you’ll only be able to pick up a single penny. If you purchase the most expensive one, you’ll be able to pick up 100 pennies.</p><p>The more expensive the ticket, the more you can profit, and the more you can lose.   </p><p>In practice, the amount of capital to commit will be guided by money management formulas such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Kelly Criterion</a>.</p><p>Professional market makers have been run over by the steamroller many times. They know their approximate chance of getting away in time, and will size their positions based on that. In a future article, we will cover position sizing in more detail.</p><figure>

  </figure><p>Now for the second rule:</p><h2 id="the-second-rule"><a href="#the-second-rule" aria-label="the second rule permalink"></a>The second rule</h2><ul><li>Before picking up your pennies, you must patiently wait for it to be your turn.</li></ul><p>Market making is a very competitive space. You are not the only market maker out there. There are plenty of other people that also want to pick up free pennies.</p><p>The queue to pick up pennies is a basic FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue. The earlier you get there, the sooner you get to pick up pennies.</p><figure>

  </figure><h2 id="insiders"><a href="#insiders" aria-label="insiders permalink"></a>Insiders</h2><p>Now let’s imagine that you purchased a ticket, stood in line for a while, picked up some pennies and got your capital back.</p><p>0.001% return. Everything good.</p><p>Just repeat the process a few million times, until you are rich. Preferably by having some automated algorithm do the work for you.</p><p>Sounds good, right?</p><p>Not so fast. If you just pick up your pennies blindly, without paying attention to your surroundings, there’s a good chance that you will get run over too often, and will end up losing all your money.</p><p>Why? Because some of the other people in the queue are insiders. These guys happen to know the guy driving the steamroller. The guy in the steamroller will pick up his phone and call them just before he decides to push the accelerator:</p><p><em>“Hey friends, I’m about to take off, leave the queue and get the fuck out if you don’t wanna get run over.”</em></p><p>The insiders will then abandon the queue and leave everyone else behind. Other people in the queue will naturally start following suit, as they think to themselves:</p><p><em>“Why are all these guys leaving the queue? Could they be insiders? I better leave as well.”</em></p><p>Some of them will make it out in time, and others won’t.</p><p>This is the adverse selection problem at play. Some people are simply more informed than others, and will have an edge based on that.  </p><p>You can’t be an insider yourself (if you could, you wouldn’t be reading this article), but you can use the changes in your surroundings to your advantage.</p><figure>

  </figure><h2 id="queue-positioning"><a href="#queue-positioning" aria-label="queue positioning permalink"></a>Queue positioning</h2><p>If you’re waiting to pick up the pennies, you MUST pay attention to the queue. If a huge amount of people are leaving the queue, you should probably leave as well.</p><p>There will always be some natural churn (people that get tired of waiting, or people that need to pee), but if half the people are leaving, there’s a good chance that something is up.  </p><p>Furthermore, you must pay attention your position in the queue. Some positions are more advantageous than others.</p><p>If you’re in a very advantageous position, you want to be very careful about leaving.</p><p>An example of a very advantageous position is when the queue is super long, and you are in the front-most 20 percent. You want to have a very good reason for abandoning a queue position like that (e.g. half of the people behind you leaving).  </p><h2 id="getting-ahead-in-the-queue"><a href="#getting-ahead-in-the-queue" aria-label="getting ahead in the queue permalink"></a>Getting ahead in the queue</h2><p>Let’s imagine that you are at the back of the queue, together with your friend, and that you guys want to get to the front fast.</p><p>What can you do?</p><p>If your friend is willing to cooperate, you might be able to play a few tricks.</p><p>Your friend will give up his position in queue. This will make other people nervous. They’ll start asking themselves: “Why is this guy leaving? Is he an insider?” Some of them might even leave.</p><p>This trick works best when your friend has bought a very expensive ticket. People will think: “Why is this whale leaving? Surely there must be something up?”</p><p>If executed correctly, this trick can net you several positions. It comes at the expense of your friend, who now has to rejoin the queue. Because of that, you only want to do it when both of you are at the back of the queue (and have nothing to lose, in terms of queue positioning).</p><figure>

And then run like crazy.</p><p>If the next person in the queue is not paying attention, and hasn’t realized that the steamroller has started rolling yet, he will run towards the penny and try to pick it up.

  </figure><p>The trading analogy to this is to place an Immediate-Or-Cancel order at the price your limit order got filled. If you got a bid filled, the order will need to be a SELL order. If it was an ask, it will need to be a BUY order.</p><p>The idea is to cancel out your newly opened position before the price level breaks. This way you won’t suffer any losses (except for the taker fees you pay on your Immediate-Or-Cancel order). The guy who suffers losses will be the guy who was behind you in the queue. This is called “scratching” a trade.</p><p>Scratching only works if there are people behind you in the queue (i.e. on the same price level as you) that are not paying attention.</p><p>But let’s be real - people tend to get a bit lazy while standing in queues for long periods of time. If the queue is long, there is a good chance that at least some of the people there are not paying attention. Maybe they are daydreaming, maybe they are talking to their friend, maybe they are looking the other way. This is your opportunity to cut your losses and avoid getting rolled over.   </p><p>Scratching comes at a cost. You pay expensive taker fees to get your order filled quickly. Unless your taker fees are zero, you don’t wanna do it too often.</p><h2 id="tracking-your-queue-position"><a href="#tracking-your-queue-position" aria-label="tracking your queue position permalink"></a>Tracking your queue position</h2><p>Until now we have assumed that you always know your exact position in the queue. This is not an accurate assumption.

All the pro market makers have their own queue tracking systems - which they dedicate a lot of resources to. Building one is not trivial - you will need to record every market event (people entering the queue, people leaving the queue, people getting filled), and chain these events together.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>"I don't think that this could ever create something that I wouldn't mute" </p><p><em>- Voxel, laying down the hard truths about music generation in general and my music generator in specific</em></p></blockquote><p>In groovelet32.exe, I’d like for the art assets to be capable of wiggling and booping in time with the music. </p><p>That’s seemingly simple sounding, but that simple idea contains, uh, <em>multitudes</em>.</p><p>This can be accomplished in one of a few different ways: </p><ol><li><p>Buy, commission, or write music, transcribe the music whole into the execution environment and play the music with locally available music generation tools (Tone.js in JavaScript, Helm or wwise in Unity) </p></li><li><p>Buy, commission, or write music, transcribe important moments in written music into software language, have instrument hits trigger effects.</p></li><li><p>Buy, commission, or write music, use automated analysis (Koreographer in Unity) to guess when dynamics are occcuring in the music and use those to trigger effects.</p></li><li><p>Buy, commission, or write music, output music as midi, play music while using midi engine to drive effects. </p></li><li><p>Generate music entirely in place, have instrument hits directly trigger effects.</p></li></ol><p>Each strategy has its ups and downs. Notably, the first four strategies start with the simple-sounding but imposing “buy, commission, or write music”. Buying music - well, it’s hard to build a whole game around stock music - especially if music is as fundamental to the experience as it should be in a game about musical robots. </p><p>Commissioning music is simply too expensive, if I’m planning on paying my composer fairly (which I would be, if I had any money).</p><p>Writing music on my own would imply a strong upgrade in my own personal music production skills, because currently I’m operating at somewhere near the “Three Blind Mice” level. A number of my family members are talented musically - my younger brother married into a “music teacher” family - but I don’t think any of them have ever cracked open a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation">DAW</a>, and they’re pretty busy with their own lives, so that’s a hard tree to shake and expect that video-game ready tunes will fall out.</p><p>So that leaves me with <strong>procedurally generated music</strong>. It’s perhaps naive to think that I, a person who can’t even write a regular song, could build a computer that could write music for me, but hey - if I’m good at anything¹ , it’s programming.</p><h2>A Basic Architecture for Procgen Music</h2><p>Some time back, I watched this inspiring JSConf talk: </p><p id="youtube2-_0ij8vY2gzE" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;_0ij8vY2gzE&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_0ij8vY2gzE?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></p><p><em>so cool</em></p><p><strong>tl;dr</strong> “we built a tool called <a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/js-announce">Magenta.js</a> that allows you to tensorflow up some tunes”</p><p>I like tensorflow! I like tunes!</p><p>Setting upon the task with some zeal I managed to get Magenta.js generating tunes, slowly. I had a simple plan for how I would take slowly-generated 8-second tunes and convert them into longer songs:</p><ol><li><p>Have a background server process generate 8-second three-part-tune clips</p></li><li><p>Use some basic heuristics to guess at the key signature (“C# major”) of the clips, evaluate their intensity (lots of drum hits? loads of notes?) and save them in a huge clip database.</p></li><li><p>Create a search interface for the clip database.</p></li><li><p>Have the client request clips from the server in a specific key and intensity.</p></li><li><p>Weave two or three clips together, repeating them a couple of times, to make a full “song”.</p></li><li><p>Add tools to control the requested key signature, intensity, and change instrument, tempo, and what-have-you at the last second.</p></li><li><p>Take the output and make it sound like real human music that people would listen to on purpose.</p></li></ol><p>Now, there are some definite problems with this scheme. One of them is <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/">Tone.js</a> - an unbelievably powerful synth workbench written for people who have read<a href="http://msp.ucsd.edu/techniques/latest/book-html/"> the entire book on Digital Signal Processing</a>, and <em>no other people</em>.</p><p>I actually took and passed a senior-level course in DSP for music generation, some 12 years ago. I have less of an excuse than the average person to be absolutely garbage at attaching oscillators to things. I’m still garbage, mind you, I just have less of an excuse.</p><p>Anyways, after some serious effort, I got steps 1-6 working.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca1c57c1-7653-4b87-af3b-44ec32498063_624x749.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca1c57c1-7653-4b87-af3b-44ec32498063_624x749.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ca1c57c1-7653-4b87-af3b-44ec32498063_624x749.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:749,&quot;width&quot;:624,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:41766,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>Look at that! Sliders! Tempo! Intensity! Configurable per-channel instruments and levels! </p><div><p>Here’s the first song that ever sounded remotely passable, produced by the system.</p><p>It’s… <em>okay</em>, right? Not <em>bad</em>. That’s where the system was a year ago.</p></div><p>Here’s another song from just a few days ago: </p><div><p>Admittedly, I haven’t been working on the procgen engine for that entire year, but it hasn’t evolved much in the interim, huh?</p><p>I figured I might be able to shape the musicality of the output with simple heuristic rules and adjustments and embellishments, but - I can’t. An extremely talented musician/producer might be able to, but as we’ve established, I’m worse at finding C than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCr91EwGGxk">the salty pirates of landlocked Saskatchewan</a>. </p></div><p>Most of my clever changes would make the output sound better… some of the time. And worse, some of the time. Sometimes, rarely, the system produces something that, if you weren’t paying a terrible lot of attention, you might confuse for real music. A lot of the time it produces something bland and amusical. About as often it produces something <em>actively unpleasant</em>.</p><p>One idea I’ve had is building an underlying voting system to try to clear “bad” tunes out of the system - if my music generation system is actually powered by a thousand clips that sound pretty good under most any circumstances because all of the ones that sound bad have been downvoted out of existence, well, that’s one way of doing things.</p><p>But even at it’s best, the output isn’t… terribly good. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa2c453a-e28c-4d54-8a6f-02ea23b50ff9_534x577.webp"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa2c453a-e28c-4d54-8a6f-02ea23b50ff9_534x577.webp" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/aa2c453a-e28c-4d54-8a6f-02ea23b50ff9_534x577.webp&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:577,&quot;width&quot;:534,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:138006,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/webp&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><div><p>And a big part of the problem is just that composing music is <em>hard</em>. If you take the simplest musical style that you can think of, there’s someone online explaining in painful detail that the soundtrack to Fart Chalice IV <em>actually</em> takes advantage of phrygian pentameter and post-modern phrasing to create artificial dissonance between the fourth and sixteenth notes in an alternating jazz-inspired progression.</p><p>I can just <em>barely</em> read music. I can’t deal with that! </p></div><p>There isn’t a simple set of rules for what will sound good when music is involved - people are too different from one another. There are dozens of conflicting sets of rules, and because there are so many ways to break those rules and still have music come out sounding good (or follow the rules and still have music come out sounding bad) a lot of music theory isn’t so much “helpful guidelines” as it is “endless taxonomy”, and most of that taxonomy has been compiled over the last 500 years by mostly Germans and Italians.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3797b22b-8653-4a82-8325-0fd59ade6bf0_960x960.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3797b22b-8653-4a82-8325-0fd59ade6bf0_960x960.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3797b22b-8653-4a82-8325-0fd59ade6bf0_960x960.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:960,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:125325,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p><em>I am literally more afraid of music theory than digital signal processing.</em></p><h2>The Many Flaws of Procedural Generation</h2><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1401d2c0-9c56-43ff-acbd-d29f26cc11c0_331x500.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1401d2c0-9c56-43ff-acbd-d29f26cc11c0_331x500.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1401d2c0-9c56-43ff-acbd-d29f26cc11c0_331x500.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:500,&quot;width&quot;:331,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:41426,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>I love this book.

This part of the project has, I think, failed, and it’s reaching the point where more effort is being met with <em>diminishing returns</em>.</p><div><p>I think I’m going to try a new plan from my list - “buy, commission, or write music, output music as midi, play music while using the midi data to silently drive effects”.</p><p>I’ll probably write some basic drum-loop first-fifteen-minutes-of-the-FruityLoops-tutorial jams to get the project off the ground, and then find someone competent to compose music if I ever feel like the project is within biting distance of actually shipping. </p></div><p>Anyways, Groovelet Music Engine, you’ve got one last chance to shine. Play yourself off! Preferably with something a little sad.</p><h2>A Goodbye From the Groovelet Music Engine</h2><p>… god dammit.</p></div></div>]]>

            I wonder why Java was so respected and JS was not? Why/how was Java already seen as such a stable and mature language? </p><p>   Not just Java, other languages (like python) were also released around/near 95, and also seemed to get to "mature" respect status. much quicker.
            

            

            </p></div>

              </a><p>

            
            I bring all this up because my impression of Java in 98 was that it had been around "forever" (as had C++ first developed in 79, but not standardized until 98!), but that's not. true at all. These were all new languages around the same time.
            

            

            </p></div>

              </a><p>

            
            I'm sure the language designs had different merits, and the target applications meant a different perception and reception, but... </p><p>   it sure seems like the industry (and academics) just decided Java and C++ were the stable mature ones and langs like JS were toys.
            

            

            </p></div>

            





            <div>

              </a><p>

            
            BTW, before you assume JS was nascent/immature b/c the web wasn't much of a thing yet, remember that JS was actually released as LiveScript on the server before it was released in a browser. So "server-side JS" was always part of the story, not just Node 15 years later in 2009.
            

            

            </p></div>

              </a><p>

            
            Why didn't "we" push JS on the server the way Java and C++ were pushed in that space? </p><p>   Why wouldn't a university consider teaching JS alongside Java and C++ (and python), given they were all roughly the same age?
            

            

            </p></div>

            My point is, technologies and ideas don't always win on merits the way we hope/claim. More often than we admit, we just pick winners based on less tangible things like marketing.

                     *Heads-up that this thread will feature some extreme examples of homophobia and transphobia.* </p><p>Hey folks, have you ever wondered why trans people face constant accusations of fetishism, sexual predation and child abuse/grooming? Well, today let's talk about stochastic terrorism.


            

            
            
            
            

            </p><p>
              So, first we have to talk about what stochastic terrorism actually is. Remember when there was a conspiracy that there was a pedophile ring operating out of a pizza parlour basement, and a crazed gunman showed up? It's that sort of incitement that stochastic terrorism describes.
              
              

            


            

            </p><p>
              It's the demonisation or incitement against a group of people or individuals with the intent that other, unaffiliated parties will act upon it; it's the releasing doctored footage and a shooter show up at Planned Parenthood as a direct result of what he's been led to believe.
              
              

            


            

            </p><p>
              So with that in mind, let's talk about Russia's extreme anti-LGBT laws that banned the "promotion" of LGBT lifestyles to children. A move that specifically marked LGBT people as a threat to children, and resulted in neo-nazis meting out vigilante "justice" against gay men.

                     Trump on climate: I don't believe it.  Trump on Khashoggi: I don't believe it. Trump on Russia: I don't believe it.  Idiocy?  A canny game?  Doesn't really matter as much as the underlying intellectual autocracy.  In this administration only one opinion matters.

              It's an assault on facts and reason. It's an assault on good governance. It's an assault on the bureaucracies that are being discounted. It's an assault on science and history.

              We live in a system that is grounded on the idea of collaborative government. Leaders may have a final word but even then, there are typically checks and balances.  Hopefully, in this case, such checks and balances may work.  But they also are being tested.

              The president's position that he is smarter than all the world's scientists, than the entire intelligence community, than experts who have studied any issue all their lives, is, of course, asinine.  But his belief that government turns solely on his opinion, is monarchic.

              Louis XIV reportedly said, "L'etat est moi."  That he was the state.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This blog post is written with purpose of memorizing the process of making my university assignment for bachelor thesis, and I'm making it public in case someone makes use of it for their purposes too.</p>

<p>My assignment was creating keyboard layout and custom characters for TempleOS operating system, and adding a feature for dynamic switching between different keyboards, but before describing the process, some background would be nice.</p>

<p>If you're reading this blog post, you most certainly know about the operating system I work in and its creator, Terry A. Davis, but for those who don't know <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_A._Davis">Wikipedia</a> has most of the stuff not relevant to this blog post covered.</p>

<p>What is important pointing out though is the fact that all the source code and documentation is located in the operating system itself. But to spare you the tedious process of creating virtual machine and installing OS itself, most of the content is located on <a href="https://templeos.holyc.xyz/%22">website</a>.</p>

<p>So, let's get to the process of creating this thing, shall we?</p>

<h2>Making external characters</h2>

<p>Browsing through the OS demos, which can be accessed through <code>Cd("/Demo");</code>, with a little assistance of more experienced TempleOS developers (big shout out to TempleOS Riot community), I discovered a file called <i>ExtChars.HC.Z</i>, which documented the process of creating external characters.</p>

<p>In the example provided by author himself, mr. Davis, he specifically made a smiley character. Upon closer inspection, one can conclude that TempleOS uses bit-per-pixel system, meaning that one 1 represents pixel, and 0 represents nothing. He uses 8x8 bits for drawing characters.</p><p>His character looked like</p>

<code>
    U8 face[8]={<p>
    
    0b00111100,<br>
    0b01000010,<br>
    0b10100101,<br>
    0b10000001,<br>
    0b11000011,<br>
    0b10111101,<br>
    0b01000010,<br>
    0b00111100,</p><p>
    
    };<br>
    text.font[255]=face[0](U64);
</p></code>

<img src="https://viktoracoric.xyz/pix/extchars.png" alt="extChars">

<p>So, we can see that 1s make the shape of smiley face, however upon creating custom character, I noticed that it was inverted on horizontal axis, so I basically just mirrored the rows horizontally, and now I got my external character.</p>

<p>Also, below this array of 8-bit values there is also a part you can notice starting with text.font, so there is some overwriting going on too. And indeed, after opening list of all characters, which can be opened by pressing <i>Ctrl+Alt+A</i>, I discovered the last character, which was just a block (every bit was 1), got overwritten with a smiley face</p>

<p>So, now that we figured out how to make custom characters, I decided to look into how to make custom key combos which would allow us to dynamically switch the keyboards.</p>

<h2>Creating custom key combos</h2>

<p>This process was fairly easy, all it took for me to find this is some digging through /Doc folder, and finding CtrlAltCBSet function, which is located inside <code>/Kernel/KeyDev.HC.Z</code> file. The process of creating custom function is very intuitive and I have no need to describe it, as it is <i>really</i> self-evident, but yeah, I decided to create a function which would print "Hello World" on a Ctrl+Alt+p keypress.</p>

<p>After modifying that file, as with any other file in kernel, recompilation is needed. We do that with <code>BootHDIns;</code>, selecting the drive (C in my case), selecting default value for partition num, pressing p to probe, selecting the number left of your disk (I overlooked this one, so I kept entering Base0 and Base1 values located below the disk), pressing enter til it starts compiling, and that's it. Simple and straightforward process</p>

<p>And that's it, after pressing Ctrl+Alt+p, I got TempleOS to print "Hello World", although in debugger mode, or as the author calls it, raw mode.</p>

<h2>Creating the font file - part 1</h2>

<p>This one took me WAY too long to figure out how it worked, way more than it should've, especially since I figured out how to make external characters.</p>

<p>File we're modifying is located at <code>/Kernel/FontStd.HC.Z</code>. Due to the way characters are written here, it reminded me of actual addresses, which I thought were hardcoded in the operating system itself somewhere. But my hacker spirit was stronger, and I decided to experiment with those "addresses", and I slapped myself in the face when I discovered these were just characters represented in hex value rather than the binary array as described in the ExtChars.HC.Z file mentioned above. So I got myself to manually draw a character on a piece of paper, write it down in binary, convert it to hexadecimal value, and then write it down. Also it's worth noting that I followed "horizontal axis reversed" logic as was described in ExtChars. But this time I found myself surprised, this one was vertically flipped as well, so I mirrored XX pairs of bytes, meaning 0xAABBCC would become 0xCCBBAA.</p>

<p>Upon the recompilation, my character was replaced with the one I created, meaning there was a success.</p>

<h2>Creating the font file - part 2</h2>

<p>I thought to myself, just modifying this file would overwrite actual english keyboard which is default, so making a copy would be wise, so I created FontHr.HC.Z inside /Kernel directory</p>

<p>I renamed sys_font_std array to sys_font_hr, and I modified keys I needed in the last few elements of the array. Now the actual problem was how to include that array into the system, how to make use of it.</p>

<p>This is where <i>the</i> most helpful function in TempleOS helped, and that is Find function, whose syntax goes like <code>F("my search query");</code>.</p>

<img src="https://viktoracoric.xyz/pix/find.png" alt="find">

<p>Pictured above is the example of find. So I went and found where else was sys_font_std located, and I stumbled upon <code>/Kernel/KMain.HC.Z</code> file, but I also realized that alongside earlier seen text.font value, there was also text.aux_font, which was font supporting Cyrillic characters. So I added the text.hr_font=sys_font_hr; line too, but obvious next move is to find text pointer and to create hr_font value.</p>

<p>Again, thanks to great find function built in the OS, I discovered that it was located in <code>KernelA.HH.Z</code> file, so I modified that file too adding the pointer I needed.</p>

<p>All I needed to do next is to create a function similar to already existing function of swapping standard font and Cyrillic font. And so I did, but the operating system didn't compile at that point</p>

<p>The easy solution was to <code>#include FontHr</code> in the file located at <code>Kernel.PRJ.Z</code>, because kernel was being compiled ahead of time, so we had to inform it that the file is there to compile.</p>

<p>After doing all of this, seemingly all is done... Unless...</p>

<h2>Font/Layout problem</h2>

<p>I thought all work was done conceptually, but then the problem arose. Just switching fonts wasn't good enough, since I effectively just replaced values of character Z to character Y (English keyboards start with "qwerty", Croatian keyboards startwith "qwertz"), so when I actually switched fonts, words displayed lost their meaning (e.g. "TempleOS rulz;" would be printed as "TempleOS rulyč") due to fundamentally different layout of keyboards, so I had to switch layouts alongside fonts too.</p>

<p>Layout file was located in <code>/Kernel/SerialDev/Keyboard.HC.Z</code>, and I saw some part included Assembly language, and the other part defined behavior you can expect from keyboards, like how it handles single keypress, reading scan codes, etc.</p>

<p>After literally hours of thinking and experimenting about possible solutions, which included MANY good but sadly failed attempts, some of which wouldn't compile at all due to AOT compilation, I FINALLY discovered the real solution.</p>

<p>I got an idea to split keyboard files into the two, one would contain assembler layout, and the other would contain rest of the functions which defined keyboard behavior.</p>

<p>After doing so, I copied the Keyboard1.HC.Z file, which was assembler part, to another file called KeyboardHr.HC.Z. After doing so, I had to modify MakeSerialDev.HC.Z file located inside <code>/Kernel/SerialDev</code> directory to exclude assembler part. Not splitting the Keyboard.HC.Z file as described above or leaving the assembler part inside makefile would cause conflicts with <code>/Kernel/KeyDev.HC.Z</code> file, which must be #include-d inside Kernel.PRJ.Z file because of inherent contradiction (A must be #include-d before B, and B must be #include-d before A, both at the same time).</p>

<p>After doing that, since I wanted dynamic switching on the keypress, I had to copy one keyboard layout to another's location. I accomplished that by making a copy of main english file, and repurposing main english file to be "main" instead. Then I copied memory blocks from Croatian keyboard layout to the main one using MemCpy function (used as <code>MemCpy(NORMAL_KEY_SCAN_DECODE_TABLE, HR_NORMAL_KEY_SCAN_DECODE_TABLE, 64);</code>. I repeated the process for shift/ctrl memory blocks too. Then I implemented mechanism for MemCpy-ing on a keypress, I named one simple variable which would be binary in nature, and I checked it upon calling the keypress function, then it would go to switch statement and reset its value inside that, alongside MemCpy that happens.</p>

<img src="https://viktoracoric.xyz/pix/function.png" alt="function">

<p>Pictured above is the example of function I described above.</p>

<p>After doing so, I only basically had to #include SerialDev/KeyboardHr and SerialDev/Keyboard before #include-ing KeyDev</p>

<p>And after recompiling and rebooting, I finally had working Croatian keyboard layout and characters, switched dynamically on demand.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>As you can see, the whole process didn't involve much modifying besides the font file, but it was incredibly tough to accomplish these concepts, and my main goal was to go the least against the philosophy of the author (and against God), which in my view I accomplished very well.</p>

<p>In the near future, I plan to release a setup system which would modify and install these files onto default TempleOS installation automatically, but before doing so I have to actually finish the Croatian keyboard til end, since 0.001% features are still missing, and I want it to be 100% perfect.</p>

Its no secret you will find many articles on the web proclaiming how good Golang is, and its always been something I wanted to try out.</p><p>Until now I haven’t really had a use case and I feel its always much better to have a “need” to use something to really evaluate it, or your stuck just running through hello world’s and tutorials where your doing little more than copy/pasting working code.</p><p>The project in question is almost ready for a big reveal, but for the purposes of this article lets just say I needed a binary I could distribute without the surrounding architecture needing a runtime to run the application.</p><p>So that ruled out my two go to languages, PHP and NodeJs/Javascript. And lead me down the Golang or Rust path.</p><p>I will concede I actually attempted to use Rust first. There seems to be even more hype around Rust at present and watching all the conferences around Rust and WebAssembly that are popping up on YouTube I took a stab. As this is a Golang article I won’t delve too deep into Rust, lets just say after half a day I quickly realised if I wanted to get a proof of concept out quickly for this new project Rust was not the language I should be learning on the job for. This is by far not a knock at Rust. It looks really promising, it is probably just a little too far out of my comfort level right now.</p><p>So having wasted a half a day I picked up the Golang handbook and started a project.</p><p>I had run all the samples you can find in the <a href="https://golang.org/doc/tutorial/getting-started">documentation</a> and the <a href="https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1">tour guide</a> multiple times in the past so the core concepts like operators, values, structs etc I had an understanding of already. Packages on the other hand caused me some confusion early on which I’ll delve into further down this article.</p><h2>The Proof Of Concept</h2><p>Building the POC I dumped all my code in the <code>main</code> package. At this point the code was pretty ropey. But it did confirm for me the approach was going to work. I felt pretty at home with writing at least basic code, the syntax is very similar to PHP and javascript. Well to be more specific strongly typed PHP8.0 and Typescript.</p><p>I was getting on quite well with the language and now wanted to refactor the work into something I would be happy to commit to version control.</p><h2>Folder Structure</h2><p>This still irks me a little, it’s almost hard coded into my brain. Code goes into a <code>src</code> folder and is organised by logical groupings. At least this is how I work and is the accepted structure for the languages I use day to day.</p><p>Golang on the other hand has a different recommended structure. Its not a requirement but is recommended so I went with it. Full details can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout">https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout</a></p><p>Im sure there must be a reason that’s inherent in the language or devised by some people smarter than me that makes this a better structure, but at this point I just don’t like it. It may become clearer the more I use Golang but I just feel the separation detaches the domain relationships and functionality. I don’t see why private code should be in a wholly different location when Golang has public exports inherent in the language.</p><h2>Modules</h2><p>This is where I hit my first real hurdle, maybe I didn’t read the docs well enough, or maybe it was just me. But I had a good few hours of frustration with my IDE (Intellij IDEA) shouting at me because it couldn’t find my code. At least part of the problem was my choice to just dump everything in <code>main.go</code>, then migrating to a directory type project, and finally landing on a module structure. I also think I may of been led down a few garden paths reading up on outdated articles.</p><p>I managed to figure it out eventually and it is pretty obvious with hindsight. I haven’t yet been in a position to write a module that’s meant to be consumed externally so i’m cautious of being too critical here. But from my relatively short experience I don’t understand why you can’t use relative imports in internal code?</p><p>The fact only its name is known by a package, but it needs to explicitly define the whole module path to pickup other packages feels a little off to me:</p><div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;go&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-go&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:false,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:false,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;showPanel&quot;:false,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Go&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;go&quot;}">package foobar
  
import (
	"github.com/xxx/xxx/internal/bazzer" // why not just "../bazzer"?
)</pre></div><h2>Dependency Loops</h2><p>Im not sure how common this is, but I had a real hard time when refactoring due to cyclic dependencies on structs. Again mainly my fault and bad design in my proof of concept. If I had started with modules up front I don’t think I would of had this issue. But the good thing that came of this is my understanding of Golang interfaces.</p><p>What I really like about them is their implicit rather than explicit nature (duck typing). When I found out about this it all became clear what I needed to do to resolve my problems.</p><h2>err != nil</h2><p>I don’t think a Golang article is complete without the mention of <code>err != nil</code>. Even before I started I knew about this. I have seen various articles propose how to write better code to prevent the repetition. Something I did pickup along the way was the use of <code>defer</code> which is a pretty neat feature allowing you to something similar to <code>try{}finally</code>. But I would be lying if I didn’t say I would be immensely grateful to see <code>try{}catch</code> make an appearance in Golang.</p><h2>Releasing</h2><p>Building the project was always super simple. I then needed to figure out how I could distribute this for different architecture. By the time I got here I was feeling pretty confident with what I had achieved, my confidence lead me to starting to reinventing a process already handled exceptionally by the <a href="https://goreleaser.com/">Goreleaser</a> and <a href="https://github.com/goreleaser/godownloader">Godownloader</a> projects. These two projects make it super simple to provide access to built copies of your app.</p><p>Which made it very surprising Godownloader seems to be struggling: <a href="https://github.com/goreleaser/godownloader/issues/161">https://github.com/goreleaser/godownloader/issues/161</a></p><p>To me these two packages feel like the composer and npm of the PHP and Javascript world i’m used to.</p><p>They appear to be a critical part of the ecosystem and certainly helped me get to a usable system very quickly.</p><p>In short a simple generated yml file and some CI scripts and I had automated releases available to the project without much customisation required.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>There are definitely some things i’m not used to or fully understand. But i’m still very interested and very happy with what i’ve able to achieve pretty quickly. It has a familiar syntax which no doubt helps and I can’t believe i’ve got to the conclusion without mentioning its SUPER fast. I’ll be talking more about the specific project this was about when its ready for launch. The source code will be open source, so please don’t judge it too harshly. It will be my first Golang project, hopefully one of many.</p><h4>Want to know when I have new content? Enter your email address to be notified when it’s available.</h4></div></div>]]>

<h2>Introduction
</h2>

<p>I often argue that the toughest thing about distributed systems is changing the way you think.  The below is a collection of material I've found useful for motivating these changes.
</p>

<h2>Thought Provokers</h2>

<p>Ramblings that make you think about the way you design.  Not everything can be solved with big servers, databases and transactions.</p>

December 6, 2020 | https://psyche.co/ideas/in-nyaya-philosophy-only-some-debates-are-worth-having | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://psyche.co/ideas/in-nyaya-philosophy-only-some-debates-are-worth-having">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>In premodern India,</strong> debates were entertainment in courtly settings, a sport for profiteers and clever men who enjoyed a quick turn of phrase or put-down. Successful debaters gained followers, fame, even wealth. Those pragmatic aims intertwined with nobler ones: religious believers and nonbelievers debated over deep religious truths. Both inside and outside religious traditions, participants sparred over controversies with significant social implications. Even the efficacy of medical cures was hard-fought in the debate arena.</p>
<p>During the 9th to 10th century CE, VÄ�caspati MiÅ›ra, an Indian philosopher who was part of a Hindu tradition called â€˜NyÄ�yaâ€™ (or â€˜reasonâ€™) argued that debate benefits society when it aims for truth. He thought, too, that debate helps us humans achieve ultimate happiness in our short, fragile and often painful human lives. But if debate has such noble aims, should we care about winning or losing? And if debate leads us to the truth, should we always debate everyone, everywhere? To understand VÄ�caspatiâ€™s answer, we must first understand the NyÄ�ya philosophy of debate.</p>
<p>For NyÄ�ya philosophers, we acquire ultimate happiness by ending the selfâ€™s painful cycle of rebirth, its journey from life to life, always bound to our past actions. Before we can end this cycle, we must rid ourselves of ethical vices. And this requires knowing the truth. This is why, for NyÄ�ya thinkers, a certain kind of debate is important, as it helps us learn the truth. This truth-seeking debate is called â€˜discussionâ€™ (<em>vÄ�da</em>). This required putting forward your own thesis and criticising a contrary thesis through a specific type of inference designed to convince your opponent of the truth. Discussion was hardcore, technical stuff. Still, NyÄ�ya discussion for truth doesnâ€™t use obtuse language. Its goal isnâ€™t rhetorical trickery but making someone know something. If the components of inference are in place, and the thesis presented is true, then your conversation partner would actually come to know the truth. But to work, that inference must have certain necessary components, put together in a particular form.</p>
<p>One component part of NyÄ�ya inference is a reason that both parties agree with. Itâ€™s a fallacy to use controversial or unproven reasons â€“ a fallacy which, if youâ€™re caught out on it, would disqualify you in a debate. VÄ�caspati discusses the example of an argument about the nature of sound based on it not having certain characteristics. But the problem is when the interlocutors donâ€™t agree on whether those characteristics are decisive â€“ just as light can be a wave or a particle, thereâ€™s an open enquiry about what to conclude from the observation. Until the controversy is settled, NyÄ�ya philosophers reject any argument about sound based on these particular features. So when those engaged in a discussion have opposing views, they are to put forward their best evidence in a convincing way. Even while challenging each other, they draw each other in. Bridge-building is, in some sense, built into discussion for the truth.</p>
<p>And agreement wasnâ€™t always easy to come by for Indian thinkers. There was intense disagreement over religious texts foundational for much of societyâ€™s structure, the Vedas. For example, Buddhists rejected these texts and â€“ depending on which scholars you believe â€“ much of the societal structure that came with them. They also interpret ordinary experience differently than NyÄ�ya philosophers. Think thereâ€™s a coffee cup over there? For some Buddhists, that cup is not a cup but a construction of your mind. For others, itâ€™s merely a cluster of atomic bits you call a â€˜cupâ€™. Think you have a self? Not so fast, says the self-denying Buddhist.</p>
<p>Discussion involves two truth-seekers coming together to learn from one another</p>
<p>And yet, despite the chasm between them, we have evidence that Buddhists and NyÄ�ya philosophers debated, in person and through generations of written conversation. So are NyÄ�ya philosophers premodern free-speech absolutists, for whom the desire for unbridled debate is above all else? Is debate for them an almost salvific activity, to be entered into with all comers, at all times? Would they, for instance, agree with the signatories of a recent letter to <em>Harperâ€™s</em> who argue that restricting debate â€˜invariably hurts those who lack powerâ€™ and that the â€˜way to defeat bad ideas is by exposure, argument, and persuasion, not by trying to silence or wish them awayâ€™?</p>
<p><strong>For VÄ�caspati and other</strong> NyÄ�ya philosophers, debate works only under certain conditions. It wonâ€™t always, everywhere, for everyone, result in a turn towards truth. In the background to NyÄ�ya thinking about debate are older texts, such as <em>Carakaâ€™s Compendium</em>, which urges medical experts to consider their own rhetorical and intellectual abilities, the hostility or friendliness of the audience, and the abilities of their interlocutor, before agreeing to a debate. VÄ�caspati adds additional dimensions to this calculus: the ethical stakes and the moral qualities of oneâ€™s conversation partner. And he draws the lines for our dialectic practices by distinguishing between three kinds of debate: discussion (<em>vÄ�da</em>), disputation (<em>jalpa</em>) and wrangling (<em>vitaá¹‡á¸�Ä�</em>). VÄ�caspati used these categories to work out how debateâ€™s practical aims (victory, material gain) are related to its epistemic ones (convincing, truth-seeking).</p>
<p>Discussion involves two truth-seekers coming together to learn from one another. For instance, students and teachers engage in discussion. But sometimes debate participants are focused only on winning, are prideful about their supposed â€˜knowledgeâ€™, arenâ€™t responsive to facts, and are looking for money or fame. VÄ�caspati points out that sometimes debate occurs between such less-than-honest interlocutors in front of powerful people who hold sway over large populations. In India, this was the royal court, where the winner might influence the establishment of a religion by decree. Today, this could include the court of social media, where powerful, Tweet-happy politicians influence society with a click of a mouse.</p>
<p>In his context, VÄ�caspati allows you to stoop to an apparently lower standard of rationality: faced with a powerful person spouting dangerous falsehoods and misleading people who depend on them, you might use fallacies to â€˜refuteâ€™ them. This is the second kind of debate, known as disputation (<em>jalpa</em>). In disputation, whether your argument is genuinely good matters less than its ability to convince the watching judges or crowd. Twist your opponentâ€™s words, read them literally instead of metaphorically, engage in bad reasoning â€“ itâ€™s all fair game in a disputation. Of course, returning fallacy for falsehood might not be a robust way of undermining a lie, but it could convince an easily swayed audience.</p>
<p>Should a virologist agree to a debate with a vaccine sceptic?</p>
<p>You could even engage in a third form of debate, wrangling (<em>vitaá¹‡á¸�Ä�</em>) â€“ putting forward no position, but leaving that aside for the sake of merely knocking down a dangerous person. Wrangling is often condemned as a performative contradiction: one canâ€™t truly lack a position when arguing against someone else. Why would you criticise someoneâ€™s view if you didnâ€™t think the opposite, or something close, were true? Imagine arguing against a flat-Earther, painstakingly showing their fallacious use of science and their cherrypicking of evidence. When they ask: â€˜And what do you think?â€™, you shrug. Youâ€™re just playing devilâ€™s advocate. NyÄ�ya thinkers find this attitude, which they identify in some Buddhists, dubious. A wrangler is a kind of sceptic lacking any intellectual core. Today we might think of trolls, the kind found in the darker corners of the internet, meme-generators who seem to lack any position of their own, having only glee in attacking others.</p>
<p>Taking up either strategy, disputation or wrangling, is risky and could backfire. If a judge identifies your fallacies, you lose the debate. Worse yet, your audience will conclude that your opponent is right. In VÄ�caspatiâ€™s view, when high-stakes debates occur over moral issues, if an audience is swayed, this could damage the correct order of things in a profound way. So when should a truth-seeker engage in debate with an opponent who holds opposing views, views they find morally reprehensible and potentially dangerous? Academics face this situation now and again: should a virologist agree to a debate with a vaccine sceptic? What if that debate were to be held at a local middle school, where the audience is young students without the relevant education to identify bad science? For VÄ�caspati, the answer is that our debate practices depend on our circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>In considering what</strong> to do, VÄ�caspati considers the ethical views of his opponents, worrying about the â€˜collapse of righteousnessâ€™ (<em>dharma-viplava</em>) in the situation where a malicious debater argues in front of powerful people. Yet he doesnâ€™t draw hard-and-fast lines about whom to debate based just on their views. Those people who seem to have no position of their own? Theyâ€™re welcome to join into discussion of the truth, if theyâ€™re genuinely interested in learning. And those people whose views challenge your religious perspective? NyÄ�ya philosophers famously oppose Buddhists who donâ€™t just disagree about abstract metaphysical ideas, but who challenge the religious orthodoxy of the day. And yet, over time, NyÄ�ya thinkers engage with, and even learn from, their opponents.</p>
<p>VÄ�caspati doesnâ€™t offer a flowchart about whom to debate and when. But in prioritising debate for truth, this NyÄ�ya philosopher encourages rational discussion that finds common ground even in intense disagreement. When a conversation partner ceases to participate in the joint project of truth-seeking, playing by different rules, losing any sensitivity to reality, …</p></div></div></div>

              <p>
This is a 5-minute guide to to setup and integrate with FusionAuth. Starting…​ now!
</p>
<section>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>
This guide assumes that you have installed either a MySQL or PostgreSQL database and have a super username and password for the database that is able to create schemas and databases. If you do not have a database installed, follow the instructions in our <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/database/">Database Installation Guide</a> to install a database.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
Here are the steps that we need to take to setup FusionAuth as a login provider (also known as an identity provider) for your application:
</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Install FusionAuth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start FusionAuth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete Maintenance Mode and the Setup Wizard</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create an Application and configure the OAuth settings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copy the OAuth login URL and add it to your application</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grant the user permissions to your application</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write a route (controller, action, etc) in your backend application that completes the login</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Store the user object in the session</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>
These steps are the standard integration with an OAuth identity provider. These also work for OpenID Connect. Since FusionAuth supports both, we’ll use OpenID Connect since it is the modern standard. Let’s get into the details of each step. You can also watch a video of an install:

<h2 id="install-fusionauth">Install FusionAuth</h2>
<p>
FusionAuth is simple to setup on your laptop, desktop or any server. You can also purchase a basic hosting plan on the FusionAuth Cloud platform here: <a href="https://fusionauth.io/pricing">https://fusionauth.io/pricing</a>
</p>
<p>
Our installation guide covers all of the different methods you can use to install FusionAuth including Docker, Homebrew, Debian packages and our quick start script. You can follow any of the methods in the <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/">installation guide here</a>. For this guide, we’ll use the Fast Path installation process using one of the commands below.  You may optionally install Elasticsearch to be used as the user search engine.

</div>
<div>
<p>Install for all users on the system using DEB or RPM packages, requires sudo access</p>
<pre><code><span></span>sh -c "curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-install/master/install.sh | sh"</code></pre>
</div>
<div>

<pre><code><span></span>sh -c "curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-install/master/install.sh | sh -s - -s"</code></pre>
</div>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="windows">Windows</h3>
<div>
<p>Install in your current working directory using ZIP packages</p>
<pre><code><span></span>. { iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-install/master/install.ps1 } | iex; install</code></pre>
</div>
<div>
<p>Install in your current working directory using ZIP packages, include Elasticsearch</p>
<pre><code><span></span>. { iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-install/master/install.ps1 } | iex; install -includeSearch 1</code></pre>
</div>
<p>
Once the Fast Path installer completes, we will see this output on the console:
</p>
<div>
<p>Fast Path install complete</p>
<pre><code><span></span>Downloading zip packages
######################################################################## 100.0%
######################################################################## 100.0%
Installing packages

Install is complete. Time for tacos.

 1. To start FusionAuth run the following command
    /Users/bpontarelli/dev/example/fusionauth/bin/startup.sh

 2. To begin, access FusionAuth by opening a browser to http://localhost:9011

 3. If you're looking for documentation, open your browser and navigate to https://fusionauth.io/docs

Thank you have a nice day.</code></pre>
</div>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="start-fusionauth">Start FusionAuth</h2>
<p>
The next step is to start FusionAuth using the command that the Fast Path installer created. This script is called <code>startup.sh</code> and we can execute it from the installation directory like this:
</p>
<div>
<p>Startup script</p>
<pre><code data-lang="shell script"><span></span>fusionauth/bin/startup.sh</code></pre>
</div>
<p>
This will start both the <code>fusionauth-search</code> and <code>fusionauth-app</code> components, which are both required to use FusionAuth. If you are on Windows, you’ll need to use the <code>startup.bat</code> file instead.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="complete-maintenance-mode-and-the-setup-wizard">Complete Maintenance Mode and the Setup Wizard</h2>
<p>
After we have FusionAuth installed and running, we can open our browser to <a href="http://localhost:9011/">http://localhost:9011</a>. This is the default address for FusionAuth when running locally. This will bring up FusionAuth, which should be sitting in Maintenance Mode and ready to be configured. FusionAuth enters Maintenance Mode any time the database or the Elasticsearch engine is not accessible or is not properly setup. In our case, FusionAuth likely was able to connect to both of these, but neither was ready to be used. Here’s how the Maintenance Mode screen should look:
</p>
<img alt="Maintenance Mode Database" src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/docs/5-minute-setup-guide/maintenance-mode-database.png" width="1200">
<p>
Here we will need to provide the super user credentials for our database along with the name of the host of the database is running on if it isn’t running locally. We can also select between MySQL and PostgreSQL and change the database port if needed. For our example, we will be using PostgreSQL on the standard port with a super username of <code>postgres</code> and a password of <code>password</code>. We can also change the username and password that will be created as the primary database account that FusionAuth will access. The reason that FusionAuth uses a separate username and password to connect to the database during normal operation is that if we encounter a breach of the FusionAuth configuration file and an attacker knows our database username and password, then the attacker will only have access to the FusionAuth database. This is helpful if we are using a single database server for multiple applications and databases. This is known as least privilege and FusionAuth tries to use this principle whenever possible.
</p>
<p>
Once we click the <strong>Submit</strong> button, we will be taken to the next step of Maintenance Mode. If you have opted to install with Elasticsearch, this step is where the FusionAuth Search component is configured, otherwise you can skip ahead to our notes on the Setup Wizard. Our Fast Path install and startup script automatically start the <code>fusionauth-search</code> component, which is a standard version of Elasticsearch. Since FusionAuth is able to connect to this search engine, all that is needed is to create the indexes inside it. This page looks like this:
</p>
<img alt="Maintenance Mode Search" src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/docs/5-minute-setup-guide/maintenance-mode-search.png" width="1200">
<p>
Clicking the <strong>Submit</strong> button here will cause FusionAuth to exit Maintenance Mode and begin starting up. We’ll see an interstitial page that looks like this:
</p>
<img alt="Interstitial" src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/docs/5-minute-setup-guide/interstitial.png" width="1200">
<p>
Once FusionAuth starts up successfully, we will be taken to the Setup Wizard. This is where we will create the administrator account for FusionAuth and accept the license. We can also sign up for the FusionAuth newsletter, which is a great way to stay up-to-date on FusionAuth releases and new features. We never pitch you, hard-sell or sell your information, so feel free to sign up. Here’s what the Setup Wizard page looks like:
</p>
<img alt="Setup Wizard" src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/docs/5-minute-setup-guide/setup-wizard.png" width="1200">
<p>
Clicking <strong>Submit</strong> here will complete the Setup Wizard and log us into the FusionAuth admin UI.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="create-an-application-and-configure-the-oauth-settings">Create an Application and configure the OAuth settings</h2>
<p>
Once we arrive in the FusionAuth admin UI, the first thing we need to do is create an Application. An Application is something that a user can log into. This is the application we are building or that we are migrating to use FusionAuth. We’ll click the <span>Application</span> menu option on the left side of the page or the <strong>Setup</strong> button in the box at the top of the page.
</p>
<img alt="Dashboard to Applications" src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/docs/5-minute-setup-guide/dashboard-applications.png" width="1200">
<p>
This will take us to the listing page for Applications. Next, we’ll click the green plus button (the add button) at the top of the page:
</p>
<img alt="Application Listing" src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/docs/5-minute-setup-guide/application-listing.png" width="1200">
<p>
On the Application form, we’ll need to provide an name for our Application (only used for display purposes) and a couple of items on the OAuth tab. We’ll start with a simple setup that allows existing users to log into your application. Therefore, we won’t need to define any roles or registration configuration. If we click on the OAuth tab, we’ll see these options:
</p>
<img alt="Application Form" src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/docs/5-minute-setup-guide/application-form.png" width="1200">
<p>
Most of the defaults will work, but we also need to provide these items:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An authorized redirect URL. This is the route/controller in our application’s backend that will complete the OAuth workflow. In our example, we set this to <code><a href="http://localhost:3000/oauth-redirect">http://localhost:3000/oauth-redirect</a></code>. We’ll show some Node.js example code below for this route.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optionally, we can specify a valid <span>Logout URL</span>. This is where the user will be redirected to after they are logged out of FusionAuth’s OAuth front-end: our application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to ensure that the Authorization Code grant is selected in the <span>Enabled Grants</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once we have all of this configured, we’ll click the blue <strong>Save</strong> button at the top of the page.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="copy-the-oauth-login-url-and-add-it-to-your-application">Copy the OAuth login URL and add it to your application</h2>
<p>
Once the Application has been created, we’ll be back on the listing page. From here, we can click the green View button for our new Application. This will open a dialog that contains information about the Application, including the full URL for the OAuth login page.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><article><header><div><p><span><time datetime="2020-12-06T17:41:03+01:00">December 6, 2020</time></span>
<span>3-minute read</span></p></div></header><div><p>We all know that we should always close <code>resp.Body</code> in Go. You’re bound to see this snippet in most Go code.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="Go"><span>resp</span>, <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>http</span>.<span>Get</span>(<span>url</span>)
<span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> {
    <span>log</span>.<span>Fatal</span>(<span>err</span>)
}
<span>defer</span> <span>resp</span>.<span>Body</span>.<span>Close</span>()
</code></pre></div><p>I was intrigued by why we really need to do this, for a while now, I’ve known that the reason is that doing so frees up the connection and helps us reuse the connection for other requests internally. But like they say the <strong>detail is in the devil</strong>. I was trying to dig deeper into the <code>net/http</code> package to read and understand more around this. But of course, I deviated quite a bit. I noticed that eventhough I was firing multiple requests wireshark was only reporting 1 (YES ONE) TLS connection.</p><p>So I followed that track. I plan to come back to <code>net/http</code> sooner or later. But for now let’s first talk about HTTP, mostly about <em>Keep Alive</em> means and why it’s important.</p><blockquote><p>HTTP persistent connection, also called HTTP keep-alive, or HTTP connection reuse, is the idea of using a single TCP connection to send and receive multiple HTTP requests/responses, as opposed to opening a new connection for every single request/response pair.</p></blockquote><p>Simply said, instead of creating new connections each time, we reuse the existing connection as much as possible. This is beneficial because we get rid of the time taken for the TCP handshake for each consecutive call.</p><p>This is the base on which HTTP/2 was built and has been the default mode of operation since HTTP 1.1.</p><h2 id="http2">HTTP/2</h2><p>Let’s say we need to make 100 calls to a given domain.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="Go"><span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span>; <span>i</span> &lt; <span>100</span>; <span>i</span><span>++</span> {
    <span>resp</span>, <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>http</span>.<span>Get</span>(<span>url</span>)
    <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> {
        <span>log</span>.<span>Fatal</span>(<span>err</span>)
    }
    
    <span>// Do something with the response here
</span><span></span>
    <span>resp</span>.<span>Body</span>.<span>Close</span>()
}
</code></pre></div><p>So if the server supports HTTP/2, that means we’ll only have a single TLS handshake (i.e. for the first request made) and the rest of the requests use the same connections. This is amazing since, TLS handshake is expensive in terms of latency.</p><p>This is simply confirmed by tracking our TCP connections on wireshark.</p><p><img src="https://nayak.io/gohttp/go_wireshark1.png" alt=""></p><p>I was curious would this still remain the same, if I ran them concurrently, would they still use the same TLS connection?</p><div><pre><code data-lang="Go"><span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span>; <span>i</span> &lt; <span>100</span>; <span>i</span><span>++</span> {
    <span>go</span> <span>func</span>() {
        <span>resp</span>, <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>http</span>.<span>Get</span>(<span>url</span>)
        <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> {
            <span>log</span>.<span>Fatal</span>(<span>err</span>)
        }
        <span>defer</span> <span>resp</span>.<span>Body</span>.<span>Close</span>()
    
        <span>// Do something with the response here
</span><span></span>    } ()
}
</code></pre></div><p>PSSS: Of course I used sync.WaitGroup in my test code.</p><p><img src="https://nayak.io/gohttp/go_wireshark2.png" alt=""></p><p>Seems like the concurrency model in Go is a bit too fast it to detect that there is an existing TLS connection over which we can transmit new requests.</p><p>Also, I did try to amateurishly benchmark them, the concurrency model is much faster!!</p></div></article></section></div></div>]]>

<p>I didn’t coin the term “VSCode girl” but I’m here to teach you how to become one. It’s a lifestyle, a mindset, not a stereotype.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>VSCode girl &gt;&gt; <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=VSCO%20GIRL" target="_blank">VSCO girl</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ve emerged from the <a href="https://support.apple.com/keyboard-service-program-for-mac-notebooks" target="_blank">sticky</a> depths of MacBook butterfly keyboards to oppose our archnemesis, the tech bros.</p>
<h2 id="vscode"><a href="#vscode" aria-label="vscode permalink"></a>VSCode</h2>
<p>In order to be a VSCode Girl, you gotta <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">download VSCode</a> and use it as your main IDE of course. What do you think I’m writing this blog post from?</p>
<p>Here are some extensions I love:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=howardzuo.vscode-favorites" target="_blank">favorites</a>: pin files/folders for easy access</li>
<li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens" target="_blank">GitLens</a>: the best GitHub integration</li>
<li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode" target="_blank">Prettier</a>: make sure you <a href="https://scottsauber.com/2017/06/10/prettier-format-on-save-never-worry-about-formatting-javascript-again/" target="_blank">format on save</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="github"><a href="#github" aria-label="github permalink"></a>GitHub</h2>
<p>Ah yes, the social media platform for brogrammers.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.devrant.com/devrant/rant/r_957017_r4A2p.jpg" alt="meme"></p>
<p>You need to become “the guy she tells me not to worry about”.</p>
<h3 id="repos"><a href="#repos" aria-label="repos permalink"></a>Repos</h3>
<p>Start putting all your coding projects on GitHub. Version control and open source is cool.</p>
<h3 id="pinned"><a href="#pinned" aria-label="pinned permalink"></a>Pinned</h3>
<p>Pin your most starred/forked/favorite repos so that lurkers can see them immediately.</p>
<h3 id="commits"><a href="#commits" aria-label="commits permalink"></a>Commits</h3>
<p>Coding for a school assignment? Great, make that repo private and still commit frequently to it. Definitely turn on private contributions for your activity calendar:</p>

<p>You can keyboard smash as commits for private repos but you should probably have legit commit messages for your public ones.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commit to GitHub more than relationships.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Repeat this mantra over and over again. It’s a central tenet of being a VSCode girl.</p>
<h3 id="profile-readme"><a href="#profile-readme" aria-label="profile readme permalink"></a>Profile README</h3>
<p>Recently, GitHub let users add a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-your-profile-readme" target="_blank">profile README</a> that sits on top of the profile page.</p>
<p>People have gotten <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/build-a-stunning-readme-for-your-github-profile-9b80434fe5d7" target="_blank">real creative</a> with how to utilize this space. I opted for a <a href="https://github.com/karenying" target="_blank">simpler approach</a> but you can really do whatever you want.</p>

<p>If you’re a student, you get GitHub Pro for <a href="https://education.github.com/pack" target="_blank">free</a>.</p>
<p>Do I know what benefits I get for it? No. But does it look cool? Yes.</p>
<h2 id="personalportfolio-site"><a href="#personalportfolio-site" aria-label="personalportfolio site permalink"></a>Personal/Portfolio Site</h2>
<p>Create a personal and/or portfolio site to show off your personality and your projects.</p>
<p>I bought my domain off <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/" target="_blank">GoDaddy</a>, built it with <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html" target="_blank">React</a>, and deployed it for free on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a>.</p>
<p>Some blog posts I wrote to help with this:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.blog.karenying.com/posts/adding-transitions-to-a-react-carousel-with-material-ui" target="_blank">Adding Transitions to a React Carousel with Material-UI</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.blog.karenying.com/posts/nav-bar-with-dots" target="_blank">Simple React Router Nav Bar</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Link your site EVERYWHERE. GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and yes even your Hinge.</p>
<h2 id="hinge"><a href="#hinge" aria-label="hinge permalink"></a>Hinge</h2>
<p>If you thought <a href="https://hinge.co/" target="_blank">Hinge</a> was a dating app … No, it is so much more. For starters, it is THE place to expand your personal brand’s reach. You just gotta tailor your profile towards the average tech bro, slap your personal site link on it, and watch your SEO skyrocket (disclaimer: SEO is a blackbox — no one really knows how it works but I promise you this can’t hurt).</p>
<p>You think I’m kidding? This is the first prompt on my profile:</p>

<p>To trap the tech bros(’ views), you need to mention some other buzzwords on your profile (think: climbing, boba, Elon, Robinhood) and set your location to South Bay.</p>
<p>A side effect, whether you like it or not, is that you’ll receive DMs like such:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What’s your favorite stack? Mine is me on top of you</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ugh gross 🤮 but probably <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack" target="_blank">MERN</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you http? Because me without you is just ://</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pretty clever but are you insecure? Why not HTTPS smh</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is this entire profile just an ad</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you build me a website</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<p>Sure. I charge $100 for an initial consultation and $200/hour after that. <a href="mailto:karenying7@gmail.com" target="_blank">Email me</a></p>
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<blockquote>
<p>if ([REDACTED] === cute) return go_on_date</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Triple equals implies JavaScript which uses camelCase, not 🐍 Boy, bye</p>
<p>But remember, Hinge is not a dating app, it’s merely a stepping stone (where you step on tech bros) for SEO. Do not get distracted.</p>
<h2 id="blog"><a href="#blog" aria-label="blog permalink"></a>Blog</h2>
<p>You can start by writing on <a href="https://medium.com/" target="_blank">Medium</a>. It’s free with low barriers to entry.</p>
<p>If you want to take it to the next level, you can code your own blogging site. This site was bootstrapped with <a href="https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen" target="_blank">Lumen</a>, a lightweight <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/" target="_blank">Gatsby</a> blog starter. It is statically hosted on <a href="http://netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a>.</p>
<h2 id="linkedin"><a href="#linkedin" aria-label="linkedin permalink"></a>LinkedIn</h2>
<p>To have a successful LinkedIn, you need a couple of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A clean semi-professional headshot</li>
<li>A tasteful banner/cover image</li>
<li>A succinct header</li>
<li>Filled out details for every section</li>
</ul>
<p>With these things in hand, pretty soon you’ll have an army of LinkedIn simps. Hint: they’re useful for promoting your blog posts.</p>
<h2 id="twitter"><a href="#twitter" aria-label="twitter permalink"></a>Twitter</h2>
<p>Tech Twitter is a weird but fun place.</p>
<p>Tweet your blogs, your opinions, unpromptedly code review tech bros’ shitty snippets if they dare share a screenshot.</p>
<p>You should tweet as if you had millions of followers (I have <a href="https://twitter.com/karen_ying_" target="_blank">24</a>). Fake it till you make it, right?</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p></div></div>]]>

<p>In my book "How to Destroy Surveillance Capitalism" I point out that the claims for Big Tech powers of behavior modification powers emanate from the companies' own self-serving boasts pitched to bring in new ad-tech customers.</p>
<p><a href="https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59">https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59</a></p>
<p>I point to the thinness of the external research on ad-tech's efficacy, and the replication failures of its research foundations on things like "sentiment analysis," "microexpressions" and "Big 5 Personalities" – the whole panoply of digital phrenology.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are undeniable, easily measured means by which Big Tech modifies our behavior that don't require us to treat marketing puffery as ground truth.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to talk to your friends you have to use Facebook because Mark Zuckerberg is holding them hostage with monopoly tactics
</li>
<li>
<p>Google uses monopoly rents to buy its way to search default on every platform, so the answer to every question you ask comes from Google</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apple gets to decide which apps you're allowed to use, who can fix your devices, and when you have to throw them away and buy new ones, thanks to DRM and lavish spending to kill dozens of Right to Repair initiatives</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are mass-scale, persistent behavior modifications that have nothing to do with psychological manipulation and everything to do with economic chicanery.</p>
<p>This week on the Freakonomics podcast, Stephen Dubner turns an economic lens on Big Tech's ad-tech boasts.</p>
<p>He talks to Steve Tadelis, an academic economist who once headed a program at Ebay to evaluate the efficacy of ad spending. First they tried eliminating "brand" advertising (that is, advertising buys for the word "ebay") and found that there was no drop in their revenues.</p>
<p>The logic behind Ebay buying ads for "ebay" is that if they don't, their competitors will, so a search for "ebay" will bring up links to Amazon. That happened…and people scrolled right past the Amazon ads to the "organic" Ebay link below the ads.</p>
<p>But Ebay also buys a bunch of keyword ads for products, like "guitar" or "washing machine" or "picture frame." They estimated 5% of their revenue came from these ads, and that every $1 they spent on them brought in $1.50.</p>
<p>Tadelis designed another experiment and found that these ads were actually responsible for 0.5% of their revenue – an order of magnitude less than their estimate – and that every $1 they spent generated $0.60 in <em>losses</em>. They cut $100m from their ad-spending.</p>
<p>But despite publication of these findings, the world increased its ad-tech spending. Tadelis attributes this to the fact that the major players in ad-tech are all incentivized to repeat the unsubstantiated tale of ad-tech's efficacy.</p>
<p>Ad-tech companies, publishers, and ad-tech buying consultancies are all compromised and unable to objectively assess whether ads work (cue Upton Sinclair: "It's difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it").</p>
<p>And, of course, now Big Tech's critics have joined the ranks of those who insist that ad-tech works with spooky, devastating efficacy.</p>
<p>For evidence, all of them point to how much money the industry generates.</p>
<p>Why would people buy these products if they didn't work? Well, the obvious answer is, "That happens all the time." See:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multivitamins
</li>
<li>
<p>Hedge funds</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But there's another answer: "it's a bubble."</p>
<p>A recent, excellent book on the ad-tech bubble is Tim Hwang's SUBPRIME ATTENTION CRISIS:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/05/florida-man/#wannamakers-ghost">https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/05/florida-man/#wannamakers-ghost</a></p>
<p>Hwang tells Dubner that in a bubble, "the red lights are flashing but everybody in the industry just refuses to take a look at the real data."</p>
<p>Bubbles thrive on opacity and complexity. Think of the 2008 financial crisis, where the lack of transparency in "toxic assets" was compounded by their complexity, which led people – including "sophisticated" regulators and investors – to trust them.</p>
<p>They assumed that the manifest absurdity of the claims made by CDO salespeople must reflect their own ignorance. After all, all those OTHER people wouldn't spend trillions on derivatives if they weren't safe enough to buy yourself and exercise regulatory forbearance over.</p>
<p>But as Hwang points out, the ad-tech market is built on garbage. By Google's own reckoning, 60% of the ads that are charged for are never seen by any human being – literally the majority of the industry's product is a figment of feverish machine imaginations.</p>
<p>While Google's own research (and that of other Big Tech players) show that ad-tech works, independent researchers find the opposite: switching from "behavioral" (surveillance) ads to "contextual" ads only reduces clickthrough by 5%.</p>
<p>Behavioral ad clickthroughs are 0.01-0.03%, and much of that is bot activity.</p>
<p>The industry is opaque and incestuous. Ad agencies – nominally working for advertisers – get massive kickbacks from ad-tech platforms for bringing them business.</p>
<p>Proctor and Gamble – the company that invented the concept of brand ads – tried taking $200m out of its online ad spend and saw <em>zero</em> change in sales.</p>
<p>And yet, ad-tech spending continues to rise.</p>
<p>Hwang says we need a "punk rock" National Bureau of Economic Research, an org that will neutrally measure ad-tech performance and slowly deflate the bubble rather than bursting it, because an ad-tech collapse would kill ad-supported media.</p>
<p>All this is kind of a microcosm for the problems of economics in general. For decades, economics was dominated by the neoclassical idea of "homo economicus," a rational utility maximizer whose bad choices were good, actually.</p>
<p>(That's still the cartoon that undergrads get)</p>
<p>Advertising – especially brand ads – is grounded in the idea that irrationality is universal and exploitable, that you can trick people into paying a 50,000% markup by slapping a logo on a t-shirt.</p>
<p>But advertisers – and the industry – assume <em>they</em> are immune to irrationality, that they don't need to worry that they themselves will be suckered by slick sales-patter from ad tech, or their agencies.</p>

<p>Last week, the largest organized strike in human history shut down India. 250,000,000 people struck against Indian PM Narendra Modi's neoliberal reforms to the agricultural sector.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2020/12/3/india_protests_modi_neoliberal_reforms">https://www.democracynow.org/2020/12/3/india_protests_modi_neoliberal_reforms</a></p>
<p>These reforms don't just remove the collective bargaining and price controls that protect the ag sector (which employs more than half the Indian working population), but also stripped multinational corporations and government of liability for harms to their workers.</p>
<p>All this while unemployment is at 27%, and 76% of rural Indians lack the funds to cover their basic nutritional needs. Meanwhile Indian billionaires have increased their wealth by 35% during the pandemic. India's richest man, Mukesh Ambani, has made $12m per <em>hour</em> since March.</p>
<p>The strike didn't just turn out unemployed people and farmers: the turnout was driven by acts of solidarity from ever sector of society.</p>
<p>In his discussion with Amy Goodman on Democracy Now, P Sainath offers some really important political context.</p>
<p>Modi has had a comfortable Congressional majority for two years and has three years left to go in his mandate, so why did he wait for the pandemic to make this far-reaching power-grab?</p>
<p>Sainath: "The reasoning was, these blokes are on their knees now. They can’t organize. They can’t hit back. And in fact, many leading neoliberal intellectuals, economists and journalists, editors, incited the government, saying, 'Never waste a good crisis.'"</p>
<p>It's shock doctrine shit, in other words. But Modi badly misjudged the moment: rather than being beating beyond resistance, Indians have been beaten to the sticking point, and will no longer be fooled by religious bigotry and neoliberal fairy tales.</p>
<p>Right wing movements around the world are grounded in the idea that some people are born to rule and the rest of us are born to be ruled over. Antimajoritarian philosophy isn't compatible with democracy, because it requires sustained turkeys-voting-for-Christmas to survive.</p>
<p>As India shows, the traditional tools of antimajoritarianism – xenophobia, sectarianism, armed violence – are unstable in the long run. Eventually there comes a point when you can't just shout "Muslims are scary!" at starving people and expect them to take that for an answer.</p>
<p>Indians have been slaughtered by both covid and mismanagement. They are at the breaking point. They are rising up.</p>

<p>In the 1970s, the Soviet Union started to clone DEC's PDP workhorse minicomputers, especially the PDP-8, which was replicated in the USSR as the Saratov-2. Today, the Saratov-2 is a distant memory, with not even a single high-quality photo of the system online.</p>
<p>Until now. Russian urban explorer Ralph Mirebs's photos of a "Soviet Computing Cemetery" (location undisclosed) that features the rotting remains of a Saratov-2 amid the ashes and fire-suppresant residue of a long-ago data-center blaze.</p>
<p><a href="https://rusue.com/cemetery-of-soviet-computers/">https://rusue.com/cemetery-of-soviet-computers/</a></p>
<p>The Saratov-2 was wild: it didn't have a microprocessor; rather, it was broken down into components, each in its own drawer: a 12-bit computing unit, I/O, RAM (ferromagnetic cubes).</p>
<p>Also present in the cemetery: an Electronics 100/25 – the Soviet version of the PDP-11 – and some DVK-2Ms (early personal computers).</p>
<p>The author recalls their own computer science education in 1993, when "one teaching DVK could distribute programs for a couple of dozen Spectrums through the network."</p>
<p>One of my last trips before the crisis hit was my visit to the Computer History Museum's boneyard – a massive warehouse filled …</p></div></article></div>

        <section>
            <div><p>The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero/?resellerType=home">Raspberry Pi Zero</a> and original Raspberry Pi both have a 32-bit ARM architecture which many projects have dropped support for. So when I saw that <a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/4530">containerd recently merged a fix</a> for building containerd on armv6, started to think what I could do with it.</p>
<p>Earlier that month, a user of the <a href="http://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd project</a> which runs very well on VPSes, RPi 3 and RPi4 asked me whether it could work on the Zero and I told him it was not practical or worth his time. After all, an RPi4 with 2GB of RAM, 4 Cores and much faster I/O is only 25GBP/EUR/USD.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd is OpenFaaS</a>, but for a single node, and designed for those who don't want to pay for and manage an entire Kubernetes cluster, GitOps, service-mesh, and IngressController just to deploy a few simple functions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My past experiences told me that it would be a challenge to get the zero working. It has such a paltry amount of memory available and its I/O is really slow. Still, sometimes it's fun to do things that we shouldn't. Had I been <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">"nerd sniped"</a>?</p>
<p><img src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/homepage-9df4b/static/1dfa03d09c1f3e446e8d936dfb92267f/8924f/6b0defdbbf40792b64159ab8169d97162c380b2c_raspberry-pi-zero-1-1755x1080.jpg" width="60%">
&gt; The RPi Zero originally released in 2015.
</p><p>In this post I'll show you what you need to do to deploy functions through the <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli">OpenFaaS CLI</a> and be able to invoke them, including multi-arch builds. At the end of the post I'll explain what the limitations are and whether we should leave the Raspberry Pi Zero with those fond memories we have of it when it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi">released in 2015</a>, 5 years ago.</p>
<h2 id="walkthrough">Walk-through</h2>
<h3 id="prereqs">Pre-reqs</h3>
<p>You will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi Zero</li>
<li>Ethernet adapter and USB &lt;&gt; USB A micro shim</li>
<li>16-32GB class 10 SD card</li>
<li>MicroUSB power adapter</li>
</ul>
<p>Flash the latest version of Raspberry Pi OS Lite to your SD card, and then create an <code>ssh</code> file in the <code>/boot/</code> folder.</p>
<p>Power up the Raspberry Pi and ssh to it with <code>ssh pi@raspberrypi.local</code>.</p>
<h3 id="installgo">Install go</h3>
<p>You can install Go from a package manager, but the version is likely to be rather old. Fortunately the Go team still ship a binary for armv6:</p>
<pre><code>export ARCH="armv6l"
echo "Downloading Go"

curl -SLsf https://dl.google.com/go/go1.13.15.linux-$ARCH.tar.gz --output /tmp/go.tgz
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go/
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/go/
sudo tar -xvf /tmp/go.tgz -C /usr/local/go/ --strip-components=1

export GOPATH=$HOME/go/
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin/
</code></pre>
<p>You now have Go installed, run <code>go version</code> to see it working.</p>
<h3 id="buildcontainerd">Build containerd</h3>
<p>faasd uses containerd rather than Docker, but there are no official binaries for any of the ARM CPUs, so we have to build them from source.</p>
<p>For armv7 and ARM64, you can use my repo <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/containerd-arm">alexellis/containerd-arm</a>. It's my hope to see ARM support upstreamed, but having spoken on several occasions to the containerd team, it seems very unlikely that we will see this happen.</p>
<p>On my first attempt of building I got the following error:</p>
<pre><code>+ bin/containerd
# github.com/containerd/containerd/cmd/containerd
/usr/local/go/pkg/tool/linux_arm/link: running gcc failed: fork/exec /usr/bin/gcc: cannot allocate memory
make: *** [Makefile:188: bin/containerd] Error 2
</code></pre>
<p>The RPi Zero and the largest RPi 1 only has 512MB of RAM and I slowly watched the RAM being eaten up with <code>watch -n "free -h"</code>.. I should have remembered this.</p>
<p>Fortunately I had the battle scars and knew what I had to do:</p>
<pre><code>sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1024 count=1M &amp;&amp;\
  sudo mkswap /swapfile &amp;&amp; \
  sudo swapon /swapfile
</code></pre>
<p>This creates 1GB of swap, on the SD card.. which already has terrible I/O, but it may just work.</p>
<p>The other trick you may have seen me talk about is adding <code>gpu_mem=16</code> to <code>/boot/config.txt</code>. It seems pointless changing the split on an 8GB RPi4, but for our RPi Zero, we need every MB we can get.</p>
<p>Second time lucky?</p>
<p>No. It failed again due to some missing libraries. I reminded myself to read <a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/master/BUILDING.md#build-containerd">BUILDING.md</a> from the containerd repo. After adding libseccomp and a few other packages, it started to move along again.</p>
<pre><code>make
+ bin/ctr
+ bin/containerd
+ bin/containerd-stress
+ bin/containerd-shim
+ bin/containerd-shim-runc-v1
+ bin/containerd-shim-runc-v2
+ binaries
</code></pre>
<p>I don't know if it was 10 minutes or over an hour, but it was slow progress.</p>
<p>I then ran <code>sudo make install</code> and copied the systemd unit file into place with:</p>
<pre><code>sudo cp containerd.service /etc/systemd/system/containerd.service
sudo systemctl enable containerd
</code></pre>
<p>I didn't want to start containerd at this time, to save on memory for the next task.</p>
<h3 id="buildfaasd">Build faasd</h3>
<p>The faasd Makefile needed a patch because it was set to cross-compile to armv7, but we needed armv6.</p>
<pre><code>.PHONY: dist
dist:
	CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm GOARM=6 go build -mod=vendor -ldflags $(LDFLAGS) -a -installsuffix cgo -o bin/faasd-armhf
</code></pre>
<p>This took so long to build on the zero that I gave up and built it on my Intel NUC. Fortunately Go is very good as cross-compiling, especially when linking into C/C++ libraries is disabled with <code>CGO_ENABLED=0</code>.</p>
<p>I then ran <code>scp</code> to copy the binary to the Raspberry Pi.</p>
<pre><code>sudo cp faasd-armhf /usr/local/bin/faasd
cd go/src/github.com/openfaas/faasd
</code></pre>
<p>The final step was to install faasd which creates two systemd unit files:</p>
<ul>
<li>faasd - for the OpenFaaS core services</li>
<li>faasd-provider - for the provider that supports CRUD and Invoke operations</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>sudo faasd install
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/12/faasd-install.jpg" alt="faasd-install"></p>
<h3 id="unexpectedissues">Unexpected issues</h3>
<p>I tried to log in with <code>faas-cli login</code>, but it didn't work. I saw a number of errors in the logs <code>sudo systemctl journalctl -u faasd</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Dec 03 23:18:49 zero-dns default:basic-auth-plugin[13218]: standard_init_linux.go:207: exec user process caused "exec format error"
Dec 03 23:18:50 zero-dns containerd[12169]: time="2020-12-03T23:18:50.338589900Z" level=info msg="starting signal loop" namespace=default path=/run/containerd/io.containerd.runtime.v2.task/default/gateway pid=13324
Dec 03 23:18:52 zero-dns default:gateway[13335]: standard_init_linux.go:207: exec user process caused "exec format error"
</code></pre>
<p>It turned out that out of nats, prometheus, and the openfaas gateway, the openfaas basic-auth plugin only nats was available for armv6. It seems that projects really have moved on and left armv6 behind.</p>
<h3 id="thenihadanidea">Then I had an idea</h3>
<p>What if we didn't run the whole OpenFaaS stack at all, but just the <code>faasd-provider</code>? It would allow this tiny device to support all the CRUD operations on functions, and invocations, but nothing more.</p>
<p>The provider seemed to be running well, and responding to <code>faas-cli</code> commands:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/12/provider.png" alt="provider"></p>
<p>We'd lose the queue and async invocations, lose the UI, lose the metrics, but we could still deploy functions and invoke them.</p>
<p>It was already very late by this point so I decided to sleep on it.</p>
<h3 id="inthemorning">In the morning</h3>
<p>I powered up the RPi zero and tried deploying a container directly to the faasd endpoint, and it worked.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/12/deploy.jpg" alt="deploy"></p>
<p>Now, I had to make a few changes. Rather than building with the OpenFaaS watchdog in the container, I just used a Dockerfile and a plain Go HTTP server.</p>
<p>Here's what I ended up with:</p>
<p>Dockerfile</p>
<pre><code>FROM --platform=${BUILDPLATFORM:-linux/amd64} golang:1.13-alpine3.11 as build

<p>I ran this on my PC with the following:</p>
<pre><code>export OPENFAAS_URL=http://192.168.0.81:8081
faas-cli publish --platform linux/arm/v6

faas-cli deploy
</code></pre>
<p>Using the PC means we can cross-compile the Go HTTP server and push a multi-arch image to the container registry. The new <code>faas-cli publish</code> command comes in handy for this and can accept a list of architectures.</p>
<p>The <code>deploy</code> command talks to the remote machine over REST and tells it to deploy a function. The server-side handler <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/blob/master/pkg/provider/handlers/deploy.go">deploy.go</a> pulls the image into containerd and starts executing it as a container.</p>
<h3 id="onemorething">One more thing</h3>
<p>When I say that it worked. I should clarify that I'd forgotten to deploy CNI - the networking layer required for faasd and containerd.</p>
<p>I saw this error by running the following:</p>
<pre><code>sudo journalctl -u faasd
</code></pre>
<p>Not that long ago, <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/blob/master/docs/DEV.md">I'd documented all the steps required for a manual installation</a>, but somehow forgot this was needed.</p>
<pre><code>export ARCH=arm
export CNI_VERSION=v0.8.5

sudo mkdir -p /opt/cni/bin
curl -sSL https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases/download/${CNI_VERSION}/cni-plugins-linux-${ARCH}-${CNI_VERSION}.tgz | sudo tar -xz -C /opt/cni/bin

# Make a config folder for CNI definitions

{
    "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
    "type": "loopback"
}

</code></pre>
<p>Just changing "ARCH" to "arm" was enough to make it work. So the CNI project are still <a href="https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/blob/master/.travis.yml">building the plugins against armv6</a> for the time being.</p>

<p>Then it was a case of simply running <code>faas-cli deploy</code> again, and finally, it actually worked.</p>

		<article>
			<p>From the moment I started paying attention to the tech industry, Paul Graham was there.  My first job out of college was in SoMa, around the corner from the Justin.tv offices, and his essays were just floating around in the ether, impossible to ignore.  His popularization of Lisp was a small part of why I tried Clojure, and a big part of why Clojure was successful.</p>

<p>I recognized that he had a tendency towards <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">self-aggrandizement</a> and <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html">awkward flattery of his readers</a>, but at worst he seemed harmless.  As his writing became increasingly focused on startups, and I became increasingly sure I didn’t want to be a founder, he simply drifted out of view.</p>

<p>Recently, however, his writing has taken a reactionary turn which is hard to ignore.  He’s <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/mod.html">written</a> about the need to defend “moderates” from bullies on the “extreme left”, <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1334441961147822081">asserted</a> that “the truth is to the right of the median” because “the left is culturally dominant,” and <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EjGX2-bU4AAWkUX?format=jpg&amp;name=medium">justified</a> Coinbase’s policy to ban discussion of anything deemed “political” by saying that it “will push away some talent, yes, but not very talented talent.”</p>

<p>I went back to the essays I had read a decade before, to see if I had missed something.  It turned out that I had.  There was a consistent intellectual framework underpinning all his writing, from his very first essays on Lisp and language design.  In many ways, those early essays contained the clearest articulation of his framework; it just took me ten years to see it.</p>

<hr>

<p>In April 2001, six years after the release of the Java language, Paul Graham weighed in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://paulgraham.com/javacover.html">I’ve never written a Java program, never more than glanced over reference books about it, but I have a hunch that it won’t be a very successful language.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He followed up with a number of observations about Java, such as the fact that it was designed by committee, infantilizes its users, and owed its initial success to an ailing corporate sponsor.  But, he wrote, this wasn’t an analysis of Java so much as introspection on his own “hacker’s radar”.  This radar was the aesthetic response of an expert programmer, drawn from epiphenomena surrounding the language and the opinions of other experts in his social circle.</p>

<p>A month later, in an essay on why languages are popular, he doubled down on the importance of his personal intuition:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/popular.html">Programming languages are <em>for</em> hackers, and a programming language is good as a programming language (rather than, say, an exercise in denotational semantics or compiler design) if and only if hackers like it.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The quality of a language can only be judged by experts (“a tiny minority, admittedly, but that tiny minority write all the good software”), and adoption by those experts will drive adoption by everyone else.  Ultimately, “a programming language probably becomes about as popular as it deserves to be.”</p>

<p>The context for both essays was that Graham was creating his own language, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/arc.html">Arc</a>.  He wanted it to be popular, and was working out how to make that happen.</p>

<p>The first intrinsic driver of popularity he named was “brevity”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/popular.html">It would not be far from the truth to say that a hacker about to write a program decides what language to use, at least subconsciously, based on the total number of characters he’ll have to type.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He called back to this when discussing the importance of libraries, which can reduce any program to a single invocation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/popular.html">Of course the ultimate in brevity is to have the program already written for you, and merely to call it. And this brings us to what I think will be an increasingly important feature of programming languages: library functions. Perl wins because it has large libraries for manipulating strings.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It appears that Graham was referring to Perl’s core library functions, not the much larger set of library functions that were even then available via <a href="https://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>, because he placed this responsibility wholly upon the shoulders of the language designer, saying language design would become increasingly focused on “how to design great libraries.”</p>

<p>Graham named other drivers of popularity in this essay, but he returned to brevity <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/langdes.html">again</a> and <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/power.html">again</a> over the next year, culminating in an essay on the singular importance of brevity, now dubbed “succinctness”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/power.html">My hypothesis is that succinctness is power, or is close enough that except in pathological examples you can treat them as identical.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Drawing from studies that found “programmers seemed to generate about the same amount of code per day regardless of the language”, he declared that “the only way to get software written faster was to use a more succinct language”.</p>

<p>Nowhere, however, did he mention libraries.  The next month, he explained that given a sufficiently succinct language, users could simply write their own libraries:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/icad.html">As for libraries, their importance also depends on the application. For less demanding problems, the availability of libraries can outweigh the intrinsic power of the language. Where is the breakeven point? Hard to say exactly, but wherever it is, it is short of anything you’d be likely to call an application. If a company considers itself to be in the software business, and they’re writing an application that will be one of their products, then it will probably involve several hackers and take at least six months to write. In a project of that size, powerful languages probably start to outweigh the convenience of pre-existing libraries.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was a significant departure from his earlier writings.  Only a year before, he had stated that “[i]t’s hard to design good libraries. It’s not simply a matter of writing a lot of code.”  He had emphasized that library design was a key part of language design, and even a year later he would tell us “[d]esign usually has to be under the control of a single person to be any good.”</p>

<p>Now he argued that the language designer only need provide a barebones language of sufficient brevity, and all else would follow.  Library design can’t be both critically important and an incidental part of someone else’s six-month software project.  Despite this, Graham never mentioned libraries ever again.</p>

<p>A year later, he explained that Arc was trying to be a “hundred-year language”.  “It may seem presumptuous,” he wrote, but “[l]anguages evolve slowly because they’re not really technologies. Languages are notation. A program is a formal description of the problem you want a computer to solve for you.”  He asserted the most important part of the language were the “fundamental operators”, because the rest of the language “could in principle be written in terms of these fundamental operators”.</p>

<p>What, then, makes a language ready for the 22nd century?  Certainly not any concerns about performance, since “[e]ven if [computers] only end up being a paltry million times faster, that should change the ground rules for programming languages substantially.”  Not data structures, since they’re just a premature optimization of the humble list.  Not a mechanism (or even notation) for parallel computation, since a simple description of the problem will “ignore any advantages to be got from parallel computation, just as they will ignore advantages to be got from specific representations of data.”</p>

<p>A hundred-year language <em>should</em>, however, be succinct.  First “write down the program you’d like to be able to write, regardless of whether there is a compiler that can translate it or hardware that can run it.”  And of course the program you’d really like to write is the shortest one possible:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html">[T]he algorithm for language design becomes: look at a program and ask, is there any way to write this that’s shorter?</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>“If we had the hundred-year language now,” Graham wrote, “it would at least make a great pseudocode.”  Confusingly, he asserted that since it will need to perform well on its million-times-faster future processor, “presumably it could generate code efficient enough to run acceptably well on our hardware.”</p>

<p>“When you see these ideas laid out like that,” he wrote, “it’s hard not to think, why not try writing the hundred-year language now?”</p>

<hr>

<p>Four years later, in 2008, Arc was released.  It was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp#The_function_namespace">Lisp-1</a> with shorter names and fewer parentheses than most other Lisps, and some reader macros to make anonymous functions easier to define.  All primitives were defined in terms of MzScheme, a different Lisp, which provided the compiler and other tooling.  It also came with a barebones web framework which used continuations, reminiscent of the Smalltalk-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaside_(software)">Seaside framework</a> which had been around since 2002.</p>

<p>It was, in all, underwhelming.  There were many paths that could have led Graham to his professed goals, and he took none of them.</p>

<p>He had written that strings were premature optimization, and should be replaced by lists of characters.  If he had done so, and made the characters full <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_point">Unicode code points</a>, Arc could have been one of the few languages not suffering from a half-century hangover stretching all the way back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIC">EBCDIC</a>.  Instead, the initial release used byte strings which only supported the ASCII character set.</p>

<p>Graham had asked “[h]ow many times have you heard hackers speak fondly of how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couple lines of code? I think anything that really smart people really love is worth paying attention to.”  But the undeniably succinct primitives and composition rules of array programming languages were nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>Server-based deployment of software was a <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/road.html">central theme</a> in Graham’s essays, and his continuation-based web framework was an interesting and fairly novel way to create continuity across multiple requests in a single session.  But since each link on the page was a continuation, and each continuation was stored in-memory in a single process, this created a single, memory-hungry point of failure.  For years, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/news">Hacker News</a> would simply display “unknown or expired link” if you waited too long to click a link.  If Arc had its own runtime, it could have supported …</p></article></div></div></div>

December 6, 2020 | https://dubeyaayush07.github.io/deliberate-mistakes/rethinking-social-media/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://dubeyaayush07.github.io/deliberate-mistakes/rethinking-social-media/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article"><header><p>December 05, 2020</p></header><section itemprop="articleBody"><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The harmful effects of the algorithms employed by social networking platforms like Twitter and Facebook has been well documented: polarisation, privacy issues, you name it. Even though I share a lot of these concerns between all the petty tribalism there is potential for having deep and meaningful conversations too. But I do not think it is possible to improve existing social networks, as even though these networks are not inherently evil they are a result of a bad business model. Their main objective is maximising user engagement the more time you spend glued to your screen the better. With this model at the core it is hard for these companies to implement change. In certain cases taking initiatives for improving the mental well being of users or for promoting productive discourse might be impractical too. The quality of the experience is secondary to the screen time.</p>
<p>The solution in my opinion is to build networks with strong core values that promote productive conversations. Start with a small community with a solid foundation then gradually expand keeping the values intact. What would such a network look like? Well like anything great it will have to take what is good about its predecessors and improve on their shortcomings. The improvements should be significant so as to provide a reason for people to actually switch. But improvements is a vague term to see how social networks can be improved I think it is better to analyse and think about the components that make up these networks from first principles.</p>
<h2>Moderation</h2>
<p>If we have learned anything from <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/right-wing-users-flock-to-parler-as-social-media-giants-rein-in-misinformation">Parler</a> it is that sometimes it becomes necessary to infringe upon people’s free speech rights especially when these privileges come at the cost of civilised discourse. Still banning people is a slippery slope for example if you ban a terrorist account then what do you do when China asks you to ban accounts of Hong Kong protesters? You have given them the precedent. I think the solution is to have strict moderation but with strong foundational principles and make them clear early on. A good strategy is to only censor people if they are disrespecting other people not when they are expressing their opinions or ideas. Even if you think that the earth is not flat you should let other people talk it out if they are being civil about it.</p>
<p>If you look at communities like <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, or the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/">Ask Historians subreddit</a> where the moderators rule with an iron hand you can notice that the posts and comments in these forums are of much higher quality. But still it is anecdotal evidence and these communities are small when you compare them to giants like Facebook and Twitter. Also how would you moderate millions of post? Even if it was possible for human to do it can you rely on them to look at these posts objectively and report them only if they violate the guidelines? I believe if you start a community with strong core values it is possible to motivate people with a little bit of algorithm ingenuity to act in good faith.</p>
<h2>Feed</h2>
<p>Feeds and Algorithms are inextricably linked, feeds serve content curated by algorithms. Feeds can be finite or infinite providing an endless stream of posts and the algorithms used by these can range from simple algorithms that serve posts in chronological order to relatively complex machine learning based recommender systems. Most of the big platforms nowadays use recommender systems coupled with infinite feeds. It can get really messy if a single feed is used to serve both recommended content and the content that the user is subscribed to. YouTube is a good example of this even though they have great recommendations the content that the user has actually subscribed to gets lost in the feed of recommended videos. You might argue that they have a different feed for subscriptions but its not the one they show first when the user enters their app/website and that is the one that actually counts.</p>
<p>For our ideal social network I think it will be better to use two different feed one main finite feed solely for the subscribed/followed content and one infinite feed that recommends content based on the the interests of the user. For the subscription feed I do not think a purely chronological algorithm will work as a post about an important event like a friend’s birthday might get trapped between relatively trivial posts but between the posts of similar importance chronological information can be taken into account. A more complex algorithm will be required for the recommendation feed I will talk about it more in the monetisation section. The goal of the feeds should be to maximise signal from noise and not waste the time of its users.</p>
<h2>Monetisation</h2>
<p>Advertising is a bad and unsustainable business model for social networks, if your main source of revenue are advertisements you will be incentivised to increase user engagement and sometimes even at the cost of the actual experience. The best business model for social networks I think is the Wikipedia model. Ask people who can afford to to pay a nominal subscription to keep the servers running. The success of the company will actually depend how happy its users are with the platform.</p>
<p>You might have noticed that I have used vague terms like ‘algorithmic ingenuity’ and statements like ‘build a system that recommends people posts based on their interests’ without mentioning the specifics of the algorithm that is because I do not know and when it comes to moderation algorithms neither does Twitter. Learning based algorithms are not completely transparent and it is difficult to predict what they are going to do and it becomes even more difficult to come up with good algorithms when the goals of the networks are misaligned with the public good. What my argument is that in social networks that do not depend on advertising money engineers will be actually motivated to come up with better algorithms for moderation and recommendation.</p>
<h2>Interface and Posts</h2>
<p>The whole social network revolves around posts these are the primary content that people use to interact with their subscribers/followers. For Twitter these are limited length messages, for Quora these are questions, for Instagram images, for YouTube videos, etc. The format of these posts is important. They can be designed such that people come up with clever ways to use them (example tweets) and they can also be designed in a more restrictive way such that people struggle to get across what they mean (example tweets).</p>
<p>The ideal post in my opinion is a mixture of these two we could allow people to post both a restricted length post and a full fledged article but nothing in between this leaves space for creativity and does not hamper conversation. An option could be given to the users to sort their feed by articles, shorter posts or both. And instead of like and dislike buttons we can use recommend and not recommend buttons the functions might be same but change in name might help people make conscious decision about whether they want similar content recommended to them or not.</p>
<p>Another way we can improve conversations I think is by giving people a small break between writing a post and actually posting it. This might seem counter-intuitive but I think if given a chance to reflect on things people generally take right decisions and it can also give them time to calm down so that they do not engage in pointless name calling. We can implement it by an optional 15 seconds timer which is enabled by default.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The goal of the post is to start a conversation about what an ideal social network might look like. But these are just abstract ideas and musings there is no evidence a social networks like this will be successful but instead of conjecturing about whether things will work or not it is better to try to implement it and see for yourself. In that spirit I am going to try to implement a social network based on these principles. But I am a lone programmer and I need help if some part of my post resonated with you and you think that implementing such a network is worth a try contact me at <a href="mailto:dubeyaayush08@gmail.com">dubeyaayush08@gmail.com</a> and maybe we could team up.</p></section><hr></article></div>]]>

<p>I recently listed <a href="https://www.arencambre.com/2020/12/05/android-is-better-than-iphone/" data-type="post" data-id="3377">17 reasons why iPhones are inferior to Android phone</a>. They are all real. Apple could fix every one of these. But laying out the advantages of either ecosystem, what’s the net value they bring?</p>



<h2>Premise</h2>



<p>This page assesses the value of each of the points where I compare the phone ecosystems. No matter how many points I have in favor of an ecosystem, they are only worth acting on if they have significant value.</p>



<p>Below, I first rate each point primarily on three factors:</p>



<ol><li>Does it help me be a better member of my family?</li><li>Does it help me do paid or volunteer work better?</li><li>Does it help me be smarter or more effective?</li></ol>



<p>If the decision point doesn’t help me with one of these factors, it is not valuable as a decision point.</p>



<p>But if the decision point <em>does</em> help at least one of these factors, then it will contribute to a score that helps with a decision on which ecosystem to move forward with.</p>



<h2>Scorecard</h2>



<p>For each point, I provide some commentary. The <strong>Importance </strong>column is how many of the above factors the point affects. If it affects no factors, then its score is 0. The <strong>Score </strong>column has a 1 if Android is better, -1 if iPhone is better, or 0 if they are about the same. I’ll award a 2 or -2 if one is far better than the other. <strong>Extended </strong>is simply <strong>Importance</strong> * <strong>Score</strong>. The sum of <strong>Extended</strong> is the final score I am going after. If it’s significantly positive, I keep my Pixel 4 XL. If it’s significantly negative, I go with my iPhone 12 Pro Max.</p>



<p>Note that this scoring is mainly based on me comparing a Pixel 4 XL to a iPhone 12 Pro Max. In my <a href="https://www.arencambre.com/2020/12/05/android-is-better-than-iphone/">prior commentary</a>, I was not as device-specific. This is a guide for my own decision. For example, I am not factoring in possibilities of Android phones I do not have, such as the Nexus 5.</p>

Even if the iPhone’s battery life isn’t all it cracked up to be, it’s still considerably better.

<h2>Verdict</h2>



<p>The final score is -5, which is a significant score in favor of keeping the iPhone.</p>



<p>In the end, it’s not a big deal to switch to Apple.</p>



<p>There is no other phone in the Android ecosystem I am interested in. I will not consider second-rate manufacturers that ruin the Android experience with garbage crapware, like Samsung. OnePlus is a contender, but it’s not quite there for me. While the Pixel 5 has a lot going for it, its weak processor, lack of face unlock, and reliance on an obsolete camera sensor are major marks against it.</p>



<p>The financials will work out. I can recover about 1/4 of the cost of my iPhone by selling my Pixel 4 XL. Also, since the iPhones devalue more slowly, that makes it easier to recover costs by just selling it, should the Pixel 6 or some future OnePlus work out better.</p>

			<h3>Balenciaga created a video game for their Fall/Winter 2021 presentation</h3> 
			<h4>Well, it's not a real video game more like a simulation... But anyway, it's cool!</h4>
			<p><img src="https://fashionweb.io/img/05-balenciaga-videogame.gif" alt="balenciaga video game"></p><p>Due to covid-19 being in full swing the big brands had to think long and hard about what exactly they should do for their collection presentations. Here are the highlights: </p>
			<p>• <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCQxPSNzU2Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prada did a “livestream”</a> of their fashion show which ended with a Q&amp;A with Rick Owens and Miuccia Prada. Prada’s show didn’t look like a real livestream at all, more like a high production recording that took a whole day to film. We don’t mind though, no point having a “live” livestream really. <br>
			• <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/747647002" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Burberry cleverly partnered with Twitch</a> for their livestream.<br>
			• Jacquemus had a socially distanced show in a wheat field and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vTYQWNFgTU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">livestreamed</a> it.<br>
			• Gucci hosted their own fashion week called “<a href="https://www.guccifest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GucciFest</a>” collaborating with Gus Van Sant on their 7 part video series. Our attention span didn’t make it past the first episode unfortunately. <br>
			• <a href="https://www.chanel.com/fr/mode/collection/metiers-art-2020-21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chanel had their show in a castle</a> and they only had one guest watching the show: Kristen Stewart. Weeeeeeiiiird. We hope she tested negative...<br>
			• <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh7ab7-Gf_E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Celine</a> hired out an empty football stadium in Monaco where Hedi Slimane showed his Gen-Z-friendly collection.<br>
			• <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Cmolbk0EWc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acne Studios</a> did a neat livestream at the empty Grand Palais.<br>
			• Balenciaga on the other hand went all in and created an <a href="https://videogame.balenciaga.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online videogame</a> dedicated to their new collection - it’s something we would only expect from Demna Gvasalia. <br></p>

			<p>The game is called <a href="https://videogame.balenciaga.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Afterworld: The Age of Tomorrow</i></a> and it’s a simulation taking you through a digital world that Balenciaga created where the characters are wearing the brand’s Fall/Winter 2021 collection. The entire simulation [we call it a simulation and not a game since you are just walking a pathway instead of playing] takes place for around 15 minutes. It starts with an intro where you roll through the “characters” like in a 90s fighting game detailing the garments in each look [check out the animated GIF above].</p>

			<p>You then transition into a Blade Runner-esque world based in a concrete building perhaps in a big metropolitan city, where the models are showcasing the new collection while standing around, browsing on their phones or taking selfies. </p>

			<p><img src="https://fashionweb.io/img/05-balenciaga-ss21-01.jpg" alt="balenciaga video game still"></p><p>

			<img src="https://fashionweb.io/img/05-balenciaga-ss21-02.jpg" alt="balenciaga video game still"></p><p>

			<img src="https://fashionweb.io/img/05-balenciaga-ss21-03.jpg" alt="balenciaga video game still"></p><p>You then walk through 5 zones, all zones looking apocalyptic. See this “Bringing life back to earth” ad in their game below, indicating a scary future.</p>

			<p><img src="https://fashionweb.io/img/05-balenciaga-ss21-04.jpg" alt="balenciaga video game still"></p><p>

			<img src="https://fashionweb.io/img/05-balenciaga-ss21-05.jpg" alt="balenciaga video game still"></p><p>

			<img src="https://fashionweb.io/img/05-balenciaga-ss21-06.jpg" alt="balenciaga video game still"></p><p>There is a small story in the game and it’s very very much fitting for Balenciaga’s brand and current creative direction. <span>*SPOILER ALERT, highlight to read*</span> <span>We thought the story would end when we arrive to a rave in the forest, but we continued from there, bypassing models dancing high on life </span><span>*SPOILER ALERT OVER*</span></p>
			

			<p>If this was a contest, hands down we would give Balenciaga the golden medal 🥇 for their spring/summer 2021 presentation.</p>

			


			<div>
				<h4><span>FINAL THOUGHTS</span></h4>
				<p>Phew, all these brands’ Marketing and Digital departments must have been sweating hard from all that digital thinking this year. A for effort guys! We will be watching you again in 6 months.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-6117893139176476722" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>After years of struggling to lose weight, I've lost 30 pounds this year. My number one takeaway has been realizing I need to be mindful of what I eat all day, from eyes open to going to bed.</p>

<p>For years I'd been giving up single things. No soda or juice. No desserts. No chips. No fries. Yet incredibly, whatever I did it didn't make a dent, at least not for long. Which seemed totally impossible.</p>

<p>I'd just cut out thousands of calories! And... nothing. Eventually, I realized it was like pushing down on a waterbed. I'd just end up eating the calories somewhere else. Automatically and without fail.</p>

<div><p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-U2RZSjyEQRU/X8B4u5G8aVI/AAAAAAAFHHQ/_OawWuIiGL0lKvmMWlJnnVeqdd-SUMzJACLcBGAsYHQ/image.png"><img data-original-height="381" data-original-width="750" height="326" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-U2RZSjyEQRU/X8B4u5G8aVI/AAAAAAAFHHQ/_OawWuIiGL0lKvmMWlJnnVeqdd-SUMzJACLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h326/image.png" width="640"></a></p><p>Maintaining good posture is easy: when you notice you are slumping, sit up straight. The hard part is noticing. What's going on at that moment when you start to slump? The exact moment when your head tilts down or your back starts to curve? Where is your mind right at that moment? How are you letting this happen? I mean what the hell, who is minding the store here?</p></div>

<p>I feel like that's exactly where my mind was when I was making a late-night snack, or grabbing another handful of chips, or digging into another piece of pizza. I was there for those moments in a way, but also not there.</p><p>Honestly, sometimes I felt like a spectator. I'd look at the snack I fixed myself and say, “Boy I should not be eating this,” then I’d sit down and eat it. Afterward, I'd say, “I should not have eaten that”. Can I talk to a manager, is there no one in charge here?</p>

<p>What finally worked was pushing the desire to lose weight down deeply into every fiber of my being, so in those moments I was present, the “I” that I wanted to be was present. Once present, the choice was actually easy. If I'm trying to lose weight, which I am, should I eat this handful of M&amp;M's? No, no I should not.</p>

<p>How to stay present? I did mindfulness meditation for several years, and I think mindfulness is what we are talking about. It's the opposite of mindlessness, and mindlessness is the enemy. What they don't advertise is there are ways to increase mindfulness without meditation. They are just... a little weird.</p>

<p>When you have an itch, even an intense one, just observe it for a while. See what happens. Often it will go away. If it's unbearable then scratch it, but not every time, and not right away.</p>

<p>If you are doing anything rushed, like writing or cleaning or typing your password in wrong, once in a while do it really slow. Like impossibly slow. The other day I was tearing a perforated piece of paper such that I waited for each single pop, then pulled it a bit more. One time I shaved so slowly that I was enjoying listening to the individual whiskers snap.</p>

<p>The goal is not just “do things slowly”. The goal is to catch yourself doing something on auto-pilot and intervene with some deliberate action. To be aware of what you were doing, then modify what you were doing mindfully. It's best to do this for different activities, sporadically. Sense that the auto-pilot has taken over, then do something to disrupt that automatic behavior.</p><p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fievTLupx7M/X76Ld1UoftI/AAAAAAAFHG8/qIy8zP7hJ3IFRLtE0MkjzJQpY7YMIONlgCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png"><img data-original-height="282" data-original-width="425" height="424" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fievTLupx7M/X76Ld1UoftI/AAAAAAAFHG8/qIy8zP7hJ3IFRLtE0MkjzJQpY7YMIONlgCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h424/image.png" width="640"></a></p>

<p>Sometimes if I'm on a mostly empty road, but I'm following someone too closely, I'll slow WAY down, until they are far in front of me. I've learned that for me this “following behavior” is very automatic.</p>

<p>After there's a gap I resume my exact same speed, but now I'm a constant five seconds behind. It's less stressful and safer, and the only downside is I'll arrive a whopping five seconds after they will. Notice you are doing something, then modify what you are doing.</p>

<p>When I finally put it together there was no grit-your-teeth effort required, it was just being consistently mindful of my goal, and therefore mindful as to whether my behavior was aligned with my goal. It required a light touch, not a heavy lift.</p><p>If “I” was there, I'd make the right decision. If I was on auto-pilot, I'd make the wrong decision. So my goal was no longer really to lose weight, it was simply to always be there.</p>

<![CDATA[From Zero to Encyrpted Secrets in 2 Minutes with SOPS and GPG]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>You probably heard about <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/sops">mozilla/sops</a>, but even if the readme is amazingly detailed, a from-scratch example is always nice to have.</p>

<p><code>sops</code>, in a nutshell, bridges the gap between various key management services (PGP, AWS KMS, GCP KMS, Azure Key Vault) and you.
This post will attempt to get you on your feet as fast as possible, in 3 simple steps: from “<em>I have no idea what to do with my hands</em>” to “<em>No way it’s that easy!</em>”.</p>

<p>Install the dependencies:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>brew <span>install </span>sops gnupg
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And run these 3-ish commands to convince yourself:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># Clone the example repository</span>
<span>$ </span>git clone https://github.com/ervinb/sops-gpg-example.git
<span>$ </span><span>cd </span>sops-gpg-example

<span># Import the encryption key</span>
<span>## The path is Keybase specific and it will work on any platform - no need to use your local filesystem path</span>
<span>$ </span>gpg <span>--import</span> &lt;<span>(</span>keybase fs <span>read</span> /keybase/team/sopsgpgexample/pgp/key.asc<span>)</span>
<span>## Or if you don't have Keybase set up yet</span>
<span>$ </span>gpg <span>--import</span> &lt;<span>(</span>curl <span>-L</span> https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ervinb/288c44a45cf2614a0684bea333b3aa36/raw/sops-gpg-example.asc<span>)</span>

<span># Decrypt and open the file</span>
<span>$ </span>sops secrets/mysecrets.dev.enc.yaml
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Your day-to-day interaction with this would be only the last line.</p>

<p><code>gpg --import</code> has to be executed only once, after which the key will be part of the local keychain
(persists reboots as well).
That’s literally all there is to it, after following the below steps.</p>

<h2 id="do-it-yourself">Do it yourself</h2>

<p>Start the stopwatch - we have 2 minutes.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Generate a PGP key
    <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span> gpg <span>--batch</span> <span>--generate-key</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>EOF</span><span>
  %no-protection
  Key-Type: default
  Subkey-Type: default
  Name-Real: Foo Bar
  Expire-Date: 0
</span><span>EOF
</span></code></pre></div>    </div>
    <p>The key is created without a passphrase because of the <code>%no-protection</code> option. Otherwise a <code>Passphrase: &lt;pass&gt;</code> would be required.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Create a sops configuration file with the key’s fingeprint. This is the ✨ magic ✨ ingredient,
which makes the onboarding so frictionless.
    <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>gpg <span>--list-keys</span>
pub   rsa2048 2020-12-06 <span>[</span>SC]
      7E6DC556C66C43D928A95EA3715A56B718EAF0B6
uid           <span>[</span>ultimate] Foo Bar
sub   rsa2048 2020-12-06 <span>[</span>E]
   
<span>$ </span><span>cat</span> .sops.yaml
creation_rules:
  - path_regex: secrets/.<span>*</span><span>\.</span>dev<span>\.</span>enc<span>\.</span>yaml<span>$</span>
    pgp: 7E6DC556C66C43D928A95EA3715A56B718EAF0B6
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>This is also perfect if you want more control over the secrets, like using different keys for different environments.
For example <code>secrets/*.dev.enc.yaml</code> could use one key, and <code>secrets/*.prod.enc.yaml</code> another one.
More details on this <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/sops#using-sops-yaml-conf-to-select-kms-pgp-for-new-files">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Use <code>sops</code> to edit and create new secrets
    <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>sops secrets/mysecrets.dev.enc.yaml
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>Then it just a question of distributing the keys to the right people and/or environment.
Which brings us to Keybase.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="note-for-linux-users">Note for Linux users</h4>

<p>I’ve found that both on Fedora and Ubuntu, for whatever reason, creating a new file with <code>sops</code> throws the following cryptic error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>sops secrets/new.dev.enc.yaml
&lt;save the file <span>in </span>the editor&gt;
File has not changed, exiting.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The solution is to create the file first and encrypt it in-place afterwards:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>vi secrets/new.dev.enc.yaml
<span>$ </span>sops <span>-i</span> <span>-e</span> secrets/new.dev.enc.yaml
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="distributing-the-key-to-firends-and-family">Distributing the key to firends and family</h2>

<p>To extract the PGP key from your local keychain, use:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>gpg <span>--list-keys</span>
<span>-------------------------------</span>
pub   rsa2048 2020-12-06 <span>[</span>SC]
      7E6DC556C66C43D928A95EA3715A56B718EAF0B6
uid           <span>[</span>ultimate] Foo Bar
sub   rsa2048 2020-12-06 <span>[</span>E]

<span>$ </span>gpg <span>--armor</span> <span>--export-secret-keys</span> 7E6DC556C66C43D928A95EA3715A56B718EAF0B6 <span>&gt;</span> key.asc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>--armor</code> makes it so that the output is ASCII (<code>.asc</code>) formatted, and not in binary (default).</p>

<p>One of the most seamless ways to distribute keys and other sensitive files is Keybase.
It has a low barrier of entry, and you can control the granularity of access with “teams”.
It also integrates nicely with the filesystem.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Install Keybase
    
  </li>
  <li>Create an account</li>
  <li>Store the secret key under a team’s folder</li>
</ol>

<p>After that, you grab the universal path and import the key to anywhere with <code>gpg</code> installed.</p>

<h2 id="use-it-in-your-applications">Use it in your applications</h2>

<p>To use the decrypted values in your application, you can just add a line to your setup scripts
to run</p>
<div><div><pre><code>sops <span>-d</span> secrets/mysecret.dev.enc.yaml <span>&gt;</span> configuration.yaml
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>(make sure to add the decrypted files to <code>.gitignore</code>)</p>

<p>For Terraform projects use <a href="https://github.com/carlpett/terraform-provider-sops">terraform-sops</a>, and if you’re into Terragrunt,
it has a built-in <a href="https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/built-in-functions/#sops_decrypt_file">sops_decrypt_file</a> function.</p>

<p>You will be running <code>sops</code> only to create or edit secrets, otherwise, it will be invisible (and incredible).</p>

<p>In this blog post, I will introduce you to a new tool, <a href="https://github.com/jsiebens/hashi-up" title="hashi-up" target="_blank">hashi-up</a>, I created to install a <a href="https://hashicorp.com/" title="HashiCorp" target="_blank">HashiCorp</a> Nomad cluster in a matter of minutes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This project is heavily inspired on the work of <a href="https://www.alexellis.io/" target="_blank">Alex Ellis</a> who created <a href="https://k3sup.dev/" target="_blank">k3sup</a>, a tool to to get from zero to KUBECONFIG with <a href="https://k3s.io/" target="_blank">k3s</a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>hashi-up is a lightweight utility to install HashiCorp <a href="https://www.consul.io/" target="_blank">Consul</a> and <a href="https://www.nomadproject.io/" target="_blank">Nomad</a> on any remote Linux host. All you need is <code>ssh</code> access and the binary <code>hashi-up</code> to build a Consul or a Nomad cluster.</p>

<p>The tool is written in Go and is cross-compiled for Linux, Windows, macOS and even on Raspberry Pi.</p>



<p>This tool uses <code>ssh</code> to install HashiCorp <code>Consul</code> or <code>Nomad</code> to a remote Linux host. You can also use it to join existing Linux hosts into a Consul or Nomad cluster. First, <code>Consul</code> or <code>Nomad</code> is installed using a utility script, along with a minimal configuration to run the agent as a server or a client.</p>

<p>hashi-up was developed to automate what can be a very manual and confusing process for many developers, who are already short on time. Once you’ve provisioned a VM with your favourite tooling, <code>hashi-up</code> means you are only 60 seconds away from running <code>nomad status</code> on your computer.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>The <code>hashi-up</code> tool is a client application which you can run on your computer. It uses SSH to connect to remote servers when installing HashiCorp Consul or Nomad. Binaries are available for macOS, Windows, and Linux (including ARM).</p>

<h3 id="setup-a-single-nomad-server">Setup a single Nomad server</h3>

<p>Provision a new VM with a compatible operating system such as Ubuntu, Debian, Raspbian, or something else. Make sure that you opt-in to copy your registered SSH keys over to the new VM or host automatically.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: You can copy ssh keys to a remote VM with <code>ssh-copy-id user@IP</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Imagine the IP was <code>192.168.0.100</code> and the username was <code>ubuntu</code>, then you would run this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">export IP<span>=</span><span>192</span>.168.0.100
hashi-up nomad install --ssh-target-addr $IP --ssh-target-user ubuntu --server</code></pre></div>
<p>When the command finishes, try to access Nomad using the UI at <a href="http://192.168.0.100:4646/" target="_blank">http://192.168.100:4646</a> or with the CLI:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">nomad agent-info -address<span>=</span>http://192.168.0.100:4646</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="join-some-agents-to-your-nomad-server">Join some agents to your Nomad server</h3>

<p>Let’s say you have a Nomad server up and running; now you can join one or more client agents to the cluster:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">export SERVER_IP<span>=</span><span>192</span>.168.0.100
export AGENT_1_IP<span>=</span><span>192</span>.168.0.105
export AGENT_2_IP<span>=</span><span>192</span>.168.0.106

hashi-up nomad install --ssh-target-addr $AGENT_1_IP --ssh-target-user ubuntu --client --retry-join $SERVER_IP
hashi-up nomad install --ssh-target-addr $AGENT_2_IP --ssh-target-user ubuntu --client --retry-join $SERVER_IP</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="create-a-multi-server-ha-setup">Create a multi-server (HA) setup</h3>

<p>Prepare, for example, three nodes and let’s say they have the following IP addresses:</p>

<ul>
<li>192.168.0.100<br></li>
<li>192.168.0.101<br></li>
<li>192.168.0.102</li>
</ul>

<p>With <code>hashi-up</code> it is quite easy to install 3 Nomad servers which will form a cluster:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">export SERVER_1_IP<span>=</span><span>192</span>.168.0.100
export SERVER_2_IP<span>=</span><span>192</span>.168.0.101
export SERVER_3_IP<span>=</span><span>192</span>.168.0.102

hashi-up nomad install --ssh-target-addr $SERVER_1_IP --ssh-target-user ubuntu --server --bootstrap-expect <span>3</span> --retry-join $SERVER_1_IP --retry-join $SERVER_2_IP --retry-join $SERVER_3_IP
hashi-up nomad install --ssh-target-addr $SERVER_2_IP --ssh-target-user ubuntu --server --bootstrap-expect <span>3</span> --retry-join $SERVER_1_IP --retry-join $SERVER_2_IP --retry-join $SERVER_3_IP
hashi-up nomad install --ssh-target-addr $SERVER_3_IP --ssh-target-user ubuntu --server --bootstrap-expect <span>3</span> --retry-join $SERVER_1_IP --retry-join $SERVER_2_IP --retry-join $SERVER_3_IP</code></pre></div>
<p>And of course, joining client agents is the same as above:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">export SERVER_1_IP<span>=</span><span>192</span>.168.0.100
export SERVER_2_IP<span>=</span><span>192</span>.168.0.101
export SERVER_3_IP<span>=</span><span>192</span>.168.0.102
export AGENT_1_IP<span>=</span><span>192</span>.168.0.105
export AGENT_2_IP<span>=</span><span>192</span>.168.0.106

hashi-up nomad install --ssh-target-addr $AGENT_1_IP --ssh-target-user ubuntu --client --retry-join $SERVER_1_IP --retry-join $SERVER_2_IP --retry-join $SERVER_3_IP
hashi-up nomad install --ssh-target-addr $AGENT_2_IP --ssh-target-user ubuntu --client --retry-join $SERVER_1_IP --retry-join $SERVER_2_IP --retry-join $SERVER_3_IP</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="create-a-multi-server-ha-setup-with-consul">Create a multi-server (HA) setup with Consul</h3>

<p>If a Consul agent is already available on the Nomad nodes, Nomad can use Consul the automatically bootstrap the cluster. So after installing a Consul cluster on all nodes, with <code>hashi-up</code> the cluster, as explained above, can be installed with the following commands:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">export SERVER_1_IP<span>=</span><span>192</span>.168.0.100
export SERVER_2_IP<span>=</span><span>192</span>.168.0.101
export SERVER_3_IP<span>=</span><span>192</span>.168.0.102
export AGENT_1_IP<span>=</span><span>192</span>.168.0.105
export AGENT_2_IP<span>=</span><span>192</span>.168.0.106

hashi-up nomad install --ssh-target-addr $SERVER_1_IP --ssh-target-user ubuntu --server --bootstrap-expect <span>3</span> 
hashi-up nomad install --ssh-target-addr $SERVER_2_IP --ssh-target-user ubuntu --server --bootstrap-expect <span>3</span> 
hashi-up nomad install --ssh-target-addr $SERVER_3_IP --ssh-target-user ubuntu --server --bootstrap-expect <span>3</span> 
hashi-up nomad install --ssh-target-addr $AGENT_1_IP --ssh-target-user ubuntu --client
hashi-up nomad install --ssh-target-addr $AGENT_2_IP --ssh-target-user ubuntu --client </code></pre></div>


<p>In this demo, I install a Nomad cluster onto eight separate DigitalOcean droplets. I takes only five minutes to get three Nomad servers and 5 Nomad clients up and running.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: in the demo, the Nomad agents will join with the <a href="https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/configuration/server_join#cloud_auto_join" target="_blank">Cloud Auto-join</a> option, instead of using IP addresses</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what’s next? Well, this project is very young and does require some improvements. At the time of writing, you can spin up a Consul or Nomad cluster with some basic configuration. Still, some additional flags and feature will be useful to build a production-ready cluster with <a href="https://github.com/jsiebens/hashi-up" target="_blank">hashi-up</a>. For instance, the tool does not have support to enable Gossip Communication encryption, Agent Communication TLS encryption and ACLs.</p>

<p>So stay tuned!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>update 2020-12-06</strong></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the hashi-up project progressed a little bit, and additional features like encryption and ACLs are available now. With the latest release, you could even install HashiCorp Vault using hashi-up.</p>

      Learning Scala - along with Groovy, Java and JVM ecosystem - was fun!
    </h3><p>
        Last updated on: <time>2020-12-06</time></p></header>

  

  

  <h3>Motivation</h3>

  <p>
    For the past two years I've been dabbling in DIY home automation. I ended up
    with a bunch of Raspberry PIs<sup><a id="ft_note_learning-scala_html_ft_1" data-tooltip-content="#ft_note_learning-scala_html_1">[1]</a></sup> all over the house, all running under Linux and connected via WiFi. They
    service some sensors and cameras, and show current date and time (among
    other dashboard-y things, like calendar or weather forecast) on a few
    displays around the house.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have a few Ansible<sup><a id="ft_note_learning-scala_html_ft_2" data-tooltip-content="#ft_note_learning-scala_html_2">[2]</a></sup> playbooks set up for running things like package- and system updates, but
    I still often <code>ssh</code> to the PIs for one-off tasks (in the beginning they all
    look like one-offs...) To do this comfortably, I installed ZSH<sup><a id="ft_note_learning-scala_html_ft_3" data-tooltip-content="#ft_note_learning-scala_html_3">[3]</a></sup> - my shell of choice - on the PIs, using the same <code>.zshrc</code> config
    everywhere. Just a handful of <code>if</code>s was enough to make my config portable,
    which was a pleasant surprise.
  </p>

  

  <p>
    One of the CLI tools I have set up in my <code>.zshrc</code> is <code>fzf</code><sup><a id="ft_note_learning-scala_html_ft_4" data-tooltip-content="#ft_note_learning-scala_html_4">[4]</a></sup>, which I use as a history search mechanism, replacing the
    default one under <code>Control + r</code>. It's incredibly useful, as it lets you
    narrow down the search incrementally and interactively, with fuzzy matching,
    which makes arriving at the intended command much faster than with the
    built-in search. You could say I got addicted to the ease of both browsing
    and searching through the shell history in an interactive manner. However,
    no matter what search method you use, <strong>if something's not there, you won't
    find it!</strong> That sounds trivial, but it connects to the topic of this
    post: how to merge ZSH history files.
  </p>

  <p>
    The use case should be clear by this point: very often, whatever I did on
    one PI, I would need to do, sooner or later, on one or two others. In such
    cases I, reflexively, tried to search for the needed command in the history
    of the <em>current shell</em>, which never saw that command... Obviously, I
    couldn't find it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Going through a few minutes of frustration a couple times was enough for me
    to start thinking about an automatic solution. How nice would it be if
    <em>something</em> gathered the histories from all the hosts and merged them
    into a single one, I thought.
  </p>

  <h3 id="learning-scala-why-scala-groovy-etc">Why Scala? Groovy? JVM?</h3>

  <p>
    As usual: by accident. It just so happened that I was learning Scala (and
    JVM in general) at the time for work, so I decided to use <em>the urge to
    automate</em> as a material for practice. As many of us do all the time, I
    thought, <q>how hard could it be?</q> and started setting up a project,
    which you can see on GitHub. In this post, I want to highlight nice things
    about Scala that I learned in the process.
  </p>

  <h3 id="learning-scala-gradle-project-setup">Project setup using Gradle</h3>

  <p>
    I'm not against the use of Scala build tool, <code>sbt</code>. I chose Gradle<sup><a id="ft_note_learning-scala_html_ft_5" data-tooltip-content="#ft_note_learning-scala_html_5">[5]</a></sup> simply because I had some prior experience with it, from my previous JVM
    project. That project had parts written in Java, Groovy, and Scala, and
    Gradle was the first tool we found which handled this case without tons of
    boilerplate code. Gradle has plugins for nearly everything, lightweight
    config syntax, and good performance. When starting the current project, I
    simply copy-pasted the <code>build.gradle</code> from the previous one, which was the
    fastest way to get started. The file looks roughly like this (click to
    unfold):

    You execute tasks configured in <code>build.gradle</code> with <code>gradle</code> command, which
    works kind of like <code>make</code> (or <code>gulp</code>, or <code>mix</code>, etc.). For example, the
    plugin called <code>'application'</code> defines a task called <code>'installDist</code>' which
    compiles and packages the project, giving you a script which starts your
    application. To compile and run the project in one go, I ended up with a
    following script, <code>run.sh</code>:

  <!--   use of the block syntax <code>{ expr; ... }</code>, which denotes a nullary lambda with -->

    It's worth noting that you can define your own tasks in <code>build.gradle</code>,
    using the full Groovy<sup><a id="ft_note_learning-scala_html_ft_6" data-tooltip-content="#ft_note_learning-scala_html_6">[6]</a></sup> language.

    Interactive shell is always nice to have, and one of the three, called
    Ammonite<sup><a id="ft_note_learning-scala_html_ft_7" data-tooltip-content="#ft_note_learning-scala_html_7">[7]</a></sup>,
    is a Scala equivalent of IPython<sup><a id="ft_note_learning-scala_html_ft_8" data-tooltip-content="#ft_note_learning-scala_html_8">[8]</a></sup>,
    and is a pleasure to work with - I used it extensively to experiment with
    unfamiliar libraries, for example.
  </p>

  <p>
    At this point the setup is done. Let's start examining the implementation.
  </p>

  <h3>Fetching history files with SCP &amp; Scala external commands</h3>

  <p>
    Recounting the problem: I have a number of hosts on the network, where I
    tend to log in via <code>ssh</code> - which means I have <code>authorized_keys</code> properly
    configured already. I would like the shell history, which is a plain text
    file, to be synchronized among all the hosts. To do this, I need to fetch
    the history files from the network, process them somehow and put the merged
    file back on the hosts.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this situation, using <code>scp</code><sup><a id="ft_note_learning-scala_html_ft_9" data-tooltip-content="#ft_note_learning-scala_html_9">[9]</a></sup> command seemed the easiest way of copying
    files across my network. It's not Scala-specific, but there's no need to
    reinvent the wheel and write custom networking code for something this
    simple. Fortunately, Scala has a simple DSL for running external programs
    built-in, in the <code>sys.process</code> namespace (see
    <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/sys/process/index.html">the docs</a>.)
  </p>

  <p>
    While the DSL is powerful - even chaining I/O of a sequence of programs
    (like what the <code>|</code> operator does in most shells) is possible - what I really
    needed was just a return code. If it's equal to <code>0</code>, we know the transfer
    finished successfully; anything else signifies an error. To execute a
    command and get the exit code, you use <code>!</code> method, implicitly added to
    <code>String</code>s and <code>Seq</code>s:

    <h3>Downloading multiple files at a time with parallel collections</h3>

    <p>
      Most of my PIs are connected via WiFi, some of the older ones even use the
      2.5Ghz network. The transfer is not slow enough to be irritating, but
      that's only if you need something from a single host. If you try
      downloading many files in sequence, the latency will add up to the level
      where it's noticeable.
    </p>

    <p>
      Scala provides a wonderful, high-level construct for parallelizing
      processing: <a href="https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/parallel-collections/overview.html">parallel
      collections</a>. Basically, whenever you have code which maps (or folds)
      a function over a collection, you can transform said collection into a
      parallel one. Parallel collections implement <code>map</code> method which executes
      given function on a pool of threads. The result is another parallel
      collection, which you can transform back into a normal one, which will
      have the results of computations, in the correct order. The <code>toList</code>
      method which does this blocks and waits for all the items in all the
      threads to finish being processed. It looks like this:

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Sometimes, I would need to generate GIFs from videos of certain file size limits, convert from one video format to another. While there are lots of online conversion tools available, they donâ€™t provide privacy for the data and usually they donâ€™t have too many options. FFmpeg, which is open source and has been used in all those online conversion tools, has become my companion.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I am going to introduce some basic usages of FFmpeg for video processing and conversion.</p>

<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>

<h4 id="ubuntu-1804-lts">Ubuntu 18.04 LTS</h4>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>apt-get update
<span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>apt-get <span>install </span>ffmpeg
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

<h4 id="video-samples">Video Samples</h4>

<p><a href="https://pixabay.com/">Pixabay</a> provides a lot of royalty-free images and videos. Letâ€™s get a 4K squirrel video from Pixabay.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>wget https://pixabay.com/videos/download/video-948_source.mp4
<span>$ </span><span>ls</span> <span>-lh</span> video-948_source.mp4 
<span>-rw-r--r--</span> 1 leimao leimao 52M Feb  3  2017 video-948_source.mp4
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This 10-second 4K MP4-format video takes 52MB.</p>

<h4 id="convert-video-to-gif">Convert Video to GIF</h4>

<p>We use the default settings to convert with multithreads to accelerate the process.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>ffmpeg <span>-i</span> video-948_source.mp4 <span>-threads</span> 16 video-948_source.gif
<span>$ </span><span>ls</span> <span>-lh</span> video-948_source.gif 
<span>-rw-r--r--</span> 1 leimao leimao 1.4G Dec 16 18:42 video-948_source.gif
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Holy! The size of the generated GIF is 1.4GB! We need to do something to reduce the size.</p>



<p>There are generally a couple of ways to achieve this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reduce resolution</li>
  <li>Reduce FPS (frame per second)</li>
  <li>Clip</li>
</ul>

<p>In this case, I did:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ ffmpeg -i video-948_source.mp4 -ss 1 -t 5 -vf fps=10,scale=480:-1 -threads 16 video-948_source.gif
$ ls -lh video-948_source.gif 
-rw-r--r-- 1 leimao leimao 3.1M Dec 16 18:54 video-948_source.gif
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>-ss</code> is the starting time of the video clip from the original video. In this case, it is 1 second.</li>
  <li><code>-t</code> is the duration of the video clip from the original video. In this case, it is 5 seconds.</li>
  <li><code>-vf</code> is the filter_graph. In this case, I set the FPS to be 10 and reduce the resolution to be 3840 Ã— 2160 to 480 Ã— 270.</li>
</ul>

<p>The size of the generated GIF this time is 3.1MB. This is quite suitable for many purposes.</p>

<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://leimao.github.io/images/blog/2019-12-16-FFmpeg-Video-Conversion/video-948_source.gif">
    <figcaption>The generated GIF from the Squirrel Video</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<h4 id="more-options">More Options</h4>

<p>FFmpeg could do conversions between different formats, such as MP4 to AVI, etc. Simply change the <code>gif</code> in the command to <code>avi</code> and you are all set.</p>



<p>There are also more sophisticated options from FFmpeg, please check <code>ffmpeg --help</code> for more details.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><h3>Docker's Second Death</h3></p><h3 id="feels-like-forever">Feels Like Forever</h3><p>Perhaps not quite forever, but the history with Docker <em>feels</em> really long in good and bad ways. I had joined Red Hat in the summer of 2015, the same summer that OpenShift 3.0 went GA. This was a remarkable event because it marked a redesign of the platform onto Kubernetes which itself had just gone to v1.0 (this is the same timeframe that GKE went GA, if you can believe it’s that old). Like many, I had no clue what Kubernetes or OpenShift were, and I definitely didn’t know much about Docker. I knew <em>of</em> containers. By fall I was neck deep in all three, and in love with the ecosystem a few months after.</p><p>The next spring was my first “real” encounter with Docker Inc. I didn’t attend Red Hat Summit 2016, but I distinctly remember that being the year that Docker really made its first outward antagonistic move against Red Hat OpenShift, at Red Hat’s own event. They were giving out the following shirt:</p><p><img src="https://www.tariqislam.com/images/dockerpatch.jpg" alt="docker-shirt"></p><p>To briefly summarize, this was an attack on Red Hat’s model of backporting patches to older versions of software (also known as “enterprise support”). Red Hat at that time shipped a version of Docker that was just slightly behind the latest cut, whereas Docker shipped their latest. I won’t go into the details of why that matters because there is still a debate today about whether backporting patches is better for an organization versus staying on the latest version of a thing (the latter has gotten considerably better in recent times). This was significant because up until that time, Docker was an integral part of the OpenShift narrative. We sold one with the other and the underlying assumption by most if not all of us was that Docker was just a great tech. In retrospect, this should have been expected as Docker Inc. started making its moves into the enterprise space and suddenly stopped being just great tech.</p><h3 id="it-was-inevitable">It Was Inevitable</h3><p>The early platform wars, as I call them, were primarily focused around OpenShift, Docker, and Pivotal. Pivotal had made significant inroads into enterprise organizations early on, and for good reason: the platform experience was pretty great. Couple that with Pivotal Labs and you had some pretty good mojo. Docker was the up and comer. It was the industry darling making a splash and it had the tech that everyone wanted or that everyone was already using. Kubernetes was still a bit of a question mark. I spent a lot of my time talking to organizations about the nuts and bolts of Kubernetes and why it mattered, or more accurately: why it should matter to them. The move by Docker to knock on OpenShift forced Red Hat messaging to over-index on Kubernetes and Linux over and above anything else. It worked and the industry caught up.</p><p>Docker, still in its industry darling state, responded quickly with Docker Swarm but never really caught on. Swarm was eventually overwhelmed (pun intended) by the uptake of Kubernetes across the industry, and this was when it died the first time: it lost the platform wars and became the very first commodity in the cloud native ecosystem. The second half of 2016 is really when Kubernetes edged out Swarm. This was made evident by the keynote demo at DockerCon 2017 in the following Spring when the presenters showcased Docker’s integration with Kubernetes on the big stage. Notably, that was the last “big” DockerCon that made a splash. From there on out, it was the Kubernetes/CNCF show.</p><h3 id="docker-debt">Docker Debt</h3><p>In all this time, Docker was always an integral part of Kubernetes. This was the relationship:</p><p><img src="https://www.tariqislam.com/images/dockershim.png" alt="dockershim"></p><p>And for the last 19 releases, that chain is what has been supported in Kubernetes. All that just to spin up a pod with a container in it. Docker went from necessity to technical debt. And out of all that, the community laboured until now where Docker will be deprecated in the next release of 1.20. The community has (rightfully) carried the technical debt of Docker for years to ensure the industry had what it needed for the most seamless experience given the ubiquity of the docker daemon. Here is what’s been around for a little while, but will be officially prime time in 1.20 and beyond:</p><p><img src="https://www.tariqislam.com/images/withoutdocker.png" alt="withoutdocker"></p><p>It’s a great simplification, and a return to consistency. To help visualize why this was necessary, I encourage you to view Docker as a platform abstraction on top of containers which are just an aggregate of some Linux constructs. Part of this abstraction involved an integration between the docker platform and containerd, the latter of which lives on today as arguably the most popular container runtime. Docker was never the runtime. Docker simply made containerd and other Linux constructs easy to work with so that container management would be a breeze. Instead of a dozen lines of code to create and deploy a running container, all you needed was:</p><pre><code>docker run
</code></pre><p>But like any platform, that convenience comes with a lot of bloat and technical debt. Especially over time. The removal of docker and the optimization of containerd marks a cultural shift of sorts for the cloud native landscape. None of this is meant to dismiss Docker Inc. Kubernetes today would not be where it is without Docker Inc. That’s a fact. The technologies and the competition that Docker Inc drove were some of the best things to ever happen to the industry. Now as far as turning a profitable business model out of open source technology goes, Docker Inc will likely be studied as a cautionary flash in the pan. Still, it’s important that we separate out the company’s contributions versus its business model. What’s left of the Docker platform, at this point, are its shadows within Kubernetes platforms. Though it does live on strongly within CI/CD ecosystems and, ostensibly, the inner loop of development thanks to the de facto standard Dockerfile. It is a testament to the power that Docker Inc once had, that its technology lived on far beyond the obsolescence of the company until community innovation caught up to it. With all the years of bloat baked into the platform, it’s really just a matter of time before other areas to the left of the platform shed the debt of the Docker daemon.</p><p>While it had an amazing journey and an indelible impact to the industry, practically speaking Docker is dead and dying.</p></div></div>]]>

Before jumping to any Kubernetes specifics, let's talk about the service discovery problem in general.</p>
<h2 id="service-discovery-problem">Service discovery problem</h2>
<p>In the world of web service development, it's a common practice to run multiple copies of a service at the same time. Every such copy is a separate instance of the service represented by a network endpoint (i.e. some <em>IP</em> and <em>port</em>) exposing the service API. Traditionally, virtual or physical machines have been used to host such endpoints, with the shift towards containers in more recent times. Having multiple instances of the service running simultaneously increases its availability and helps to adjust the service capacity to meet the traffic demand. On the other hand, it also complicates the overall setup - before accessing the service, a client (the term <em>client</em> is intentionally used loosely here; oftentimes a client of some service is another service) needs to figure out the actual IP address and the port it should use. The situation becomes even more tricky if we add the ephemeral nature of instances to the equation. New instances come and existing instances go because of the non-zero failure rate, up- and downscaling, or maintenance. That's how a so-called <strong><em>service discovery</em></strong> problem arises.</p>
<div>

</div>


<h2 id="server-side-service-discovery">Server-side service discovery</h2>
<p>A pretty common way of solving the service discovery problem is putting a load balancer <em>aka</em> reverse proxy (e.g. Nginx or HAProxy) in front of the group of instances constituting a single service. An address (i.e. DNS name or less frequently IP) of such a load balancer is a much more stable piece of information. It can be communicated to the clients on development or configuration stages and assumed invariable during a single client lifespan. Then, from the client standpoint, accessing the multi-instance service is no different from accessing a single network endpoint. In other words, <a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/server-side-discovery.html">the service discovery happens completely on the server-side</a>.</p>
<div>
    <p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/service-discovery-in-kubernetes/server-side-service-discovery.png" width="100%"></p><p><i>Server-side service discovery.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The load balancer abstracts the volatile set of service instances away from the clients. However, the load balancer itself needs to be aware of the up to date state of the service fleet. This can be achieved by adding a <a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/service-registry.html"><em>service registry</em></a> component. On the startup, an instance needs to be added to the registry database. Upon the termination, the instance needs to be removed from it. One of the main tasks of the load balancer is to dynamically update its routing rules based on the service registry information.</p>
<p>While it looks very appealing from the client standpoint, the server-side service discovery may quickly reveal its downsides, especially in highly-loaded environments. The load balancer component is a <strong>single point of failure and a potential throughput bottleneck</strong>. To overcome this, the load balancing layer needs to be designed with a reasonable level of redundancy. Additionally, the load balancer may <strong>need to be aware of all the communication protocols</strong> used between services and clients and there will be always an <strong>extra network hop</strong> on the request path.</p>
<h2 id="client-side-service-discovery">Client-side service discovery</h2>
<p>Can we solve the service discovery problem without introducing the centralized load balancing component? Sure! If we keep the <em>service registry</em> component around, we can teach the clients to look up the service instance addresses in the <em>service registry</em> directly. After fetching the full list of IP addresses constituting the service fleet, a client could pick up an instance based on the load balancing strategy at its disposal. In such a case, <a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/client-side-discovery.html">the service discovery would be happening solely on the client-side</a>. Probably the most prominent real-world implementation of the client-side service discovery is Netflix <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/eureka">Eureka</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/ribbon">Ribbon</a> projects.</p>
<div>
    <p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/service-discovery-in-kubernetes/client-side-service-discovery.png" width="100%"></p><p><i>Client-side service discovery.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The benefits of the client-side approach mostly come from the absence of the load balancer. There is neither a <strong>single point of failure</strong> nor a potential <strong>throughput bottleneck</strong> in the system design. There is also one less moving part which is usually a good thing and <strong>no extra network hops on the packet path</strong>.</p>
<p>However, as with the server-side service discovery, there are some significant drawbacks as well. Client-side service discovery <strong>couples clients with the <em>service registry</em></strong>. It <strong>requires some integration code</strong> to be written for every programming language or framework in your ecosystem. And obviously, this <strong>extra logic complicates the clients</strong>. There seem to be an effort to <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/service-proxy-pod-sidecar-oh-my/">offload the client-side service discovery logic to the service proxy sidecars</a> but that's already a different story...</p>
<h2 id="dns-and-service-discovery">DNS and service discovery</h2>
<p>Service discovery can be implemented in more than just two ways. There is a well-known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-configuration_networking#DNS-based_service_discovery">DNS-based service discovery (DNS-SD)</a> approach that actually even predates the massive spread of microservices. Quoting the Wikipedia, <i>"a client discovers the list of available instances for a given service type by querying the DNS PTR record of that service type's name; the server returns zero or more names of the form <code>&lt;Service&gt;.&lt;Domain&gt;</code>, each corresponding to a SRV/TXT record pair. The SRV record resolves to the domain name providing the instance..."</i> and then another DNS query can be used to resolve a chosen instance's domain name to the actual IP address. Wow, so many layers of indirection, sounds fun 🙈</p>
<p>I never worked with DNS-SD, but to me, it doesn't sound like full-fledged service discovery. Rather, DNS is used as a <em>service registry</em>, and then depending on the dislocation of the code that knows how to query and interpret DNS-SD records, we can get either a <a href="https://github.com/benschw/srv-lb">canonical client-side</a> or a <a href="https://www.haproxy.com/blog/dns-service-discovery-haproxy/">canonical server-side</a> implementation.</p>
<p>Alternatively, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_DNS">Round-robin DNS</a> can be (ab)used for service discovery. Even though it was originally designed for load balancing, or rather load distribution, having multiple A records for the same hostname (i.e. service name) returned in a rotating manner implicitly abstracts multiple replicas behind a single service name.</p>
<p>In any case, <strong>DNS has a significant drawback when used for service discovery</strong>. Updating DNS records is a slow procedure. There are <strong>multiple layers of caches</strong>, including the client-side libraries, and historically record's TTL isn't strictly respected. As a result, propagating the change in the set of service instances to all the clients can take a while.</p>
<h2 id="entering-kubernetes-realm">Entering Kubernetes realm</h2>
<p>First, let's play an analogy game!</p>
<p>If I were to draw some analogies between Kubernetes and more traditional architectures, I'd compare Kubernetes <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/"><em>Pods</em></a> with service instances. <em>Pods</em> are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/k0zc0m/kubernetes_pods_are_logical_hosts_or_simply/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">many things</a> to <a href="https://twitter.com/iximiuz/status/1331630336707596288?s=20">many people</a>, however, when it comes to networking <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/#the-kubernetes-network-model">the documentation clearly states that</a> <i>"...Pods can be treated much like VMs or physical hosts from the perspectives of port allocation, naming, service discovery, load balancing, application configuration, and migration."</i></p>
<p>If <em>Pods</em> correspond to individual instances of a service, I'd expect a similar analogy for the <em>service</em>, as a logical grouping of instances, itself. And indeed there is a suitable concept in Kubernetes called... surprise, surprise, a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/"><em>Service</em></a>. <i>"In Kubernetes, a Service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them (sometimes this pattern is called a micro-service)."</i></p>
<p>Strengthening the analogy, the set of Pods making up a Service should be also considered ephemeral because neither the Pods' headcount nor the final set of IP addresses is stable. Thus, in Kubernetes, the problem of providing a reliable <strong>service discovery</strong> remains actual.</p>
<p>While creating a new Service, one should choose a name that will be used to refer to the set of Pods constituting the service. Among other things, the Service maintains an up to date list of IP addresses of its Pods organized as an <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/glossary/?all=true#term-endpoints"><em>Endpoints</em></a> (or <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/endpoint-slices/"><em>EndpontSlice</em></a> since Kubernetes 1.17) object. <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#cloud-native-service-discovery">Citing the documentation</a> one more time, <i>"...if you're able to use Kubernetes APIs for service discovery in your application, you can query the API server for Endpoints,</i> [I guess using the Service name] <i>that get updated whenever the set of Pods in a Service changes."</i> Well, sounds like an invitation to implement a <del>cloud-native</del> Kubernetes-native client-side service discovery with the Kubernetes control plane playing (in particular) the role of the <em>service registry</em>.</p>
<div>
    <p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/service-discovery-in-kubernetes/kube-native-service-discovery.png" width="100%"></p><p><i>Kubernetes-native client-side service discovery.</i></p>
</div>

<p>However, the only real-world usage of this mechanism I've stumbled upon so far was in the <a href="https://linkerd.io/2020/07/23/under-the-hood-of-linkerds-state-of-the-art-rust-proxy-linkerd2-proxy/#the-life-of-a-request"><em>service mesh</em></a> kind of software. It's a bit unfair to mention it here though because <em>service mesh</em> itself is needed to provide, in particular, the service discovery mechanism for its users. So, if you're aware of the client-side service discovery implementations leveraging Kubernetes Endpoints API please drop a comment below.</p>
<p>Luckily, as with many other things in Kubernetes, there's more than one way <del>to skin a cat</del> to get the service discovery done. And the applications that weren't born cloud-native (i.e. 99% of them) will likely find the next service-discovery mechanism much more appealing.</p>
<h2 id="network-side-service-discovery">Network-side service discovery</h2>
<p><i>Disclaimer: I've no idea if there is such thing as <em>network-side</em> service discovery in other domains and I've never seen the usage of this term in the microservices world. But I find it funny and suitable for the purpose of this paragraph.</i></p>
<p>In Kubernetes, the name of a Service object must be a valid <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#dns-label-names">DNS label name</a>. It's not a coincidence. When the DNS add-on is enabled (<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#dns">and I guess it's almost always the case</a>), every Service gets a DNS record like <code>&lt;service-name&gt;.&lt;namespace-name&gt;</code>. Obviously, this name can be used by applications to access the service and it simplifies the life of the clients to the highest possible extent. A single well-known address behind every Service <strong>eradicates the need for any service discovery logic on the client-side</strong>.</p>
<p>However, as we already know, DNS is often ill-suited for service discovery and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#why-not-use-round-robin-dns">the Kubernetes ecosystem is not an exception</a>. Therefore, instead of using round-robin DNS to list Pods' IP addresses, Kubernetes introduces one more IP …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    

<p>This year I thought about building my ideas and I’ve already done a post on “Drone Trails” and the motivation behind it. The part I didn’t speak about much is how hard it was to develop. I started building around March, released my app in September on iOS. 10 months later I’ll finally have the Android app ready.</p>

<p>What ticks me off in the entire process is the time it takes to learn, build and create mobile apps. This is a whole new world to be honest. A lot of the process is very discouraging because to me the thing that makes coding interesting is “You get to see what you build <em>quickly</em>”. It’s that dopamine hit that keeps me going and when that disappears (the tipping point) - the motivation to finish something is entirely driven by will power and no longer the passion for the idea.</p>

<p>There are areas and choices of implementation that will make life easier here but honestly if there is a tool out there to help me build and design quickly - I would try it in an instant (and there isn’t IMO).</p>

<h3 id="the-build-tools">The build tools</h3>

<p>This is by far the most frustrating part of the process. To build a crud app with some basic server functionality including hooking up firebase - I needed about dozens of dependencies and building the app took ~ 20 mins every time I needed to do. Why is compiling such a pain ? It’s the most visible component in terms of building/iterating quickly and this is the part that takes up most of the time.</p>

<p>The dependency management tool is janky at times that you need to unlink and link them back. Worse - it shits the bed and XCode complains about stuff you didn’t even know existed in your app. It takes much of your time to understand this and about the time you figure this out, you have other problems of managing your release environments to test things quickly.</p>

<p>It takes scripts and Makefile recipes to make this happen quickly. Why can’t this be so much easier ? I learned you can circumvent this issue by using React Native which I ended up doing because I didn’t want to do Kotlin and spend 3 months learning that.</p>

<h3 id="the-app-specific-concepts">The app specific concepts</h3>

<p>I come from an DevOps/Infra engineer background - so mobile app building was something new to me. There are tons of resources out there explaining how to build but nothing that talks about the why. On top of this - there are some programming paradigms that’s very specific to apps that makes life even more trickier. I had trouble understanding:</p>
<ul>
  <li>delegate pattern</li>
  <li>cocoapod dependency management</li>
  <li>property setters and observables</li>
  <li><em>design</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The last point is something I’m going to stress on. There is a certain acumen one needs to develop to build something <em>useful</em>. By useful - I mean something that can be tolerated by your users. This is not the same as knowing how to build because you have to understand why you have to build here.</p>

<p>I can build the worst UI experience with some really good functionality and lose the narrative. You want to learn those and that takes time. My 2 cents on people building curriculum around app development - include design and user experience. It’s underrated and taken so lightly that judgements like “Design can’t be so hard” will bite you for sure.</p>

<p>Don’t even get me started on UI building in Android - that stuff still uses xml and is way behind when the tool chain that makes iOS so good. I quickly resorted to React native for building the Android app. I will wrote more there in a new post since I was pleasantly surprised I could replicate functionality in 2 weeks.</p>

<h3 id="will-no-code-tools-solve-this-">Will No-code tools solve this ?</h3>

<p>I don’t think so. You need something in the middle. The grass looks greener thinking about non-engineer customer base here but it is equally greener on this side of the field too :)</p>

<p>You are looking at folks who want to build the courage to try out ideas outside of their regular jobs. <em>Saving time</em> is the most valuable thing you can buy then from a development perspective. Prototyping takes precedence and feedback becomes equally important.</p>

<p>There isn’t a single tool out there that hits this sweet spot including feedback. It’s extremely hard to get noticed and it is even harder to get testers. I would totally get on the bandwagon if something out there provides all this functionality.</p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>There are tons of tools out there to make life easier but finding and selecting one is a challenge. If your app is slightly non-trivial - the research needed exponentially rises. There are fewer resources out there that points you to the bits you should care about. Build tutorials that teaches fundamentals because questioning the why(s) is even harder than teaching the how(s).</p>

<p>Screen image captured at Beijing Aerospace Control Center in Beijing, capital of China, Dec. 6, 2020 shows the rendezvous and docking of the ascender of China's Chang'e-5 probe with the orbiter-returner combination. The ascender of China's Chang'e-5 probe successfully rendezvoused and docked with the orbiter-returner combination in lunar orbit at 5:42 a.m. (Beijing Time) on Sunday, the China National Space Administration (CNSA) has announced. This is the first time Chinese spacecraft have carried out rendezvous and docking in lunar orbit. (Xinhua/Jin Liwang) </p><p>&nbsp;After a successful liftoff from the lunar surface and rendezvous in lunar orbit, China's Chang'e-5 lunar probe docked with the orbital module on Sunday, with the lunar samples safely transferred to the return capsule, China's first successful attempt at such a maneuver made possible by cutting-edge technologies.&nbsp;</p><p>It is a visionary endeavor that lays a technological foundation for future deep-space exploration, observers said.&nbsp;</p><p>The probe's ascender successfully docked with the orbital module in lunar orbit on Sunday at 5:42 am, some 380,000 kilometers from the Earth, and completed the lunar sample transfer at 6:12 am from the ascender to the return capsule, the Global Times learned from the China National Space Administration (CNSA).&nbsp;</p><p>It is the first time China has achieved a probe rendezvous and docking in lunar orbit. Under autonomous control from the probe and long-distance guidance from the command team in ground control, the orbital module approached the ascender after it launched from the moon, and captured it in a smooth operation.&nbsp;</p><p>The return capsule carrying the lunar materials weighing two kilograms separated from the orbital module in lunar orbit at 12:35 pm on Sunday, and now it is waiting for a suitable window to return to the Earth, CNSA said.&nbsp;</p><p>The docking maneuver was described by Chinese netizens as "a kiss from space," as thousands of stargazers watch every step of the probe's odyssey. Space fans have witnessed several major breakthroughs in China's aerospace history.&nbsp;</p><p>Sources close to the mission previously told the Global Times that the Chang'e-5 probe is set to achieve four firsts in China's aerospace history.&nbsp;</p><p>It has already achieved three of these, including the first-ever robotic sample collecting on lunar surface, a complex takeoff from the rough lunar terrain, and most challenging of all, the rendezvous and docking in lunar orbit.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the most crucial devices applied during the spacecraft's docking maneuver was a pair of microwave radars, installed on both the ascender and the orbiter, which helps measure and adjust the positions of the two sections under fast-changing distances, and transmit data during the process.&nbsp;</p><p>This technology has been applied previously to multiple rendezvous and docking operations in low Earth orbit, including the crewed Shenzhou mission.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it is the first time the technology has been tried in lunar orbit 380,000 kilometers from the Earth, with the maneuver becoming a world-leading innovation in the aerospace field.&nbsp;</p><p>"Compared with low-Earth orbit, satellite services can't be used for navigation in lunar orbit. The only means of communication is through microwave radar," said Sun Wu, chief engineer of the technology.

<hr>

<p>
The boss needed item 3 inserted into a numbered list of hundreds of items.
The intern used a mouse to select the original 3 on the screen,
then typed 4,
then selected the original 4,
then typed 5,
then scrolled down,
then selected the original 5,
then typed 6,
and so on.
Another intern sat watching the screen to make sure there were no mistakes.
</p>
<p>
I happened to be in the room for other reasons.
I remember the horror of watching the beginning of this barbaric editing process.
Those poor interns!
</p>
<p>
When I enter a list of items into the computer,
what I'm typing doesn't look like
</p>
<pre>     1. ...
     2. ...
     3. ...
</pre>
<p>
but more like
</p>
<pre>     * ...
     * ...
     * ...
</pre>
<p>
Each asterisk is a special command to the computer,
telling the computer to automatically display the next number for the reader.
The reader eventually sees
</p>
<pre>     1. ...
     2. ...
     3. ...
</pre>
<p>
but that isn't what I typed.
This small difference produces a tremendous savings of time
whenever I insert an item, or delete an item, or move an item.
</p>
<p>
If I decide later
to skip the numbers
and use bullets instead,
I tell the computer
to introduce each list item with a bullet.
This is one command covering the whole list.
There's also a command that does the same thing
for the whole document.
There isn't separate work for each item.
It's no problem if a coauthor
later wants to change bullets back to numbers.
</p>
<p>
The interns, I suppose,
would be manually changing "1." and "2." and "3."
and so on to "•" and "•" and "•" and so on.
Or maybe they would be trying to figure out
how some search-and-replace feature could do the same thing;
let's hope the document doesn't have a sentence somewhere
that talks about something that happened in the year 2001.
Or maybe the interns would be quitting and finding a better job.
</p>
<p>
[Note added 2020.12.07:
I was expecting that many of my readers
would already be accustomed to relying on the computer
for automatic numbering.
I was surprised, however,
to see some comments along the lines of "Inconceivable!"
from readers unable to imagine
how the interns could have been in a different situation,
going through such a shockingly inefficient revision process.
Here's a hint:
Each item in the list looked like a flush-left paragraph,
like the paragraphs in this blog post,
adjacent to the left margin.
The text being selected by the mouse,
for example to change "3" to "4",
was to the right of the margin,
like the rest of the text in each item.]
</p>
<p>
<b>Abstraction as a time-saver for authors.</b>
This use of asterisks
is just one example of how I'm often typing something more abstract
than what's seen by the ultimate reader.
I don't type "Figure 12" or "see [41]", for example;
I type things like "Figure \ref{network-measurements}" and "see \cite{multiplication-survey}",
and I let the computer automatically convert
"\ref{network-measurements}" and "\cite{multiplication-survey}"
into numbers to display for the reader.
</p>
<p>
With one extra command,
covering the entire document,
I can tell the computer
to include section numbers
as part of all figure numbers in the document,
so that the figures are easier for the reader to find:
e.g., Figures 3.1 and 3.2 and 3.3 are in Section 3.
With another command,
again covering the entire document,
I can tell the computer
to cite all authors by name rather than by number.
</p>
<p>
As another example,
I was recently editing a mathematical paper,
and I decided that a particular concept
would be easier for the reader to remember
if I changed the notation that I was using for the concept.
The notation was all over the paper,
but this change took just a few seconds of editing.
I had given a name to the concept,
had told the computer <i>once</i> to display this name as a particular notation,
and had then typed this name throughout the paper,
so there was only one place where I had to change the notation.
</p>
<p>
Of course one can't,
and shouldn't try to,
prepare in advance for <i>every</i> possible change to a document.
But it's not hard to prepare for the most likely changes.
This small initial effort
saves a tremendous amount of time later.
When I say "small",
I'm including the effort to select a document-creation system
that's designed to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">make this sort of thing easy</a>.
</p>
<p>
(As a side note,
programmers will recognize this strategy
as an example of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information%5Fhiding">information hiding</a>
strategy introduced by Parnas,
and will recognize that modern program-creation systems
are designed to make this easy.)
</p>
<p>
Microsoft Word isn't completely missing abstractions,
but these abstractions
are competing for user-interface resources
against features encouraging the user
to work at lower abstraction layers.
The extra effort to use the abstractions
ends up pushing users into doing something simpler,
something that just works now,
and paying heavily for this choice
later when the document is being revised.
</p>
<p>
Have I done a scientific study
<i>proving</i> that Microsoft Word
is less efficient than LaTeX?
No.
I'd love to see a careful study of this topic.
Short-term,
this would help guide new authors to make sensible choices.
Longer-term,
insights from this sort of study could be the basis for further improving
our document-creation systems.
I certainly don't think that the existing systems are perfect.
(<a href="https://cr.yp.to/writing/visual.html">Example.</a>)
</p>
<p>
Imagine, however, that a study looks only at
<i>the time for someone looking at a printout to create a document matching this printout</i>.
This would be blind to the time for subsequent edits.
This would be blind to the suffering of those interns.
This would incorrectly conclude that typing
"1. ... 2. ... 3. ..." and "see [41]"
is more efficient than typing
"* ... * ... * ..." and "see \cite{multiplication-survey}".
It <i>is</i> slightly more efficient in this limited metric,
but it is much less efficient in the metric that matters,
namely the total time spent by the user.
</p>
<p>
<b>An example of a "scientific" study.</b>
At this point you're probably thinking that
nobody could possibly miss such an obvious issue.
This brings me to the main topic of this blog post,
a 2014 peer-reviewed study
<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0115069">"An Efficiency Comparison of Document Preparation Systems Used in Academic Research and Development"</a>
by two psychologists,
Knauff and Nejasmic ("KN").
</p>
<p>
Participants in the study were given a page of text
and were given a limited time to type the page into the computer.
There were three different types of text:
</p>
<ul>
<li>simple prose with a few footnotes;
</li>
<li>a page with a complicated table of data;
and
</li>
<li>a page with many mathematical formulas.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Participants were scored
on the basis of how much text they typed and how accurately they typed it.
The time was so rushed that a significant fraction of participants
didn't finish typing the whole page,
even for the case of simple prose.
</p>
<p>
The study considered two document-creation systems:
LaTeX and Microsoft Word,
in each case with "all tools, editors, plug-ins, and add-ons"
that participants were "accustomed to using".
Of course different "add-ons" could have different efficiency,
and of course there are other document-creation systems,
but these are topics for another blog post.
</p>
<p>
The study produced many pages of results,
which I'll summarize by saying that
Word did slightly better on the prose
and much better on the table,
while LaTeX did better on the formulas.
The study authors made no effort to measure any subsequent document-editing step.
</p>
<p>
<b>Slithering from one metric to another.</b>
The fundamental mistake in the KN paper
is the change of cost metric.
</p>
<p>
The original question was how efficiently authors are creating documents:
in particular, how efficiently authors are creating academic research papers.
KN claimed in their title to be comparing "efficiency"
of "document preparation systems used in academic research".
But they then quietly changed this metric in three ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
They considered only the efficiency of an initial fragment of the document-creation process,
ignoring the time spent revising documents.
They provided no reason to believe that the efficiency of this fragment
was well correlated with what they had previously claimed to be measuring.
Nothing in their paper acknowledges
the most obvious reason for a negative correlation,
namely that slightly more work at the outset
makes revisions much easier later.
In my experience,
document-creation systems vary in how well they support this work.
</li>
<li>
KN didn't even measure the time taken for this initial fragment of the process.
Instead they imposed a rushed time limit,
and measured how incomplete and inaccurate the resulting document was.
Again they provided no reason to believe that what they measured
was well correlated with what they had previously claimed to be measuring.
Perhaps they were assuming that more mistakes will take more time to fix,
but my experience is that some types of mistakes are much easier to fix than others,
and that document-creation systems vary in the types of mistakes they encourage.
</li>
<li>
KN didn't even measure creating a <i>new</i> document,
which is what academics are actually spending their time doing.
People who were writing papers in the age of typewriters
will remember writing and editing papers <i>by hand</i>
before tediously typing the final pages,
but that was because editing a typed page
ranged from annoying
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correction%5Ffluid">white-out</a>,
or sometimes scissors and tape)
to super-annoying
(retyping the whole page).
Today the initial writing on paper is skipped,
and typing is interleaved in small chunks
with parts of the author's thought process,
making the typing process much less boring.
I'm continually re-reading
and thinking about what I just typed.
Is the error rate of the academic's modern typing process
well correlated with the error rate of the
archaic retyping process that KN measured?
Again KN provide no reason to believe this.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Did KN use the honest title
"A comparison of the unreliability of
rushed retyping of a page
using document preparation systems
that are also used for academic research and development"?
No.
Would you expect a journal to accept a paper
with such a title?
</p>
<p>
Instead they used a title …</p></div>

<p>tls-redirector is a tiny HTTP server written in Go that is designed to run on
port 80 and redirect all incoming traffic to HTTPS. It does this by emitting a
301 Permanent Redirect where the scheme is simply replaced with "https".</p>
<p>This is intended to separate out responsibilities from the software that
listens on port 443 and serves your website. Because you have tls-redirector
on port 80, you do not need to configure HTTP to HTTPS redirects; simplifying
configuration for Apache, nginx, or whatever web server you use.</p>
<p>Furthermore, most crawlers and bots will actually connect to port 80 without a
meaningful Host header. As tls-redirector cannot be configured, it can only
politely tell them to go away, whereas your primary web server likely sends
them to the "default server" which may well redirect them to your website,
opening you up to being scanned. This causes tons of noise in your log files.</p>
<p>Because it uses the Host header, tls-redirector is truly zero-config. Set it
up once and forget about it.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Building without that tag will produce a binary that only has TCP/IP support.</p>
<h3 id="possible-caveats"><a href="#possible-caveats" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>Possible Caveats</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <code>Host</code> header is required to redirect - there's no way to configure a
default - and visitors without one will simply see an error message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only a single ACME challenge directory can be served, as the <code>Host</code> header
is ignored, so if you have multiple domains or servers on the same machine,
you may want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider using DNS based ACME challenges.</li>
<li>Store all your HTTP based ACME challenges in the same directory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="configuration"><a href="#configuration" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>Configuration</h3>
<p>Behavior may be configured through the following environmental variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>PORT</code>. TCP/IP port number to listen on. If not specified, port 80 is used
OR systemd socket activation is detected and used.</p>
<p>You can force tls-redirector to use socket activation with <code>PORT=systemd</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ACME_CHALLENGE_DIR</code> Path to a directory on disk to serve at the
path <code>/.well-known/acme-challenge</code>. All files are served as <code>text/plain</code> and
is intended to provide support for HTTP based ACME challenges if necessary.</p>
<p>Setting this to <code>/tmp</code> means tls-redirector will look for files in that
directory. This differs slightly from the <code>--webroot</code> command of EFF certbot
because certbot expects to be at the root, and tls-redirector does not.
Therefore, when you setup certbot, if you have the following:</p>
<p><code>certbot --webroot /var/www</code></p>
<p>You should set TLS Redirector to:</p>
<p><code>ACME_CHALLENGE_DIR=/var/www/.well-known/acme-challenge</code></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p>I'm about to write an essay about how I think Apple could make their 30% cut on App Store sales very worth it to developers, but I thought it was worth doing a quick, dense review first on the history and contentiousness of this "tax".</p><h3>Why 30%?</h3><ul><li>"There was some precedent; Apple <strong>had been charging roughly the same commission on music sales</strong> on its iTunes software. For each 99 cent song it sold, Apple passed on 72 cents to major music labels and 62 cents to independent labels, according to The Wall Street Journal in 2007."</li><li>When Apple began setting rules for the App Store, “30 percent was just kind of a no-brainer,” said Mr. Shoemaker, who joined the company in early 2009. “It was, ‘Of course that’s what we’re going to use.’ Nobody questioned it.”</li></ul><p>Both from this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/technology/apple-app-store-epic-games-fortnite.html">NYT piece</a>.</p><h3>What does it cost Apple?</h3><ul><li>Apple charges a 30% cut of app sales and in-app purchases to developers and now 15% to developers making under $1m annually (small devs make for 5% of overall revenue). <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction">[source 1]</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/18/technology/apple-app-store-fee.html">[source 2]</a></li><li>Apple doesn't release the cost to operate the app store, but they essentially provide the <strong>same service for Mac for a fixed price of ~$100/year</strong> (which developers also pay for iOS). So it should be safe to assume that the fixed price covers it.</li></ul><h3>How much do they make from it?</h3><ul><li>Apple brings in $50 billion a year from app sales so this comes out to about $15b a year, which is a nontrivial <strong>~14.2% of their 2020 profit</strong> of $105b <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/gross-profit">[source]</a><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/07/apple-app-store-had-estimated-gross-sales-of-50-billion-in-2019.html#:~:text=Apple's%20App%20Store%20platform%20grossed,Store%20alone%20would%20be%20no.">[source]</a></li></ul><h3>Why were developers ok with this in the first place?</h3><ul><li>It's unprecedented in software for developers to pay a % fees to the OS owners. Normally, OS owners have had to appease developers to build killer apps for their platforms.</li><li>But iPhone was so far ahead of the competition at launch in 2007 out of the box that <strong>it reversed the dynamic and developers wanted to be on the platform instead</strong>. Then, they got used to the 30% and Android followed suit because Android doesn't <em>directly</em> compete with iPhone (see below).</li></ul><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/sPyZIulyNnxjXdxx.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2018-08-16-at-11.00.12-AM-1024x534.png"></p><h3>Why can Apple still charge this much?</h3><ul><li>Apple is not technically a monopoly because consumers have the choice of Android. But <strong>Android and iOS users are very distinct demographics that don't switch</strong>, and Apple users are far more willing to pay money for apps.</li></ul><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/JoTarglFpKLOrCbW.png" alt="Untitled.png"></p><p><a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/despite-androids-massive-market-share-ios-still-makes-more-money-for-developers/"></a>Source: <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/despite-androids-massive-market-share-ios-still-makes-more-money-for-developers/">Neowin</a></p><ul><li>Android has far more users but they pay a lot less, while Apple has a low fewer users but they pay a lot more, resulting in overall revenues being about even.</li></ul><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/uoeFazIlqcKIzUkh.png" alt="Untitled (1).png"></p><p><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/beachheads-and-obstacles/"></a>Source: <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/beachheads-and-obstacles/">Stratechery</a></p><h3>Does Google (or anyone else) have incentive to lower their cut and compete?</h3><ul><li>Not really, let's say developers save money and pass them on to their Android customers, customers have already demonstrated willingness to pay more than a (100/70 = 1.42x) premium for Apple's products, mostly due to their tight integration with other Apple hardware and focus on privacy.</li><li>We've already seen competing app platforms like Windows Phone fail. Apps are very long-tailed in their usage and the long tail of developers don't have resources to build for yet another platform (except perhaps the web).</li></ul><h3>Is the web viable competition to apps?</h3><ul><li>Not really for apps that solve <a href="https://insightbrowser.com/blog/open-web-dying-why-care"><em>familiar problems</em></a> —  the web can't do several important things that native apps can, e.g. notifications, bluetooth, NFC, etc. <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/07/apple-fingerprinting-privacy/">Some claim</a> that Apple and Google are deliberately crippling web browser standards to keep it this way because because they own iOS/Android and exert a lot of influence on W3C as owners of Safari and Chrome.</li><li>But increasingly, it can do more than you expect and some big companies stand to make/save a lot of money by delivering their apps through the web. Amazon is offering its cloud gaming service <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21455343/amazon-luna-apple-app-store-rules-cloud-gaming-streaming-google-nvidia">on iOS through the browser</a>, and technically, it can work!

In particular, Fortnite <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/epic-lawsuit-vs-apples-30-app-store-cut-aims-for-leverage-pressure-and-a-better-deal/">flouted</a> this rule and offered discounts to users paying them directly and Apple took them off the App Store. Fortnite is a beloved and popular game so this generated lots of public sentiment against Apple.</li></ul><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/NRpDvTfoYxoQggBK.png" alt="epic-app-store (1).png"></p><ul><li>Apple terms don't let developers tell users that their prices are inflated because of this cut and that they can get the same service for cheaper. Facebook, for example, had to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21405140/apple-rejects-facebook-update-30-percent-cut">charge users more for attending real-life events</a> if they bought a ticket on an iPhone, though they now have a temporary relief.</li></ul><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/klSCdbpBnYIaJDLw.jpg" alt="Eobp-R4UwAAUef_.jpeg"></p><p>The best summary I can offer is this <a href="https://emojipedia.org/index-pointing-up/">☝️</a> illustration, and another quote from the NYT <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/technology/apple-app-store-epic-games-fortnite.html">piece</a>.</p><blockquote>“I think we’re realizing that 30 percent is way too much,” said Phillip Shoemaker, a former senior App Store executive, who left Apple in 2016. Credit card companies charge roughly 3 percent to process payments. “It should be closer to that,” he said.<a href="https://emojipedia.org/index-pointing-up/">
</a></blockquote><h3>Do developers have enough leverage to change Apple's mind?</h3><ul><li>Small developers (ones making under $1m ARR) don't financially but because they are a large number, they probably matter from a public sentiment point of view. They only make up for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/18/technology/apple-app-store-fee.html">5% of the revenue</a>. Apple also <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/11/apple-announces-app-store-small-business-program/">recently reduced</a> their take to 15% for small developers.</li><li>Big developers have mostly been OK playing by Apple's rules or making special deals, but that may change with new incentives and more regulation?</li></ul><h3>Who has special deals with Apple?</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348108/apple-amazon-prime-video-app-store-special-treatment-fee-subscriptions">Amazon has a reduced rate of 15% with Apple for Prime Video subscriptions</a>.</li><li><a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/apple-facebook-live-events-waives-30-percent-tax-gaming-1234783624/">Facebook temporarily isn't paying for live events.</a></li></ul><h3>What about ad revenue?</h3><ul><li>Notably, Apple does not take a cut of ad revenue made on apps running on iOS, thereby increasing the incentive to be a free app monetized by ads.</li></ul><h3>What big companies are likely to keep complaining?</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.timetoplayfair.com/">Spotify, they directly struggle to compete with Apple Music</a>, and it'll likely get even harder with Apple's bundled Apple One.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/31/netflix-stops-paying-the-apple-tax-on-its-853m-in-annual-ios-revenue/"></a> Apple has this <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/03/addressing-spotifys-claims/">response</a> to Spotify.</li><li>Amazon and Google now both own cloud gaming platforms that they would presumably want on iOS, and gaming accounts for 77% of app revenue right now, so there's lots of money at stake. <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/app-revenues/">[source]</a></li><li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/31/netflix-stops-paying-the-apple-tax-on-its-853m-in-annual-ios-revenue/">Netflix</a>, maybe. For now they don't allow signing up via the app. They've probably done the calculation that most users will be ok signing up with an untaxed platform, then logging in with iOS.</li></ul><h3>So, will Apple reduce its cut?</h3><ul><li>Unlikely unless it comes from regulatory pressure, which Apple is trying to mitigate with restructuring as a progressive tax with a 15% cut for small developers.</li><li>It'll be interesting to follow the development of cloud gaming and if that gets Amazon and Google to exercise more of their muscle.</li></ul><h3>How would the world change if Apple lowered their cut to 0%?</h3><ul><li>Apple would lose $15b in annual profit, around 14.2% of annual profit.</li><li>For reference, the only segment that makes more profit for Apple is likely iPhone hardware sales with sales of $55b and a margin of 60%, coming out to ~$33b. [<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/apple-s-5-most-profitable-lines-of-business-4684130#:~:text=For%20the%20fiscal%20year%202019,company%27s%20sales%3B%20the%20iPad%20accounted">source</a>] [<a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/Profit-margins-on-the-iPhone-have-fallen-to-60_id111023">source</a>]</li><li>We'd see subscription services like Spotify, Netflix, Audible and Peloton becoming more competitively priced and easier to sign up for on iOS. Audible may stop doing their really weird credits scheme.</li><li>I suspect there won't be much of a change to the indie app ecosystem from going from 15% to 0, though some that have held out on principle may join in.</li></ul><h3>Clarifying out position</h3><ul><li>We plan for Insight to be a freemium product once its out of beta, so as an iOS browser this we'd naturally like to keep costs down.</li><li>We generally have a no-ads position and ad blocking is one of our users' favorite features. We don't want to cripple it to make sustainable revenue.</li><li>All things considered, it'd be easier to live without the 15%/30% cut, but for now we're willing to play with it.</li></ul><p>That's all I can think of for now.

<p><strong>Who Is This For?</strong></p>
<ul><li><em>Artists and creative independents. </em>Kanye West’s most recent albums sound nothing like the one before. In an age of blockbusters and calculated risk, he proclaims <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/earshot/kanye-wests-yeezus-leaks-as-569315">his strategy is no strategy</a>. Yet he has also cultivated one of the most fervent fan bases, rivaling the Beyhive, Beliebers, and the Swifties. <em>Rolling Stone</em> and <em>Billboard</em> said he made the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-albums-2010s-ranked-913997/kanye-west-my-beautiful-dark-twisted-fantasy-album-917419/">best recording album of the 2010s</a>. Love him or hate him, there’s something to learn.</li><li><em>Leaders. </em>Kanye took his fanbase, his investments into product, and his reputation, and figured out how to create and extract hundreds of million dollars worth of value from it. In an age where <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/01/the-death-of-the-artist-and-the-birth-of-the-creative-entrepreneur/383497/">the artist has been declared dead</a>, Kanye transcends. Whether you’re an entrepreneur, a CEO, or a politician, you’ll get a lot from understanding his psychology and what convinces people—fans or collaborators—to buy into his thoughts.</li><li><em>Thinkers.</em> From popular culture to high fashion, and business to politics, Kanye West understands the world from a unique perspective and has taken the time to develop his own worldview. It’s important to discern the values behind what he talks about, because his words hold weight with a lot of people. It’s like how Kanye’s alma mater Nike talks about athletes. If you’re a human being, you’re a thinker—and you’re going to find this piece really interesting.</li></ul>
<p><em>See, I invented Kanye,</em><br><em>It wasn’t any Kanyes,</em><br><em>And now I look and look around,</em><br><em>And there’s so many Kanyes.</em><br><em>— I Love Kanye,” Kanye West, 2016</em></p>
<p><em>Kanye West is not Picasso</em><br><em>I am Picasso</em><br><em>Kanye West is not Edison</em><br><em>I am Edison</em><br><em>I am Tesla</em><br><em>Jay-Z is not the Dylan of anything</em><br><em>I am the Dylan of anything</em><br><em>I am the Kanye West of Kanye West</em><br><em>The Kanye West</em><br><em>Of the great bogus shift of bullshit culture</em><br><em>From one boutique to another</em><br><em>I am Tesla</em><br><em>I am his coil</em><br><em>The coil that made electricity soft as a bed</em><br><em>I am the Kanye West Kanye West thinks he is</em><br><em>When he shoves your ass off the stage</em><br><em>I am the real Kanye West</em><br><em>I don’t get around much anymore</em><br><em>I never have</em><br><em>I only come alive after a war</em><br><em>And we have not had it yet</em><br>— <a href="https://lithub.com/here-is-that-leonard-cohen-poem-about-kanye-west/">Leonard Cohen</a>, 2015</p>
<p>Like our own stories, we know how this one ends. But unlike our stories, anything that could happen <em>has</em> happened to Kanye West, and we have literally no idea what will happen next. Some of us have chosen to stop watching, but most of us don’t. Before the 21 Grammys, before <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-albums-2010s-ranked-913997/kanye-west-my-beautiful-dark-twisted-fantasy-album-917419/"><em>Rolling Stone</em></a> and <a href="https://thesource.com/2019/11/19/billboard-names-kanye-wests-my-beautiful-dark-twisted-fantasy-the-greatest-album-of-the-decade/"><em>Billboard</em></a>, before the Adidas and Gap deals that would make him a billionaire, only Kanye knew that he would be the greatest artist of our generation.</p>
<p>This is the first of a series covering the religion of Kanye West. I read <a href="https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/modern-gospels">Mario Gabriele’s piece on Modern Gospels</a>, and I had to do it. Gabriele’s piece introduced me to sociologist <a href="https://iep.utm.edu/durkheim/#SH6c">Émile Durkheim</a>, who says a religion consists of three elements:&nbsp;</p>
<ul><li>“A unified system of beliefs and practices”—the values, practices, and beliefs that bind Kanye’s followers to his religion</li><li>“Sacred things, that is to say, things set apart and forbidden”—Kanye himself, his creative process, and his products (see the <a href="https://marker.medium.com/why-the-gap-is-betting-its-future-on-the-kanye-effect-c0a2b5d92b13?sk=5e1c5e392381b52b3b49f96d2ffe6f72">Kanye halo effect</a>)</li><li>“One single moral community called a Church”—the companies, communities, and individuals who have bought into Kanye West’s beliefs and practices</li></ul>
<p><em>Jargon alert: This piece will introduce Kanye West and cover one unified belief of the sacred object that ties the moral community together. I would love to do more parts that cover the other unified beliefs, as well as the Kanye West mythology and how he became a sacred object. I’d also like to write about the collective effervescence that sustains it (through concerts, products, and content), as well as the moral community (the Churches of Kanye). If you end up getting something from this article, consider buying my latest book, which was </em><a href="https://herbertlui.net/reps/"><em>written with the spirit of Kanye West’s creative process</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>Fervent celebrity worship is nothing new—for example, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/09/23/915846867/five-decades-on-an-eclectic-church-preaches-the-message-of-john-coltrane">the church of John Coltrane has stood for over five decades</a>. But even then, the case of Kanye West unlike any other. Love him or hate him, Kanye’s influence on today’s culture is undeniable. His admirers have ascended into powerful positions (e.g., Donald Glover has called himself <a href="https://djbooth.net/features/2016-06-20-donald-glover-kanyes-greatest-offspring">the son of Kanye</a>). Many of his collaborators have as well—the most prominent exhibit would be Virgil Abloh, who took the coveted menswear designer position at LVMH.</p>
<p>People worship Kanye the way they worship Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, Mark Zuckerberg, Oprah Winfrey, etc… Maybe even moreso, frankly. Some of these people carry the big bucks. Consider how Gap Inc., a Fortune 500 company, is betting on Kanye’s company, brand, and product insights to <a href="https://marker.medium.com/why-the-gap-is-betting-its-future-on-the-kanye-effect-c0a2b5d92b13?sk=5e1c5e392381b52b3b49f96d2ffe6f72">turn its core business around</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Creating a religion is a simple feat the same way telling a story is a simple feat; it starts easy, but it’s actually really difficult. The hardest parts involve believing in yourself, getting people to care and believe you, and actually making the story come true.</p>
<p>This is an investigation into why people care about Kanye. Ever since <a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/808s-and-heartbreak-influence/">he released <em>808s and Heartbreak</em></a>, people have considered Kanye’s career to be increasingly irrelevant. Yet, not only does he survive, he <em>thrives</em>. It’s not merely the controversy; otherwise, we would still be watching Charlie Sheen and Tekashi69. Why did you click into this article? Why do we care?</p>
<p>“I’m not a businessman, I’m a business, man!” Jay-Z rapped on “Diamonds (Remix)” with Kanye West. Kanye is no longer just a business or a brand—he has informally created a modern gospel that his fans can latch on to and incorporate into the world. Here’s what it looks like, and why it works.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: Kanye West as a person is different from his persona, I imagine, and I don’t know the guy personally. Like many in the Church of Kanye, I am only familiar with the persona—the one at the core of millions, if not billions, of parasocial relationships. Like Kanye says, I’m going to use that disadvantage as my advantage though.</em></p>
<p><em>I wrote this for </em><strong><em>entertainment</em></strong><em> value. Other people have written books about this topic, so feel free to look into them if you want a comprehensive, academic, view of Kanye West’s religion. For now, I see this as a foundational sketch—not a final painting—of his work. An introduction to ideas beyond the headlines, perhaps like a demo of a song, if you will…&nbsp;</em></p>
<h2>Kanye, the Free Thinker</h2>
<p>These past few years, we’ve heard Kanye West repeatedly compare himself to people like Steve Jobs, Walt Disney, Karl Lagerfeld, Howard Hughes, Michael Jackson, and such. These comparisons don’t hint at his intellectual background necessarily—they’re references for what Kanye wants people to see his possibilities as. <a href="https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/kanye-west">He says</a>, “In no way do I want to be the next any one of them. But I am the first me. So I only mention those other names to try to give people a little bit of context.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most prominent intellectual influence on Kanye West happened at home; his mother, Professor Donda West. Donda West was a notable English professor at Chicago State University, whose dissertation involved systems approaches to education (as seen in the recently published <a href="https://books.google.ca/books/about/Donda_s_Rules.html?id=iAwdyAEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y"><em>Donda’s Rules</em></a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s clear Donda West’s expertise provided Kanye with a wealth of literary experience and systems thinking to draw from. Through his mother, Kanye became the product of some of the world’s most forward literary thinkers. The world owes Donda West a lot more credit for cultivating Kanye West to be the genius he is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Kanye was growing up, his mother made church an important pillar of their lives. On p. 138 of <em>Raising Kanye</em>, Donda West writes:</p>
<p><em>We’d go every Sunday to Christ Universal Temple in Chicago. I liked the church because the minister, Johnnie Colemon, preached prosperity. I had belonged to Hillside Church, which was very similar, before moving from Atlanta, and would take Kanye there. Barbara King, the minister there, was also a very spiritual and progressive thinker. I wanted Kanye to be steeped in that kind of exposure to God. I never bought into the fire-and-brimstone type of religion or one that was repressive. Certainly, I would not expose Kanye to that. But I felt compelled to see to it that a spiritual component was a key part of Kanye’s upbringing.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://religionnews.com/2019/11/21/with-joel-osteen-kanye-drops-a-clue-about-his-faith-and-his-kinship-with-trump/">Colemon’s</a> and <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/bishop-barbara-l-king-founding-pastor-of-hillside-international-truth-center-dies-at-90/W55VU6ZOUJHMJO6X2G4AUKF7FM/">King’s</a> churches are associated with New Thought, a metaphysical movement encouraging positive thinking, and material wealth as a sign of God’s blessings. There are many movements that fall into New Thought, the most popular one today might be <em>The Secret</em> and the Law of Attraction. Other contemporaries include Goop and Soulcycle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fusion of New Thought and Christianity is known as prosperity gospel, the term for a variation of Christianity which proposes that through faith and hard work, God will make your financial and physical dreams come true.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This childhood exposure to prosperity gospel and New Thought is also a core belief, or as Kanye puts it, the “dragon energy,” that binds Kanye West and Donald Trump together. Fred Trump would take a young Donald Trump to Marble Collegiate Church to listen to Norman Vincent Peale’s speeches. Peale is the author of <em>The Power of Positive Thinking</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kanye’s mentor and “big brother,” Jay-Z, has been at least a dabbler of new thought, <a href="https://www.oprah.com/oprahsbookclub/books-that-made-a-difference-to-jay-z">recommending books like <em>The Seat of the Soul</em>, as well <em>The Celestine Prophecy</em></a>. Similarly, a writer Kanye West works with, Sakiya Sandifer, is a proponent of new thought as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kate Bowler, author of <em>Blessed: A History of the American Prosperity Gospel</em>, describes New Thought: <em>“Adherents, acting in accordance with divine principles, relied on their minds to transform thought and speech into heaven-sent blessings.” </em>Three aspects of New Thought are rooted in the twentieth-century’s view on how the power of the mind:</p>
<ul><li>High anthropology: God and humanity separated only by degree</li><li>Priority of spiritual reality: The world should be reimagined as thought, rather than substance</li><li>Generative power of positive thought: People share in God’s power to create by means of thought; they can shape their own worlds by their thinking</li></ul>
<p>And ever since he became a reborn Christian, Kanye’s particular …</p></div></div>

<h3 id="toc-how-it-works-1"><span>How It Works</span></h3><p>A Raspberry Pi computer promiscuously sniffs packets on the local network. A Python script parses these packets, looking for any communication between the smart speaker and the vendor's cloud service.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the modern workplace, data integration skills can help you supercharge your career. Regardless of what kind of job you have, it’s likely you will be working with some kind of software. It might be a cloud billing system, an appointment scheduling system, warehouse software, or even just email. Most software applications are driven by data inputs and outputs. If you have even basic competency with data integration, it can open up many opportunities for you to automate tasks and leverage data to solve business problems.</p><p><strong>By using data, you can increase your impact at work. More impact means more opportunities, career progression, and often bigger compensation.</strong></p><p>Let’s look at how data integration skills can improve your career.</p><p>Whether your job is in accounting, business development, customer service, human resources, logistics, or manufacturing, there’s a pretty good chance data integration techniques could save you time by automating repetitive tasks.</p><p>With all the talk about robots and AI eliminating jobs, you may question whether automation is a good thing. If you can use data integration to automate portions of your job, won’t that signal to management that your job may be expendable? In my experience, employees that embrace technology and use it to be more effective tend to outperform those that resist technology.</p><p>If there are significant parts of your job that cab be automated and you don’t do something about it, eventually your employer will. In some cases, this could involve offshoring your job to a country where labor is less expensive. Or it could be addressed by larger software or automation initiatives which could result in significant changes to your role. Due to the competitive nature of business, there is a continual need to reduce any forms of waste. Companies that don’t continuously improve efficiency lose their competitiveness and eventually die out.</p><p>So, given this “survival of the fittest” business environment what can you do?</p><p>Take charge of automating your own work. Be proactive about eliminating waste in your individual tasks and processes you work with. This will make you a more effective employee. You will deliver better and faster results which increases your value to your organization. It also demonstrates to management that you are a proactive innovator. It could provide job security, win you a higher rating on your next performance evaluation, and ultimately improve your compensation.</p><p>But more importantly you will be demonstrating to you manager and your coworkers how to improve business processes through automation. The improvements you make can be shared with other team members or even with other departments. In some cases, your small but creative automations could lead to a large scale rethink of how your company operates or perhaps even lead to a new product or service.</p><p>Hard to imagine doing this in your current job? Let’s talk through an example.</p><h2 id="how-to-automate-lead-acquisition">How to Automate Lead Acquisition</h2><p>Let’s say you have a general sales inquiry email address posted on your company’s web site. You are working on the marketing team and one of your responsibilities is to monitor incoming emails and look for potential customers that are interested in using your company’s service. When you identify a lead based on an incoming email, you log into <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/">Salesforce</a> and type up a new Lead entry. This then triggers the sales team to reach out to the potential customer to initiate a conversation. This process has to happen pretty quickly. If you wait too long after the potential customer sends the email, they may lose interest and move onto a competitor.</p><p>This process is a perfect candidate for automation using data integration between the email message content and the Salesforce lead API.</p><p>It’s highly likely you could implement this integration with absolutely zero programming using a workflow automation tool like <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zappier</a> or <a href="https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft Power Automate</a>. In fact, a quick search of the Microsoft Power Automate site will uncover a pre-existing workflow that does exactly what we’re looking for:</p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/johnberry/image/upload/v1607224978/PowerAutomateSalesforce_smx5vk.png" alt="PowerAutomateParserr"></p><p>It uses a SaaS product called <a href="https://parserr.com/">Parserr</a> which specializes in parsing the unstructured text in email messages and attachments and converting it to structured data which can be more easily imported into databases or other SaaS products.</p><p>Salesforce offers many integration options that allow you to load CRM record types like leads, accounts, contacts and opportunities. In fact, here is publicly available documentation about their <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfFieldRef.meta/sfFieldRef/salesforce_field_reference_Lead.htm">Leads API</a>:</p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/johnberry/image/upload/v1607224981/SalesforceLead_fdjuno.png" alt="SalesforceLead"></p><p>This is a great example where a simple data integration between two SaaS products reduces your labor and adds additional business benefits. The fully automated process will be faster, which will speed the sales team’s response to the customer and increase the percentage of sales wins.</p><p>This makes you more effective as an individual contributor and gets you noticed by your manager. The same integration approach you have taken on this project could be applied to many similar situations in your department or across your company. It’s possible this small success could lead to more growth opportunities at your company. Or possibly it could even be the start of a transition to a technology job, which I’ll explain next.</p><p>There are a variety of roles in the typical IT Department that require data integration expertise. Some IT organizations have a team that focuses on B2B integrations or EDI. Legacy EDI messaging is specialized skill and usually requires expertise with specific B2B platforms like <a href="https://www.softwareag.com/en_corporate/platform/integration-apis.html">WebMethods</a>, <a href="https://www.opentext.com/">OpenText</a>, or cloud-based iPaaS tools (integration platform-as-a-service). Working in a B2B integration team requires cross-functional skills. Besides expertise with EDI specifications and translation software, B2B workers usually need a deep understanding of the back-end systems like the ERP or CRM which are involved with the B2B signals. Soft skills like project management and people skills are critical as well.</p><p>Application-to-Application integration is sometimes managed by a specialized B2B integration team, but often it is handled by a general software engineering team. Since application integration usually leverages technologies like REST APIs, webhooks, GraphQL, or SOAP, IT workers with programming skills are often best suited for building these solutions. In these scenarios, engineers use their programming language of choice (like Python, Java, or C#) to connect various application API’s into an automated workflow.</p><p>Finally database integration projects involving data warehousing, data analytics, and extract-transform-load (ETL) are usually handled by a database or data engineering team. Database integration techniques are quite different from B2B integration and software engineering tasks. Database integration teams will be handling data in bulk (often big data) which requires technical knowledge of the database system’s native features. Data engineering work usually involves data platforms like <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Apache Spark</a>, <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/">Apache Airflow</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/">Microsoft SQL Server</a>, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>, or cloud-based ETL tools. With rapidly growing interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence, data engineering is becoming a much more common job title in many IT Departments.</p><p>Any of these data integration disciplines can lead to a rewarding career path. If you are interested in coding, learning to interact with APIs and write the “glue code” that ties APIs into an integrated workflow will make you extremely valuable to potential employers. Data engineering requires expertise with a particular data platform, but tends to requires less traditional programming skills. Finally, B2B integration work requires the least amount of programming skills, but often requires deeper understanding of business processes and strong soft-skills. All of these roles can put you in a position to solve business problems and create value for your employer.</p><p>Are you interested in changing to a technology career but perhaps haven’t had time to learn to code yet? Data integration is a route for a non-technical person to transition into a technology career. In my experience it’s far easier for non-technical people to become effective at integration rather than trying to learn programming from scratch.
This may sound strange. After all, conventional wisdom is that the path to a tech career is learning to code. There is an entire educational industry that has developed around teaching JavaScript or Python to aspiring software engineers. You can go to boot camps or use online resources and after a few months of intensive work, supposedly you will be able to get a lucrative job as a software engineer. Unfortunately, from what I’ve observed many of these programs are glorified get-rich-quick schemes.</p><p>Programming isn’t for everyone. Software engineering requires a certain way of thinking that simply doesn’t come naturally to some people. Any many simply find programming unpleasant or boring. Even if you do manage to learn JavaScript, it’s not necessarily a guaranteed path to a six-figure income.</p><p>Instead of learning a programming language, perhaps a better strategy is to learn some kind of data integration tool or technique. For example, quite possible for most individuals to develop functional expertise with cloud integration platforms like <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/logic-apps/">Azure Logic Apps</a> or <a href="https://www.mulesoft.com/">Mulesoft</a> within a few months. You can use the tool for a few side projects or even to solve problems in your day job. This provides you some compelling achievements to add to your resume and attract the interest of technology hiring managers.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a> is another great skill to learn. The ability to query relational databases with SQL can make you more effective in many non-technical jobs, but it’s also a great way to land an entry level tech job on a data analysis or engineering team. SQL is a query language and it tends to be far easier to learn that an a full programming language. Combine basic SQL knowledge with self-serve business intelligence tools like <a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft PowerBI</a> or <a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a> and you have most of the skills necessary to move into an …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><span><p>What have you done to get yourself equipped and prepared for the new year ahead? That could be getting into courses to up skill yourself. It could be a career switch to a new role with broader/specialised job description as you think is better for your own career. Whatever those maybe, what matters more are often not found in the big decisions as mentioned. Rather, they are found in your daily habits. Reading one technical article a day. Figuring out how to earn 1 buck from your investments a day. The power of atomic habits creates that change you wish to see. How are you improving today?</p>

<p>In this article, I’ve curated some articles I’ve put time to read through the past weeks to share with you all. Its broadly general topics and technical topics.</p>

<p>I’ve attached the youtube briefly explaining about the book <code>atomic habits</code> by James Clear.</p>

<p>While people are paying to even get into the beta testing for starlink, this has been a consistent business strategy to acquire capital by the famous Elon Musk for Tesla’s cybertruck. Perhaps this is a classic example of not leaving any money on the table. If people are willing to pay for it, then just take it and also put yourself on a position to provide a minimal standard of quality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It allows independent bookshops to create their own virtual shopfront on the site, with the stores receiving the full profit margin – 30% of the cover price – from each sale. All customer service and shipping are handled by Bookshop and its distributor partners, with titles offered at a small discount and delivered within two to three days</p>

<p>Really amazing how people are taking that leap of faith to stand for what they believe in and actually pursues it. Its definitely one of the most rewarding feeling to see what you believe in takes fruit and gaining traction.</p>

<p>It is a really insightful article to look at our daily life activity (video call) from a different lens. Its heartening to hear how the disability does not deter companies from valuing the skill and results of these people.</p>

<p>Otter, google meets, Zoom, these are tools that are specialized at what they do and thus integration of services can often times be more valuable than we engineers can imagine. While it makes sense to build your features in-house but that will probably pale in comparison to companies which are specialized and focused on the feature.</p>

<p>For example, zoom wishes to do caption but that would not be as comprehensive as Otter which is a tool specialised for caption capturing.</p>

Simple is better.

<p>Every line of code comes at a cost: maintenance. To avoid paying a large price for every line of code written, we build reusable components.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Repeat your code to avoid creating dependencies, but do not repeat yourself to manage them.</li>
<li>Split your code by separating out hard-to-write pieces of code with frequently-changed ones.</li>
<li>Layer your code by building simple-to-use APIs out of simpler-to-implement parts. A component is made up for even smaller components like that of a lego.</li>
</ul>

<p>Genuinely, this is one piece of bad writing, but the essence is paramount. Write code that requires as little maintenance in the future. Writing readable code lowers your maintenance cost. Writing test lowers maintenance cost. On and on; if you just take a moment to think through, are there exceptions to good coding practices that ends up actually creating more maintenance cost?

<li><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/blog/understanding-the-differences-between-rabbitmq-vs-kafka/">What is the difference between RabbitMQ vs Kafka</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It is built around the popular AMQP protocol. What is this protocol<br>
<a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Message_Queuing_Protocol">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Message_Queuing_Protocol</a></p>

<p>RabbitMQ is often summarized as an “open source distributed message broker”<br>
Apache Kafka is described as a distributed event streaming platform; focusing on facilitating raw throughput.</p>

<p>If you ever want to decide between thee two applications, consider the following</p>
<ul>
<li>What skills are needed to operate these services</li>
<li>What is the strength of its surrounding developer community</li>
<li>What does these two services excel at?</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to consider use-cases which has more specific routing needs and per-message guarantees, consider RabbitMQ. This service is created with these use-cases in mind and thus serves these use-cases more specifically.</p>

<p>The developer community around these two services have been going steadily. So that makes this factor (at least for these two services in particular) negligible. Its a tie!</p>

<p>RabbitMQ do have its own kubernetes operator. So you can consider leveraging on that for your livechat services if that is what you wish to pursue in the long run. When you are using Kubernetes, there are much more opportunities to leverage your resource and the CICD’s innovations.</p>

<p>it is interesting from how I managed to learn at least 5 new concepts from a single article. Definitely this scope of work is hugely unfamiliar to me. While i am in a stage of my engineering journey to explore more deep-tech tools for more specific business use-cases. I have to stay ahead my the current situations i am exposed so i can be ready as i start to walk down the growth path I’ve set for myself when i choose to leave the comfort of my full time to pursue my own idea.</p>

<p>The new concepts i’ve learnt are mainly:</p>
<ol>
<li>There exists something called binary-based stream protocol</li>
<li>What is AMQP? Advanced Message Queuing Protocol</li>
<li>There are actually such a thing call streaming use-cases.</li>
</ol>

</ul>

<p>This is a good article to help you understand the difference between git rebase and git merge. Going back a step to the purpose of a git, it is to keep your source of truth on the master branch. If there is a bug, you can revert back, track back, hunt it down with ease and get it sorted out without having to pull out all your hair. Rebase while it keeps your history clean does not entirely prioritize or set you up for the purpose as mentioned earlier. It makes the debugging harder if the feature branch you are rebasing is vast and has thousands of commit. That makes the entire debugging process more tedious than its needed to be in the context of git. A good fundamental read to get yourself up to date on the use-cases of git.</p>

<p>There is a new learning called git bisect. It allows you to use binary search to find the commit in which the bug was introduced.</p>

<p>You start of your bug search in this manner</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>git bisect start<br>
git bisect bad # Indicate the current version is bad<br>
git bisect good # Indicate from which commit is the version good</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once you have the the following above, git bisect will select a commit in the middle of that range (as you would expect of a binary search), checks it out and output something as the following</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>Bisecting: 675 revisions left to test after this (roughly 10 steps)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once you see the message above, that indicates that the middle commit has been checked out. If that version is working correctly, type</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>git bisect good</p>
</blockquote>

<p>if its bad, type</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>git bisect bad</p>
</blockquote>

<p>you can check out the git bisect documentation over <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect">here</a>.</p>

I'm exploring tapping into this latent resource pool to make automated testing affordable &amp; unlock a more comprehensive configuration coverage.</p><p>The goal of DART (Distributed Android Remote Testing) is to enable any Android device to run automated tests — without ADB or complex setups/maintenance. A commercial product could pay people per hour of device use, allowing anyone to utilize idle device time. Each device is subsumed to provide a distributed testbed.</p><p>DART is orthogonal to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourced_testing">crowdsourced testing</a> — the latter requires active human participation.</p><p>DART seems to be the best solution to utilize device idle time — the best way to verify that an app works on "Samsung S9" is by executing it on "Samsung S9".  Contrast this to other procedures where phones are usually a suboptimal option: server hosting, remote computation, etc.</p><p>In the demo below, I ran a few test cases on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.focus&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Mozilla Focus Privacy Browser</a> without cables/ADB.</p><p><iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CcHEsx7ODyw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h3>1.1. 💪 Motivation</h3><p>The following problems motivated the development of DART.</p><h5>i. 🧩 Android Device Fragmentation</h5><img src="https://elvischidera.com/4c37a9cd069bcaa8ee86c04764a37790/android_fragmentation.gif" alt="Android device fragmentation"><p>The top device farms barely cover 1% of the total number of Android device models. Nondistributed device farms favor depth instead of breadth — maintenance cost increases as more diverse devices are added.</p><p>Testing on flagship devices alone doesn't always suffice.</p><blockquote><p>Anecdote: I once spent an entire day debugging an ANR that occurs to a small fraction of our users. I discovered it only affects phones purchased in specific regions. I never was able to reproduce the issue on the same phone bought in the USA.</p></blockquote><p>The Android version distribution exacerbates this problem.</p><p><span>

They claim to have a global infrastructure of more than 22,000 SIM-enabled (similar) devices in 150 locations.

At Headspin's core is the <a href="https://github.com/DeviceFarmer/stf">DeviceFarmer STF</a> open-source library. But like its predecessors, Headspin only supports a limited set of device models.</p><h5>ii. 💸 Expensive Physical Devices</h5><img src="https://elvischidera.com/457ab6ec0d4f4335573264b78937f40d/real_device_pricing_chart.svg"><p>Real device test farms have an initial cost and require periodic maintenance, hence why they are more expensive than virtual device farms.</p><blockquote><p>Running 10 hours of test daily on real devices costs <strong>$1000/month</strong> (assuming 20 working days of equal levels of productivity).</p></blockquote><h3>1.2. 📱 Product</h3><p><strong>The key 🔑:</strong> Uber averts enormous maintenance costs by not owning all the cars on its global network. Similarly, with a distributed network of test devices, extensive device coverage is attainable with minimal maintenance costs. For one or two co-located devices, maintenance isn't fastidious.</p><blockquote><p>From <a href="https://github.com/DeviceFarmer/stf#faq">DeviceFramer STF</a> FAQ: "Aside from a single early failure we had within only a few months, all of our devices were doing fine for about two years. However, having reached the 2-3 year mark, several devices have started to experience visibly expanded batteries <!-- -->[...]<!-- -->
In our experience, the system runs just fine most of the time, and any issues are mostly USB-related. You'll usually have to do something about once a week."</p></blockquote><p>Organizations can decide what type of tests are ideal for DART and if the network is made-up of single nodes or clusters of nodes. The simple taxonomy of android testing below should be helpful. <!-- -->[1]</p><img src="https://elvischidera.com/3c544343e6de6b0d393c6101c4359694/taxonomy_android_testing.svg" alt="Taxonomy of Android testing"><p>The network can be internal to an organization. An example: <code>X</code> devices stored in HQ, each employee can remotely contribute their test device into the system.</p><p>It can also be external to an organization. Imagine paying people <code>$1.5/hour</code> of device time. Assuming a device runs test overnight (thanks to timezone differences), the estimated monthly earning is <code>$240</code> (<code>$1.5 * 8 hours * 20 working days</code>).</p><blockquote><p>The median income in some countries is ~$400/month. </p></blockquote><p>Below is a demo of the <a href="https://github.com/Elvis10ten/dart">proof-of-concept</a>.</p><p><iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7SotlhlwMDA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Currently, a simple dashboard renders the test summary.</p><div>

    </span></a></p><h5>ii. 👩🏽‍💻 Publisher Perspective</h5><p>The publisher cares about test fraud and product leaks.</p><p>Proof of work disincentivizes test fraud. The server can use device logs, screenshots, videos with UUID, and past executions to validate submitted work results. As this isn't watertight, it is best combined with other strategies: user verifications, <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet">device attestation</a>, randomization, and device throughput throttling.</p><p>Preventing product leaks is hard  — if it runs on a phone, any sufficiently motivated (&amp; knowledgeable) person can figure out a way to access objects. Three good-enough solutions are:</p><p>a. Running headless tests.</p><p>b. Using a private network of vetted devices.</p><p>c. Adopting only for binaries at the later end of the release pipeline.</p><h3>1.4. 🎃 Going Headless</h3><p>It is possible to obscure the application under test using a simple overlay. The video below shows the execution of the test cases of the Google IO 2019 app. On the right, the app interactions are invisible. Depending on the strategy, concealing actions do not affect screenshots or videos.</p><p><iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jxwsoe3T8yE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>With framework UI component wrappers, it is possible to borrow some ideas from <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/4db1f432b853152075923499768639e14403b73a/tools/layoutlib/README">Layoutlib</a> to offer a full headless solution. <code>Layoutlib</code> is a custom version of the android View framework designed to run inside Eclipse. The goal of the library is to provide layout rendering in Eclipse that are very close to their rendering on devices.</p><h3>1.5. 📦 Containerization</h3><p>Tests need to run in an isolated environment. A plugin framework like <a href="https://github.com/didi/VirtualAPK">VirtualAPK</a> can be built to offer a layer of isolation between apps and the OS. This works using the <code>DexClassLoader</code> and some reflection hacks to modify framework components. With this approach, apps can be seamlessly loaded &amp; unloaded without any user interaction.</p><p><span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div itemprop="articleBody">  <p>For several reasons, emulation has always fascinated me. A program that executes other programs sounds like such a cool concept. It really feels like you’re getting your money’s worth out of writing it! Beyond that, it definitely feels like you’re <em>building</em> a computer within software. I really enjoyed learning about computer architecture and writing some basic HDL code, but emulation is a much more straightforward way of achieving a similar feeling of generating a machine. I’ve also always had this goal of knowing exactly how <em>Super Mario World</em> worked, ever since I first saw it as a kid. Because of this, writing a SNES/SFC emulator has been on my mind for a while. I decided recently that it was time to take a <a href="https://github.com/rivergillis/chip-8">step forward</a> towards making this happen.</p> <p>So let’s take a look at writing an emulator. A simple, but complete example would involve CHIP-8.</p> <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8">CHIP-8</a> is actually a programming language. It’s really simple too, there’s only <a href="http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM#3.0">35 opcodes</a>. To write an interpreter for it, we pretty much just need to write a program that can execute all 35 different instructions. The <em>emulation</em> aspect of this comes from the bits you wouldn’t normally find in a programming language interpreter. We need a way to display graphics, process user input, play audio, and we need to simulate the hardware mechanisms of a CHIP-8 machine. Things like registers and memory need to be taken into account during execution, and we also need to be careful about timing.</p> <p>Let’s start! For this project, we’ll be using C++. This should be fairly trivial to translate into other languages. If you want to take a look at the complete source, see the <a href="https://github.com/rivergillis/chip-8">project repository</a>.</p> <p>First, a basic main loop. We’ll ignore emulating timing for now.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>// main.cpp</span>

<span>void</span> <span>Run</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>CpuChip8</span> <span>cpu</span><span>;</span>

    <span>cpu</span><span>.</span><span>RunCycle</span><span>();</span>

    <span>Run</span><span>();</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>catch</span> <span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>exception</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>e</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Our <code>CpuChip8</code> class will encapsulate the state of our virtual machine and interpreter. Now if we implement <code>RunCycle</code> and <code>Initialize</code> we’ll have ourselves a basic emulator skeleton. We now need to discuss the phsyical system we’re emulating.</p> <p>Our CHIP-8 system will be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telmac_1800">Telmac 1800</a>. We’ve got ourselves a pool of 4K of memory, a 64x32 1-bit display, and the ability to beep. <em>Nice</em>. The CHIP-8 interpreter itself is implemented via a virtual machine. We need to keep track of a stack, sixteen 8-bit registers (named V0 through VF), a 12-bit index register (named I), a program counter, two 8-bit timers, and a 16-frame stack.</p> <p>The canonical memory map looks like this:</p> <div><div><pre><code>0x000 |--------------------|
      | Interpreter memory |
      |                    |
0x050 | Built-in fontset   |
0x200 |--------------------|
      |                    |
      |                    |
      | Program memory     |
      | and dynamic allocs |
      |                    |
      |                    |
0xFFF |--------------------|
</code></pre></div></div> <p>You’ll notice there’s no explicit stack here. The program actually doesn’t have a stack to address, that’s only used by the interpreter to implement jumping to functions and back. With this in mind we can draw up a header.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>// cpu_chip8.h</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>We use excplicit integer types to ensure values are over/underflowed correctly. We need to use 16-bit types for 12-bit values. We also have 16 digital input keys, which we store as either on or off within this class. When we hook up input, we’ll find a way to feed that into the class between cycles. The opcode is made easy by the fact that all CHIP-8 instructions are 2 bytes long.</p> <p>So that gives us 0xFFFF=64k possible instructions (though many are unused). We can actually store every possible instruction in a map so that when we fetch an opcode we are able to immediately execute it by calling the associated <code>Instruction</code> in <code>instructions_</code>. Since we don’t bind much data to the functions, which should be able to fit the entire instruction map in cache!</p> <p>Our <code>Initialize</code> function is where to set up the memory map described above:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>// cpu_chip8.cpp</span>

The gist of it here is that we set everything to 0 and load things into memory that need to be loaded. The fontset here is a series of 16 built-in sprites that programs can reference as they want. We’ll go over how that memory forms sprites later on when we worry about graphics. Our goal is that once <code>Initialize</code> complete we’re set up to execute a user program.</p> <p>Let’s build out a basic <code>RunCycle</code> so that we have a better idea of out to write <code>BuildInstructionSet</code>.

Also, since we chose to define <code>Instruction</code> as a function pointer without any arguments, we’re going to have to bind those to the function itself. This requires more work in the initial set-up, but means we completely remove the instruction-decode phase on <code>RunCycle</code>.</p> <p>Let’s dig into the meat of the interpreter, <code>BuildInstructionSet</code>. I wont list the implementations for every function here, but you can find that in the <a href="https://github.com/rivergillis/chip-8">repository for this project</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Before I got into productivity and performance, I used to spend many hours online ingesting vast troves of digital content. My information diet ranged from inspirational TED talks to specialized podcasts, from blog posts found on Hacker News to ebooks shared on Twitter.</p>
<p>I’m deeply curious, and I gave in to new content as much as I could. What could be the harm?—I thought. I <em>loved</em> spending my time this way. It felt useful, it was fun, and it nurtured my self-image as a “smart guy” — all at the same time. Truly, a learning hack.</p>
<p>Turns out I wasn’t hacking anything: The learning wasn’t real.</p>
<p>A few months ago, doubts began to creep into my mind about the effectiveness of my habits.</p>
<p>While I’d amped up my information consumption, I wasn’t retaining most of it. My memory was behaving like a leaky bucket. Sure, I was spending tens of hours listening to politics on the radio. But when I tried to use any of those points in a conversation, I found that I didn’t actually know enough to make a coherent argument. <strong>I knew the surrounding context, but the moment I needed to get specific my argument would crumble</strong>. Same for many other topics: the more technical they were, the less retention I had.</p>
<p>Where did all that information go?</p>
<p>The problem lied in how I was seeing learning, and therefore how I was approaching it.</p>
<p>Learning is what turns information consumption into long-lasting knowledge. The two things are different: while information is ephemeral, true knowledge is foundational. If knowledge were a person, information would be its picture.</p>
<p>It’s easy to think of learning in <em>accretive</em> terms: if I stack up enough information, it will eventually turn into knowledge. We tend to judge the world in material terms, and if data were tangible, an indefinitely growing memory might be reasonable to assume. The more information I consume, the more information I store, the information data I can later retrieve. The more business newsletters I’ll read, the more I’ll know business.</p>
<p>However, this line of thinking wasn’t really applicable to my case: I was undoubtedly consuming many business newsletters each week, but that wasn’t translating into long-term business knowledge.</p>
<p>I spent the last eight months trying to find an answer to this riddle. It took me deep into the topic of meta-learning: How do humans learn? And how can we learn better in the digital information age?</p>
<h2 id="learning-must-be-effortful">Learning must be effortful</h2>
<p>Unfortunately for us, human memory does not resemble storage, and “passive accumulation” isn’t how learning happens.</p>
<p>The truth is that we retain information only when we put <em>serious effort</em> into the process of learning. The intrinsic effortfulness of learning is not just a byproduct of the core activity, like shortness of breath during running. On the contrary: it’s what <em>actually</em> <em>enables</em> it. The relationship is causal.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://giansegato.com/img/essays/edutainment-not-learning/image_1.png"> 
</figure>

<p>I didn’t find a learning hack to avoid effort because there’s no such thing as easy learning: <strong>learning <em>must</em> be effortful in order for it to happen</strong>.</p>
<p>What surprised me the most is that learning is far more grounded in the physical world than I was comfortable admitting.</p>
<p>The most literal meaning of effort is <em>physical</em> effort (think of weight lifting at the gym). The same holds true with information retention: it works best when the process of assimilating it is <em>physically effortful</em>. Our memory shines when our learning is physical, visceral, and obvious, like the aching in your hands after a morning spent hand-writing.</p>
<p>Since they’re passive, easy, and exclusively digital, after this realization all my podcasts, e-books, audiobooks, newsletters, blog posts, videos, live webinars were suddenly deprived of their “<em>learning status</em>”. Instead, they assumed their proper place in my schedule as pure <em>entertainment</em> activities.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that digital products make it uniquely easy to trick yourself into thinking that you’re learning when you are actually being entertained.</p>
<p>What I still didn’t know was why our mind works like this. Is this just the current state of digital learning and teaching, or there’s actually a margin for <em>easy</em> learning to be found somewhere?</p>
<h2 id="the-neurology-of-learning">The neurology of learning</h2>
<p>I’m no expert in medicine, let alone neurology, but I did want to roughly understand what happens when we — as humans —&nbsp;create knowledge. Luckily I didn’t need profound medical expertise to get the gist of the matter.</p>
<p>Our brain is made of a web of interconnected neurons. The links between these neurons are called axons: long, slender projections of nerve fibers that transmit electrical impulses.</p>
<p>Around these axons, there’s an insulating membrane called myelin. It covers many neuronal axons and facilitates the propagation of electrical signals along neuronal circuits. The more myelin around an axon, the stronger and more connected the signal transmission will be.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://giansegato.com/img/essays/edutainment-not-learning/image_2.png"> 
</figure>

<p>Myelin is to neural transmissions as oxygen is to fire. It allows rapid information transfer over long distances, and it <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1261127">greatly increases</a> the speed of propagation of electric signals in our brain.</p>
<p>See it as water flowing through a pipe with dynamic, changing capacity. Pipes with greater capacity can move more water, more quickly than a small pipe or a slow drip. The more myelin supporting a neural connection, the easier it is to use that connection — and thus to use the skill or remember the topic associated with that connection</p>
<p>A key aspect of myelin is that it’s highly dynamic. It’s an integral component of our brain plasticity. So the question becomes: how is myelin generated, and why?</p>
<p>When we come across a new topic, new regions of the brain start activating. The more we use those new regions, the more myelin is synthesized, the easier that topic (or activity) gets.</p>
<p>We all know the old saying <em>practice makes perfect</em>. The more we use a certain region of our brain, the more our brain “prioritizes” and “hones” it. That is what leads to myelin: activity induces myelination, which leads to increased strength of connectivity and efficiency along those very neurons. It’s a self-reinforcing process.</p>
<p>In other words, it compounds.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://giansegato.com/img/essays/edutainment-not-learning/image_3.png"> 
</figure>

<p>See now why it’s so hard to learn? To learn anything we must make active use of unexplored regions of our brain <em>before</em> they’re ready. It’s, quite literally, getting out of the comfort zone. The more we use them, the more they get better. <strong>Learning is <em>structurally</em> hard.</strong></p>
<p>The truly mesmerizing thing about myelination is that it is correlated with active use of <em><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.4351">motor neurons</a></em>. It looks like human cognition is fundamentally grounded in sensory-motor processes: we retain information better when we associate some <em>physical activity</em> to it. <strong>The general intuition is that movement provides additional cues we can use to retrieve knowledge.</strong></p>
<p>We can see this effect happening when we take notes. A larger corpus of research is suggesting that taking notes physically — that is, by hand-writing them — is <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01810">far more effective</a> than using a laptop. Keyboarding does not provide tactile feedback to the brain that the contact between pencil and paper does: this contact, this raw feedback, is the key to creating the neurocircuitry in the hand-brain complex, that <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01810">evidence shows</a> supports memory and retention.</p>
<p>All of this means <strong>we need to radically reassess digital learning</strong>. We haven’t evolved to store information by passively watching Masterclass videos: that’s just not how our minds work.</p>
<p>However, the other side of this coin is that we’re living in times of unprecedented information surplus. This is an opportunity that we should learn to seize.</p>
<h2 id="creative-learning-in-a-digital-world">Creative learning in a digital world</h2>
<p>The best way to describe my information diet before discovering that effort is instrumental to learning would be <em>edutainment</em>.</p>
<p>Edutainment mixes education topics with entertainment methodologies. Even if edutainment optimizes for passive attention instead of effortful engagement (the opposite of learning), it’s not just “mere fun.” Deleting Twitter and unsubscribing from newsletters, as suggested by Deep Work advocates like <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">Cal Newport</a>, can actually end up <em>preventing</em> learning.</p>
<p>I see edutainment as <em>preparation for learning</em>: it’s a powerful explorative tool that can provide ideas and motivation to learn. And yet, it’s also not learning itself, in the same way as buying running shoes is not running.</p>
<p>Within this framework, “mindless” browsing online can be transformed into <em>scouting for learning opportunities</em>. It’s yet another searching problem where it’s key to balance the exploration of new opportunities with the commitment to the existing ones — a topic I wrote about at length in <a href="https://giansegato.com/essays/the-ebb-and-the-flow-of-product-development/">another essay</a>. It’s about balancing the time spent “scouting” for interesting topics online with the offline effort needed for long-term retention and integration.</p>
<hr>


<hr>
<p>Pragmatically, I solved this trade-off with a powerful tool: a learning inbox.</p>
<p>A learning inbox is a to-do list for stuff I’d like to actually learn. I picked up the idea from Andy Matuschak — legendary ed-tech expert —, who <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/A_reading_inbox_to_capture_possibly-useful_references">used a similar concept</a> as a tool for capturing possibly-useful references. The learning inbox is a system that forces me to be mindful about what content is <em>learning</em>, and what is at the end of the day just <em>entertainment</em>.</p>
<p>Everything interesting I find on my way is sent to my learning inbox and from there gets triaged, be it a paper, an online essay, a blog post, a YouTube video, or a podcast. When an item ends up in there, there are three things that can happen: I either decide to actively engage with it, to file for future interest, or just trash it. Active engagement is exactly what it sounds like: <strong>I need to take effortful action to consume the content in the list</strong>, otherwise I automatically bucket it as entertainment.</p>
<p>In other words, I need to do something with it. To <em>create</em> something. Write a blog post about it, use it in a new project, test it on the field, teach it at a meetup. That’s why I speak at <a href="https://giansegato.com/about/#talks">many conferences</a>: it’s a learning tool.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/">GTD fashion</a>, permanence in this list is temporary. It’s a release valve, not a …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the summer, I developed a couple of small, sort of silly programs.
One, <a href="https://jakemccrary.com/experiments/photo-fit/">Photo Fit</a>, is a little tool that runs in a web browser and resizes photos to fit as your phone’s background.
The other, <a href="https://default-equipment.herokuapp.com/">Default Equipment</a>, runs on Heroku and automates changing the “bike” of my Strava-tracked e-bike rides to be my <a href="https://onewheel.com/">onewheel</a>.</p>

<p>These weren’t created to solve large problems in the world.
There is no plan to make any money with them.
As of October 2020, Default Equipment doesn’t even work for other people (though it could, send me a message if you’d like to use it and I’ll get around to it).</p>

<p>Each was created to fix a minor annoyance in my life and, because these tools can live on the Internet, they can fix the same minor annoyance in other lives.</p>

<p>With an increasing amount of software in the world, being able to write software is nearly sorcery<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.
As a developer, you can identify a problem in the world and then change the world to remove that problem.
And, depending on the problem, you can remove it for everyone else.</p>

<p>Software developers aren’t alone in being able to identify problems and remove them through creation.
Carpenters can build shelves for their books.
Cooks can prepare food to remove hunger.
You can come up with nearly an infinite number of other examples.</p>

<p>The difference is that a solo developer can solve problems for an unknown number of other folks.
This is enabled by the Internet enabled ease of distribution.
This is very powerful.</p>

<p>Developers can expose their solution to others through a web application.
Desktop or mobile applications can be distributed through various app stores or made available as a download.
Source code can be made available for others to run.
Being able to distribute easily and cheaply is a game changer.</p>

<p>A developer’s change to the world might be a minor improvement.
Photo Fit might never be used by anyone besides me.
But it is still out there, making the world slightly better.
It is available for someone to stumble upon when they are also annoyed by the same problem.</p>

<p>It felt good to write these tiny, useful programs.
If you scope them small enough, there is a definitive ending point<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.
This lets you feel that finishing-a-project satisfaction quickly.
The small size also allows you experiment with new techniques and tools without committing to a large and ongoing commitment.</p>

<p>I wrote both Photo Fit and Default Equipment in TypeScript.
Before the beginning of summer, I didn’t know TypeScript and had little exposure to Node.js.
Now I have some experience with both and gained that while making small improvements to my life and potentially the lives of others.</p>

<p>If you haven’t developed software to solve a small problem recently, I’d recommend doing it.
Don’t hesitate to remove a problem that feels silly.
Removing those problems can still make your life slightly better and gives you an opportunity to learn.
It feels good to remove an annoyance from your life.
If you can, make that software available to others so their lives are improved as well.
Take advantage of the power of easy distribution to improve the world and not just your tiny slice of it.</p>

<div>
<p>Over the years of building software products from scratch in an agile, and iterative fashion, here’s an interesting thought process for software engineering that I’ve recognized to be working very well —&nbsp;</p>
<p>FURPS is an acronym used by Requirement gatherers to categorize requirements into Functionality, Usability. Reliability, Performance, and Supportability.</p>
<p>What I’ve noticed is, if you take them as part of your software development planning and efforts allocation, IN THAT ORDER in terms of the priority, it helps to optimize for the efficiency of the value delivery as the effect of your software building/product delivery.</p>
<p>Let me explain this idea more concretely-</p>
<p>Let’s say you are building a new product from scratch, then the effort allocation for the Version 0 (which might be a Proof of Concept product) can be thought something like this —</p>
<p><strong>ITERATION 0&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Functionality – 60 % or more of your efforts should be put here. Why? because this is V0, and everyone wants to just see whether this works! Nothing is more important than functional software at this point. A common understanding here is that the software is kept as simple as possible at any given point of time while delivering on the functionality.</p>
<p>Usability – 20 % of your efforts should go here. Why? usability is an important factor, but not as critical as functionality, even in case of business to consumer products, and especially in the case of business to business products. Hence, apart from having a “common-sense” usability aspects baked into your product, no special efforts are required here at this point in software development.</p>
<p>Reliability – 10 % of your efforts should go here. Why? as a V0 of the product, the reliability of this software is an inherent effect of its simplicity. When your software isn’t doing too many things, and there aren’t much intra-component communication or complex infrastructure setup, your software is reliable by default. You don’t need to invest too much on reliability at this point.</p>
<p>Performance – 5 %. Why? because premature optimization is the root of all evil! At V0, you are not going to have any particular performance or scalability problems. Even if you have. you probably can’t predict them really well when you are building V0, as you may not be fully aware of the expected behaviour of the user and the system. The best thing here is to wait, roll-out and watch as the performance problems occur. “Common-sense” performance optimization is good enough at this point.</p>
<p>Supportability – 5 %. Why? As a V0, you won’t fully know about how and in what ways supportability might be needed. And at V0, the product builders are best suited to provide the support, can be production hot-fixes, or can be pulling data/reports. Then the product builders would get a good understanding of supportability requirements for the future.</p>
<p>Let’s say you are finished with your V0, and your consumers/stakeholders are happy with the software in the sense that they are confident on “this works”. Now the natural next step is (depending upon the business and consumer need), is to build Version 1 of this software, which would be a more complete solution.</p>
<p>In such a case, the efforts allocation can be done in the following ways —</p>
<p><strong>ITERATION 1</strong></p>
<p>Functionality – 40%. Why? because you are building on top of the simple software that you’ve built for V0. Building functionality with relatively fewer efforts allocation will help you to be focused, keeping it simple, yet delivering what is needed.</p>
<p>Usability – 30%. Why? At this point, you know about what are the most critical pain-points for your users, and you must focus to solve those while keeping it simple.</p>
<p>Reliability – 10% Why? At V1, everyone would expect the software to function reliably. Here you should fix common reliability issues that you’ve noticed in V0 production.</p>
<p>Performance – 10%. Why? at this point, you have already know the performance bottlenecks, and your stakeholders might want to scale it up for the larger audience. So relatively better focus on performance helps here.</p>
<p>Supportability – 10%. Why? because now you have gone through the support process yourself, and you now know what is needed, and you are better suited to build APIs/ tools to better support your software or hand it over to other folks to do it.</p>
<p>With iteration 1, your software is now more stable. Now usually the stakeholders and users expect some new features and better usability with each iteration.</p>
<p>Hence from now onwards, you can do something like this —</p>
<p><strong>ITERATION 2</strong></p>
<p>Functionality – 30 % — Now you’ve built some base systems and components, adding new features would be easy. You can also use this time to reduce tech-debts or refactoring code-smells etc.</p>
<p>Usability – 30 % — This is the time to really invest on usability. You should really go through each flow, design aspects, and start iterating on improving usability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Reliability – 20% — Primarily to mitigate the impact of additional functionality being built as part of V2 on reliability, You must not break working software at the expense of adding something new at this point.</p>
<p>Performance – 20% — Primarily to mitigate the impact of additional functionality being built as part of v2 and scale.</p>
<p>Supportability – 10% — to add on to the supportability and tooling that you have built on V1, and to support the new functionality being built-in v2.</p>
<p>From iteration 3 onwards, you will find the “equilibrium” levels of these figures, which should guide you further, in the process.</p>
<p>To conclude,&nbsp;<strong><em>while building software, most efforts should be put on building the functionality, followed by usability, then reliability, performance, and usability</em></strong><em>. The concrete figures on how much efforts that are put will vary as the time (and iterations) progress, but “FURPS in that order” would still be a general theme.</em></p>
<p>The figures used in the above example will vary depending upon the type of software you’re building, and are representative of the general idea.</p>
<p>All of this thought process has come from my personal experience building software over the years, and not from a formal course or study on this matter.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this? Feel free to share in the comments!</p>

  <section>
    <p>Following our <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/elementary-os-on-pinebook-pro">efforts to bring elementary OS to the ARM-based Pinebook Pro</a>, we’ve added experimental builds for the ARM-based Raspberry Pi 4 series—including the recently-launched Raspberry Pi 400—to our <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://builds.elementary.io/">Early Access</a> program. Like Pinebook Pro builds, Raspberry Pi support is considered an experiment and is not something we have committed to officially support indefinitely. However, if you’re one of the many folks with a Raspberry Pi 4 sitting around and wanted to see how a full, modern desktop operating system runs, elementary OS is now an option!</p>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://blog.elementary.io/images/elementary-os-on-raspberry-pi/desktop.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi 4 running elementary OS"></p>
  <figcaption>My current desktop, powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 running elementary OS</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Personally, I typically use Raspberry Pi 4 as a network device, e.g. a DNS server and for network-attached storage. However, I’ve been using elementary OS builds on it for the past week, and I’m impressed. While it won’t compete experience-wise with a high end desktop, it is a real option for casual computing, development, and writing. In fact, this blog post was written entirely on my Raspberry Pi 4 running elementary OS. It would even be possible to run the same network services on the hardware from within elementary OS just so you get a nice modern GUI when doing any local management.</p>

<p>Like with <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/elementary-os-on-pinebook-pro">Pinebook Pro</a>, there are some things you should know if you plan to use elementary OS Early Access builds on Raspberry Pi:</p>

<h2 id="kernel">Kernel</h2>

<p>Since Ubuntu has released Raspberry Pi images, we are able to rely on that work to ship a supported and updated kernel. Thanks to all of the folks at Canonical and in the Ubuntu community who have worked to make that happen!</p>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<p>elementary OS on Raspberry Pi 4 is not going to match the polished experience of a full modern desktop computer, largely due to our current software stack. GTK3 does not offer GPU-accelerated animations, so animations within apps are less smooth than we would like. Still, for a computer coming in at under $100, it’s impressive and perfectly usable for several tasks.</p>

<p>There are also some things you can do to improve performance. We would definitely recommend using some sort of cooling with your Raspberry Pi, whether that’s a a heatsink and fan (like the recently-announced <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/new-raspberry-pi-4-case-fan/">Raspberry Pi 4 Case Fan</a>), or a passive case like one from <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://flirc.tv/">Flirc</a>—my favorite for its looks and silence. Since Raspberry Pi 4 tends to throttle due to heat under desktop loads, cooling will help it stay more responsive. We also recommend trying USB3 storage as your boot drive, as it should be faster than a microSD card. Using a 1080p (or lower) resolution also works a fair bit better than trying to push a 1440p or 4K display, but your mileage may vary based on your use case.</p>

<h2 id="supported-raspberry-pi-models">Supported Raspberry Pi Models</h2>

<p>We recommend Raspberry Pi 4 or Raspberry Pi 400 with 4 GB RAM at a minimum—but the more, the better. (We don’t even recommend less than 8 GB for computers with much faster CPUs, graphics, and storage.)</p>

<p>Older models of Raspberry Pi (like the original, Raspberry Pi Zero, Raspberry Pi 2 series, and Raspberry Pi 3 series) are not supported; elementary OS requires the faster processor, additional RAM, and 64-bit architecture of the Raspberry Pi 4 series. For older models, we recommend sticking to Raspberry Pi OS or a “headless” OS like Ubuntu Server.</p>

<h2 id="run-elementary-os-on-raspberry-pi">Run elementary OS on Raspberry Pi</h2>

<p>In its current state, we would not consider elementary OS on Raspberry Pi as polished of an experience as running on well-supported AMD- or Intel-based hardware.</p>

<p>That said, the audience for Raspberry Pi leans toward tinkerers and experimenters; as such, we’ve decided to publish our builds under our <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://builds.elementary.io/">Early Access builds</a> program. This means dedicated <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/elementary">sponsors</a> of elementary OS who wish to run elementary OS on Raspberry Pi can download it from the same place as Early Access builds of elementary OS. As a note, all of this work has been focused on bringing the <strong>pre-release of elementary OS 6</strong> to Raspberry Pi, so all the usual disclaimers about pre-release builds apply here as well.</p>



<p>Once you have access to Early Access builds, head over to the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/elementary/os/wiki/Raspberry-Pi">elementary OS wiki</a> to get it installed on your own hardware. If you find and file any issues, please remember to specify the build of the OS you downloaded as well as that you are running on Raspberry Pi—it will help us validate and triage issues much more quickly.</p>

<h2 id="thanks-to-andrew-david-hewitt-and-marius-meisenzahl">Thanks to Andrew, David Hewitt, and Marius Meisenzahl</h2>

<p>Bringing elementary OS to Raspberry Pi was a collaborative effort. <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/andrewc910">Andrew</a>, <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/davidmhewitt">David Hewitt</a>, and <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/meisenzahl">Marius Meisenzahl</a> specifically worked to prototype, improve, and ultimately ship these builds. And of course countless folks across the Raspberry Pi Foundation, Debian, Canonical, Ubuntu, and more have worked for years on making the underlying system work well for us to build on.</p>

		<p>It has been almost two years since Talos was first announced to the world. ARM support was almost immediately a feature request. At the time the project had major features missing that needed to be implemented before we could even <em>think</em> about Talos on ARM. Only after forming a company, hiring a kick ass team, and pouring a tremendous amount of time and love into Talos have we finally been able to achieve this.</p>
<p>The Talos team is proud to announce support for four ARM single board computers (SBCs) in our latest alpha release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi 4 Model B</li>
<li>Pine64 Rock64</li>
<li>Banana Pi M64</li>
<li>Libre Computer ALL-H3-CC H5 (Tritium)</li>
</ul>
<p>For those not familiar with Talos, it is an ultra minimal OS with an API instead of ssh+shell built for the purpose of running Kubernetes with security as a priority. The image is immutable, the runtime is ephemeral, and the configuration is declarative. For more on what all of this means, see our documentation at <a href="https://www.talos.dev/">https://www.talos.dev/</a>. We think you will love it.</p>
<p>Landing support for SBCs signifies a huge milestone for Talos. You can now run Talos nearly anywhere you can imagine. The same Talos is able to run in the cloud, on-premise, and now at the edge. This means you get a resource efficient, secure, and reliable OS running the same vanilla Kubernetes that you run in production datacenters - wherever you might need it.</p>
<p>We are looking to add support for more boards. Please, let us know what boards you might be interested in by creating an issue in the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/talos-systems/talos">repo</a>.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-i-care-about-this">Why do I care about this</h2>

<p>Recently I solved <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/issues/396">this</a> delta issue,
where the maintainer asked to switch from Travis CI to GitHub actions.</p>

<p>These are all the pull requests I’ve done if you want to have a look at this journey:
<a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/399">#399</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/400">#400</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/409">#409</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/411">#411</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/413">#413</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/417">#417</a>
and finally <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/418">#418</a>.</p>

<p>And yes..As you can see I like small incremental work and early feedback instead of giant pull requests. 😁</p>

<p>Anyway, the delta project has a lot of compilation targets and the binaries are automatically released in the
GitHub releases <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/releases">page</a> every time the project is tagged. Sweet. 😌</p>

<p><img src="https://www.marcoieni.com/2020/12/rust-makes-cross-compilation-childs-play/delta.png" alt="delta releases" title="Releases"></p>

<p>From an x86_64 architecture (TLDR: common 64 bit Intel or AMD processors) it is really straightforward to
compile for a different operating system with <code>cargo</code> if you are targeting the same architecture.
For example if you want to compile for macOS you just need to run:</p>

<pre><code>rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin
cargo build --target x86_64-apple-darwin
</code></pre>

<p>The problems start to arise when you want to compile for a different architecture, such as i686 (32 bit) or ARM processors.
In this case, you have to install some dependencies and set some environment variables, which may be painful.
For example, in the old continuous integrations scripts of delta,
<a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/blob/15d06cbf7584570ec3b5beaba99cb8898f9ec3dc/etc/ci/before_install.sh">this</a>
was the way dependencies were installed. Ugly, I know. As rust developers we are used to great tools,
so there must be a better way right?</p>

<h2 id="meet-cross">Meet Cross</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>“Zero setup” cross compilation and “cross testing” of Rust crates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the description of the <a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross">Cross</a> tool.</p>

<p>The TLDR is that it let you compile and test rust projects for architectures other than i686 and x86_64.</p>

<p>Instead of doing <code>cargo build --target &lt;YOUR_TARGET&gt;</code> you simply do <code>cross build --target &lt;YOUR_TARGET&gt;</code>.
Based on the target, in fact, cross will run a docker image that has all the right dependencies already
installed and configured by the rust-embedded team itself. 😉
And that’s it..just run <code>cargo install cross</code> and you are ready to cross-compile for all
<a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross#supported-targets">these</a> targets in rust, no other dependency
is required, except docker of course!</p>

<p>Obviously this was not an exhaustive overview about cross and I encourage you to have a look at the GitHub page
if you are interested.</p>

<h2 id="cross-in-github-actions">Cross in GitHub actions</h2>

<p>Of course, after a whole morning getting mad trying to setup weird ubuntu dependencies for the delta issue,
when I found out about cross I felt very stupid for not knowing it in advance and I tried to integrate it in the
Continuous Deployment delta pipeline.</p>

<p>It turns out that this is like the easiest thing in the world! The <a href="https://github.com/actions-rs/cargo">action-rs/cargo</a> action
I was already using had built-in <a href="https://github.com/actions-rs/cargo#cross-compilation">support</a> for cross.
Now I even felt more stupid, but anyway..you just need to set the <code>use-cross</code> variable to <code>true</code> and you are done!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/blob/e198c0d841d9fb660e59e0329235a8601b407c69/.github/workflows/cd.yml#L32-L37">This</a>
is the step that builds the whole delta project for all its different targets..easy, right? 😀</p>

<h2 id="cross-in-rust-github-template">Cross in Rust GitHub template</h2>

<p>You may or (probably) may not be aware of <a href="https://rust-github.github.io/">Rust GitHub Template</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rust GitHub Template is a template for cargo generate that aims to be a starting point suitable for the vast majority of rust projects that will be hosted on GitHub.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Beyond all its nice goodies, this template will setup Continuous Deployment for you, therefore whenever
you tag your project, it will be published on <code>crates.io</code> and the binaries will be released in the GitHub Releases page,
just like in delta. 😁</p>

<p>Until today, Rust GitHub template only supported x86_64 windows, linux and mac, but after I found out Cross I couldn’t resist
and I added support for i686 and aarch64 linux architectures, which are both two <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html">tier 1</a> rust targets.
In practice, this means your “old thinkpad” and “raspberry pi” users will thank you a lot. 😛</p>

is an example of the resulting Continuous Deployment step.</p>

<p>And that was it, after I spent a lot of <em>very useful</em> time trying to setup compilation dependencies basically I just wanted to share my love for the <code>cross</code>

      <p>PHP8 was <a href="https://www.php.net/releases/8.0/en.php">released</a> on the
26<sup>th</sup> of November 2020. It brought a lot of interesting things,
security-wise, but also showcases a couple of (minor) missed opportunities in my
opinion.</p>
<h2 id="type-safety"><a href="#type-safety">Type safety</a></h2>
<p>I'm a big fan on relying on typing to ensure security properties,
like <a href="https://web.dev/trusted-types/">Trusted types</a> in javascript: it
shouldn't compile if it's not secure.</p>
<p>PHP8 won't try to cast string into numbers anymore, thanks to the 
<a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/string_to_number_comparison">Saner string to number comparisons RFC</a>,
meaning that collision with hashes starting with <code>0e</code> and the likes are finally
a thing of the past! This is a subset of Snuffleupagus' <a href="https://snuffleupagus.readthedocs.io/features.html#preventing-sloppy-comparisons">sloppy comparison
prevention</a> feature.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/consistent_type_errors">Consistent type errors for internal functions RFC</a>
will prevent things like <code>0 == strcmp($_GET['username'], $password)</code> bypasses,
since <code>strcmp</code> won't return <code>null</code> and spit a warning any longer,
but will throw a proper exception instead. This was also a <a href="https://externals.io/message/106522">nice opportunity</a>
for PHP to add annotations for functions parameters and return types.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/arithmetic_operator_type_checks">Stricter type checks for arithmetic/bitwise operators</a>
and <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/engine_warnings">PHP RFC: Reclassifying engine warnings</a> RFC
are in the same spirit.</p>
<h2 id="jit"><a href="#jit">JIT</a></h2>
<p>PHP8 comes with a <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/jit">JIT</a> based on
<a href="https://luajit.org/dynasm.html">DynASM</a>, bringing an RWX memory space into
PHP's memory space, into a shared allocation, meaning that its offset won't
change between different PHP8+ processes.</p>
<p>Moreover, DynASM isn't designed with processing/compilation/execution of
untrusted code in mind, and doesn't do things like constants blinding and
advanced folding to mitigate against spraying, nor random padding/nop
insertion, nor ensuring that the memory region is never both writeable <em>and</em>
executable to prevent direct code injection. This means that it's now way
easier to gain native code execution when exploiting memory corruptions,
albeit to be fair, most attackers are happy with a php code execution,
and won't push further.</p>
<p>Having a JIT comes with a lot of code complexity and maintenance burden. I'll
be without doubt a <a href="https://bugs.php.net/search.php?cmd=display&amp;order_by=ts1&amp;direction=DESC&amp;limit=30&amp;package_name[]=JIT">great source of
bugs</a>,
for a minor speed improvement on real-life workloads.</p>
<h2 id="cryptography"><a href="#cryptography">Cryptography</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><code>password_hash</code> now automatically generates a salt, accepting a
    user-provided one is deprecated.</li>
<li><code>crypt</code> will now fail instead of silently falling back to
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypt_(C)#Traditional_DES-based_scheme">DES</a>
    when an unknown salt format was provided. The parameter is also made
    mandatory, hashing without a salt is now unsupported.</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5652">RFC 5652</a> is now exposed via the OpenSSL extension.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="misc"><a href="#misc">Misc</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.errorcontrol.php">error control operator</a>, aka <code>@</code>
    won't silence fatal errors anymore, meaning that poorly written webshells will have more chances
    to leave traces in your logs.</li>
<li><code>libxml_disable_entity_loader</code> is now deprecated, even if it's not (yet) reflected in php's documentation.
    This is acceptable since PHP8 now requires at least libxml 2.9.0,
    which comes with external entity loading disabled by default.</li>
<li>Access to undefined constants will throw an error, instead of being silently
  interpreted as a string, no more <code>SALT</code> being silently converted to <code>"SALT"</code>.</li>
<li><code>create_function</code> was <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/ee16d99504f0014c3d292809da927fb622293f41">removed</a>, closing its infamous code injection vector.</li>
<li><code>array_key_exists</code> throws when passed an array/object, instead of silently
  doing nonsense.</li>
<li>The <code>e</code> modifier in <code>mb_ereg_replace</code> has been removed.</li>
<li>Metadata associated with a phar will
  <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/phar_stop_autoloading_metadata">no longer be unserialized</a>,
    killing a low-hanging
    <a href="https://github.com/s-n-t/presentations/blob/master/us-18-Thomas-It's-A-PHP-Unserialization-Vulnerability-Jim-But-Not-As-We-Know-It.pdf">RCE vector</a>.</li>
<li><code>FILTER_SANITIZE_MAGIC_QUOTES</code>, <code>get_magic_quotes_gpc</code> and <code>get_magic_quotes_runtime</code> have been removed,
  people will now have to do proper sanitization instead.</li>
<li>As usual, a couple of memory safety issues were fixed,
    <a href="https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=80242">some</a>
    <a href="https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=76618">exploitable</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jvoisin/snuffleupagus">Snuffleupagus</a> is currently being
    ported to php8!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="missed-opportunities"><a href="#missed-opportunities">Missed opportunities</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/engine_warnings#undefined_variable">Undefined
variables</a>, as
opposed to constants, are still not an error, meaning that things like <code>solt</code>
instead of <code>salt</code> might (and will) go unnoticed.</p>
<p>Converting an <code>Array</code> to a string will only yield a <code>Warning</code> instead of an
error, albeit that now that <code>__toString</code> <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/tostring_exceptions">can <em>finally</em>
throw</a>, it might hopefully change
in the near future.</p>
<p>Albeit significant <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/easy_userland_csprng">CSPRNG</a>
<a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/random-function-exceptions">improvements</a> have been
merged in PHP7, PHP8 didn't seize the opportunity to keep the momentum and to
aliases <code>rand</code> and <code>mt_rand</code> to <code>random_int</code>, like
<a href="https://snuffleupagus.readthedocs.io/features.html#weak-prng-via-rand-mt-rand">Snuffleupagus</a> is doing.</p>
<p>An other missed opportunity in my opinion is that there is <a href="https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=50715">still no
way</a> to disable some <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.php">PHP's wrappers</a>, except via
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.stream-wrapper-unregister.php"><code>stream_wrapper_unregister</code></a>
but this can be reversed with
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.stream-wrapper-restore.php"><code>stream_wrapper_restore</code></a>.
Wrappers are scary: the main use I've seen for the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.php.php#wrappers.php.filter"><code>filter://</code>
one</a> is
exfiltrating data via <code>php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/some/file</code>, and is a <a href="https://www.netsparker.com/blog/web-security/php-stream-wrappers/">decent
amount of</a>

<a href="https://gynvael.coldwind.pl/?lang=en&amp;id=671">stuff</a> lurking in the shadows.
Providing a way to reduce this attack surface (like making streams opt-in)
would be welcome.</p>

<![CDATA[Count-Distinct Using Flajolet Martin Algorithm]]>
            </title>

December 6, 2020 | https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/flajolet-martin | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/flajolet-martin">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Measuring the number of distinct elements from a stream of values is one of the most common utilities that finds its application in the field of Database Query Optimizations, Network Topology, Internet Routing, Big Data Analytics, and Data Mining.</p>
<p>A deterministic count-distinct algorithm either demands a large auxiliary space or takes some extra time for its computation. But what if, instead of finding the cardinality deterministically and accurately we just approximate, can we do better? This was addressed in one of the first algorithms in approximating count-distinct introduced in the seminal paper titled <a href="http://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/Publications/FlMa85.pdf">Probabilistic Counting Algorithms for Data Base Applications</a> by Philippe Flajolet and G. Nigel Martin in 1984.</p>
<p>In this essay, we dive deep into this algorithm and find how wittily it approximates the count-distinct by making a single pass on the stream of elements and using a fraction of auxiliary space.</p>

<p>The problem statement of determining count-distinct is very simple -</p>
<p><em>Given a stream of elements, output the total number of distinct elements as efficiently as possible.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/101273043-250c3800-37b8-11eb-9e0c-435e386f3529.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/101273043-250c3800-37b8-11eb-9e0c-435e386f3529.png"></p>
<p>In the illustration above the stream has the following elements <code>4</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>7</code>, <code>4</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>7</code>, <code>6</code>, <code>5</code>, <code>3</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>4</code>, <code>7</code> and <code>1</code>. The stream has in all <code>7</code> unique elements and hence it is the count-distinct of this stream.</p>
<p>Deterministically computing count-distinct is an easy affair, we need a data structure to hold all the unique elements as we iterate the stream. Data structures like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(abstract_data_type)">Set</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">Hash Table</a> suit this use-case particularly well. A simple pythonic implementation of this approach is as programmed below</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>cardinality</span><span>(elements: int)</span> -&gt; int:</span>
    <span>return</span> len(set(elements))
</code></pre>
<p>Above deterministic approach demands an auxiliary space of <code>O(n)</code> so as to accurately measure the cardinality. But when we are allowed to approximate the count we can do it with a fraction of auxiliary space using the Flajolet-Martin Algorithm.</p>

<p>The Flajolet-Martin algorithm uses the position of the rightmost set and unset bit to approximate the count-distinct in a given stream. The two seemingly unrelated concepts are intertwined using probability. It uses extra storage of order <code>O(log m)</code> where <code>m</code> is the number of unique elements in the stream and provides a practical estimate of the cardinalities.</p>
<h2>The intuition</h2>
<p>Given a good uniform distribution of numbers, the probability that the rightmost set bit is at position <code>0</code> is <code>1/2</code>, probability of rightmost set bit is at position <code>1</code> is <code>1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4</code>, at position <code>2</code> it is <code>1/8</code> and so on.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/101275842-e635ac80-37ce-11eb-9e00-357b966cbac6.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/101275842-e635ac80-37ce-11eb-9e00-357b966cbac6.png"></p>
<p>In general, we can say, the probability of the rightmost set bit, in binary presentation, to be at the position <code>k</code> in a uniform distribution of numbers is</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/101275886-357bdd00-37cf-11eb-9bc6-346332031eb2.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/101275886-357bdd00-37cf-11eb-9bc6-346332031eb2.png"></p>
<p>The probability of the rightmost set bit drops by a factor of <code>1/2</code> with every position from the Least Significant Bit to the Most Significant Bit.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/101276356-1cc0f680-37d2-11eb-858d-3f40061988f0.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/101276356-1cc0f680-37d2-11eb-858d-3f40061988f0.png"></p>
<p>So if we keep on recording the position of the rightmost set bit, <code>ρ</code>, for every element in the stream (assuming uniform distribution) we should expect <code>ρ = 0</code> to be <code>0.5</code>, <code>ρ = 1</code> to be <code>0.25</code>, and so on. This probability should become <code>0</code> when bit position, <code>b</code> is <code>b &gt; log m</code> while it should be non-zero when <code>b &lt;= log m</code> where <code>m</code> is the number of distinct elements in the stream.</p>
<p>Hence, if we find the rightmost unset bit position <code>b</code> such that the probability is <code>0</code>, we can say that the number of unique elements will approximately be <code>2 ^ b</code>. This forms the core intuition behind the Flajolet Martin algorithm.</p>
<h2>Ensuring uniform distribution</h2>
<p>The above intuition and approximation are based on the assumption that the distribution of the elements in the stream is uniform, which cannot always be true. The elements can be sparse and dense in patches. To ensure uniformity we hash the elements using a multiplicative hash function</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/98463097-f7df6080-21de-11eb-8b61-a84ff7ad85de.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/98463097-f7df6080-21de-11eb-8b61-a84ff7ad85de.png"></p>
<p>where <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are odd numbers and <code>c</code> is the capping limit of the hash range. This hash function hashes the elements uniformly into a hash range of size <code>c</code>.</p>
<h2>The procedure</h2>
<p>The procedure of the Flajolet-Martin algorithm is as elegant as its intuition. We start with defining a closed hash range, big enough to hold the maximum number of unique values possible - something as big as <code>2 ^ 64</code>. Every element of the stream is passed through a hash function that permutes the elements in a uniform distribution.</p>
<p>For this hash value, we find the position of the rightmost set bit and mark the corresponding position in the bit vector as <code>1</code>, suggesting that we have seen the position. Once all the elements are processed, the bit vector will have <code>1</code>s at all the positions corresponding to the position of every rightmost set bit for all elements in the stream.</p>
<p>Now we find the position, <code>b</code>, of the rightmost <code>0</code> in this bit vector. This position <code>b</code> corresponds to the rightmost set bit that we have not seen while processing the elements. This corresponds to the probability <code>0</code> and hence as per the intuition will help in approximating the cardinality as <code>2 ^ b</code>.</p>
<pre><code>
L = <span>64</span>

<p>Although the above algorithm does a decent job of approximating count-distinct it has a huge error margin, which can be fixed by averaging the approximations with multiple hash functions. The original Flajolet-Martin algorithm also suggests that the final approximation needs a correction by dividing the approximation by the factor <code>ϕ = 0.77351</code>.</p>
<p>The algorithm was <a href="https://github.com/arpitbbhayani/flajolet-martin/blob/master/flajolet-martin.ipynb">run</a> on a stream size of <code>1048</code> with a varying number of distinct elements and we get the following plot.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/101244923-58ef4b00-372f-11eb-9193-8e9d6dc6a227.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/101244923-58ef4b00-372f-11eb-9193-8e9d6dc6a227.png"></p>
<p>From the illustration above we see that the approximated count-distinct using the Flajolet-Martin algorithm is very close to the actual deterministic value.</p>
<p>A great feature of this algorithm is that the result of this approximation will be the same whether the elements appear a million times or just a few times, as we only consider the rightmost set bit across all elements and do not sample.</p>
<h3>Unique words in Thee Jungle Book</h3>
<p>The algorithm was run on the text dump of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jungle_Book">The Jungle Book</a> by Rudyard Kipling. The text was converted into a stream of tokens and it was found that the total number of unique tokens was <code>7150</code>. The approximation of the same using the Flajolet-Martin algorithm came out to be <code>7606</code> which in fact is pretty close to the actual number.</p>

December 6, 2020 | https://docs.prudent.me/blog/2020/12/5/open-digital | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://docs.prudent.me/blog/2020/12/5/open-digital">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>This article on The Business Times is interesting:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/banking-finance/open-banking-apis-a-bigger-threat-to-singapore-banks-than-digital-entrants-dbs">Open banking APIs a bigger threat to Singapore banks than digital entrants: DBS Research</a></p>
<p>While it focuses on the disruptive forces of open banking on traditional banks, I am more excited because it seems hopeful that Prudent users will finally be able to make Bank Account Enquiries (one of the three use cases on <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/development/fintech/technologies---apis">MAS' API page</a>)</p>
<p>Per the article: <i>"open banking may enable consumers to aggregate their banking, insurance and investment information across banks and financial institutions on a single platform"</i></p>
<p>This is exactly what Prudent need! Currently, Prudent extensions gets these information by means of texts and PDF imports, which is not exactly the best user experience, but it works...</p>
<p>If this upcoming 😉<i>digital service for financial planning</i>😜 will draw inspiration from PSD2, there should be an OBIE like API that allows secure access to the Account Information interface. To this end, there are three interesting aspects:</p>
<p><b>1) Registration with a National Competent Authority</b></p>
<p>Open banking initiatives typically requires 3rd party developers accessing customer data to be registered with a National Competent Authority. I hope this is done on a tiered basis, i.e. the criteria for read-only access to retail banking transaction data should not be prohibitive for citizen developers and individuals making available creative apps! I think it's reasonable considering the read-only nature and with user-consumer consent. Payment initiation and funds confirmation approval criteria can be higher.</p>
<p><b>2) Sandboxes</b></p>
<p>Sandboxes can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it provides a comfortable environment for institutions, developers and user-consumers to figure out how and what things can be done. The flip side is when everyone gets too comfortable playing in the sandbox and do not move on.</p>
<p>Well, if the latter is the case, might as well have individual sandboxes where developers can access actual data of their accounts. In this case, perpetual sandboxes are totally fine! After all, programming is not an exclusive skill and tools can be made available for users to utilize these sandboxes without any coding (i.e. by re-using readily available code and clients).</p>
<p><b>3) Just JSON will do...</b></p>
<p>Lastly, if read-only APIs still seem a little daunting, the very least that can be done quickly is to provide transaction exports via e-mail in JSON instead of CSVs and PDFs. Sigh! I also wish trusted browser makers can make headless HTTP clients exclusively for API use, that will really spur the API economy! After all, from a security perspective, how different is it to browse these data vs programmatically using these data?</p>
<p>Selifishly, these are ideas on what helps Prudent and its users. Nevertheless, I hope it provides some glimpse into what a developer hopes for in open banking, however representative that may be. 🙏🏻</p>

                    <p>Yesterday, my cofounder wrote a <a href="https://blog.nillium.com/its-time-to-remove-news-from-facebook-and-google/">controversial post on this blog</a>, presenting a case for news publishers to limit -- or remove -- their reporting from Facebook and Google. &nbsp;The responses were immediate and plentiful, but fascinatingly different depending on the audience.</p><p>On Hacker News, a tech- and startup-focused forum, the link rose to the top of the list before being “flagged” and removed from the front page. &nbsp;The<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25249414"> comments there</a> took a more pragmatic, technical approach to the problem, from “<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25249553">The technical capability already exists in the form of robots.txt and the referer header,</a>” to constant reminders that news organizations <em>need</em> this traffic.</p><p>On the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/k3kmg9/its_time_to_remove_news_from_facebook_and_google/">r/journalism subreddit</a>, we were hit from the other side. &nbsp;Why not just “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/k3kmg9/its_time_to_remove_news_from_facebook_and_google/ge3zqq2/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">nationalize the press so we can quit with the hand-wringing</a>?” suggested one commenter, while another lamented that “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/k3kmg9/its_time_to_remove_news_from_facebook_and_google/ge51kko/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">this idea disenfranchises young journalists who don’t have any name credibility and recognition and need an established platforms [sic] gravitas to help establish them</a>.”</p><p>If ever there was a good illustration of the disconnect we face in trying to make journalism sustainable again, this is it. &nbsp;The tech side that constantly proclaims “information wants to be free,” and sees pay-for-journalism as a solved problem through Substack, and the jaded newsroom audience who sees another tech platform trying to come in and get them financially hooked.</p><p>The problem, of course, is that it is not a problem equally felt across these camps. &nbsp;The Hacker News crowd is absolutely correct when they say that news organizations need the traffic coming from social media and aggregators -- they do! -- but that is a sign of addiction, not a healthy ecosystem. &nbsp;And the journalist demographic has every reason to assume the worst, because they have been hurt before.</p><p>The economics of this are simple. &nbsp;</p><p>A few decades ago, people subscribed to newspapers, written on paper, that were delivered every morning. &nbsp;The subscription fee never fully covered the cost of running a newspaper; ads appeared between articles, and that subscription base guaranteed an audience for the sponsors. &nbsp;These publications naively started putting their articles online for free -- if advertising could buoy their business up until this point, why would the web be any different? &nbsp;As the ad market matured, CPMs increased, and slowly, internet advertising started to represent real money.</p><p>But then things went viral. &nbsp;Lots of things. &nbsp;People started sharing news articles they read (or <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/06/16/six-in-10-of-you-will-share-this-link-without-reading-it-according-to-a-new-and-depressing-study/%20Show%20less">didn’t read</a>) on social media. &nbsp;Tech companies tweaked their sorting algorithms to get content to eyeballs -- and did so incredibly successfully. But, this created our first problem.</p><h3 id="problem-1-hard-news-doesn-t-trend">Problem 1: Hard news doesn't trend</h3><p>Admittedly, this is only a problem depending on what side of the fence you sit.</p><p>If your goal -- like that of any number of tech companies -- is to get content in front of your users that they will engage with -- then this has been an unmitigated success. &nbsp;However, if you are reporting out a story for a specific audience, not being able to reach them is problematic. &nbsp;</p><p>At this point, the tech side may wonder why if your articles are so great, the audience isn’t seeking it out. &nbsp;The answer, I suspect, is that the audience does not know it is there.</p><p>Virtually any digital editor will tell you that most traffic bypasses the homepage. &nbsp;Users rarely think &nbsp;“I wonder what is happening today?” and seek out the news site; rather, they are told what is happening by the sorting algorithms and walk away feeling like they are updated. &nbsp;That works to a degree, except that hard news -- especially local news -- does not trend.</p><p>No one shares the summary of last night’s city council meeting. &nbsp;Even the most damning investigative report will only get so far if it is focused on a small area; users outside the area just won’t amplify it.</p><h3 id="problem-2-fake-news">Problem 2: Fake News</h3><p>What <em>does</em> trend? &nbsp;The outrageous, crazy things that you want to share with the world. &nbsp;Of course, that’s not to say all viral headlines are fake, but at this point it seems pretty well accepted that many are.</p><p>Because anyone can write and post anything, these wholly fabricated, or hyper-partisan stories are usually placed in the same regard as those that are rigorously reported and fact-checked. They are then forced to compete against each other for attention.</p><p>Worse yet, these posts can be so malignant that it impugns the reputation of “the media” -- because now you cannot believe what you read.<br></p><h3 id="problem-3-clickbait">Problem 3: Clickbait</h3><p>How do you compete then? &nbsp;By stooping lower. &nbsp;It means publishers resort to writing clickbait headlines to grab a second or two of user attention, and then covering the article page in more clickbait links to keep them there. &nbsp;</p><p>It can even creep into the editorial decisions: Knowing what people are searching for or clicking on can shape what reporters are assigned. <br></p><h3 id="problem-4-all-the-ads">Problem 4: All the ads</h3><p>Why do drivers in your area need to know about that new law? &nbsp;What celebrity finally “broke [their] silence?” &nbsp;I <em>know</em> I won’t believe what happens next. &nbsp;</p><p>These ads are annoying. These ads are detrimental to the user experience that any publication wants. &nbsp;But these ads are needed -- they are a symptom of the addiction. &nbsp;When the flow of users becomes constricted, these organizations have no other choice but to exploit their traffic for as much as it is worth; it’s survival.</p><p>Those ads in between articles in the print newspaper? &nbsp;They still exist, but they are now sold by Facebook, Twitter, and Google. &nbsp;Money is still being made off of the reader, it just is not going to the people doing the reporting. &nbsp;And partnerships between newsrooms and tech giants are generally for big, national outlets, leaving the local newsroom to suffer.</p><h3 id="problem-5-brain-drain">Problem 5: Brain drain</h3><p>As awful as this all is for the casual news consumer, it is worse for the people working on it all day everyday. &nbsp;No one wants assignment-by-SEO. No one wants the ads all over the place. And most of all, no one wants the layoffs. &nbsp;So those that can are fleeing to Substack, or creating their own publications.</p><p>That is great for them, and I wish them all the best. &nbsp;But as that Reddit commenter pointed out, that only works for reporters who have made a name for themselves. &nbsp;It is much more common to follow someone because you like their ideas than someone who you think reports out a story well. &nbsp;</p><p>What about all of those wide eyed, young, idealistic reporters <em>looking </em>to make a name for themselves? &nbsp;What about all of the important stories <em>they</em> are covering? &nbsp;Will now fewer people go to the legacy publications once the big names jump ship?<br></p><h3 id="what-we-re-doing">What we're doing</h3><p>This is why Xana wrote what she did, and made the case firms should pay up. &nbsp;First, it got your attention enough to rise above the noise (a requirement, as discussed above). And it also presented this point: The traffic coming from big tech, while needed for local news’ survival, is also killing it. The answer cannot be found in robots.txt -- it comes from rethinking the model of how we find our users, and how we interact with them.</p><p>Forth is our answer. &nbsp; </p><p>We want to take what is appealing about discovering news on social, and replicate it, but with reporters we know and trust. &nbsp;We want to help them build personal brands because we know younger generations tend to trust real people over companies or institutions (think: influencers). &nbsp;We want to rev-share, not because we think it is a selling point, but to align our incentives with those of the newsrooms; we both succeed together.</p><p>We will be launching soon in markets where we feel we have enough reporters to make using our app worthwhile. &nbsp;If you are a reporter or represent a newsroom, we would love to hear from you at <a href="mailto:hello@nillium.com">hello@nillium.com</a>. &nbsp;If you want to read what our partners are writing, please sign up for the <a href="https://www.forthapp.com/list.html">waiting list</a> -- we will let you know as soon as we are live in your area.</p>

December 6, 2020 | https://www.alvarez.io/posts/two-factor-encryption/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.alvarez.io/posts/two-factor-encryption/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>Security is an illusion, especially with computers. The systems are so complex, handled by so many different people that nobody really has a good idea of how everything works. Even the best specialists have knowledge gaps: software, hardware, etc… This creates a security nightmare: breaking stuff is trivial, fixing the systems is nearly impossible.</p>
<h2 id="high-security-systems-still-exist">High Security Systems Still Exist</h2>
<p>There are systems that are protected against nearly all attacks. <strong>Their main philosophy is not to fix the security issues but to prevent an attacker from accessing the system in the first place.</strong> You can’t hack something that’s not there. However these systems are painful to use, especially for their lack of internet connection. Here are the main techniques used in a high security system:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Air Gapping</strong>: The device can’t connect to anything that is not physically plugged into it. No internet, wifi, bluetooth, speaker, microphone, webcam. Anything that can communicate with the outside world is physically removed from the electronic device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Non Contamination Protocol</strong>: Air Gapping is not sufficient (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet">stuxnet</a> is a good example of why it isn’t). Everything plugged into the air gapped device (like usb keys) can’t be plugged anywhere else. No exceptions. This prevents any information from getting out. I would even recommend not to plug anything that comes from another device (stuff like stuxnet or ransomware can still make some damage).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Physical Protection</strong>: Non-contaminated air gapped devices are impossible to attack remotely. The only way is to access them physically. Having the electronic device hidden in a place that is difficult to access (e.g. in a safe) will protect it better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Full Disk Encryption</strong>: Physical Protection is not foolproof. An attacker can still get access to it with enough resources. To protect the information inside your device, encrypt its entire content. Not all types of encryption are made equal, we will talk about it later in this article.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tamper Evident System</strong>: The last remaining attack on an electronic device, after you’ve already used all of the above techniques, is to tamper it. The main goal is to access the encryption key when it is entered. Using tamper evident techniques (hardware and software) will alert you that somebody has modified your device to access your password (more about it in Two Layers of Encryption below).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Backup</strong>: The last remaining problem is system failure. As long as your backups follow all of the above techniques, you can have as many as you want. Store them in a different location for increased safety.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Security is more about how you use the hardware/software rather than having a secure device in itself. It’s more about protocol than technology.</strong></p>
<p>I have seen classified environment with less security than the one just presented. Using a device with all of the above techniques will guarantee an electronic fortress. However this creates a big problem: <strong>you become the information’s weak link</strong>. It means that an attacker will no longer try to hack or decrypt your device, but instead will threaten you in order to access the information inside it.</p>
<h2 id="plausible-deniability">Plausible Deniability</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.alvarez.io/img/color/2FE.png" alt="Rubber-hose cryptanalysis">
<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber-hose_cryptanalysis">Rubber-hose cryptanalysis</a> from <a href="https://xkcd.com/538/">xkcd</a></em></p>
<p>To prevent being compelled to reveal your passwords, somebody invented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption">Deniable Encryption</a>. Basically you have two passwords: when you enter the first one the information decrypted is different than when you enter the second one. You use your device with the second password to work on the sensitive information (which can’t be accessed using the first password). In case somebody threatens you, you give them the first password. They will decrypt your device and see that there is no information (or if there is, info that is not sensitive).</p>
<p>In practice Plausible Deniability is problematic:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tools and techniques exist to detect the presence of a secondary password (Deniable Encryption).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your attacker sees that the system can use plausible deniability, they may not believe that there is only one password and therefore may continue to threaten you until you reveal the second one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It will be harder for you to pass lie detection tests since you are still able to access the sensitive information using a secondary password.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What you really want, if threatened, is not to be physically able to unlock your device. If you can’t decrypt the information, nobody has a reason to threaten you.</p>
<h2 id="two-factor-encryption">Two Factor Encryption</h2>
<p>Two Factor Encryption uses your password in addition to something you possess to generate the encryption key of your device. In general these secondary factors look like USB keys. To decrypt the information, you need your password (50% of the key) and some information you don’t know, stored/calculated by your secondary factor (the other 50% of the key).</p>
<p>You can’t open your device without these two elements: your password and the secondary factor.</p>
<p>The beautiful thing is that if you break the secondary factor, you won’t be able to access your device and its backups. You can’t be compelled to decrypt the information, because you simply can’t: your password, which you can now freely communicate to your attacker, will not be enough.</p>
<p><strong>Using Two Factor Encryption creates a physical “red button” which, if pressed, will destroy all access to the information in your devices (even offline backups stored in different locations).</strong></p>
<p>This also has the side effect of preventing you from accessing your device’s information ever again. This is one disadvantage of Two Factor Encryption over Plausible Deniability, which is that you can’t access your data after the attacker is done with you. However if you’re handling sensitive information, it is very likely that you’d rather have it destroyed than letting it fall into the wrong hands.</p>
<h2 id="yubikey">YubiKey</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.alvarez.io/img/color/2FE-2.png" alt="YubiKey"></p>
<p>A nice, affordable second factor for your encryption is a <a href="https://www.yubico.com/">YubiKey</a>. However there is no straightforward manual on how to use it, and the key has quite complex modes and functionalities.</p>
<p>If you are not a technical person, I will recommend using the <a href="https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016614980-Understanding-Core-Static-Password-Features">password mode</a>. It is not as safe as the challenge mode, but it will be simpler to use and to configure.</p>
<p><strong>Password Mode</strong></p>
<p>The YubiKey can act as a usb keyboard. When the button is pressed, it will send a combination of keys (a kind of password) as if someone was typing. This makes it compatible with everything that requires a typed password. However using this mode implies that the 50% of the key coming from your 2FE will be the same across all devices. If it is intercepted it will drastically reduce the security.</p>
<p>To use the password mode, when prompted to your login information, enter your password (the thing you know), then plug your YubiKey and press the button. It will “type” the rest of the “password” (the thing you possess but don’t know). You can then access your device.</p>
<p>In this scenario the thing you know is 50% of the password, the other 50% of it (which you don’t know) is stored on your YubiKey and typed for you when you press the button.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge Mode</strong></p>
<p>The challenge mode is safer than the password mode, however it is more complex to configure and use. The information received from the YubiKey (the 50% of the key that comes from the 2FE) is different for each device. If it is intercepted, it will not compromise the security of other devices.</p>
<p>To use the challenge mode, your encryption software has to be compatible with it (contrary to the password mode which works with everything). When prompted to your login information, enter your password, and then the software will send a challenge (a phrase or an id you pre-configured) to the YubiKey which will respond with the missing 50% of the encryption key. The combination of the two elements (your password and the 2FE response), creating the encryption key, will unlock your device.</p>
<p>The advantage of the challenge mode is that if you configure a different challenge (phrase or id) for each device you will have a different response each time, making your encryption key unique on all your devices and backups. This increases the security a lot in case one of them is compromised.</p>
<h2 id="not-all-encryptions-are-made-equal">Not All Encryptions Are Made Equal</h2>
<p>Cryptography may be the hardest thing in security. If you screw it up, nobody will come and tell you about it, and  you will pay the consequences later on.</p>
<p><strong>Serpent Encryption Algorithm</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpent_(cipher)">Serpent</a> was part of the finalists of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard_process">AES competition</a>. It was judged to be the most secure algorithm of them all, but <a href="https://www.schneier.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/paper-twofish-final.pdf">was discarded due to its speed</a>. However 20 years later, the computational power of everything exploded. Today the difference in speed between AES and Serpent doesn’t matter anymore, however the  difference in security still does. This is part of the reason why you should use Serpent everywhere ;)</p>
<p><strong>Truecrypt</strong></p>
<p>Truecrypt is an awesome tool that has been proved to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueCrypt#Legal_cases">complicated to break</a>. The tool was suddenly discontinued in 2014 in what seemed to be due to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/26pxol/truecrypt_is_dead/">third party pressure</a>. An independent audit was financed by the <a href="https://www.opencryptoaudit.org/">community</a> in 2013. The <a href="https://opencryptoaudit.org/reports/TrueCrypt_Phase_II_NCC_OCAP_final.pdf">summary</a> was released in 2015, showing “no evidence of deliberate backdoors, or any severe design flaws that will make the software insecure in most instances”.</p>
<p>Given that it’s complicated/impossible to break, that it’s been audited without any security flaw found, and the pressure put on the developers to stop the project: <strong>it’s safe to say that you should use it everywhere</strong>.</p>
<p>You can find Truecrypt <a href="https://github.com/DrWhax/truecrypt-archive">here</a>, the last version is 7.1a. Use the 3 ciphers cascade encryption mode.</p>
<p>If you use the hidden volume feature, be careful with older backup versions of your file container. The difference between the older version of the container and the newer version will reveal the use of an hidden volume (bytes will change where there is supposedly no data). Try to backup the content of your container inside a new one, so  that there is no match at all between the backups and the original container.</p>
<p><strong>Password</strong></p>
<p>The last line of defense for your data is your password. Depending on the system you are using, the encryption key will be encrypted using your password, or …</p></div></div>

<!-- Did we just complain about everybody creating their own time management strategy? Well, obviously it’s all right if we do it, isn’t it? :) -->
<p>Most plans are strictly sequential. When you invariably have to adjust your plan to reality, you have to update the whole lengthy sequence. Time-consuming at best, motivation consuming at worst. With deep planning, you create a simple hierarchy instead.</p>
<p>Think about what you want to achieve this year. Based on that, what do you want to achieve this month? This week? Today? This way you create a long-term strategy and still adjust your plans with little effort.</p>
<!-- At the end of each period, take a step back and reflect. What went well? What not? What can I do differently next time? -->
<p>Curious? Then take a look at <a href="https://www.focalityapp.com/en/time-management-app/">Focality, our time management app</a>. Focality combines deep planning, self-reflection and data-driven insights to let you constantly improve your time management skills.</p>
<h2>The complete list of time management strategies</h2>
<p>Without further ado, here comes the complete list of time management techniques in alphabetic order:</p>
<h3>1-3-5 rule</h3>
<p>For every day, create a list of one big thing, three medium things and five small things that you want to accomplish this day. This brings clarity into your workday and helps not to get buried by an endless flood of to-do items.</p>
<h3>2-Hour Solution</h3>
<p>See Two-Hour Solution.</p>
<h3>2-Minute Rule</h3>
<p>There are two 2-Minute Rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you want to establish a new habit, make sure that it requires no more than 2 minutes in the beginning. Work yourself up from there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Getting Things Done methodology (see below), if a task takes only 2 minutes or less, then do it right away instead of organizing it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>10-Minute Rule</h3>
<p>If you are putting something off, force yourself to do it for just 10 minutes. Chances are that you will continue past the 10 minutes.</p>
<h3>18 Minutes</h3>
<p>Start your day by planning what you will do that day for 5 minutes. Every hour, take one minute, review your progress and refocus. At the end of the day, take 5 minutes to reflect and evaluate your day.</p>
<h3>4Ds of Time Management</h3>
<p>This method helps you to quickly decide what to do with a task. Either Do it, Defer it, Delegate it or Drop it.</p>
<h3>7 Minute Life</h3>
<p>Spend 7 minutes in the morning to plan your day. Then another 7 minutes in the evening to reflect. Accompanied by many <a href="https://the7minutelife.com/member-tools/">templates</a>.</p>
<h3>80/20 Rule</h3>
<p>The 80/20 rule, also known as the Pareto Principle, is a rule of thumb that states that 80% of the effect step from 20% of the causes. Applied to time management it means that you can get 80% of the results with just 20% of the work. Getting to 100% will require disproportionately more work. Perfect is the enemy of done.</p>
<h3>90-Minute Rule / 90-Minute Focus Sessions / 90-Minute Solution</h3>
<p>Align your work with your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_rest%E2%80%93activity_cycle">basic rest–activity cycle</a> by doing focused work for approximately 90 minutes, followed by a 20-minute break. The following article sums it up nicely: <a href="https://medium.com/better-humans/avoid-burnout-and-increase-awareness-using-ultradian-rhythms-5e64158e7e19">Avoid Burnout and Increase Awareness Using Ultradian Rhythms</a></p>
<h3>ABCDE Method</h3>
<p>Created by Brian Tracy, ABCDE is a method for setting priorities. Basically assign each task a priority from A to E. A: Very important, must do. B: Important, should do. C: Nice to do, without consequence if skipped. D: Delegate. E: Eliminate.</p>
<h3>Action Method</h3>
<p>Leave every meeting, workshop or other event with a set of concrete tasks that need to be performed, called “action steps”. These should be kept separately from accompanying information (“reference items”). Everything that can’t / shouldn’t be approached right now becomes a “backburner item” to be possibly revived later. The method was developed by Behance. There used to be an online tool that implemented the action method, but it  was discontinued in 2015.</p>
<h3>Agile Results</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://jdmeier.com/agile-results-on-a-page/">Agile Results</a> technique is heavily inspired by software development frameworks like Scrum. At the beginning of the week, identify three wins that you want to achieve. Each day, identify three wins for that day. Use Fridays to recognize three things that are going well and three things to improve. Accompanied by a set of further practices to improve your time management like 30 day improvement sprints, reference collections and more.</p>
<h3>Autofocus</h3>
<p><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/autofocus-system/">Autofocus</a> is a to-do list methodology by Mark Forster which tries to use as little structure as possible. Dump everything in a ruled notebook. Scan your list and work on what stands out for as long as you feel like it. Then cross the item off the list. If you haven’t finished it, add it to the bottom again. Repeat. If you pass through a whole page (except the latest page) without anything standing out, dismiss all items on that page.</p>
<h3>Batching / Time Batching / Task Batching</h3>
<p>Work on batches of similar tasks instead of mixing unrelated ones. It reduces friction by minimizing context switching.</p>
<h3>Biological Prime Time</h3>
<p>Track your energy levels and identify your most energetic times of the day. Schedule your most important work for those times. First described by Sam Carpenter in his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6019060-work-the-system">Work the System</a>.</p>
<h3>Bullet Journal</h3>
<p>A bullet journal combines to-do list, planning and journaling. The name bullet journal comes from the extensive use of bullet(ish) points to structure and mark information.</p>
<h3>COPE</h3>
<p>The Clear-Organized-Productive-Efficient technique helps you to eliminate low-value activities and prioritize everything so that you can focus on the things with the most impact.</p>
<h3>Don’t break the chain</h3>
<p>See Seinfeld Strategy.</p>
<h3>Eat That Frog</h3>
<p>Tackle the biggest and/or most difficult and/or most disliked task first thing in the morning. Then you won’t waste energy or distract yourself the rest of the day because you are secretly dreading that task. <a href="https://www.briantracy.com/blog/time-management/the-truth-about-frogs/">Eat That Frog</a> was created by Brian Tracy who named it after a quote by Mark Twain: “Eat a live frog first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.”</p>
<h3>Eisenhower Matrix / Box / Method / Principle</h3>
<p>Former U.S. president Dwight D. Eisenhower used to rate his problems by the two criteria urgency and importance. These criteria are commonly used as axis on a 2x2 matrix with 4 quadrants:</p>
<ol>
<li>Urgent and important</li>
<li>Not urgent and important</li>
<li>Urgent but not important</li>
<li>Not urgent and not important</li>
</ol>
<p>The Eisenhower Matrix helps you to better prioritize your tasks and avoid the urgency trap where you fill your day with everything that’s urgent and neglecting the important.</p>
<h3>Final Version</h3>
<p>Start with a list of tasks. Select the first one on the list. Think about which other task from the list you would rather do. Select that one but remember/mark the first. Repeat until you no longer want to do anything before the currently selected task. Then work on the tasks in this chain - but in reverse order! Once you are done with the chain start the process again with the next open task on the list. Reference: <a href="http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs004/1100358239599/archive/1109511856508.html">The Final Version newsletter</a></p>
<h3>Flowtime Technique</h3>
<p>Work on only one task at a time. When you start, write down the time. Continue working on the task until you feel that you need a break. If you are exhausted or can’t focus anymore, take a break. Write down the stop time. Decide how long this break should be and set a timer for it. Repeat.</p>
<h3>Fresh or Fried</h3>
<p>At the end of the day, when your brain is fried, prioritize your tasks for the next day. Schedule important tasks to the beginning of the day, when your brain is still fresh. Schedule less important or easier tasks towards the later parts of the day when your brain fries again.</p>
<p>Reference: <a href="https://thefyslife.com/article/fresh-or-fried-productivity/">Dominate Your Day With the “Fresh or Fried” Prioritization System</a></p>
<h3>Getting Things Done (GTD)</h3>
<p>Getting Things Done is a famous method created by David Allen. It makes extensive use of to-do lists and techniques to manage them. At its core it employs five basic activities to bring structure to your task management:</p>
<ol>
<li>Capture everything: Don’t keep tasks in your head, write everything down.</li>
<li>Clarify: Make sure all your items are clear and actionable.</li>
<li>Organize: Use categories, priorities and due dates to bring structure to your lists.</li>
<li>Review: Frequently go over your lists. Update priorities, remove outdated items, etc.</li>
<li>Engage: Do it.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a href="https://www.focalityapp.com/en/resources/goal-setting/">Goal Setting</a></h3>
<p>Goal setting is the process of defining what you want to achieve in the long-term (or mid-term). Instead of focusing just on tasks, it helps you getting direction in life. If you don’t have clear goals, you are basically adrift. And you hardly get to where you want to be by accident.</p>
<p>We have compiled an <a href="https://www.focalityapp.com/en/resources/goal-setting/">extensive guide to personal goal setting</a> which will help you to understand the topic in depth. Learn why it is important, what types of goals to set, attributes of well-defined goals and much, much more.</p>
<h3>Inbox Zero</h3>
<p>This strategy focuses on managing your email inbox with maximum efficiency. According to its creator, Merlin Mann, the name Inbox Zero does not refer to the number of emails in your inbox, but “how long it takes to use the inbox”. Basically, you run every incoming email through a short process in which you do one of the following things: Delete, delegate, respond, defer (to do later), do (immediately).</p>
<h3>Ivy Lee Method</h3>
<p>This time management strategy has been created in 1918 by productivity consultant Ivy Lee. He recommends writing down six tasks at the end of each day that you want to accomplish the next day. Order them by importance. Then, on the next day, work your way down the list. At the end of the day, move any uncompleted task to the list for the next day. Repeat.</p>
<h3>Medium Method</h3>
<p>Combine the strengths of digital and paper tools. Chad Hall’s <a href="https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/medium-method">Medium Method</a> employs paper notebooks, post-it notes, a task-management app, an online calendar and a note app.</p>
<h3>MIT: Most Important Tasks</h3>
<p>Write down the most important tasks for the next day. Up to three. At the beginning of the day, focus on those and do nothing else until your MITs are completed.</p>
<h3>MoSCow Prioritization</h3>
<p>Borrowed from requirements management this technique helps you prioritize your tasks. Give each task a priority of …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

                            <p>It has been claimed that left-wingers or liberals (US sense) tend to more often suffer from mental illness than right-wingers or conservatives. This potential link was investigated using the General Social Survey cumulative cross-sectional dataset (1972-2018). A search of the available variables resulted in 5 items measuring one's own mental illness (e.g., ”Do you have any emotional or mental disability?”). All of these items were weakly associated with left-wing political ideology as measured by self-report, with especially high rates seen for the “extremely liberal” group. These results mostly held up in regressions that adjusted for age, sex, and race. For the variable with the most data (n = 11,338), the difference in the mental illness measure between “extremely liberal” and “extremely conservative” was 0.39 d. Temporal analysis showed that the relationship between mental illness, happiness, and political ideology has existed in the GSS data since the 1970s and still existed in the 2010s. Within-study meta-analysis of all the results found that extreme liberals had a 150% increased rate of mental illness compared to moderates. The finding of increased mental illness among left-wingers is congruent with numerous findings based on related constructs, such as positive relationships between conservatism, religiousness and health in general.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This post is going to be a quick tour of the essential aspects of <code>stack</code> targeted at beginners. It will not only list commands that should be executed but would try to provide contextual explanations as much as possible. The aim is to give an introduction to <code>stack</code> that is not filled with commands to be memorized but one that can help the beginner to start forming a better understanding of <code>stack</code> so they can explore the tool further on their own.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="clarifying-terms">Clarifying terms</h2>

<p>It is important to have an understanding of some basic terms and concepts when it comes to working and building Haskell programs. This includes understanding what is meant when we say things like <em>Cabal</em>, the difference between <em>Modules, Libraries, Packages</em>, etc. These terms were already explained in the previous post, so instead of reproducing it again here, please take a moment to read the <a href="https://schooloffp.co/2020/08/17/whirlwind-tour-of-cabal-for-beginners.html#clarifying-terms">Clarifying Terms section</a> in the Whirlwind Tour Of Cabal For Beginners post.</p>

<p>One thing to point out regarding the concepts of packages and projects is that <code>stack</code> provides configuration for projects via a file called <code>stack.yaml</code>, while packages are configured via either <code>package.yaml</code> file or <code>.cabal</code> file. These files are covered in more depth in <a href="#creating-a-new-project">Creating a new project</a> section.</p>

<h2 id="what-stack-is">What Stack is</h2>

<p><code>stack</code> is a build tool for Haskell. It is an alternative to <code>cabal-install</code>, but still makes use of cabal the package format and Cabal the library. It has a strong focus on reproducible build plans. It was conceived to solve dependency problems (commonly referred to as cabal hell) that used to plague <code>cabal-install</code>. It does this by providing a curated package set that is guaranteed to always compile.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It should be stressed that the cabal hell issue that used to plague cabal-install has mostly been resolved. The solution took a different approach than what <code>stack</code> employed. It made use of an approach similar to what is obtained in Nix. The details of this are not important, just that using either <code>cabal-install</code> or <code>stack</code>is now a matter of preference and UX choices.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="moving-parts">Moving parts</h2>

<p><code>stack</code> also comes with some moving parts and terms that could be confusing to a beginner. In this section, these terms are explained before moving to how to install <code>stack</code>.</p>

<h3 id="curated-package-set">Curated Package Set</h3>

<p>Hackage is Haskell’s central package archive of open-source software. Anyone can upload (and also download) packages from Hackage hence it contains different versions of packages that are not guaranteed to be compatible. A curated package set is then a subset of packages from Hackage which are regularly tested for compatibility. <code>stack</code> makes use of the idea of a curated package set to resolve the problem of incompatible dependencies.</p>

<h3 id="stackage">Stackage</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.stackage.org/">Stackage</a> is the central package archive of open-source software of Haskell packages <strong>that have been curated and tested for compatibility</strong>. Hence the curated package set used by <code>stack</code> is hosted on Stackage. Stackage is spearheaded by folks at <a href="http://www.fpcomplete.com/">fpcomplete</a>, but is still a community effort, hence anyone can also <a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stackage/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.md#adding-a-package">submit packages</a> for inclusion in the curated package set that is hosted on Stackage.</p>

<h3 id="resolver">Resolver</h3>

<p>It is easy to imagine the need for versioning when working with these curated package sets hosted on Stackage. Where a particular version uniquely identifies a particular curated package set and the packages it contains. In <code>stack</code>, the version of a curated package set is referred to or specified as a <em>resolver</em>.</p>

<p>A resolver uniquely identifies the GHC version and the other Haskell packages contained within a package set. Package sets that have been thoroughly tested and would be maintained for a long period are identified by LTS (long term support) resolver version numbers, while package sets that are still in flux are identified by nightly resolvers. The available LTS resolvers can be found <a href="https://www.stackage.org/lts">here</a> while nightly resolvers can be seen <a href="https://www.stackage.org/nightly">here</a>. For example <a href="https://www.stackage.org/lts-16.22">lts-16.22</a>, is a LTS Resolver, while <a href="https://www.stackage.org/nightly-2020-11-19">nightly-2020-11-19</a> is a nightly Resolver.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Based on its name, it might be tempting to think of resolver as a piece of software that performs the act of resolution. A better way is to see the resolver as an identifier or a tag. It is a way to refer to a particular curated package set.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="hpack">hpack</h3>

<p>As explained in <a href="https://schooloffp.co/2020/08/17/whirlwind-tour-of-cabal-for-beginners.html#clarifying-terms">Clarifying Terms section</a> Haskell makes use of cabal package format, a text-based, key-value format used to describe a Haskell package. <code>hpack</code> is an alternate format to cabal package format. Instead of a custom key-value text-based format, it makes use of <a href="https://yaml.org/"><code>yaml</code></a>.</p>

<p>So while the cabal package format uses a custom key-value text-based format specified in a file ending with <code>.cabal</code> extension, <code>hpack</code> uses <code>yaml</code> with package descriptions specified in <code>package.yaml</code> file. <code>stack</code>has inbuilt support for <code>hpack</code>. This means <code>stack</code>can parse <code>hpack</code>s’ <code>package.yaml</code> and use it to generate <code>.cabal</code> file.</p>

<p>In summary, you can view <code>stack</code>as a Haskell build tool, that makes use of curated package sets, identified by resolvers and hosted on Stackage, with inbuilt support for <code>hpack</code> as an alternative package specification format.</p>

<h2 id="installing-stack">Installing Stack</h2>

<p>Installing <code>stack</code>is straight forward. On Un*x operating systems, run:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl <span>-sSL</span> https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On windows, the provided <a href="https://get.haskellstack.org/stable/windows-x86_64-installer.exe">Windows Installer</a> can be used</p>

<p>To confirm <code>stack</code>is properly installed run <code>stack --version</code> which will give an output similar to this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>stack <span>--version</span>
Version 2.3.3, Git revision cb44d51bed48b723a5deb08c3348c0b3ccfc437e x86_64 hpack-0.33.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that you do not need to install GHC separately when using <code>stack</code>. <code>stack</code>handles getting the version of GHC needed for each project created. This is also one of the ways in which <code>stack</code>differs from <code>cabal-install</code> which requires GHC to be separately downloaded and installed. So <code>stack</code>not only takes care of resolving dependencies, compiling Haskell code, it also handles the management of the toolchain required to do this, and GHC is included in the toolchain.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="creating-a-new-project">Creating a new project</h2>

<p>Now we have <code>stack</code>installed, the next thing to do is to create a new Haskell project. Doing this is straightforward. To create a new project, run <code>stack new</code>.</p>

<p>Doing so will produce an output similar to this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>stack new firstproject
Downloading template <span>"new-template"</span> to create project <span>"firstproject"</span> <span>in </span>firstproject/ ...

The following parameters were needed by the template but not provided: author-name
You can provide them <span>in</span> /Users/schooloffp/.stack/config.yaml, like this:
templates:
  params:
    author-name: value
Or you can pass each one as parameters like this:
stack new firstproject new-template <span>-p</span> <span>"author-name:value"</span>

The following parameters were needed by the template but not provided: author-email, author-name, category, copyright, github-username
You can provide them <span>in</span> /Users/schooloffp/.stack/config.yaml, like this:
templates:
  params:
    author-email: value
    author-name: value
    category: value
    copyright: value

Neither the Oxford Protein Informatics Group nor I accept any responsibility for the content of this post.</em></p>



<p>You might have heard it from the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03348-4">scientific</a> or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/30/technology/deepmind-ai-protein-folding.html">regular press</a>, perhaps even from <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology">DeepMind’s own blog</a>. Google ‘s AlphaFold 2 indisputably won the <a href="https://predictioncenter.org/casp14/index.cgi">14<sup>th</sup> Critical Assessment of Structural Prediction</a> competition, a biannual blind test where computational biologists try to predict the structure of several proteins whose structure has been determined experimentally — yet not publicly released. Their results are so incredibly accurate that many have hailed this code as the solution to the long-standing protein structure prediction problem.</p>



<p>Protein structure is at the core of biochemistry, and has profound implications for medicine and technology. Establishing the structure of a protein is a bottleneck in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_design#Structure-based">structure-based drug discovery</a>, and accurate structure prediction is expected to improve the productivity of pharmaceutical research pipelines (although it is only one factor, and we will need to get other things right before truly revolutionary changes happen — check Derek Lowe’s posts <a href="https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2019/09/25/whats-crucial-and-what-isnt">here</a> and <a href="https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/12/01/the-big-problems">here</a>). Structural information of proteins is also essential in biology, where it helps to elucidate function — many key papers in biochemistry derive insight from experimental advances in structure determination. </p>



<p>Given the importance of the problem, and the wide network of resources that have slowly been advancing for decades, I think nobody was expecting that a solution would be presented too quickly. I myself decided to focus my PhD research in the field of structure prediction, thinking like many others that several years of work across many research lines would be necessary before we could achieve something close to a solution. I may now need to change topics.</p>



<p>How much of the press release is true, what has actually happened, and how significant is it? There has been endless discussion about this topic in multiple forums. Frankly, I haven’t been able to think about anything else for the past 72 hours. In an attempt to clear my own thoughts, I have decided to write this blog post detailing everything I have learned since my scientific world was turned upside down around 3 pm GMT on Monday. I hope this is useful for my fellow protein bioinformaticians who could not attend CASP14, but also to anyone who wants to hear a little bit more about this topic.</p>



<p>Please bear in mind that my report of the CASP14 assessment and conference will necessarily be interspersed with conjecture. The details of how <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology">AlphaFold 2</a> works are still unknown, and we may not have full access to them until their paper is peer-reviewed (which may take more than a year, based on their CASP13 paper). The magnitude of the breakthrough is undeniable — but we need more details to gauge its potential impact.</p>



<p>This is going to be a long post. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.</p>



<h2>How good is AlphaFold 2, exactly?</h2>



<p>Astoundingly so.</p>



<p>Let me tell you the story as it happened last Monday. A handful of hours before the start of the CASP14 meeting — around noon GMT — the organisers released the results of the assignment. Almost immediately, comments started to circulate around Twitter. This is the image everyone was sharing:</p>

One group, 427, named AlphaFold 2, shows an incredible improvement with respect to the second best group, 473 (BAKER). This figure was obtained from the official CASP14 webpage on Tuesday 1st December, 2020.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This bar plot describes the sum of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score">Z-scores</a> representing the predictions from the different groups. Remember that the Z-score is just the difference of a sample’s value with respect to the population mean, divided by the standard deviation; a high value represents a large deviation from the mean, and is commonly used as a outlier detection procedure. In other words, the groups that are markedly better than the average will have larger Z-scores. In this graph we see that one group performs a lot better than the rest: Group 427, whose average Z-score was around 2.5 when considering all targets, and rose to 3.8 in the hardest ones. If this was an intelligence test, AlphaFold 2 would score an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient">intelligence quotient</a> (IQ) above 160.</p>



<p>If the relative comparison is astounding, the actual performance is just as impressive. I am going to consider a typical metric in structural biology, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation_of_atomic_positions">root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of atomic positions</a>. If you are not much of a protein folder, these numbers may not say much to you. Don’t worry — in next section I will show a few graphical examples. Just keep in mind that (1) a lower RMSD represents a better predicted structure, and that (2) most experimental structures have a resolution around 2.5 Å (<strong>updated 8th Dec:</strong> although, as many have pointed out in Twitter, this is an apples to oranges comparison). Taking this into consideration, about a third (36%) of Group 427’s submitted targets were predicted with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) under 2 Å, and 86% were under 5 Å, with a total mean of 3.8 Å.</p>

<p>We were still digesting this information when the conference started and, oh boy, did we suffer the first half an hour. Claims that this year’s competition was “a little unusual” were followed by suggestions that one particular group had produced impressive results. Finally, John Moult, who has chaired every CASP since 1994, masterfully delivered a nail-biting exposition of the history of the competition, slowly feeding us information until he finally showed the graph we were all expecting. Here it is:</p>

The dark orange line (CASP14_serv) corresponds to the predictions made by fully automated servers, the olive green line (CASP14_w/o427) includes all predictions assisted by humans except for the highest performing group; and the black line (CASP14) represents the predictions by the best performing team: Group 427, or AlphaFold 2. This plot uses the GDT_TS score, where 100 represents perfect results and 0 is a meaningless prediction.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As a rule of thumb, a GDT_TS around 60% represents a “correct fold”, meaning that we have an idea of how the protein folds globally; and over 80% we start seeing side chains that closely resemble the model. As you can see, AlphaFold 2 achieves this objective for all but a small percentage of the tasks.</p>



<p>And then, after three decades of competitions, the assessors declared that AlphaFold 2 had succeeded in solving a challenge open for 50 years: to develop a method that can accurately, generally and competitively predict a protein structure from its sequence (or, well, a multiple sequence alignment, as we will see later). There are caveats and edge cases, as in any application — but the magnitude of the breakthrough, as well as its potential impact, are undeniable.</p>



<p>The story does not end there. The models produced by AlphaFold 2 were so good that in some cases defied the results of the experiment. I will provide two brief examples, based on examples mentioned in the conference. The first example comes from the group of <a href="http://www.chem.umd.edu/faculty-staff-directory/facultydirectory/osnat-herzberg">Osnat Herzberg</a>, who were studying a phage tail protein. After appreciating the excellent agreement of DeepMind’s model with their structure, they noticed that they had a different assignment for a cis-proline. Upon reviewing the analysis, they realised they had made a mistake in the interpretation and corrected it.</p>



<p>The second comes from the group of <a href="https://www.chemie.uni-hamburg.de/en/institute/bc/arbeitsgruppen/tidow/personen/tidow-henning.html">Henning Tidow</a>, who was studying an integral membrane protein, the reductase FoxB (apparently related to iron uptake in Gram-negative bacteria). Prof. Tidow’s group worked on this model for about two years, trying different methodologies to solve the crystal structure, including <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5947774/">experimental phasing</a> methods. When they were given the models from DeepMind’s prediction, they managed to solve the problem by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_replacement#:~:text=Molecular%20replacement%20(or%20MR)%20is,the%20diffraction%20data%20is%20derived.">molecular replacement</a> in a matter of hours.</p>



<p>There is one last point to clear. Some people have wondered if Google’s incredible success is not perhaps related to an easier set of target proteins this year. This is, <em>per se</em>, a difficult claim to sustain (after all, wouldn’t other groups with much more experience have also benefited from this?), but to disprove this point the assessors have concluded that the targets for CASP14 were the most difficult to date, based on the similarity of existing protein structures to the targets:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.blopig.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3.png?resize=577%2C510&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="577" height="510" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.blopig.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3.png?w=577&amp;ssl=1 577w, https://i0.wp.com/www.blopig.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3.png?resize=300%2C265&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.blopig.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3.png?w=577&amp;ssl=1 577w, https://i0.wp.com/www.blopig.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3.png?resize=300%2C265&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.blopig.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3.png?resize=577%2C510&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Comparison of the targets of the last four CASPs in terms of the coverage and sequence identity of the available templates. On both counts, CASP14 includes the most difficult free-modelling (FM) targets yet provided. TBM stands for Template Based Models.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>There are still many interesting points of discussion. Many will argue that the set of targets studied at CASP14 is not representative of <em>all</em> interesting structural prediction problems — and they will be right. And, yes, certainly there are some problems where AlphaFold 2 hasn’t performed that well. I will give you my thoughts on some of the caveats later, when we near the end of this blog post. But, for now, let’s be clear on something: AlphaFold 2 is a tool that can solve the protein structure prediction <em>for a very significant number of targets</em>.</p>



<h2>How does this compare to other methods?</h2>



<p>I might have convinced you that AlphaFold 2 is a massive breakthrough. Now it is time …</p></div></div>

              <p>The study linked below reports on an interesting kind of litmus test for heart health in middle aged men: if you can do forty pushups, you’re much less likely to have heart problems over the next ten years.</p>
<p>The usual warnings apply about correlation not implying causation. It’s possible that men who can do forty pushups typically embrace other healthy living habits or enjoy some genetic advantage. Thus, a sudden intense micro-focus on pushups may not be the answer.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the long-term physical benefits of strength training are well established. I found <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/hacking-exercise-health">Hacking Exercise for Health</a> to be a very informative and motivating short course on this topic.</p>

		<p>We have been slowly working towards the next pacman release. The major change for this release is the implementation of parallel downloads.  Check out this video:</p>

<p>It is time for this feature to receive some wider testing. Grab the package using:<br>
<code>pacman -U http://allanmcrae.com/packages/pacman-6.0.0alpha1-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst</code></p>
<p>This should be “safe” – there are quite a number of us using this code for our system management.  There may be issues with AUR helpers due to ABI changes… If you are concerned, keep a copy of the repo package around to reinstall if necessary.</p>
<p>There are still a few <a href="https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/67811">issues</a> with the downloader we will fix before release.  If one of your mirrors is broken, you will be spammed with error messages at the end of the downloads.  And <tt>TotalDownload</tt> does not work.  But otherwise, it is good to go!</p>
<p>Report any bugs to the <a href="https://bugs.archlinux.org/index.php?project=3">bug tracker</a>.</p>

In this article, I'll be discussing some of the studies that have covered this subject along with some of the solutions to reduce the amount of blue light you're being subjected to.</span></p><h2 id="viewer-cpun"><span>What is Blue Light?</span></h2><p id="viewer-bj5bp"><span>Sunlight is composed of red, yellow, orange, green, and blue light rays and many shades of each of these colours, depending on the energy and wavelength of the individual rays (otherwise known as <!-- -->electromagnetic radiation<!-- -->). Combined, this spectrum of coloured light rays creates sunlight called “white light”.</span></p><p id="viewer-bc2fl"><span>Without getting into the details, there is an inverse relationship between the wavelength of light rays and the amount of energy they contain.</span></p><p id="viewer-825iu"><span>This means that the rays on the red end of the visible light spectrum have longer wavelengths and, therefore, less energy. On the other hand, rays on the blue end of the spectrum have shorter wavelengths and more energy.</span></p><p id="viewer-15gnj"><span>Not all colours of light have the same effect. Blue wavelengths are beneficial during daylight hours because they boost your mood, attention and reaction times, however, studies suggest they're more disruptive at night.</span></p><h2 id="viewer-65vu6"><span>What exposes you to Blue Light?</span></h2><p id="viewer-bi01v"><span>Although sunlight is the biggest source of Blue Light that you'll be subjected too, here are some of the others:</span></p><ul><li id="viewer-cugnd"><p>LED light</p></li><li id="viewer-di5pk"><p>Fluorescent light</p></li><li id="viewer-ads93"><p>Flat-screen LED televisions</p></li><li id="viewer-7b2ak"><p>Computer monitors</p></li><li id="viewer-ep37g"><p>Smartphones and tablet screens</p></li></ul><p id="viewer-5valn"><span>Although you receive a lot less Blue Light from these sources than from the sun, it's the fact that we tend to use them more and more before going to bed that is of concern.</span></p><h3 id="viewer-qt2o"><span><strong><span>Suggested Articles:</span></strong></span></h3><ul><li id="viewer-apq6a"><p><strong>🚄 </strong><a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/hyperloop-the-future-of-travel" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Hyperloop, the future of travel?</u></strong></a><strong>

During the study, some participants were instructed to wear special glasses that blocked blue light wavelengths whilst the rest didn't. The results showed that the people in the study that wore these glasses produced more melatonin than those who didn’t and hence, had a better night's sleep.</span></p><p id="viewer-8nqqi"><span>These studies do seem pretty conclusive, however since then others have said otherwise.</span></p><p id="viewer-8kim"><span>In 2019, a group of researchers at the University of Manchester in the U.K. <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(19)31368-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>challenged that notion</u></a>. After exposing mice to lights that were different in hue but equal brightness and assessing their subsequent activity, the researchers concluded that yellow light actually seems to disturb sleep more than blue. Warm-toned light, they hypothesized, could trick the body into thinking it’s daytime, while cooler blue light more closely mimics twilight.</span></p><p id="viewer-7o6g0"><span>It is important to note however, that animals studies don't always reflect the entire reality, as they often can't translate directly to human behavior. Furthermore, since rodents are nocturnal, they may respond differently to light than humans do. Finally the lights were also kept very dim, regardless of color, which may not property represent the bright lights of electronics.</span></p><p id="viewer-b6bbs"><span>Because of these conditions, the results of the study can't be taken too seriously, given how many previous ones have concluded that Blue Light has a negative impact on sleep.</span></p><h3 id="viewer-2fn3f"><span>How to minimise the effects </span></h3><p id="viewer-ctu4b"><span>If you're worried that Blue Light might be affecting your sleep, here are a few solutions:</span></p><ol><li id="viewer-fljja"><p>First of all, try and <a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/how-can-we-reduce-our-screen-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>cut down on your screen time</u></a>.

<p>The C++, eh C, preprocessor is wonderful.</p>
<p>Well, no - it isn’t wonderful.</p>
<p>It is a primitive text replacement tool that must be used to work with C++.
But is “must” really true?
Most of the usage has become obsolete thanks to new and better C++ language features.
And many more features like modules will come soon™.
So can we get rid of the preprocessor?
And if so, how can we do it?</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Much of the preprocessor use is already bad practice:
Don’t use it for symbolic constants, don’t use it for inline functions etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As this gained a lot of traction, let me clarify something:
I’m not advocating for removing the preprocessor with this post.
Some people in the C++ community and many on the standardization committee want to do that, however,
so I wanted to explore the feasibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But there still a few ways it is used in idiomatic C++.
Let’s go through them and see what alternative we have.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the most common usage:
<code>#include</code> a header file.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-the-preprocessor-needed">Why is the preprocessor needed?</h3>
<p>In order to compile a source file, the compiler needs to see the declarations of all functions that are being called.
So if you define a function in one file,
and want to call it in another, you have to declare it in that file as well.
Only then can the compiler generate the appropriate code to call the function.</p>
<p>Of course, manually copying the declaration can lead to errors:
If you change the signature you have to change all declarations as well.
So, instead of manually copying the declarations,
you write them in a special file - the header file,
and let the preprocessor copy it for you with <code>#include</code>.
Now you still need to update all declarations, but just in one place.</p>
<p>But plain text inclusion is dumb.
It can sometimes happens that the same file gets included twice,
which leads to two copies of that file.
This is no problem for function declarations,
but if you have class definitions in an header file,
that’s an error.</p>
<p>To prevent that, you have to use include guards or the non-standard <code>#pragma once</code>.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-we-replace-it">How can we replace it?</h2>
<p>With current C++ features, we can’t (without resorting to copy pasta).</p>
<p>But with the <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/n4647.pdf">Modules TS</a> we can.
Instead of providing header files and source files,
we can write a module and <code>import</code> that.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about modules, I highly recommend the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjvh127abfw">most recent CppChat</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conditional-compilation">Conditional Compilation</h2>
<p>The second most common job of the preprocessor is conditional compilation:
Change the definitions/declarations by defining or not defining a macro.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-the-preprocessor-needed-1">Why is the preprocessor needed?</h3>
<p>Consider the situation where you’re writing a library that provides a function <code>draw_triangle()</code>
which draws a single triangle on the screen.</p>
<p>Now the declaration is straightforward:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>// draws a single triangle
</span><span></span><span>void</span> <span>draw_triangle</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div><p>But the implementation of the function changes depending on your operating system, window manager, display manager
and/or moon phase (for exotic window manager).</p>
<p>So you need something like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>// use this one for Windows
</span><span></span><span>void</span> <span>draw_triangle</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>// create window using the WinAPI 
</span><span></span>    <span>// draw triangle using DirectX
</span><span></span><span>}</span>

<span>// use this one for Linux
</span><span></span><span>void</span> <span>draw_triangle</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>// create window using X11
</span><span></span>    <span>// draw triangle using OpenGL
</span><span></span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The preprocessor helps there:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>#if _WIN32
</span><span></span>    <span>// Windows triangle drawing code here 
</span><span></span><span>#else
</span><span></span>    <span>// Linux triangle drawing code here
</span><span></span><span>#endif
</span></code></pre></div><p>The code in the branch that is not taken will be deleted before compilation,
so we won’t get any errors about missing APIs etc.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-we-replace-it-1">How can we replace it?</h3>
<p>C++17 adds <code>if constexpr</code>, this can be used to replace simple <code>#if … #else</code>:</p>
<p>Instead of this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>do_sth</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>#if DEBUG_MODE
</span><span></span>        <span>log</span><span>();</span>
    <span>#endif
</span><span></span>    <span>…</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We can write this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>do_sth</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>constexpr</span> <span>(</span><span>DEBUG_MODE</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>log</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>…</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>If <code>DEBUG_MODE</code> is <code>false</code>, then the branch will not be compiled properly,
it will only check for syntax errors, similar to the checking done for a not yet instantiated template.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is not correct, as was pointed out.
It will still be fully checked if outside a template.
It doesn’t matter here though, as it still doesn’t have any runtime overhead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is even better than <code>#if</code> as it will spot obvious errors in the code without checking all macro combinations.
Another benefit with <code>if constexpr</code> is that <code>DEBUG_MODE</code> can now be a normal <code>constexpr</code> variable,
instead of a constant coming from a macro expansion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And if you don’t have <code>if constexpr</code>, you can use class template specializations,
or <a href="https://foonathan.net/blog/2015/11/16/overload-resolution-3.html">tag dispatching</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, there are downsides to <code>if constexpr</code>:
You can’t use it to constrain preprocessor directives, i.e. <code>#include</code>.
For the <code>draw_triangle()</code> example, the code needs to include the proper system header.
<code>if constexpr</code> can help, so you’d need true conditional compilation there or manually copy the declarations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is better than normally as system header declarations are usually pretty stable.
But it’s still not recommended.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And modules can’t help either as the system headers do not define any module you can import.
Furthermore, you can’t conditionally import a module (as far as I know).</p>
<h2 id="passing-configuration-options">Passing configuration options</h2>
<p>On a related note, you sometimes want to pass some configuration options to a library.
You might want to enable or disable assertions, precondition checks, change some default behavior…</p>
<p>For example, it might have a header like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>#ifndef USE_ASSERTIONS
</span><span></span>    <span>// default to enable
</span><span></span>    <span>#define USE_ASSERTIONS 1
</span><span>#endif
</span><span></span>
<span>#ifndef DEFAULT_FOO_IMPLEMENTATION
</span><span></span>    <span>// use the general implementation
</span><span></span>    <span>#define DEFAULT_FOO_IMPLEMENTATION general_foo
</span><span>#endif
</span><span></span>
<span>…</span>
</code></pre></div><p>When building the library you can then override the macros either when invoking the compiler,
or through CMake, for example.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-we-replace-it-2">How can we replace it?</h3>
<p>Macros are the obvious choice here, but there are is an alternative:</p>
<p>We could use a different strategy to pass options,
like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy-based_design">policy-based design</a>,
where you pass a policy to a class template that defines the chosen behavior.
This has the benefit that it doesn’t force a single implementation to all users,
but of course has <a href="https://foonathan.net/blog/2017/02/08/policy-based-design-problem.html">its own downsides</a>.</p>
<p>But what I’d really like to see is the ability to pass these configuration options when you <code>import</code> the module:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>import</span> <span>my</span><span>.</span><span>module</span><span>(</span><span>use_assertions</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span><span>);</span>
<span>…</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This would be the ideal replacement for:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>#define USE_ASSERTIONS 0
</span><span>#include</span> <span>"my_library.hpp"</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>But I don’t think that’s technically feasible without sacrificing the benefits modules provide,
i.e. pre-compiling modules.</p>
<h2 id="assertion-macros">Assertion macros</h2>
<p>The macro you’ll most commonly use probably does some kind of assertion.
And macros are the obvious choice here:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’ll need to conditionally disable assertions and remove them so they have zero overhead in release.</li>
<li>If you have a macro, you can use the pre-defined <code>__LINE__</code>, <code>__FILE__</code> and <code>__func__</code> to get the location where the assertion is
and use that in the diagnostic.</li>
<li>If you have a macro, you can also stringify the expression that is being checked and use it in the diagnostic as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s why almost all assertions are macros.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-we-replace-it-3">How can we replace it?</h3>
<p>I’ve already explored how conditional compilation can be replaced and how you can specify whether or not they should be enabled,
so that’s no problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using policy-based design here also allows customization of how the diagnostic is reported to the user.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Getting the file information is also possible in the Library Fundamentals TS v2 as it adds <code>std::experimental::source_location</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>my_assertion</span><span>(</span><span>bool</span> <span>expr</span><span>,</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>experimental</span><span>::</span><span>source_location</span> <span>loc</span> <span>=</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>experimental</span><span>::</span><span>source_location</span><span>::</span><span>current</span><span>())</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>expr</span><span>)</span>
        <span>report_error</span><span>(</span><span>loc</span><span>.</span><span>file_name</span><span>,</span> <span>loc</span><span>.</span><span>line</span><span>,</span> <span>loc</span><span>.</span><span>function_name</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The function <code>std::experimental::source_location::current()</code> expands to the information about the source file at the point of writing it.
Furthermore, if you use it as a default argument, it will expand to the caller location.
So the second point is no problem either.</p>
<p>The third point is the critical one:
You can’t stringify the expression and print it in the diagnostic without using a macro.
If you’re okay with that, you can implement your assertion function today.</p>
<p>But otherwise you still need a macro for that.
Check out <a href="https://foonathan.net/blog/2016/09/16/assertions.html">this blog post</a> how you could implement an (almost) macro-less assertion function,
where you can control the level with <code>constexpr</code> variables instead of macros.
You can find the full implementation <a href="https://github.com/foonathan/debug_assert">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="compatibility-macros">Compatibility macros</h2>
<p>Not all compilers support all C++ features, which makes porting a real pain,
especially if you don’t have access to a compiler for a testing and need to do the “change a line, push to CI, wait for CI build, change another line” cycle just because some compiler really doesn’t like an important C++ feature!</p>
<p>Anyways, the usual compatibility problems can be solved with macros.
The implementations even define certain macros once they’ve implemented a feature,
making checking trivial:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>#if __cpp_noexcept
</span><span></span>    <span>#define NOEXCEPT noexcept
</span><span></span>    <span>#define NOEXCEPT_COND(Cond) noexcept(Cond)
</span><span></span>    <span>#define NOEXCEPT_OP(Expr) noexcept(Expr)
</span><span>#else
</span><span></span>    <span>#define NOEXCEPT
</span><span></span>    <span>#define NOEXCEPT_COND(Cond)
</span><span></span>    <span>#define NOEXCEPT_OP(Expr) false
</span><span>#endif
</span><span></span>
<span>…</span>

<span>void</span> <span>func</span><span>()</span> <span>NOEXCEPT</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>…</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This allows a portable usage of features even though not all compilers have them already.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-we-replace-it-4">How can we replace it?</h2>
<p>We can’t do that in any other way.
Workaround missing features requires some kind of preprocessing tool to get rid of not-supported features.
We have to use macros here.</p>
<h2 id="boilerplate-macros">Boilerplate macros</h2>
<p>C++’s templates and TMP go a long way to eliminate a lot of boilerplate code you otherwise need to write.
But sometimes, you just need to write a lot of code that is the same but not <em>quite</em> the same:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>struct</span> <span>less</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>bool</span> <span>operator</span><span>()(</span><span>const</span> <span>foo</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>const</span> <span>foo</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span><span>bar</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>b</span><span>.</span><span>bar</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>greater</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>bool</span> <span>operator</span><span>()(</span><span>const</span> <span>foo</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>const</span> <span>foo</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span><span>bar</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>b</span><span>.</span><span>bar</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>…</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Macros can generate that boilerplate for you:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>#define MAKE_COMP(Name, Op) \
</span><span>struct Name \
</span><span>{ \
</span><span>    bool operator()(const foo&amp; a, const foo&amp; b) \
</span><span>    { \
</span><span>        return a.bar Op b.bar; \
</span><span>    } \
</span><span>};
</span><span></span>
<span>MAKE_COMP</span><span>(</span><span>less</span><span>,</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>)</span>
<span>M…</span></code></pre></div></article></div></div>

    <blockquote>
  <p>Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.</p>

  <p>– Harold Abelson, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above maxim has guided most of my career as a software engineer and has been one of
the central <a href="https://guide.clojure.style/#guiding-principles">guiding principles</a> of the <a href="https://guide.clojure.style/">community Clojure style guide</a>,
that I’ve been maintaining for the past (almost) 8 years.</p>

<p>While the style guide was well received by the Clojure community in general, and universal agreement was reached on most points in it, one aspect
remains controversial to this day - namely the style guide’s preference towards “semantic indentation” over “fixed indentation” for function/macro
arguments. Today I want to address an article that suggested that fixed indentation is preferable, as it’s simpler and it’s easier to provide tooling support for it.
That article is named <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/clojurefmt/">Better Clojure Formatting</a><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, which admittedly is catchy and made me consider naming my
response to it “The Best Clojure Formatting” or “Superb Clojure Formatting”, but I’ve opted for a more modest title in the end.</p>

<h2 id="prologue-the-purpose-of-formatting">Prologue: The Purpose of Formatting</h2>

<p>Have you ever thought why formatting (layout) is important at all?
Not just in code, but in any text in general.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>The answer to this question is quite simple - proper formatting
can enhance a lot the readability of any text. And here’s also the crux
of it - computers don’t really care about readability. As long as some
code is syntactically correct any compiler or interpreter would be happy
to compile or run it.</p>

<p>For us humans, however, formatting can be very helpful or extremely confusing.
As far as I’m concerned any formatting that makes some code easier to read and
comprehend is good formatting.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-semantic-formatting">Introducing Semantic Formatting</h2>

<p>Before I go into my arguments let’s briefly contrast semantic and fixed indentation with a couple of examples.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>;;; Semantic indentation</span><span>
</span><span>;;</span><span>
</span><span>;; macros</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>when</span><span> </span><span>something</span><span>

  </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>"Hello, "</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>"world!"</span><span>))</span><span>

</span><span>;; function call spanning two lines (wide formatting)</span><span>

        </span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>))</span><span>

</span><span>;; function call spanning three lines (narrow formatting)</span><span>

</span><span>;;</span><span>
</span><span>;; macros</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>when</span><span> </span><span>something</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>something-else</span><span>))</span><span>

</span><span>(</span><span>with-out-str</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>"Hello, "</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>"world!"</span><span>))</span><span>

</span><span>;; function call spanning two lines</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span> </span><span>even?</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>))</span><span>

</span><span>;; function call spanning three lines</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span>
  </span><span>even?</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>))</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I hope it’s obvious that the main difference is that “semantic indentation” differentiates between macros with body forms and regular function/macro invocations.
That makes it easy to visually tell them apart. The “fixed indentation” approach, however, advocates ignoring those differences and indenting everything the same way.</p>

<p>A different way to think about semantic indentation might be to compare it to syntax highlighting - normally different constructs in a programming language (e.g. special forms, built-in functions and user-defined functions), get highlighted
differently, to reflect their semantics and to assist the reader in comprehending what they are dealing with.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> There are other aspects of “semantic indentation” as well, but I’ll stick only to the most prominent/infamous parts in this article.</p>

<h2 id="semantic-formatting-vs-fixed-formatting">Semantic Formatting vs Fixed Formatting</h2>

<p>The main argument for “semantic formatting” is pretty simple - it
reflects better the semantics of your code, which results in improved
clarity/readability. Just by looking at the shape of the code you can
infer how something is supposed to behave.</p>

<p>A secondary argument might be that’s also the formatting that has been employed by
all major Lisp dialects (e.g. Common Lisp, Scheme, Emacs Lisp) for a very long time.
Some might argue that following in their footsteps is just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming">cargo culting</a>,
but if the premise behind their approach is still relevant today I don’t think the cargo cult theory has any merit.</p>

<p>Clojure developers have historically had a love/hate relationship with Lisp tradition, depending on their background.
That’s normal, given that Clojure was often marketed as a modern Lisp that break away from some arcane Lisp dogmas and traditions
and aligns itself with modern programming practices.
Tradition, however, doesn’t always mean bad, obsolete and irrelevant. In the case of semantic indentation, I think Clojure’s
predecessors had the right idea and nothing has fundamentally changed.</p>

<p>The main argument in favor of “fixed indentation” is tooling support - if you don’t need to format something differently, obviously creating code formatters becomes easier. There’s nothing for the formatter to parse/analyze, and there’s no need for configuration. Simplicity is generally a good thing, so this definitely sounds appealing.
While, I’m all for consistency and good tooling support, I think those are also achievable with semantic indentation in the case of Clojure (although a bit harder). Consider the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For many macros you can infer the right indentation just by looking for a <code>body</code> parameter:</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defmacro</span><span> </span><span>when</span><span>
  </span><span>"Evaluates test. If logical true, evaluates body in an implicit do."</span><span>
  </span><span>{</span><span>:added</span><span> </span><span>"1.0"</span><span>}</span><span>
  </span><span>[</span><span>test</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span> </span><span>body</span><span>]</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>list</span><span> </span><span>'if</span><span> </span><span>test</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>cons</span><span> </span><span>'do</span><span> </span><span>body</span><span>)))</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Of course, there will also be counter-examples that need special handling, as they used some non-conventional names, but
this simple heuristic will work quite well most of the time.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Common Lisp’s SLIME <a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/doc/html/Semantic-indentation.html">has been using this approach</a> for a very long time.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s easy to specify the right indentation with <a href="https://docs.cider.mx/cider/indent_spec.html">metadata</a></li>
  <li>All popular Clojure editors and formatters that exist today are supporting “semantic indentation” pretty well, so clearly it’s not a big obstacle for tooling.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general I’ve always found it dangerous that a lot of the reasoning
around code style in recent years has been centered around how easy it is to enforce
certain style automatically.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>  I’ve experienced this first-hand both as
an editor of several code style guides, and as the author of a <a href="https://docs.rubocop.org/">fairly
popular Ruby lint/formatter tool</a>.  Yeah,
lint tools and formatters are very important and they make our lives easier, but we should
never forget we’re writing code for humans to read and (only occasionally) for machines to
execute. It’d be really sad if we lost sight of that just to pursue the ultimate degree
of consistency.</p>

<p>And there’s also the meta topic of the code we write being some artistic expression of our inner self, but we should
probably disregard this argument in any professional context. I’ll mention, though, that due to the simplicity
of Clojure/Lisp we’re (un)fortunate to have way fewer stylistic decisions to make than developers working with
languages like Ruby, Java or JavaScript.</p>

<p>Before, I wrap up I want to elaborate a bit on the reasoning behind the (infamous) semantic rules for function arguments alignment:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>;; function call spanning two lines</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span> </span><span>even?</span><span>
        </span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>))</span><span>

</span><span>;; function call spanning three lines</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span>
 </span><span>even?</span><span>
 </span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>))</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>While some people would argue that the rules are random or inconsistent, I believe that’s definitely not the case:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the first example, the formatting is similar to the one in every Algol-like language where the name of the function stands out and the arguments are grouped together. Of course, in most Algol-like languages people are still arguing whether to align or not align their function/method arguments. That being said, the case for aligned has always been the case for improved readability.</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Ruby (aligned arguments)</span>
<span>some_method</span><span>(</span><span>foo</span><span>,</span> <span>bar</span>
            <span>baz</span><span>)</span>

<span># Ruby (indented &amp; aligned arguments)</span>
<span>some_method</span><span>(</span>
  <span>foo</span><span>,</span> <span>bar</span>
  <span>baz</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above example is in Ruby, but it could have easily been in Java, C#, Python, JavaScript, etc.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the second example some people would question what they call “the 1-space indent”. That’s not really indentation at all, but rather standard alignment of list elements. Don’t forget the <code>()</code> are not some special invocation syntax, but plain old list literals, that are normally formatted like any other collection literal:</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>;; list literal</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>
 </span><span>2</span><span>
 </span><span>3</span><span>)</span><span>

</span><span>;; vector literal</span><span>
</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>
 </span><span>2</span><span>
 </span><span>3</span><span>]</span><span>

</span><span>;; set literal</span><span>
</span><span>#</span><span>{</span><span>1</span><span>
  </span><span>2</span><span>
  </span><span>3</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I don’t know about you, but I find the following fixed indentation a big weird:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>;;; Fixed Indentation</span><span>
</span><span>;;</span><span>
</span><span>;; list literals</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>
  </span><span>4</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span> </span><span>6</span><span>)</span><span>

</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>
  </span><span>2</span><span>
  </span><span>3</span><span>
  </span><span>4</span><span>
  </span><span>5</span><span>
  </span><span>6</span><span>)</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Admittedly, list literals are not very common in Clojure, that’s why it’s understandable
that for many people lists are nothing but an invocation syntax.</p>

<p>“Better Clojure Formatting” argued that the semantic formatting guidelines were not consistent:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This rule would be easy to automate if it didn’t have a huge list of exceptions. <code>let</code>, <code>cond</code>, <code>if</code>, <code>defn</code> and many other forms simply don’t follow this rule.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I disagree with this assessment, as the guideline in question is strictly for forms without bodies (mostly regular function calls).
All of the cited exceptions are just regular cases of a different <a href="https://guide.clojure.style/#body-indentation">rule</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Again, exceptions! E.g. <code>try</code> doesn’t follow it. Also, having a mix of one- and two-space indents was driving me mad when I was trying to follow those rules manually.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same here. Obviously <code>try</code> is not part of the guideline in question and follows a different guideline, which is hardly an exception.</p>

<h2 id="wide-vs-narrow-formatting">Wide vs Narrow Formatting</h2>

<p>I’ve noticed that many people dislike semantic formatting, because
it’s too wide (in the sense of taking up horizontal space) for their
taste. A reader remarked he finds this wide formatting ugly, wasteful
of horizontal space, and prohibitive of descriptive (long) function
names:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>;; semantic (wide)</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>clojure.core/filter</span><span> </span><span>even?</span><span>
                     </span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>))</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s important to understand that the comparison of wide vs narrow formatting has nothing to do with
semantic vs fixed. I think the confusion comes mostly from the fact that the semantic formatting is
often used in its wide version, although there’s a matching narrow version for everything.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>;; semantic (narrow)</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>clojure.core/filter</span><span>
 </span><span>even?</span><span>
 </span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>))</span><span>

</span><span>(</span><span>cond</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>zero?</span><span> </span><span>n</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>curr</span><span>

<p>This blog has been online for about 10 hours. To put it more harshly: I’m a
nobody on the internet. Yet, when I generated my first visitor report with
<a href="https://goaccess.io/">goaccess</a>, I saw that the bot army has already started
attacking my server. A lot of suspicious-looking URLs have been requested:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>/config/getuser?index=0</code></li>
  <li><code>/vendor/phpunit/phpunit/src/Util/PHP/eval-stdin.php</code></li>
  <li><code>/api/jsonws/invoke</code></li>
  <li><code>/solr/admin/info/system?wt=json</code></li>
  <li><code>/index.php?s=/Index/\x5Cthink\x5Capp/invokefunction</code>
<code>&amp;function=call_user_func_array&amp;vars[0]=md5&amp;vars[1][]=HelloThinkPHP21</code></li>
  <li><code>/console/</code></li>
  <li><code>/wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/readme.txt</code></li>
  <li><code>/Autodiscover/Autodiscover.xml</code></li>
  <li><code>/vendor/phpunit/phpunit/src/Util/PHP/eval-stdin.php</code></li>
</ul>

<p>This is just a small sample but it is obvious that they are trying to exploit
known vulnerabilities. These are absolutely harmless because this is a static
website but there was one request that caught my attention:</p>



<p>My static site doesn’t have a <code>.env</code> file but I work on a lot of projects that
have one. I of course know that exposing the <code>.env</code> file is a mistake – it
usually contains passwords, keys and other sensitive information and in a
production environment, these should be in environment variables – but it is
very scary to see that this is <em>among the first things</em> hackers try – because
it’s so easy to accidentally copy it into a public directory.</p>

<p>So please, everyone: <strong>protect your <code>.env</code>!</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><a href="https://medium.com/@aidandcunniffe?source=post_page-----4101612d4ad9--------------------------------" rel="noopener"><img alt="Aidan Cunniffe" src="https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/96/96/1*26JtOGzXJBiOCbDzaKjrWg.jpeg" width="48" height="48"></a></p></div></div></div></div><p id="cb76"><em>and why I’m still trying…</em></p><p id="5880">One of the curious things about being human is the ability to hold two contradictory views simultaneously. When I’m in analysis mode I try to understand what market, technical and social forces have lead to the status quo. To do this effectively, or at least to induce useful principles for later use, you have to believe that things are the way they are for good reasons. As soon as I put my innovator hat on however, I get all jazzed up and think “screw that! X would be so much better if Y”. I’ve learned over the last year that balancing these two perspectives is essential to an inventor.</p><p id="9c7d">This week I watched Bret Victor’s <a href="http://worrydream.com/dbx/" rel="noopener">Future of Programming</a> lecture from July 2013 and it compelled me to put these thoughts down on paper. During the lecture, Bret uses an overhead projector and pretends its 1973. He proudly presents the latest in programming research for the time and explains why it’d be really silly if we aren’t using them in 40 years. To Victor’s credit he remains in character the whole time as he satirically paints the ideal world we’ll soon enter — one the audience knows doesn’t really exist.</p><p id="cbac">The future Bret showed off included direct manipulations of the output (result) instead of the code, programming via constraints/goals, spatial (visual) programming paradigms, and massively parallel programming approaches. Declarative programming, functional programming, microservice architectures and WYSIWYG editors check some of those boxes, but not nearly at the level of their potential. All that being said, there’s no argument against real progress having been made the last 40 years, just not the progress many expected.</p><p id="f16a">So now I’ll put on my analysis hat and work through why the art of programming is so hard to advance beyond its current levels.</p><p id="a3f1">Many blame the lack of advancements on developers. We built shinny thing X, but developers are too arrogant, stubborn, busy, dismissive or all of the above to adopt it. I’ve even heard people accuse developers of selfishly protecting their future job prospects by trying to stifle the adoption of new programming mediums. Heck, I’ve said this before…</p><p id="f628">^ This is just wrong. In my experience developers are very rational beings. Their job is to find the most efficient way of solving problems every single day and if you create a tool that provides that they’ll be all over it. They’ll even volunteer their time to help you build it for free. If you move forward accepting that developers are mostly rational actors and have good reasons for adopting something / not adopting something you can learn a lot to inform future design.</p><p id="33a0">So I did that. I actually sat down with people over the last 3 months and asked them why they failed to adopt a variety of tools. I overwhelmingly got rational explanations to why switching to something new was irrational.</p><h2 id="99cb">Better Hammer Tradeoff</h2><p id="8f1e">Imagine you’re building a log cabin by hand with a bad, but usable hammer. When you’re 90% of the way finished a magical genie comes and offers you a better hammer. Great! But there’s a tradeoff: If you take the new shinny hammer, you have to start the house from scratch…oh and he turns back humanity to the stone age. You can get your new hammer, but you’ll have to do without bandsaws, your pickup truck, and yes, nails.</p><p id="3e8b">What’s the rational choice? Hint, it involves the old hammer.</p><p id="7f24">That parable emerged from summarizing all the interviews I conducted and highlights the frustrations developers have had with many of the new ‘solve all your problems’ tools they’ve tried. For context these tools fit into two categories: new programming languages including some flow &amp; graph based paradigms and no-code visual builders.</p><p id="6a39">There are two areas of value to consider when choosing a programming paradigm: the developer experience of the [language, tooling, GUI] and the strength of the ecosystem (what common problems have been solved already). Many of the new paradigms, while often built on sound principles, miss out on the massive body of work that already exists is language X. How do you weight these two areas when picking your paradigm? 30–70? 90–10? 1–99? Most people I spoke with rated the ecosystem as 2–3x more important than DX.</p><p id="9ab3">Tool-builders usually only focus on DX and [assume, hope, pray] that a community comes along and builds an ecosystem. This still can happens, but it was much much more common in the 90s than it is today. There are network effects in programming and a beautiful virtuous cycle quickly emerges among the most used tools. When a user shares functionality openly it makes paradigm more capable, which attracts new users, who continue to improve that paradigm. Boom! Node module for everything.</p><p id="0b6c">When you look at the languages that have really caught on recently, they tend to share one thing in common: they tap into an existing body of work. Look at TypeScript, the most popular language released after 2000, which interoperates with Javascript. Then there’s Swift, the second most popular language released after 2000. Just imagine where Swift would be today if it hadn’t been interoperable with Objective-C and the Cocoa legacy or if TypeScript’s ecosystem was a blue ocean from day one.</p><p id="272c">There are consequences for tool makers building an entirely new base abstraction, be it visual, text based or otherwise. If you choose not to interoperate with an existing ecosystem, you or your community will need to spend years coming up from the stone age to modernity. Programming is just learning to use a bunch of stacked abstractions. Even if you have an objectively better base abstraction, one that would have clearly won out over everything else had it been introduced in 1992, people will have few incentives to adopt it if there’s no ecosystem.</p><h2 id="749d">Sunk Cost…Sensibility</h2><p id="5881">Most people complete the phrase “Sunk cost _____” with “fallacy”. The classic economics thought experiment usually involves a couple staying at a concert they hate just because they paid face value for the tickets. An enlightened economist would, as the story goes, leave as soon as they became unhappy with the concert and reclaim a few precious hours. But if you had to pay $50k, $50M or $5B to leave the concert early, you’d probably stay. When the switching costs are that high, there’s good reason to stay and the largest employers of programmers in the world have enormous switching costs. This keeps mainstream programmers anchored to the status quo.</p><p id="2c6d">This is another completely rational choice developers make when sticking to the paradigms they know. The combined costs of hiring new people, training, rewriting the code, and the opportunity cost of choosing these actions over improving your product almost always outweigh the benefits of making the change. <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/" rel="noopener">Joel has a classic article about code rewrites that expands on this more.</a></p><p id="ccc1">Young companies without much in the way of legacy or those with no other choice have the luxury of picking new paradigms, but few of these companies end up becoming incumbents. Those who do make it are the kingmakers. Both Facebook and Twitter were first built on technologies that were inadequate for their eventual scale (PHP and Ruby). Facebook became so attached to PHP that they enhanced the language to suit their needs with Hack and other tools. Similarly, Twitter switched over to Scala which one could argue is a key reason for Scala’s mainstream success.</p><h2 id="a2d4">Solving the Least Important Problems</h2><p id="513f">Tool makers must strike a balance between learnability and productivity. A visual programming environment like MIT’s <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" rel="noopener">Scratch</a> is incredibly learnable. I’ve seen 4-5 year old kids build games with it after just a few hours. The drag/drop interface and shape based constraints are really easy to learn and prevent Scratch from ever being in a broken state. This is great for kids and individuals trying to learn programming.</p><p id="bb8d">The same things that make Scratch easy to learn also make it an unproductive environment for more serious programmers. For a professional, programming with drag and drop is way slower than keying in code — that’s just a fact.</p><p id="cad2">These tradeoffs must be considered whenever building a new tool. If you build something super learnable that is not productive you’ll get a lot of praise, but little follow through. If you build something that’s too difficult to learn, but very productive you’ll turn a lot of people off. To reach mainstream programmers you need to make something that is both learnable and productive.</p><p id="5100">I think most of the stalled innovations in programming focused disproportionally on learnability. The problem is, within a few weeks of using any paradigm developers usually have built a repository of habits that keep them from making mistakes. For instance, if a new visual logic builder prides itself on preventing all syntax errors, that’s really cool, but most developers have learned to do that automatically.</p><p id="742f">Truth is, every tool you have ever used is flawed and every new tool will also be flawed. Humans subconsciously come up with ways to cope with their tools so they can keep themselves focussed on the bigger conceptual issues. That isn’t going to change anytime soon. If professionals already have habits in place to cope with things that have been made easier/more learnable by new tooling, those new tools do not have much value to them. It’s like offering a 40 year old who’s been driving manual her whole life an automatic car — yeah that’s great, but it’s not needed and she certainly won’t pay a premium for it to be included.</p><h2 id="6e7a">Things Have Been Getting Better</h2><p id="10b2">No good analysis fails to include a few words from the Advocatus Diaboli.</p><p id="e04a">Things have been getting better. The growth has just been in the ecosystems and not the paradigms themselves. We’ve been building this amazing tower of abstraction since the early days of programming that provide really useful abstractions for things like:</p><ul><li id="fb86">Charging a credit card, which has gone from a 20 person team to processor.charge()</li><li id="b32b">Configuring a massive cluster of servers is done with a short text file instead of …</li></ul></div></div></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Note: the ideas in this post have already been covered numerous times in the past. One article that has greatly influenced my perspective over the years is <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McKinley's Choose Boring Technology</a>. Below I'll explore the topic from my own experience, and how I ended up using Kubernetes for a recent project.</p><p>Over the years I have observed that many engineers tend to attribute much of the success or failure of a company to the technical choices made. I know I’m often guilty of this too. And while it is often justified, I would argue that for the vast majority of startups out there, the choice of programming language, framework, or even database doesn’t matter that much. This seems especially true during the early stages.</p><h2>Through the engineering lens</h2><p>This perception is understandable, we as engineers tend to look at the world from a specific lens, and are often biased by what we know best. Our daily activities may include things such as debugging CI pipelines, implementing new features, pairing with colleagues, or migrating the always present legacy codebase. The environment that surrounds us makes it easy to believe that it all boils down to those things that we see and understand. It’s an illusion that makes us feel like we’re fully in control of what makes or breaks the product.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, it can be a huge advantage for many companies to make their product 3x more efficient than competitors, or to have elegant, composable code. But you might be focusing on the wrong problems if nobody cares about the product you’re actually building, and sooner or later your business will hit this wall.</p><p>I’m not saying that software doesn’t matter. A solid foundation for your startup goes a long way. If investing in this allows you to build better features faster than your competitors, more power to you. But finding the right balance is highly dependent on what you’re trying to solve and the resources you have at hand. There’s no right or wrong way to do it, and as usual, it mainly comes down to tradeoffs.</p><p><img src="https://panelbear.com/static/img/blog/lenses.png" alt="Different lenses"></p><h2>Boring is less surprising</h2><p>I believe aiming for a healthy balance of risk vs reward when it comes to your technical choices is something to strive for. In particular, if it decreases the chances you get stuck on the wrong problems down the road.</p><p>Boring is often interpreted as “picking old technologies over newer ones”, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that. For me, this comes down to using proven technologies in which the ways it can fail are mostly known, but occasionally experimenting with different, possibly newer tools that might suit the problem at hand better.</p><p>Maybe you want to gain more experience by using the latest framework or programming language, or you just want to have some fun. You do what makes you happy. But if you’re trying to make a decision to increase the odds that your product or business will succeed, it’s worth stepping back and considering your options.</p><p>For me, mainly choosing software that has been around for longer is not about it being boring or older, it’s about the fact that the ways in which it fails are better known. There are fewer unknowns for you to deal with and this maximizes your chances of actually shipping the project.</p><p>For example the other day I had an issue with my Django app, and a quick search led me to tens of answers to this problem in various forums and websites. It took me at most 10 minutes to get back on track and that was the end of this issue.</p><p>I experienced the exact opposite a few years ago with a popular, but not so battle-tested Scala library my team had been using for a while. We were probably among the first to encounter the issues we were facing, and it seemed nobody had walked down this path before. Maybe it sounds like a fun challenge or a great chance to contribute back to OSS (which I’m happy to), but once you solve it, do your customers really care about it? How many days, weeks, or even months are you willing to invest in such issues? In my case, I’d rather use that time to ship new features or improve the existing ones.</p><h2>Exploit vs explore</h2><p>I try to follow an 80/20 distribution when it comes to my choice of tools. This means my stack consists of about 80% software I already know well, but I do allow myself 20% of the stack to explore tech I have less experience with. The exact ratio is not what’s important here, it’s more the fact that you should lean towards using proven technologies.</p><p>This also resonates with how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multi-armed bandits</a> work. You try to maximize your expected gain by taking advantage of what worked well in the past, while sometimes exploring new things to avoid missing out on a possible goldmine.</p><p><img src="https://panelbear.com/static/img/blog/bandits.png" alt="Balance new vs proven"></p><p>A more recent example of mine started as an embarrassingly simple Django app with no charts, all metrics were rendered on a plain HTML table, and all data was stored on a SQLite database. Took literally a weekend to get it up and running including manually deploying to a $5/mo VM. Low risk and high reward for my needs at the time.</p><p>Fast forward and as I added more features and began handling more page views for various websites, I started to notice that the codebase could use some refactoring. It also became increasingly repetitive to do things like deploying to new instances, issuing SSL certs, and keeping the DNS records up to date in case the IP address of my instances changed.</p><p>As a second iteration, I upgraded to a docker-compose setup plus lots of glue code. But soon enough I found myself reinventing what other tools already do well. There are multiple ways to solve each of these pain points, but in my case, it came down to using a tool I am very familiar with from my full-time job: Kubernetes.</p><p>Yes, I am well aware it can be overkill for a lot of projects out there, and I could have gotten away with a more traditional solution. But it works well for me, and I have been running production workloads with it for several years already. Please do not just blindly follow my path. Use what you already know best.</p><p>Kubernetes allowed me to simplify the operational aspects tremendously, and I feel comfortable debugging issues with it after having the pleasure of putting down multiple production fires for my employer over the years. It has also been around several years, there's lots of documentation, and a huge helpful community who can help. It'd argue that there's more documentation available than for any home-grown deployment system, or even EC2/Lambda/DigitalOcean for that matter.</p><p>As an added benefit, it also made it trivial when I migrated from DigitalOcean to Linode, and most recently to AWS (each migration took mostly an evening of changing my Terraform files and deploying them - I’m being serious). But that’s for another post.</p><h2>Let complexity come over time</h2><p>My point is, I moved into these technologies as the pain with the previous solution was higher than dealing with the new tech. But more importantly, it helped me ship features even faster to my customers while reducing the operational overhead for me.</p><p>If I had started with the more advanced setup from day one, I might have lost all motivation before I would have had the first version of Panelbear. The key is to solve the problems that are getting between you and your goals, not potential issues you believe one day will be yours.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<!-- /.post-info -->      <p>As we know from the previous parts of this series, the execution of a Python program consists of two major steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-2-how-the-cpython-compiler-works/">The CPython compiler</a> translates Python code to bytecode.</li>
<li><a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-1-how-the-cpython-vm-works/">The CPython VM</a> executes the bytecode.</li>
</ol>
<p>We've been focusing on the second step for quite a while. In <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-4-how-python-bytecode-is-executed/">part 4</a> we've looked at the evaluation loop, a place where Python bytecode gets executed. And in <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-5-how-variables-are-implemented-in-cpython/">part 5</a> we've studied how the VM executes the instructions that are used to implement variables. What we haven't covered yet is how the VM actually computes something. We postponed this question because to answer it, we first need to understand how the most fundamental part of the language works. Today, we'll study the Python object system.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In this post I'm referring to CPython 3.9. Some implementation details will certainly change as CPython evolves. I'll try to keep track of important changes and add update notes.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Consider an extremely simple piece of Python code:</p>



<p>To compute the function <code>f</code>, CPython must evaluate the expression <code>x + 7</code>. The question I'd like to ask is: How does CPython do that? Special methods such as <code>__add__()</code> and <code>__radd__()</code> probably come to your mind. When we define these methods on a class, the instances of that class can be added using the <code>+</code> operator. So, you might think that CPython does something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>It calls <code>x.__add__(7)</code> or <code>type(x).__add__(x, 7)</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>x</code> doesn't have <code>__add__()</code>, or if this method fails, it calls <code>(7).__radd__(x)</code> or <code>int.__radd__(7, x)</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The reality, tough, is a bit more complicated. What really happens depends on what <code>x</code> is. For example, if <code>x</code> is an instance of a user-defined class, the algorithm described above resembles the truth. If, however, <code>x</code> is an instance of a built-in type, like <code>int</code> or <code>float</code>, CPython doesn't call any special methods at all.</p>
<p>To learn how some Python code is executed, we can do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disassemble the code into bytecode.</li>
<li>Study how the VM executes the disassembled bytecode instructions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's apply this algorithm to the function <code>f</code>. The compiler translates the body of this function to the following bytecode:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ python -m dis f.py
...
  2           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)
              2 LOAD_CONST               1 (7)
              4 BINARY_ADD
              6 RETURN_VALUE
</pre></div>


<p>And here's what these bytecode instructions do:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>LOAD_FAST</code> loads the value of the parameter <code>x</code> onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>LOAD_CONST</code> loads the constant <code>7</code> onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>BINARY_ADD</code> pops two values from the stack, adds them and pushes the result back onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>RETURN_VALUE</code> pops the value from the stack and returns it.</li>
</ol>
<p>How does the VM add two values? To answer this question, we need to understand what these values are. For us, <code>7</code> is an instance of <code>int</code> and <code>x</code> is, well, anything. For the VM, though, everything is a Python object. All values the VM pushes onto the stack and pops from the stack are pointers to <code>PyObject</code> structs (hence the phrase "Everything in Python is an object").</p>
<p>The VM doesn't need to know how to add integers or strings, that is, how to do the arithmetic or concatenate sequences. All it needs to know is that every Python object has a type. A type, in turn, knows everything about its objects. For example, the <code>int</code> type knows how to add integers, and the <code>float</code> type knows how to add floats. So, the VM asks the type to perform the operation.</p>
<p>This simplified explanation captures the essence of the solution, but it also omits a lot of important details. To get a more realistic picture, we need to understand what Python objects and types really are and how they work.</p>
<h2>Python objects and types</h2>
<p>We've discussed Python objects a little in <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-3-stepping-through-the-cpython-source-code/">part 3</a>. This discussion is worth repeating here.</p>
<p>We begin with the definition of the <code>PyObject</code> struct:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>_object</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>_PyObject_HEAD_EXTRA</span> <span>// macro, for debugging purposes only</span>
    <span>Py_ssize_t</span> <span>ob_refcnt</span><span>;</span>
    <span>PyTypeObject</span> <span>*</span><span>ob_type</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It has two members:</p>
<ul>
<li>a reference count <code>ob_refcnt</code> that CPython uses for garbage collection; and</li>
<li>a pointer to the object's type <code>ob_type</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We said that the VM treats any Python object as <code>PyObject</code>. How is that possible? The C programming language has no notion of classes and inheritance. Nevertheless, it's possible to implement in C something that can be called a single inheritance. The C standard states that a pointer to any struct can be converted to a pointer to its first member and vice versa. So, we can "extend" <code>PyObject</code> by defining a new struct whose first member is <code>PyObject</code>.</p>
<p>Here's, for example, how the <code>float</code> object is defined:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span> <span>// expansion of PyObject_HEAD macro</span>
    <span>double</span> <span>ob_fval</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyFloatObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>A <code>float</code> object stores everything <code>PyObject</code> stores plus a floating-point value <code>ob_fval</code>. The C standard simply states that we can convert a pointer to <code>PyFloatObject</code> to a pointer to <code>PyObject</code> and vice versa:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>PyFloatObject</span> <span>float_object</span><span>;</span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>PyObject</span> <span>*</span><span>obj_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>PyObject</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>&amp;</span><span>float_object</span><span>;</span>
<span>PyFloatObject</span> <span>*</span><span>float_obj_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>PyFloatObject</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>obj_ptr</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The reason why the VM treats every Python object as <code>PyObject</code> is because all it needs to access is the object's type. A type is also a Python object, an instance of the <code>PyTypeObject</code> struct:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>// PyTypeObject is a typedef for "struct _typeobject"</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>_typeobject</span> <span>{</span>

<span>};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>By the way, note that the first member of a type is not <code>PyObject</code> but <code>PyVarObject</code>, which is defined as follows:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span>
    <span>Py_ssize_t</span> <span>ob_size</span><span>;</span> <span>/* Number of items in variable part */</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyVarObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Nevertheless, since the first member of <code>PyVarObject</code> is <code>PyObject</code>, a pointer to a type can still be converted to a pointer to <code>PyObject</code>.</p>
<p>So, what is a type and why does it have so many members? A type determines how the objects of that type behave. Each member of a type, called slot, is responsible for a particular aspect of the object's behavior. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tp_new</code> is a pointer to a function that creates new objects of the type.</li>
<li><code>tp_str</code> is a pointer to a function that implements  <code>str()</code> for objects of the type.</li>
<li><code>tp_hash</code> is a pointer to a function that implements  <code>hash()</code> for objects of the type.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some slots, called sub-slots, are grouped together in suites. A suite is just a struct that contains related slots. For example, the <code>PySequenceMethods</code> struct is a suite of sub-slots that implement the sequence protocol:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>lenfunc</span> <span>sq_length</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>sq_concat</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeargfunc</span> <span>sq_repeat</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeargfunc</span> <span>sq_item</span><span>;</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>was_sq_slice</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeobjargproc</span> <span>sq_ass_item</span><span>;</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>was_sq_ass_slice</span><span>;</span>
    <span>objobjproc</span> <span>sq_contains</span><span>;</span>

    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>sq_inplace_concat</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeargfunc</span> <span>sq_inplace_repeat</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PySequenceMethods</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If you count all the slots and sub-slots, you'll get a scary number. Fortunately, each slot is very well <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html">documented</a> in the Python/C API Reference Manual (I strongly recommend you to bookmark this link). Today we'll cover only a few slots. Nevertheless, it shall give us a general idea of how slots are used.</p>
<p>Since we're interested in how CPython adds objects, let's find the slots responsible for addition. There must be at least one such slot. After careful inspection of the <code>PyTypeObject</code> struct, we find that it has the "number" suite <code>PyNumberMethods</code>, and the first slot of this suite is a binary function called <code>nd_add</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_add</span><span>;</span> <span>// typedef PyObject * (*binaryfunc)(PyObject *, PyObject *)</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_subtract</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_multiply</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_remainder</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_divmod</span><span>;</span>
    <span>// ... more sub-slots</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyNumberMethods</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It seems that the <code>nb_add</code> slot is what we're looking for. Two questions naturally arise regarding this …</p></div></div>

<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/index.html">(home)</a> <span>2020-12-06</span>
<p>Despite what I may have said in an earlier post, it's not <em>all</em> that nice to code directly in wat.
So I've started work on a compiler. A very thin compiler. The language should feel very similar to our, beloved, <code>wat</code>, but save us from
typing all those <code>i32.const, local.get</code>.
</p>
<p>Some points up front:
</p>
<ul><li>
the compiler targets <code>WAT</code> (not <code>WASM</code>). This means using <code>WABT::wat2wasm</code>.
</li><li>
not self hosting <span>come on people, I don't even have malloc to play with yet, let alone a buggy, poorly implemented, partial copy of common lisp.</span>
</li><li>
the compiler is written in common lisp (specifically, sbcl). <span>hereinafter CL</span>.
</li><li>
syntax checking is state-of-the-art and errors are output in a readable format (i.e. you will get a cryptic <code>sbcl</code> debug trace if you make the
slightest mistake).
</li><li>
why <strong>sugar</strong>? It was either that or <code>watson, watsup, watsamatta, watulookin</code>. <span>Also cos it's just syntactical sugar, get it?</span>
</li><li>
internet searches are to be done using <code>sugarlang</code> <span>or sugarland if you prefer</span>.
</li><li>
there is no manual; not even mul/div or all the relation operators (e.g. &lt;=) are written yet!
</li><li>
the compiler output is not a standalone executable but a <code>wasm</code> file. The <em>best</em> standalone wasm runtime I've found so far is <code>wasm-interp</code>.
Please don't say node.js. You can say <code>v8</code>, maybe.
</li></ul>
<blockquote><strong>node.js/npm</strong><br>That feeling when ...<br>People say <em>Minimalist System</em><br>Then say "just use npm install ..."<br></blockquote><h2> sugar example</h2>
<p>Here is the <code>malloc.wat</code> example from the previous blog post on webasm re-written in <code>sugar</code>.
It's quite a bit more concise and convenient than the original raw <code>wat</code> (see below).
</p>
<p>(previous post on <code>wat</code>
<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/blog/2020-12-03-webasm-forth-with-lisp-syntax.html">/blog/2020-12-03-webasm-forth-with-lisp-syntax.html</a>
)
</p>
<pre>; malloc.sugar - sugar example code
(memory (import "js" "mem") 10)
(import "console" "log" (func js_log (i i32)))
(global memend i32 #x1000)
(global sbrk (mut i32) 0)
; ----- allocate some memory in wasm-space
(defun (export "malloc") (len i32) :result i32
  (locals (i32 (newbrk (+ sbrk len)) (mem sbrk)))
  (if (&gt;= newbrk memend) (return 0))
  (set sbrk newbrk)
  mem)
; ----- write bytes in wasm-space memory using js callback
(defun (export dump_range) (start i32 len i32)
  (locals (i32 i (end (+ start len))))
  (for (i start end)
    (js_log (get.u8* i))))
</pre>
<p>And this is what you would have written if you were coding directly in <code>wat</code>.
</p>
<pre>(module
  (memory (import "js" "mem") 10)
  (import "console" "log" (func $js_log (param $i i32)))
  (global $memend i32  (i32.const 4096))
  (global $sbrk (mut i32)  (i32.const 0))
  ;; ----- allocate some memory in wasm-space
  (func (export "malloc") (param $len i32) (result i32)
    (local $newbrk i32)
    (local $mem i32)
    (local.set $newbrk (i32.add (global.get $sbrk) (local.get $len)))
    (if (i32.ge_u (local.get $newbrk) (global.get $memend))
      (return (i32.const 0)))
    (local.set $mem (global.get $sbrk))
    (global.set $sbrk (local.get $newbrk))
    (local.get $mem))
  ;; ----- write bytes in wasm-space memory using js callback
  (func (export "dump_range") (param $start i32) (param $len i32)
    (local $i i32)
    (local $end i32)
    (local.set $end (i32.add (local.get $start) (local.get $len)))
    (local.set $i (local.get $start))
    (block $break2 (loop $head1
      (br_if $break2 (i32.eq (local.get $i)  (local.get $end)))
      (call $js_log (i32.load8_u (local.get $i)))
      (local.set $i (i32.add  (i32.const 1) (local.get $i)))
      (br $head1)))))
</pre>
<h2> using sugar</h2>
<p>Write a <code>your-source.sugar</code> source file in your favorite text editor. Then run <code>sugar</code> on it to produce <code>your-source.wat</code>
</p>
<p>This is how I use sugar (with a makefile for calling sugar, then wat2wasm):
<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/src/sugar.mk">/src/sugar.mk</a>
</p>
<pre>$ mk malloc.wasm
./sugar malloc.sugar &gt;malloc.wat
summary: globals:2 functions:3 macros:2
wat2wasm malloc.wat
</pre>
<p>(see below for installing common lisp)
</p>
<h2> compiler</h2>
<p>The compiler is very small and may be interesting to read, for that reason.
<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/src/sugar">/src/sugar</a>
</p>
<p>It includes a macro system, which I have used to implement <code>inc</code> and <code>for</code> but it's not yet available for use from sugar
itself. <span>Also the full CL defmacro/destructuring-bind lambda list syntax is non trivial to replicate; not to mention backquote.</span>
</p>
<h3> compiler structure</h3>
<p>Here is the overall compiler structure
</p>
<pre>loop:
  read a form [from source file]
  (compile form) =&gt; stdout
compile form:
  integer =&gt; (i32.const int)
  symbol =&gt; (local/global.get varname) [check in environment/scope]
  list/s-expr/cons =&gt;
    if (is-macro? form)
      (compile (expand-macro form))
    else:
      is-special? form =&gt; (compile-special form) [defun/import/export/global/set...]
      is-function? =&gt;
        for all args (compile arg)
        call func with args
      otherwise =&gt; error undefined function
</pre>
<h3> common lisp?</h3>
<p>Too many brackets?
</p><blockquote>Rule 1: There are no brackets, only indentation.<br>Rule 0: We suffer the brackets cos it gives us defmacro and that's worth a lot of suffering.<br></blockquote><p>Did you ever generate code? Did you think that was cool? You'll love common lisp. Try it for 2 weeks.
Money back guarantee if not satisfied.
</p>
<h3> value-if</h3>
<p>Lisp has value-IF i.e. you can use IF anywhere you use a value. That's like C's ternary but more powerful.
At first I thought WAT doesn't have it, but (if) has an optional
<code>(result type)</code> clause, like (func) so that it's branches
can return (type matched) values. So you can do clever things like this:
<span>note the (result i32) clause between if and condition.</span></p>
<pre>(set x
  (if (result i32) (&gt;= z limit)
    (comp-true-value y)
    (comp-false-value s 14 q)))
</pre>
<p><code>wat (select)</code> is like the C ternary operator although it can have blocks/statement sequences inside.</p><p>select v if: select has all 3 clauses always evaluated while (if) has only the conditional and the chosen branch evaluated. The other
(if) branch is not evaluated.
</p>
<h2> future directions</h2>
<h3> user accessible macros (defmacro)</h3>
<p>Implement (defmacro ...) for sugar.
</p>
<h3> shortcut and/or</h3>
<p>At the moment I only have the bitwise and/or operators '&amp;' and 'bor' and next on the list is having shortcutting logical <code>and/or</code> operators
like CL.
</p>
<p>Ideally I'd like to have lisp-style <code>and/or</code> where the expression value is
returned rather than just 0 or 1. Also standalone <code>and/or</code> so we can have things like
</p>
<pre>(and (file-existsp fname) (process-file fname))
(or (setup-completep) (error setup-failed))
</pre>
<span>Shortcut <code>and/or</code> actually compile to nested (if) expressions.</span><h3> missing operators/functions</h3>
<p>A whole slew of function counterparts for other types (i64,f32,f64) are missing. The compiler cannot type-infer which one (see below)
so these would have explicit names like <code>+f64, set.f64</code> etc.
</p>
<p>There are many other relops missing etc. They are fairly trivial to add.
</p>
<h3> arrays</h3>
<p>Currently I'm using pointer <code>get*/set*</code> but I'd like to have <code>aref</code> and implicit index to pointer arithmetic.
</p>
<h3> loops</h3>
<p>Some more loops. <code>while repeat</code> etc. The underlying <code>block, loop, br_if, br</code> are exposed so writing loops is possible.
It would only be the case of adding some more macros to enable:
</p>
<pre>(while condition body...)
(forever body...)
</pre>
<p>Also <code>continue, break</code> would be nice.
</p>
<h3> structures / defstruct</h3>
<p>Some kind of struct might be nice to have. Even if all the fields had to be i32 initially i.e. just a vector with named,
instead of numbered, fields.
</p>
<h3> better syntax/semantic checking</h3>
<p>Even the current error messages drop you into the SBCL debugger, which can be a scary place - [<code>ctrl-d</code>] to exit.
</p>
<h3> type tracing</h3>
<p>Knowing the types of values would allow the compiler to check signatures of calls of user functions and builtins.
It would also allow me to infer the correct type for <code>set</code> rather than requiring <code>set.f32</code> etc.
</p>
<h3> LET</h3>
<p>Locals <em>must</em> be defined at the start of a function. This means implementing LET (scoped blocks with local variables) is not trivial.
The current, single-pass, compiler would need to become far more complex to first decide how many locals are required in a function,
then allocate them up-front and possibly rename them if there are clashes.
</p>
<h3> self hosting</h3>
<p>The <em>holy grail</em> of compiler writers is that they rewrite their compiler in their new language. Common Lisp is <em>so far</em> above
the level of <code>wat</code> that this would be a large undertaking. First I'd need to write malloc...
</p>
<h2> installing common lisp</h2>
<p>Setting up sugar/common lisp may be trivial or hard depending on how familiar with common lisp you are :)
</p>
<p>Installing common lisp (I use SBCL) is outside the scope of this post. (Tell me it's harder than npm ...)
</p>
<p>I refer you to [Zach Beane's]
<a href="https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/">https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/</a>
</p>
<p>SBCL might even be in your package manager:
</p>
<pre>$ pacman -Ss sbcl
</pre>
<p><code>sugar</code> is run as a unix script. I've made a custom sbcl core since I prefer <code>iterate</code> over <code>loop</code>.
Here is a very brief explanation of how to make such a core, starting with <em>plain, vanilla</em> sbcl.
</p>
<pre>$ sbcl
* (ql:quickload '#:iterate)
* (sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die "sbcl-iterate")
$ sudo mv sbcl-iterate /usr/share/sbcl/sbcl-iterate
</pre>
<h2> source</h2>
<ul><li>

</li><li>
<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/src/sugar">/src/sugar</a>
</li></ul>
<h2> mistakes</h2>
<p>[2020-12-07] My original compiler structure had a macro expansion bug. I was misled since I was in a block where I had just checked that
(form) was a consp/list and I assumed this remained true inside that block.
However, I missed the fact that I am modifying the form inside the block, with (expand-macro).
It's possible (expand-macro) returns a non-list e.g. a symbol. Then my list assumptions break.
</p>
<pre>compile form:
  ...
  list/s-expr/cons =&gt;
    while: (is-macro? form)
      form := (expand-macro form) &lt;---- bug: this can change form into a non-list
    is-special? form =&gt; ...
    is-function? =&gt; ...
</pre>
<p>First I fixed this with an extra list check in is-macro and also in the is-special/is-function parts, and a recursive call to compile
for non-list forms.
</p>
<p>I later thought if I had used a functional approach and avoided the mutation, I would not have made this mistake. My visual hint
that I was dealing with a list would have remained true. It turns out the functional solution is even more elegant than the original
and doesn't have the bug (+1 to functional purists).
</p>
<p>The functional solution, doesn't loop, it recurses on compile. Then compile gets the chance to decide again
what type of form expand-macro returned (nested macros …</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Git is a distributed version control system and does not require a central server. Although repositories are usually published at a well-known location for convenient cloning and fetching of the latest changes, this is actually not necessary. Each clone can have the full commit history and evolve independently. Furthermore, code changes can be exchanged via email or other means. Finally, even the clone itself does not need to be made from a well-known domain that hosts a git repository (see <tt>git-bundle(1)</tt>).</p>

<p>Given that git itself is already fully decentralized one would think there is no further work to do. I came across the <a href="https://radicle.xyz/">Radicle</a> project and its somewhat psychedelic website. Besides having a website with a wild color scheme, the project aims to offer a social coding experiment or git forge functionality using a peer-to-peer network architecture. According to the <a href="https://docs.radicle.xyz/docs/what-is-radicle">documentation</a> the motivation seems to be that git's built-in functionality works but is not user-friendly enough to make it accessible. In particular, it lacks social coding features.</p>

<p>The goal is to add git forge features like project and developer discovery, issue trackers, wikis, etc. Additional, distinctly decentralized functionality, is also touched on involving Ethereum as a way to anchor project metadata, pay contributors, etc. Radicle is still in early development so these features are not yet implemented. Here is my take on the <a href="https://radicle.xyz/">How it Works</a> documentation, which is a little confusing due to its early stage and some incomplete sentences or typos. I don't know whether my understanding actually corresponds to the Radicle implementation that exists today or its eventual vision, because I haven't studied the code or tried running the software. However, the ideas that the documentation has brought up are interesting and fruitful in their own right, so I wanted to share them and explain them in my own words in case you also find them worth exploring.</p>

<h2>The git data model</h2>
<p>Let's quickly review the git data model because it is important for understanding peer-to-peer git forges. A git repository contains a <tt>refs/</tt> subdirectory that provides a namespace for local branch heads (<tt>refs/heads/</tt>), local and remotely fetched tags (<tt>refs/tags/</tt>), and remotely fetched branches (<tt>refs/remotes/&lt;remote&gt;/</tt>). Actually this namespace layout is just a convention for everyday git usage and it's possible to use the <tt>refs/</tt> namespace differently as we will see. The git client fetches refs from a remote according to a <i>refspec</i> rule that maps remote refs to local refs. This gives the client the power to fetch only certain refs from the server. The client can also put them in a different location in its local <tt>refs/</tt> directory than the server. For details, see the <tt>git-fetch(1)</tt> man page.</p>

<p>Refs files contain the commit hash of an <i>object</i> stored in the repository's object database. An object can be a commit, tree (directory), tag, or a blob (file). Branch refs point to the latest commit object. A commit object refers to a tree object that may refer to further tree objects for sub-directories and finally the blob objects that make up the files being stored. Note that a git repository supports <i>disjoint</i> branches that share no history. Perhaps the most well-known example of disjoint branches are the GitHub Pages and GitLab Pages features where these git forges publish static websites from the HTML/CSS/JavaScript/image files on a specific branch in the repository. That branch shares no version history with other branches and the directories/files typically have no similarity to the repository's main branch.</p>

<p>Now we have covered enough git specifics to talk about peer-to-peer git forges. If you want to learn more about how git objects are actually stored, check out my article on the <a href="http://blog.vmsplice.net/2016/05/git-internals-of-how-objects-are-stored.html">repository layout and pack files</a>.</p>

<h2>Identity and authority</h2>
<p>Normally a git repository has one or more owners who are allowed to push refs. No one else has permission to modify the refs namespace. What if we tried to share a single refs namespace with the whole world and everyone could push? There would be chaos due to naming conflicts and malicious users would delete or change other users' refs. So it seems like an unworkable idea unless there is some way to enforce structure on the global refs namespace.</p>

<p>Peer-to-peer systems have solutions to these problems. First, a unique identity can be created by picking a random number with a sufficient number of bits so that the chance of collision is improbable. That unique identity can be used as a prefix in the global ref namespace to avoid accidental collisions. Second, there needs to be a way to prevent unauthorized users from modifying the part of the global namespace that is owned by other users.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">Public-key cryptography</a> provides the primitive for achieving both these things. A public key or its hash can serve as the unique identifier that provides identity and prevents accidental collisions. Ownership can be enforced by verifying that changes to the global namespace are signed with the private key corresponding to the unique identity.</p>

<p>For example, we fetch the following refs from a peer:</p>
<pre>&lt;identity&gt;/
  heads/
    main
  metadata/
    signed_refs
</pre>

<p>This is a simplified example based on the Radicle documentation. Here <tt>identity</tt> is the unique identity based on a public key. Remember no one else in the world has the same identity because the chance of generating the same public key is improbable. The <tt>heads/</tt> refs are normal git refs to commit objects - these are published branches. The <tt>signed_refs</tt> ref points to an git object that contains a list of commit hashes and a signature generated using the public key. The signature can be verified using the public key.</p>

<p>Next we need to <i>verify</i> these changes to check that they were created with the private key that is only known to the identity's owner. First, we check the signature on the object pointed to by the <tt>signed_refs</tt> ref. If the signature is not valid we reject these changes and do not store them in our local repository. Next, we look up each ref in <tt>heads/</tt> against the list in <tt>signed_refs</tt>. If a ref is missing from the list then we reject these refs and do not allow them into our local repository.</p>

<p>This scheme lends itself to peer-to-peer systems because the refs can be propagated (copied) between peers and verified at each step. The identity owner does not need to be present at each copy step since their cryptographic signature is all we need to be certain that they authorized these refs. So I can receive refs originally created by identity A from peer B and still be sure that peer B did not modify them since identity A's signature is intact.</p>

<p>Now we have a global refs namespace that is partitioned so that each identity is able to publish refs and peers can verify that these changes are authorized.</p>

<h2>Gossip</h2>
<p>It may not be clear yet that it's not necessary to clone the entire global namespace. In fact, it's possible that no single peer will ever have a full copy of the entire global namespace! That's because this is a distributed system. Peers only fetch refs that they care about from their peers. Peers fetch from each other and this forms a network. The network does not need to be fully connected and it's possible to have multiple clusters of peers running without full global connectivity.</p>

<p>To bootstrap the global namespace there are <i>seed</i> repositories. Seeds are a common concept in peer-to-peer systems. They provide an entry point for new peers to learn about and start participating with other peers. In BitTorrent this is called a "tracker" rather than a "seed".</p>

<p>According to the Radicle documentation it is possible to directly fetch from peers. This probably means a <tt>git-daemon(1)</tt> or <tt>git-http-backend(1)</tt> needs to be accessible on the public internet. Many peers will not have sufficient network connectivity due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation">NAT</a> limitations. I guess Radicle does not expect every user to participate as a repository.</p>

<p>Interestingly, there is a <i>gossip</i> system for propagating refs through the network. Let's revisit the refs for an identity in the global namespace:</p>
<pre>&lt;identity&gt;/
  heads/
    main
  metadata/
    signed_refs
  remotes/
    &lt;another-identity&gt;/
      heads/
        main
        foo
      metadata/
        signed_refs
      remotes/
        ...
</pre>

<p>We can publish identities that we track in <tt>remotes/</tt>. It's a recursive refs layout. This is how someone tracking our refs can find out about related identities and their refs.</p>

<p>Thanks to git's data model the commit, tree, and blob objects can be shared even though we duplicate refs published by another identity. Since git is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage">content-addressable</a> object database the data is stored once even though multiple refs point to it.</p>

<p>Now we not only have a global namespace where anyone can publish git refs, but also ways to build a peer-to-peer network and propagate data throughout the network. It's important to note that data is only propagated if peers are interested in fetching it. Peers are not forced to store data that they are not interested in.</p>

<h2>How data is stored locally</h2>
<p>Let's bring the pieces together and show how the system stores data. The peer creates a local git repository called the <i>monorepo</i> for the purpose of storing portions of the global namespace. It fetches refs from seeds or direct peers to get started. Thanks to the <tt>remotes/</tt> refs it also learns about other refs on the network that it did not request directly.</p>

<p>This git repository is just a data store, it is not usable for normal git workflows. The conventional <tt>git branch</tt> and <tt>git tag</tt> commands would not work well with the global namespace layout and verification requirements. Instead we can clone a local file:/// repository from the monorepo that fetches a subset of the refs into the conventional git refs layout. The files can be shared because <tt>git-clone(1)</tt> supports hard links to local repositories. Thanks to <tt>githooks(5)</tt> and/or extensible <tt>git-push(1)</tt> remote helper support it's possible to generate the necessary global namespace …</p></div></div>

            <p>Earlier today, I had the misfortune of reading a blog post about the dangers of the decentralized web and how we should not partake in or encourage it's development. Hacker News had a pretty <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25312854" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">active discussion</a> about the post.</p><p>Ideological takes on this always turn ugly, and I'm at a point in my life where I avoid that at all costs. I can only talk about my preferences about the world, not about how things ought to be, implying some sort of inherent value or divine moral good.</p><p>Here's what I prefer: a world where ideas, no matter how silly or dangerous, are allowed to be expressed, shared, ignored, attacked and laughed at. I don't imagine a world like this can ever exist easily, but a more decentralized web can help us get halfway there.</p><h3 id="ok-so-what-about-gurlic-then">Ok so what about Gurlic then?</h3><p><a href="https://gurlic.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Gurlic</a> is roughly just over two months old now, and at a point where I am relatively comfortable with the basic features it has. In the coming weeks and months, I want to focus on modifying the backend to either adopt an existing decentralized protocol, or think about how to approach writing a new one. Perhaps it would have been smarter to do this before building it first, but that would have limited how I envisioned Gurlic to be and it would've turned out differently.</p><p>Right now I'm looking into the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">activitypub</a> spec, and the <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">matrix</a> spec - here are some initial thoughts I have about how Gurlic should approach decentralization/federation.</p><ul><li><p>Decentralization can be a priority, but must never be promoted as a feature, or made to be a selling point. When decentralization becomes the main selling point of a product or service, the usability and polish tend to suffer. Not always, but nearly always. None of the marketing copy should include the words 'decentralization', 'privacy' etc. <strong>Normal users don't care about any of this</strong>.</p></li><li><p>User experience should be seamless. The user shouldn't have to generate a key, remember an extra password, remember weird URL schemes, or download utilities and clients just to be part of an online community or to write an article. Above all, the user must not be confused, as one usually is when looking at Mastodon instances, which one to sign up to, and so on. My mom should be able to use it without having to call me, just like she does with Facebook. <strong>Normal users do care about this</strong>.</p></li><li><p>The protocol must be flexible enough to allow for all of Gurlic's current features. This means communities, user profiles, publications, articles, galleries, rich media posts, sharing/responding and so on. All seamlessly without any rough edges.</p></li><li><p>Any and all cryptocurrency/blockchain must be avoided.</p></li></ul><p>I'll have more to write about this in the near future.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main id="main-content"><article><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517400508447-f8dd518b86db?w=1226&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=edges" alt=""><div><section><p>We wrote about <a href="https://security.christmas/2019/21">"Safe travels for the road warrior"</a> last year. This year we offer one more trick, and expand our list for staying safe and secure on the road.</p>
<p>Watch out for shoulder surfers, and protect your equipment if you have to leave it in for example your hotel room.</p>
</section><article><section><p><em>PANDEMIC WARNING: Stay at home if you can. A virus has for the better part of 2020 attacked physical infrastructure (people). We have no patch or hotfix, so while that is being worked out, we advice you to travel as little as possible.</em> </p>
<h2>Shoulder surfers:</h2>
<p>Be aware of your surroundings and reduce the risk of shoulder surfers. A shoulder surfer is someone who is peaking over your shoulder to get information. We can spot people prone to this type of social engineering attack all the time. When people are visiting a cafee, are on public transport, or on air planes they will use their laptop for work stuff. And they don’t notice, or care if someone is looking.</p>
<p>To protect your information, you can, and should invest in a privacy shield for you screen. They cost next to nothing, but reduce/limit the viewing angle of your display.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/privacy-screen-protector-angle-2.jpg" alt="privacy screen protector"></p>
<p>Reduce the number of apps visible on your computer. On a Mac I recommend that you use <a href="https://www.macbartender.com/">Bartender</a>, but there are Windows and *Nix options as well. The point of this application is that it hides all the running apps from the menu bar, so that it looks like this: </p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QsbNjHu.png" alt="a neat menu bar"></p>
<p>rather than this abomination of a menu bar: </p>
<p><img src="https://eshop.macsales.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/1password1280.jpg" alt="an untidy and talkative menue bar"></p>
<p>The reason for hiding this information from shoulder surfers is that it reveals many of your attack vector. If someone knows what applications you are running, they know a lot about you. Developer tools, Automator scripts, and a password manager? You presumably work in IT. Bluetooth enabled, an old version of Outlook and a TorrentClient? The bad guys already have tools for these applications.  </p>
<h2>Mikado security</h2>
<p>The other tip is to not leave your computer laying around. This may seem obvious, but there are times when this is impossible. There will be events where you have super secret stuff on your computer, and must step away for a period of time. For instance in a hotel room while you are away for an hour, or go to a resturant.</p>
<p>If an adversary has physical access to your device, they can do all sort of damage. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2013/12/11/poker_pros_call_shenanigans_over_hotel_malware_infections/">A poker player had this happen to him</a>, where someone broke into his hotel room to install malware on his laptop. This is only one of the cases, but we suspect there are many more based on  the fact that hotel room locks are <a href="https://youtu.be/-Bazy3Ew6D4">ridiculously insecure</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/RX-O4XuCW1Y">easy to bypass</a>.<br>
So to combat this problem, we have devised a nice little trick to help you stay safe if you have to leave your device behind.</p>
<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/5475/9350249910_6aeb4b5d85_h.jpg">
<a href="https://flic.kr/p/ffftxm">Mikado</a> by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/kobakpontorg/">Balazs Koren</a>, on Flickr</p>
<p>Mikado (also known as “pick-up sticks game”) is a game where players drop a bundle of sticks as a loose bunch onto a table top. Each player in turn tries to remove a stick from the pile without disturbing any of the others.</p>
<p>MikadoSecurity is where you spread the sticks over the object that you want to protect. You then take a picture of it, and when you return, you can verify that no one has tampered with your device.
In the event that the sticks are not as you left them, you can escalate the problem. Either to do forensics, or discard the computer if you need to.</p>
<p>This trick relies on the same principles as we rely on for computer security. Prime number factoring, traveling salesman problem and SAT are hard to solve if P != NP, but easy to verify.
An example of this is a sudoku board. It is hard for both humans and computers to solve, but if I hand you a board, it is easy for you to verify if I did it correct. </p>

A big source of angst was the amount of “unknown traffic”, things which matched no patterns. Our sales team wanted this less. Our customers wanted it less. Our competitors had less. Why couldn’t we?</p><p>I used to answer this question as follows. “You know, I can put in one bad pattern, that mis-matches, a false positive. The amount of unknown will go down. Will that make it better? I can make 0% unknown right now.”. Interestingly, some would agree with the statement “sure, lets do that”. Some would say “don’t be ridiculous, I want 100% known, and 0% incorrect.”. I would answer the last question as “what if you made your own proprietary protocol, the license-plate protocol. You, and only you use it. The data in the stream is ciphered from your license plate. Would you expect a pattern for that?”. They would usually say no, I would then point out that 0% unknown as a false goal, the real goal was 0% incorrectly known and as much known as feasible. Still didn’t stop the competitor from using weak false positives to get to higher <code>known</code> amount.</p><p>Yesterday I received an email from the good people at Google. They are launching a new document leakage tool. It scans your shared documents for sensitive things (emails, medical, that sort of thing). Mine is below. Its alarming. 7% of my shared files contain sensitive information!

<p>Corrections added to the Creator/Type code section thanks to user "Somebody" on Hacker News</p>

<p>Suppose you double-click on a file on your computer. You're doing this so you can open the file and work with it. But does your operating system know what that means? How does it know <em>what</em> to open the file <em>in</em>? Let's look at some solutions that have been proposed over the years to solving this issue.</p>
<p>(fun fact: this originally started as a touchup of <a href="https://invisibleup.com/articles/2/">one of my oldest articles</a> before just kinda becoming this whole <em>thing</em>, so expect a bit of retreading.)</p>
<h2>Nothing</h2>
<p><img alt="IBM 709 in use" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/34/IBM709.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>Used in</strong>: Early mainframes such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_704">IBM 704</a>, etc.</p>
<p>(Image credit: <a href="https://www.computer-history.info/Page4.dir/pages/IBM.704.dir/">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a>)</p>
<p>What's a "file", anyways? It's a sequence of bytes on a disk, possibly floppy. Or a tape. (Cassette or paper, your choice.) Or on stacks of cards with holes in them. Or toggled in by hand on a front panel.</p>
<p>File types weren't relevant because <em>files</em> weren't really a thing. In the mainframe era, you typically 
1. loaded a program on to your computer from punch cards or a tape
2. fed input into that program either from a teletype terminal or from a different tape/card deck
3. received output from the teletype, a line printer, or yet another tape/card deck</p>
<p>Computers weren't complicated enough where there was any confusion as to what a file on a certain medium <em>was</em>, simply because there was so little to work with. If you had a stack of punchcards, that was your "file". Hope you labeled the box you put it in!</p>
<p>Tapes are more interesting, because they hold substantially more data. (A whopping 5.76 megabytes, stored on 3/4 of a kilometer of magentic tape. How exciting!) That said, storing more than one file on a tape was a strange task. Operating systems weren't really a <em>thing</em> yet. The best that existed were programming languages such as FORTRAN or COBOL that had statements for hardware tasks such as reading from or writing to a tape or punch card. For example, <a href="http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Fortran/102649787.05.01.acc.pdf">here's the manual for FORTRAN for the IBM 704.</a> We have several commands such as <code>READ</code> (from the punch card reader), <code>READ TAPE</code>, <code>PUNCH</code> (new cards), <code>PRINT</code> (to the printer), etc.</p>
<p>On the IBM tape units of the time (ex: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_727">IBM 727</a>), tapes were separated into <em>files</em> and <em>records</em>. In FORTRAN, records were created on every <code>WRITE TAPE</code> command, and could be read with <code>READ TAPE</code> later. Records could be overwritten by using the <code>BACKSPACE</code> statement and then writing again. Files were collections of records, and could be created with an <code>END FILE</code> command.</p>
<p>As an aside, later programming languages such as C still share their heritage from this era. This is why we draw text to the screen with <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/"><code>printf</code></a> which long ago would have literally printed to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletype_Model_33">teletype terminal</a>, why we read files using <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/rewind/"><code>rewind</code></a>, <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/fseek/"><code>fseek</code></a>, <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/fread/"><code>fread</code></a>, and <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/fwrite/"><code>fwrite</code></a> as if we were on a tape drive still. Even <a href="http://www.asciitable.com/">ASCII</a>, the encoding most commonly used for the basic Latin alphabet, has code points for file, group, record, and unit separators. (This may also be related to block terminals, something that will be discussed in a future article.)</p>
<p>As mainframes moved onto more advanced batch processing and later interactive time-share operating systems like UNIX, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/360_and_successors">OS/360</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Terminal_System">Michigan Terminal System</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incompatible_Timesharing_System">ITS</a>, etc., they gained more sophisticated methods of dealing with files than raw tape drive access. But then came the microcomputers.</p>
<h2>Type Codes</h2>
<p><img alt="Apple DOS file listing" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/34/appledos.gif"></p>
<p><strong>Used in</strong>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_DOS">Apple DOS for Apple II</a> (1978-1980), <a href="https://www.hpmuseum.org/hp28c.htm">HP-28</a> and <a href="https://www.hpmuseum.org/hp48s.htm">HP-48</a> series, etc.</p>
<p>We have floppy disks now. They can store a lot of files, rename them, delete them, etc. without too much issue. There's this neat computer called the Apple II that just came out. It uses these new-fangled disks, so it needs to figure out how to store files on it.</p>
<p>The way that Apple DOS (the Apple II's disk operating system for most of it's life) stored files is somewhat interesting. Each file has a name (up to 30 characters) and also a <em>type code</em>. 8 of them were defined but only 4 of them mattered:</p>
<ul>
<li>I (Integer BASIC program)</li>
<li>A (Applesoft BASIC program)</li>
<li>B (Binary files; either assembled programs or data)</li>
<li>T (ASCII text files)</li>
</ul>
<p>Apple DOS had some specific commands that interacted with these types. For instance, the <code>RUN</code> command worked on both Interger BASIC and Applesoft BASIC programs, and chose which one to use. <code>BRUN</code>, <em>binary run</em>, only worked on binary files. <code>OPEN</code>, <code>READ</code>, <code>WRITE</code>, and <code>CLOSE</code> all worked only on ASCII text files.</p>
<p><strong>The types more served as a way to help the operating system more so than you.</strong> This is especially evident in the late 80's and early 90's HP calculators such as the HP-28c and the HP-48GX. These calculators didn't have disks, but they did have persistent memory that could store objects into folders much like a computer.</p>
<p>These calculators used Reverse Polish Notation. Essentially, you do math by placing objects on the stack and then executing commands, which take things from the stack and put a new thing on. An <em>object</em> in RPN is something you placed on the stack. The HP-48's Advanced User's Reference Manual lists 32 distinct types, including real numbers, complex numbers, character strings, arrays, lists, variable names, executable programs, graphics objects, directories, etc. A <em>command</em> could be, say, <code>ADD</code> or some fancy plotting calculus stuff. Whatever they were, they needed to know what types they were dealing with so that they could either reject the input or properly work with it.</p>
<p>Like the Apple II, just having an integer for a type is perfectly okay because the types don't serve the user. They're just there so the operating system knows what a given chunk of bytes on the stack <em>is</em>. There are a few reserved spots for custom types, but for the most parts new types aren't expected to ever be added, nor should they be.</p>
<h3>File Extensions</h3>
<p><img alt="CP/M disk listing as seen on an Amstrad CPC" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/34/cpm.gif"></p>
<p><strong>Used in</strong>: AMSDOS (Amstrad CPC), CP/M, MS-DOS, etc.</p>
<p>Microcomputers really started to gain in popularity with the likes of the ZX Spectrum, the Amstrad CPC and the Commodore 64 among others. These were fairly cheap and simple computers. When first launched, these came with nothing but cassette tape inputs, as disks were too expensive.</p>
<p>On these computers, you'd attach a cassette player using a standard AUX cord (although some, like the CPC, had a cassette player built in), and the computer would instruct you when to start and stop the tape. These cassette players usually came with a little counter that rolled up as the tape progressed, to help you tell where the tape was. When you insert a tape, you reset the counter to zero. When you want to <em>make</em> a file, you'd write down what the counter read, then save the file. To <em>load a specific file</em>, you'd seek the tape until you're at the location you've written down, then start reading.</p>
<p>More advanced computers such as the Amstrad CPC instead saved <a href="http://www.cpcwiki.eu/index.php/AMSDOS_Header">a header</a> with each file containing, among other things, a file name and extension. If asked for a specific file it could just read the tape until it found it. Later these computers gained disk drives, and any ad-hoc tape fiddling was replaced with a proper file system such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table">FAT</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_File_System">MFS</a> that stored <em>where</em> a file was on a given disk and <em>what is was called</em>.</p>
<p>File codes are limited. It is nigh-on impossible to add more ones. What you have is what you got. So... what if we just made the codes out of letters? A couple of them? And they could be anything. Then programmers could come up with whatever file extensions they want and that's okay.</p>
<p>Suppose, in MS-DOS, you have a file named <code>REPORT.TXT</code>. <code>REPORT</code> is the file name, <code>TXT</code> is the extension. <strong>File extensions give an easy, consistent indicator of what a file contains.</strong> A <code>TXT</code> file contains text, a <code>BMP</code> file is a bitmap, etc. </p>
<p>Some file extensions, like <code>EXE</code>, <code>BAT</code>, <code>SYS</code> and <code>COM</code> had special meaning much in the same way that the Apple DOS codes had special meanings, but other than that they're just there to help the user. <strong>The user had to manually choose which program to use.</strong> This allowed for the user to choose what view or editor to use depending on what would be the most helpful. Unfortunately, there were no default programs. If the user didn't know which program, say, a <code>VIZ</code> file is for, they're out of luck. Is it a visualization? Some manga thing? The digital manifestation of a cute internet ghost who's staying up way too late geeking out about old computers? <em>The world may never know...</em></p>
<h3>Creator Codes</h3>
<p><strong>Used in:</strong> Classic Mac OS</p>
<p><img alt="File properties dialog on Classic Mac OS" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/34/macinfo.gif"></p>
<p>Let's hop on over to the Macintosh for a quick second. It was a newfangled thing in 1984, and it had the opportunity to reinvent the wheel and break compatibility with CP/M and mainframe traditions. And so it did.</p>
<p>The original 128K Macintosh used 400K floppy disks, a not-completely-terrible amount of space for the time. It used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_File_System">MFS</a>, which didn't support directories but <em>did</em> support files. It was also completely graphically driven. The Finder was supposed to be the primary way of interacting with files, and the <code>File &gt; Open</code> command could launch the program that made the file. How'd it do that?</p>
<p><strong>Instead of file extensions, the Macintosh used type and creator codes</strong>. These were 4-byte identifiers, much like file extensions, but there were two of them each with a different meaning. The type code was mean to represent the format the data was stored in, used to filter files in the Finder's "Open" dialog. The creator code was meant to indicate the application that created the file, and used by the Finder to choose which specific application to launch. Now, these weren't normally visible to the user. They just saw the file name and a icon for that type.</p>
<p>To do that, the system kept a database of codes and their associated icons and programs. When ran for the first time or moved from disk to disk, <strong>the Finder would read the program data and register in a database what creator codes and file types it supported.</strong> The Finder would then save this information on the disk containing the application. Later, <strong>when the user opened a file, the OS would check its type and creator code against its stored list to determine which application to use.</strong> This worked pretty well.</p>

      <p>All is quiet at Greta Thunberg's home on Kungsholmen in Stockholm. On this day one year ago she was at sea, on a catamaran in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Now she has just come home from school. Labrador Roxy is asleep on the couch, and Moses, the golden retriever, has crashed out on the floor. A thousand-piece jigsaw puzzle is spread out over the kitchen table on which Greta lays edge pieces while waiting for Sir David to appear on the computer monitor.</p>
        
    
  
    

        
    
  
    

      <p><strong>This fall, she is the main character</strong> in Nathan Grossman's feature film Greta. He has recently released the film and the book A Life on our Planet.</p>
      <p>In the introduction to the film, Sir David says:</p>
      <p>”The natural world is disappearing. The evidence is all around us, it is happened in my lifetime. I have seen it with my own eyes.”</p>
      <p>The story starts in 1937, the year he turned 11.</p>
      <p>Then: Wilderness on 66 percent of the Earth, a carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere of 280 ppm.</p>
      <p>And now? Wilderness on 35 percent of the Earth, a carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere of 415 ppm.</p>
      <p>Just like climate change and the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/11/covid-19-pandemics-nature-scientists/">ongoing pandemic</a>, the loss of biodiversity is part of a major sustainability crisis caused by humans.</p>

      <p><strong>The computer pings</strong>, and Gretas kitchen is filled with a familiar voice coming from the speakers. A voice usually accompanied by pictures of vast savannas, colorful coral reefs and mighty animals cheerfully says:</p>
      <p>”Hello, Greta!”</p>
        
    
  
    

        
    
  
    

      <p>DN's Head of Culture Björn Wiman leads the conversation by link from home.</p>
      <p><strong>Björn Wiman: ”Sir David, how is life for you during the pandemic?”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>David Attenborough:</strong> ”Well, it is not so bad. I am lucky to have a garden. It is not a big garden, but it is a garden, and it has a pond. I get food delivered once a week. And I have a lot to do: I can write here and I record, doing my voiceovers while watching the programs on a screen. So I have been pretty active... I have not actually left the house in eight and a half months, which is extraordinary. But I cannot complain.”</p>
      <p><strong>”Greta, I know that films and documentaries like the ones Sir David has made were what got you interested in this subject from the start.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Greta Thunberg:</strong> ”Yes, that is right. It was by watching documentaries and films that I was introduced to the climate crisis and the environmental crisis. That is how I learned and linked the facts to start with. It was a big eye-opener for me.”</p>

      <p><strong>”This conversation is about two parts of the same major crisis: Climate change and the mass extinction of other species on Earth. My impression is that the climate crisis sometimes takes up a disproportionate amount of space and that too little attention is focused on the interaction between these two crises. Do you agree?”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>GT:</strong> ”These crises are interconnected. We cannot communicate one crisis without communicating the other. Unfortunately, the media today works in such a way that we want simple and click-friendly headlines. That can make it difficult to explain complex issues, and this is a very complicated issue. We need to connect the information: This is not one crisis, it is not two or three separate crises. This is a symptom of a much bigger issue.”</p>

      <p><strong>”Do you think, Greta, that there is too much focus on the ”nature side” of this issue – and too little on the consequences for human civilization and the future of humanity?”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>GT:</strong> ”No, I do not think there is too much focus on nature. I think there is too little focus on nature.”</p>
      <p><strong>DA:</strong> ”Yes, that is right.”</p>
      <p><strong>GT:</strong> ”There is too little focus on all aspects of this crisis.”</p>
        
  
  

      <p><strong>”Does that also apply to the ”solution side” of this problem? You sometimes hear ‘the solution can be found in new technological systems’ or ‘the solution is that we change our way of life’.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>DA:</strong> ”There is not one single solution. There are a number of different solutions because there are a lot of problems. Fishing has a set of problems, carbon dioxide emissions have different problems, the way we treat agricultural land. The fuel and energy industries have their own challenges. So there is not just one miraculous action that allows us to say, ‘Right, bingo, there we have it! We have resolved the issue.’ It is not like that! There are millions of issues.”</p>
      <p><strong>GT:</strong> ”Exactly. Sometimes it feels like we are wasting the little time we have now by arguing about what solution is best. ‘We shouldn not be doing this because this is better.’ As if we had a choice! As if we can decide for ourselves what we need to do, and as if there is one magical solution that will fix everything. We need to get away from that narrative, we need to leave that idea behind us.”</p>
      <p><strong>DA:</strong> ”Yes, I agree. And at the end of the day, you know, it is a big world. The only thing we can do – what you, Greta, are particularly good at – is to ensure that people around the world see what the problem is. We have to be persistent, and we have to make sure there is a large democratic multitude of voices saying 'do something, do something, do something'. We have to keep that choir alive, or those with power will not react. But even when they do react, it is extremely difficult to reach agreement on how we should treat the oceans or the atmosphere.”</p>
      <p><strong>GT:</strong> ”Yes. For a crisis as complex as this one, which we do not fully understand – for there will always be things we are unaware of – we must bring together all the experts. We have to deal with the crisis as a crisis and work together from there. We cannot expect to have all the answers delivered to us, for someone to say, ‘This is what we need to do. This is going to solve the problem.’ We have to find the answers along the way.”</p>

      <p><strong>DA:</strong> ”Yes. And we cannot expect it to happen overnight, or in a year, or even in a decade. That we are going to solve all the problems. But there have been major changes already... I remember that ten years ago it was considered strange to invest in wind power and solar panels. But it actually happened! And veganism – you are a vegan, Greta – I mean: It has happened! So changes are happening, they are not sufficient, and they are not dramatic enough, but... We all move in our own circles, so it is hard to generalize. But in my circles I meet far more people who understand the problems now, far more people who do what they can in their own lives.”</p>

<p><strong>Monopoly Technology Platforms are Colonizing Education</strong></p>
<p><strong>By Larry Kuehn</strong></p>
<p>The exposés of abuse by social media corporations like Google and Facebook have finally brought attention to the dangers of monopolies over our communications. The way these monopolies have been colonizing public education has, however, gone almost unnoticed. This is rampant privatization sneaking in as essential to “21<sup>st</sup> Century learning.”</p>
<p>The top five global capital corporations are technology platforms—Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook. Platforms are a host for a variety of services and uses. All of the big five platform corporations have become too large in a short period of time to have any significant competition outside of this group. They compete against one another, adding services to secure their monopoly by offering users everything they do online.</p>
<p>If a new service is developed that seems to be gaining users, or that competes with an element of their platform, it is purchased and integrated into the platform—avoiding new competitors. Alternatively, they use their massive resources to develop a comparable app and push the potential competitor aside.</p>
<p>Snicek, in <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Platform+Capitalism-p-9781509504862"><em>Platform Capitalism</em></a>, points out that the development of these monopolies “introduces new tendencies within capitalism that pose significant challenges to a post-capitalist future.” Building public cooperative platforms becomes an impossible dream.</p>
<p>No surprise—these platforms have moved to colonize education. Public education represents a big chunk of potential revenue. Just as importantly, schools are where one can find most of the future potential consumers and users of the platform services.</p>
<p>Colonization is a process where a significant force moves into an area and dominates. It takes over not only the production and resources, but imposes—often by stealth and power—the processes and approaches and even values of the social and cultural environment. And, dominate is what the monopoly platforms are on track to do in public education.</p>
<p><img src="http://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Suite-For-Education-400x200.png" alt="" width="262" height="131" srcset="https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Suite-For-Education-400x200.png 400w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Suite-For-Education-768x384.png 768w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Suite-For-Education.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 262px) 100vw, 262px">The most successful colonizer has been Google. A recent report indicates that Google’s <em>G-Suite for Education</em> is being used by half the teachers and students in the U.S. Canada is fast approaching the same level of use. It includes a range of free software tools that can be used by students and teachers—word processing, presentations, spread sheets and the like. G-Suite incorporates “Classroom,” an integrated learning management system that keeps track of grades, attendance and more. And, of course, YouTube is linked to student use.</p>
<p>New elements are added frequently. “Google Sites” is promoted for student e-portfolios, because “every student should publish for the world.” Google acquired Workbench, integrated with Google Classroom to give “lessons connected to a variety of ‘maker’ activities focused on STEM.” It is part of Google’s plan to “help schools and educators address their universal needs around education content.”</p>
<p>Google, rather than democratic public institutions, therefore shapes what is on offer. Google’s position as colonizer is strengthened by the hardware increasingly used in schools—the Google Chromebook. <img src="http://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CB_canada.max-1000x1000-400x222.png" alt="" width="346" height="192" srcset="https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CB_canada.max-1000x1000-400x222.png 400w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CB_canada.max-1000x1000-768x425.png 768w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CB_canada.max-1000x1000.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px">It is less expensive than other computers because much of what it needs to operate is supplied by Google in the cloud—operating software, applications and memory. No need to build those into the computer.&nbsp; According to market reports, Chromebooks make up the majority of all computers sold to schools in the U.S. and are marketed globally.</p>
<p>However, one must have a gmail account to use these Google tools—so if a parent wants to protect the privacy of their child and refuses a gmail account that kid is left out while the rest of the class works away on their Chromebook and other Google tools. (See <a href="http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/4497822/GAFE-Information-Letter-and-Consent-Form-page2.pdf">here</a> the kind of consent form parents are asked to sign, giving Google access to acquire and store student information outside of Canada.)</p>
<p><img src="http://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2018-12-31-at-4.20.52-PM-400x70.png" alt="" width="657" height="115" srcset="https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2018-12-31-at-4.20.52-PM-400x70.png 400w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2018-12-31-at-4.20.52-PM-768x135.png 768w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2018-12-31-at-4.20.52-PM-1024x180.png 1024w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2018-12-31-at-4.20.52-PM.png 1238w" sizes="(max-width: 657px) 100vw, 657px"></p>
<p>Google has even taken up teaching “internet safety,” with a program aimed at reaching 5 million students. Its core is a game for students in Grades three to six to teach them to avoid “schemers, hackers and other bad actors.” However, as critics point out, it doesn’t talk about privacy concerns when users’ personal information and actions are tracked online. Google conveniently ignores its role as a “bad actor.”</p>
<p>A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1474904116654917">Swedish study </a>of Google’s strategy concluded that “By making an implicit demarcation between two concepts (your) ‘data’ and (collected) ‘information’ Google can disguise the presence of a business model for online marketing and, at the same time, simulate the practices and ethics of a free public service institution.”</p>
<p>In “<a href="http://2017trends.hackeducation.com/data.html">The Weaponization of Education Data</a>,” Audrey Watters points out “the risk isn’t only hacking.&nbsp; It’s amassing data in the first place. It’s profiling. It’s tracking. It’s surveilling.”</p>
<p>Google isn’t alone in the business of colonizing education and student data—just the most successful so far. One competitor is Microsoft 365 Education, with a promise of “empowering every student on the planet to achieve more” and that it will “unlock limitless learning.”</p>
<p>It’s not an accident that it is “Microsoft 365” that is being pushed. It offers a cloud-based software and cloud storage for your work. It is the new business model for Microsoft: they don’t sell you software, you rent it—and you keep paying for it. And your work isn’t saved on your own computer, so you have to keep up your subscription. Like Google, they are hoping that students will keep using their tools when they finish being students.</p>
<p>Microsoft is imitating much of what Google offers, but by charging for the service rather than trading it for data. It offers apps, educator training and STEM lessons “to enrich science, technology, engineering and math classes.” They offer “budget friendly” Windows 10 devices with licences for Microsoft 365 Education.</p>
<p>The other major tech corporations have programs as well. Apple, for example, was the first into education with the Apple IIe and the “Apple Classroom of Tomorrow” way back in the 1980s. More recently it depended on the ease of use of the iPad, despite its cost, to sell classroom sets along with Pearson curriculum in an <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/05/los-angeles-edtech/">ill-fated project with Los Angeles schools</a>.</p>
<p>Venture capitalists are hoping to find the magic app that will make a fortune. The potential market is indicated by expenditure of hundreds of millions each year on developing new products. The “winners” are likely to be bought up by one of the major corporations—or find their product idea taken by the monopolies.</p>
<p>Not enough attention is paid by education authorities or researchers to the shaping and distortion of education that is possible—even likely—by this colonization of education by technology monopolies.</p>

<p>I used <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb</a> for years in Russia, Germany, and the United States. All the time, the experience was great. At some point, I read a <a href="https://amzn.to/3o9JywH">book about Airbnb</a> to understand the company better.</p>

<p>For Thanksgiving week (November 21-29), five of my friends and I rented a house in Las Vegas.</p>

<p>The total price for nine days: <strong>$2543</strong>.</p>

<p>Previously people went to Vegas to spend time in casinos or walk on The Strip. This year, <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">the pandemic</a> made it impossible.</p>

<p>It was not a problem for us. We did not plan to socialize; we were going rock climbing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105731932/red-rock">Red Rocks</a>, located next to Vegas, is an excellent place for traditional, sport, bouldering, multi-pitch climbing.</p>

<p>The plan was for some people to take days off and climb every day, and for others to work three days remotely and join the gang during the rest.</p>

<h2 id="incident">Incident</h2>

<p>We moved in on Saturday night. The next morning, excited, we woke up at 6am, had breakfast, verified that we closed back and front doors and at 7am drove to the Red Rocks Park.</p>

<p>We had a fantastic day of climbing, but after the sunset, we went home to realize that the window in one of the rooms was open and some of our belongings had disappeared.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Three work Macbook Pro (I do not include the price, they are replaced by our employees for free)</li>
  <li>One personal <a href="https://amzn.to/33uWB3F">Macbook Pro</a> ($1550)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/2JCZWqE">Oculus Quest 2</a>. I just bought it. Really cool. Wanted to share the experience. ($399)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/2VnyrUt">GoPro Hero 6</a> ($194)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/36oMMGz">Lenovo Tab 4, 10.1in Android Tablet</a> ($190)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3lms9is">Sony WH1000XM3 Noise Cancelling Headphones</a> ($348)</li>

</ul>

<p>I called the host, told her about the situation. She shared a set of images from the cameras and the next day sent the whole video.</p>

  </p>

<p>We believe this is what happened:</p>

<p>At 8:55am, two hours after we left, someone</p>
<ol>
  <li>Openly came to the front door.</li>
  <li>Knocked in the door.</li>
  <li>Waved Lexus car keys at the camera. (We do not have Lexus.)</li>
  <li>Ringed the bell.</li>
  <li>Waited to verify that no one was at home.</li>
  <li>Got to the back of the house.</li>
  <li>Put gloves and balaclava on.</li>
  <li>Checked if the back door was open. It was not.</li>
  <li>Checked if he can open the window. And it was possible.
10 Moved the pool chair below the window.</li>
  <li>Got into the house.</li>
</ol>

<p>We called the police, and in two hours an officer came. He was polite and professional. He got the list of the stolen items, our version of the incident in the written form, and left.</p>

<p>I was curious, how did the burglar open the window? I checked, and the answer was simple: <strong>the lock on the window was not operational.</strong> No need to break anything, anyone can open the window from the outside!</p>

<p>If the weather was warmer, we would probably try to open windows the night we came. In that case we would discover the problem, but the night was cold and we did not touch the windows.</p>

<p>Till this moment, I was chill. Bad things happen. Burglars get into houses, and no one could be protected from it. We were safe in this incident, and from the money perspective, our loss was not huge.</p>

<p>But the fact that the lock on that window was not functioning is an issue (few more windows had the same problem). If the front door lock was broken it would be worse but even windows that could not be locked are sketchy.</p>

<p>In general, I prefer to blame myself for bad things that happen to me. This time I cannot figure out what was my fault. For sure, we could check all the locks in the house, but it is an overkill.</p>

<p>I am ok with making mistakes and paying for them. But this time, we paid for the host’s errors and Airbnb’s as a company.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Host</strong>: the house was not ready for hosting the guests.</li>
  <li><strong>Airbnb</strong>: limitations of the onboarding policy. I believe there is a list of things that the house owner needs to mark to become a host, and either functioning window locks are not on the list, or it is not enforced.</li>
</ul>

<p>After we told the host about our discovery, she sent a person to lock all the windows completely. From now on, no one would be able to open them from inside or outside.</p>



<p>I wanted to reach out to Airbnb, tell them about the situation, and ask about the next steps.</p>

<p>Safety comes first. Hence I assumed that even if you are under stress and your brain is not functioning well, it is obvious how to contact the support team.</p>

<p>To my surprise, it is not the case.</p>

<p>I spent some time on the Airbnb website but could not figure out which phone number I should call.</p>

<p><strong>Message to AirBnb</strong>: It would be great if you simplify the design of the support page. When we talk about safety, it should be about efficiency and not about the visual appeal or cuteness level.</p>

<p>I would like it to be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I open the Airbnb website =&gt; I see an obvious button/link to the support page.</li>
  <li>I open the support page =&gt; I see an obvious button/link to the hotline phone number.</li>
</ul>

<p>I posted the tweet about the incident and tagged Airbnb and Las Vegas police in it.</p>

<blockquote>— Vladimir Iglovikov (@viglovikov) <a href="https://twitter.com/viglovikov/status/1330741490759266304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>A miracle happened. Airbnb contacted me and asked for my email to identify the account and to get more details.</p>

<p>My guess is that the Marketing team at Airbnb has alarms that trigger when someone mentions the company on social media.</p>

<p>Finally, after two hours, we got into the conversation about the incident, but the path to get there was not obvious at all.</p>

<p>Imagine how many people got into trouble in similar situations and did not leverage this communication channel?</p>

<p>I got an email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My name is XXX, from the Airbnb claims team.</p>

  <p>I am contacting you regarding the incident that occurred during your reservation with YYY.</p>

  <p>As my colleague informed you in the previous email, we are only able to offer up to $500 for any stolen property. In order to proceed with this refund, I will need the following:</p>

  <p>*Original purchase invoice for the stolen items.</p>

  <p>This is requested as “proof of ownership”, if you don’t have the original purchase invoice, a picture of you where the item can be seen will also be accepted as proof of ownership.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All this story is not about money. But getting compensated for the host’s and Airbnb’s mistake with cash or AirBnB credits would be nice. It does not address the issue with window locks but sweetens the situation.</p>

<p>We interpreted the email as: “We will compensate up to $500 per stolen item”. Using the numbers from the invoices, it summed to $2600.</p>

<p>We collected invoices, sent them to Airbnb, and got the reply with words: “After additional review, I’m happy to report that we have just released a payout in the amount of $500 to your Airbnb account. You can confirm in your Airbnb Transaction History.”</p>

<p>The guess about up to $500 per item was overly optimistic.</p>

<p>After the end of the stay, I got a message from the host:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hi Vladimir,</p>

  <p>Thank you again for choosing our home for your vacation stay.</p>

  <p>I hope the home met (and even surpassed) your expectations. It was a sincere pleasure hosting you, and I really hope to host you again in the near future. I would be truly grateful for a 5 star review of your stay when you have a spare moment and I would definitely do the same for you.</p>

  <p>Also, please in the private comments if there is something, the home or myself can approve of please let me know.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand that this is a standard template, but under the circumstances, it sounds strange and
does not fit the story and overall experience.</p>

<p>I did not plan to share the actual address of the property. The harm to the renting business could be material. But after this text, I changed my mind. It does not look like the host plans to revise the house and look for things that can and should be fixed. For example, the front door lock is barely working. The door could be open with a good push.</p>



<p>We had a great vacation. The weather was good, and the red rocks are remarkable. We had a lot of fun and plan to come back sometime soon.</p>

<p>Work laptops were replaced. We accepted the loss of personal items.</p>

<p>The Airbnb experience was not as smooth as we expected. Our things got stolen, and even on the other days, we did not feel comfortable leaving belongings in the house.</p>

<p>The host was responsive, but it is not enough. Communicating with guests and collecting money should not be the only responsibility. It is worth inspecting the house and fixing things that do not work as expected proactively, without waiting till the universe gives you feedback.</p>

<p>Overall, I believe that staying at AirBnB is safe, and such incidents are the exception rather than the rule, but, for sure, Airbnb has some work to do to improve communication and increase the guests’ safety. The compensation of $500 for all the stolen items does not look fair either.</p>

<p>I would like to end the story with some action items like: “<strong>Next time, when I rent a place, I will do XXX</strong>.” Nothing reasonable comes to my mind.</p>

<p>When I sit in front of the computer in San Francisco, the only thing that comes to my mind is to build a Face Recognition system and check the burglar’s face in it. Something similar to Clearview. Machine Learning is my expertise; creating such a system is straightforward but will take some time. Tempting. Thinking about it.</p>

<p>What would be your action item after such an experience?</p>

            		<p>Often changes in the business side implies large changes in the corresponding code of the app to support it. Like changing business models from one-time purchase to subscription. Or that time when the business asked to provide that exclusive holiday app icon promotion for $1.99. All of these makes unit testing and integration testing of the app more challenging since in-app purchase code often interact heavily with the feature switches of corresponding products.</p>
<p>Won’t it be great if your in-app purchase code can keep working flawlessly as faced by business challenges?</p>
<p>How about having the ability to offer “<a href="https://cutecoder.org/business/time-limited-app-purchase/">exclusive limited-time availability</a>” special features as if they were physical products?</p>
<p>How to offer fully-functional <a href="https://cutecoder.org/business/free-trial-app-store/">time-limited trials</a> in Apple’s App Stores?</p>

<p>In Segmentâ€™s early days, we hit countless problems as a founding team. And at the time, I thought those problems were unique to our own special snowflake of a founding journey. I chalked it up to us being new grads and first-time founders.</p><p>But as I've worked with more and more startups, I've realized just how wrong I was.</p><p>Over the past five years, I've made about 25 different seed-stage investments. In doing so, it's taught me a <em>LOT</em> about the common errors that startup founders make. Even across different industries and levels of experience, I see founders hitting the exact same set of problems we encountered in the early days of Segment!</p><p>This post shares a handful of the top lessons that benefit todayâ€™s early stage founders. Itâ€™s a list of the things I wish weâ€™d figured out earlier at Segment. [1]</p><p>This sounds incredibly boring... but the #1 mistake I see startups making is that they donâ€™t set goals. If you take one thing from this post, it's that you should set goals for where you want to be.</p><p>For the longest time at Segment, we didn't have goals. We moved ahead in various (often random) directions, and we would launch features consistently... but we never really set goals at all.</p><p>As we grew the company, we started to lose momentum. Teams were spending time on a bunch of stuff that frankly just didn't really matter to the overall business.</p><p>It wasn't until we hired our VP Eng, Tido, that we finally started setting focused and audacious product goals. Just by verbalizing where we wanted to go and then grading our results, our velocity improved by an order of magnitude.</p><p>I don't care if you call them OKRs, sprints, or something else entirely. Just set a deadline when you want to have something done and a metric you want to move or some other concrete result.</p><p>When early stage founders do attempt to set goals, I often see them agonize over what specific goals to choose. In practice, a "pretty good goal" is way better than "no goals at all". Perfect is the enemy of good.</p><p>If you don't yet have product-market fit, your goal should probably be getting your first 3-5 customers using the product. If you've hit the level where you now have dozens of users, your goal should be growing by an order of magnitude. It's better to get in the habit of setting and driving towards goals rather than being too worried about their exact semantics. Worst case, you just pick a better goal later.</p><p>A great set of goals answers the question: <em><strong>"what would have to be true in order for us to feel good about our progress at the end of the month?"</strong></em><em> [2]</em></p><p>If each teammate can independently answer "what are our goals for the month?" in the same way, you'll know you've succeeded. If youâ€™re looking for prior art, read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Measure-What-Matters-Google-Foundation/dp/0525536221">Measure What Matters</a>. </p><p>If you strictly focus on making things true by a certain date, you are bound to make at least some progress towards your end result. </p><p>At the end of the day, every billion-dollar startup is really just the sum of many small deltas.</p><p>Let's get one thing straight: your investors won't know everything. But investors won't know <em>anything</em> if you don't keep them updated on how things are going.</p><p>For the longest time, we were fearful of our Segment investors, to the point that we wouldn't bother sending them emails unless they asked about us. I can say now with confidence that this was 100% the wrong approach.</p><p>We worried that investors would think that we were screwing up (true) and failing (true as well!). And while that might be the case, a founder-friendly investor won't think that way. Investors, especially angels, invested because they believe in <em>you</em>. If I didn't think a team would go somewhere, I wouldn't put money in.</p><p>With each investor, <strong>include the goals you're working towards, as well as the asks for them</strong>. I think monthly is about the right cadence for this in the early days, moving to quarterly around Series A/B time when you start partnering more with a few board members.</p><p>Simply writing the updates should clarify your own thinking tremendously. If it takes you more than 1-2h to put together an update on the most important things happening at the company, it's probably a sign that you should be doing more thinking about the big picture.</p><p>When asking for help, the things that our investors have been able to help us with evolved quite a bit over time. But here's a good rule of thumb for what to ask for:</p><ul><li><p><u>Seed/Pre-seed</u>: user-testing, intros to beta users, hiring</p></li><li><p><u>Series A</u>: hiring, early customers, go-to-market</p></li><li><p><u>Series B/C+</u>: comparables at other companies, senior/exec hires, specific expertise around things like management, infrastructure, systems, etc.</p></li></ul><p>Not all investors will be able to help with everything. But at the very least, sending them information will help you be top of mind. I've lost track of how many times a moment of serendipity where I'm catching up with an old friend has led to a meaningful conversation for a company I've invested in.</p><p>As an extra bonus, the strongest startups send these updates to everyone on their team. It's amazing how much putting the goals in writing helps everyone stay on the same page about what's most important.</p><p>One other note here: take pictures. I now wish we had far more pictures of Segment at every stage of the company. They help turn investor updates into cherished memories.</p><p>Okay, this lesson is taken directly from the YC playbook. And YET, I see so many founders (including YC founders) fail to launch their product. </p><p>If no one notices your launch... just ignore it and then launch again. If you're doing things right, you'll never run out of stuff to launch! [3]</p><p>Why is launching so important? Let me share a personal story...</p><p>We spent about 1.5 years building different iterations of analytics tools. For every iteration, we had a waitlist that users could sign up to use. We personally reached out to the users who we thought were the best fits, and then tried to set up time to use the product. </p><p>The result? Nobody cared. We had no users. We never launched. </p><p>When we finally launched Segment in it's current incarnation, we threw out that approach entirely. We put up a self-service flow, and let anyone who wanted to sign up for it.</p><p>That's when something strange happened... we attracted an entirely new set of developers who just were crawling out of the woodwork and excited to use the new product we'd built. They were coming from companies far outside of SV that we'd never heard of.</p><p>It floored me.</p><p><strong>Lesson learned: the people you happen to be talking to now are probably not the people who have the biggest problem in your space. Do everything you can to reach the folks with the biggest problem, and then, reduce any barriers they might encounter.</strong></p><p>I expect a bunch of you reading this post to ignore this advice, just like we did in the early days. It takes a certain confidence to launch something you've built and put it out there for the world to see. Ultimately though, the rewards are worth it. You'll see users coming from communities you've never even heard of.</p><p>Let me tell you a tale of two startups.</p><p><strong>Startup A</strong> is constantly putting up interesting content on their blog. Their founders are sharing product launches, engineering posts, and creatively brainstorming about what it takes to solve problems in their market.</p><p><strong>Startup B</strong> is operating in stealth. You can't find much about them online, but one of the founders reached out with a nice personalized email mentioning their funding by a top-tier VC. </p><p>Suppose you're looking for a job... do you pick Startup A or Startup B? In my experience, A almost always wins. Momentum is a compounding force.</p><p><strong>Unless you are working in a space that heavily depends on IP, you should probably be publishing more content about what you are doing.</strong> This could be open source, it could be a weekly newsletter, it could be a changelog. [4]</p><p>Whatever it is, it's going to help you both hire <em>and</em> attract customers. So much of the internet is merely about consuming, that just by putting ideas out there, youâ€™ll have a leg up on the competition.</p><p>In the early days of Segment, our <a href="https://segment.com/blog/show-hn-to-series-d/">user acquisition was powered by open source projects and blog posts</a>. But I've seen founders have success with Twitter, Substacks, Podcasts and a variety of different channels.</p><p>If you're looking for inspiration, the <a href="https://railway.app/changelog">Railway</a> and <a href="https://linear.app/changelog">Linear</a> changelogs are epic examples. Companies like <a href="https://baremetrics.com/blog/i-sold-baremetrics">Baremetrics</a> and <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/shareholder-update-q2-2020-and-july/">Buffer</a> differentiated themselves by just being open and honest. <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/globe">Stripe</a> and <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/behind-the-feature-the-making-of-the-new-auto-layout/">Figma's blogs</a> not only share what they build, but how they built it.</p><p>There are three big inputs that all startups need to continue growing</p><ol><li><p>product capabilities</p></li><li><p>customers and users</p></li><li><p>hiring</p></li></ol><p>I've put them in roughly the order that most teams encounter them. </p><p>Startups begin with a small product that has a modicum of utility. It starts attracting a handful of customers organically. And as more and more customers start using the product, the founders realize that they need extra help to stay on top of all of those requests.</p><p>Remember though, the real goal here is #2. Itâ€™s not the size of your team, itâ€™s the value youâ€™re able to provide to the world. [5]</p><p>I see hiring a big team before you have product-market fit as a red flag. If the company doesn't yet have a set direction, it's going to be harder to pivot with 10 people than it is with 3.</p><p>But, I've worked with startups who have traction and runway... and just seem to be spinning their wheels under load from existing customers.</p><p>I get it. Hiring isn't the most fun, especially for an introvert. It's a lot of interviewing and feeling like there's a lot of rejection. Rejecting people sucks. Losing candidates sucks. For many of our roles at Segment, we've had to talk with 50-100 different people to make an eventual hire.</p><p><strong>If you have 24 months of runway, and a clear list of things youâ€™d do if you had more copies of yourself: you probably aren't spending time to hire the people you need.</strong></p><p>At Segment, my co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/ivolo">Ilya</a> fulfilled this role. It was back in 2014, we were 12 people at the time, had raised a $10m Series A, and had $1m in revenue.</p><p>Thing…</p></div></div>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Semantic scene understanding is crucial for robust and safe autonomous navigation, particularly so in off-road environments. Recent deep learning advances for 3D semantic segmentation rely heavily on large sets of training data; however, existing autonomy datasets represent urban environments or lack multimodal off-road data. We fill this gap with RELLIS-3D, a multimodal dataset collected in an off-road environment containing annotations for <strong>13,556 LiDAR scans</strong> and <strong>6,235 images</strong>. The data was collected on the Rellis Campus of Texas A\&amp;M University and presents challenges to existing algorithms related to class imbalance and environmental topography. Additionally, we evaluate the current state of the art deep learning semantic segmentation models on this dataset. Experimental results show that RELLIS-3D presents challenges for algorithms designed for segmentation in urban environments. Except for the annotated data, the dataset also provides full-stack sensor data in ROS bag format, including <strong>RGB camera images</strong>, <strong>LiDAR point clouds</strong>, <strong>a pair of stereo images</strong>, <strong>high-precision GPS measurement</strong>, and <strong>IMU data</strong>. This novel dataset provides the resources needed by researchers to develop more advanced algorithms and investigate new research directions to enhance autonomous navigation in off-road environments.</p>

Specifically, sequences from this dataset includes classes such as mud, man-made barriers, and rubble piles. Additionally, this dataset provides a finer-grained class structure for water sources, i.e., puddle and deep water, as these two classes present different traversability scenarios for most robotic platforms. Overall, 20 classes (including void class) are present in the data.</p>

December 5, 2020 | https://blog.streetwriters.co/how-to-write-good-metaphors/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.streetwriters.co/how-to-write-good-metaphors/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Metaphors are everywhere;&nbsp;in literature, visual arts, poetry, and films. Language, in a way, itself&nbsp;is a metaphor. But try to make one on the fly, and you will find out it is not easy. Creating a metaphor requires ingenuity and care. A small mistake can make a metaphor clumsy. So how does one write a good metaphor?&nbsp;Let’s find out.</p><h2>Why Metaphors are Important</h2><p>Metaphors make us understand things better. When feelings are involved or when something happens which has no proper words in our vocabulary, we need something to communicate our experience. Metaphors come in handy in such situations. For example, author F. Scott Fitzgerald wanted to describe good writing. He could simply say that good writing was hard or good writing is very difficult. But he chose to say it like this:</p><p><em>All good writing is swimming underwater and holding your breath.</em></p><p>The metaphor&nbsp;“swimming underwater while holding breath” opens a door for us into the experience of Fitzgerald as a writer. That was a very difficult thing to convey in plain words. A whole paragraph might have not sufficed. But here a metaphor has conveyed the meaning completely in a single sentence. Metaphors help us convey meaning by using similarities in different objects and experiences. They relate things with one another and the result is a new understanding of a certain thing. All good poetry and literature do this to create new meanings. Another example is this beautiful metaphor by Shakespeare:</p><blockquote><p>All the world's a stage,<br>And all the men and women merely players;<br>They have their exits and their entrances;<br>And one man in his time plays many parts.</p><p><em>As You Like It</em>, William Shakespeare</p></blockquote><p>Metaphors help us use all of our senses in reading a sentence. They make the experience of language more immersive. Take this sentence as an example:</p><blockquote><p>Time has not stood still. It has washed over me, washed me away as if I'm nothing more than a woman of sand, left by a careless child too near the water.</p><p><em>The Handmaid's Tale</em>, Margaret Atwood</p></blockquote><p>The writer could simply have said that time has changed me. But the use of sand and water as metaphors has given the whole experience a life of its own. We can hear in our minds the sound of waves when reading the sentence. We can imagine a woman of sand. Therefore, metaphors give a deeper meaning to our words. They can convey meanings for which sometimes whole pages are necessary and sometimes even a book is not enough.</p><blockquote><p>I'm a little pencil in the hand of a writing God.</p><p>Mother Teresa</p></blockquote><p>In this small sentence, Mother Teresa has conveyed the whole of her faith. We can get a glimpse of her intimate relationship with God. We can sense her metaphysical experience. This was not possible without the use of a metaphor.</p><p>Along with that, plain words can be boring for our minds. Our minds hate repetitiveness and mundaneness and loves newness and ingenuity. Metaphors give us this freshness and livens ordinary language. Language becomes more interesting.</p><blockquote><p>She herself is a haunted house. She does not possess herself; her ancestors sometimes come and peer out of the windows of her eyes and that is very frightening.</p><p><em>The Bloody Chamber, </em>Angela Carter</p></blockquote><p>Simply saying that there is an eerie feeling attached to her the writer could have told us about the character but using a metaphor makes it more interesting and memorable. In addition to that, Metaphors add vagueness and abstractedness to our language. This gives readers free rein to make their own interpretations.</p><blockquote><p><em>There's a bluebird in my heart that<br></em><em>wants</em><em> to get out<br></em><em>but</em><em> I'm too tough for him,<br></em><em>I say, stay in there, I'm not going<br></em><em>to</em><em> let anybody see<br></em><em>you</em><em>.</em></p><p><em>Bluebird</em>, Charles Bukowski</p></blockquote><p>Nobody has a clear idea of what the bluebird is in this poem and so people make their interpretations. Metaphors give us the freedom to read works in the context of our own Worldview.</p><h2>How to Write Good Metaphors?</h2><p>First of all, start thinking about the thing or experience you want to express. Concentrate on the idea and think about it deeply. Understand it thoroughly. How do you feel about the whole idea?</p><p>For example, you want to describe the scene of someone waking up for the first time to the sound of the coming train. Lean into the experience of someone peacefully sleeping in a cozy room under blankets in a comfy bed. Now imagine a train passing over with an ear-shattering sound. What will the character feel like? Imagine it. Now can you compare it to something else that is similar in its sudden experience?</p><p>For me, the scene of a car suddenly breaking through the bedroom wall is similar so I would construct my metaphor around that imagery.</p><p><em>He woke up and thought a car had crashed in his bedroom. Everything was moving. His heart was pumping. "Oh! It's the train!" he let out a sigh and shook his head.</em></p><p>Secondly, try using original metaphors in your writing or ones that are rare. Commonly used metaphors are dead in a sense. Some dead metaphors are given here as an example:</p><ul><li>It's raining cats and dogs.</li><li>I'm visiting an old flame.</li><li>He's loose cannon.</li><li>She found herself behind the eight balls.</li><li>He drives me up a wall.</li><li>She saw the light at the end of the tunnel.</li><li>Ticking time bomb</li><li>Tip of the iceberg</li><li>Slippery slope</li><li>Going the extra mile</li><li>Early bird</li><li>Icy personality</li><li>Turning in one's grave</li><li>About to explode (from anger)</li></ul><p>Here are some more complex examples of metaphors. Read them carefully so you can get an idea of how a metaphor works.</p><p><em>1. Books are the mirrors of the soul.</em></p><p>Virginia Woolf describes here the connection between an author and his/her books. Books describe the inner thoughts of the author's mind. That is an experience similar to seeing one's soul. A mirror reflects everything that is in front of it. It does not lie. This small sentence combines these two concepts perfectly to convey a beautiful meaning.</p><p>2. <em>"</em><em>But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun!"</em></p><p>Shakespeare is trying to describe the feeling of love that Romeo had for Juliet. The sun is a classic metaphor used in ancient literature to describe a lover.</p><p>3. <em>The parents looked upon Matilda in particular as nothing more than a scab. A scab is </em><em>something you have to put up with until the time comes when you can pick it off and flick </em><em>it away.</em></p><p>The author here depicts the anger Matilda's parents felt for their child using “a scab on skin”. A person puts up with it because it's painful and messy to remove it before time.</p><p>4. <em>"O Lord, You are our Father, We are the clay, and You, our potter; And all of us are the work of Your hand."</em></p><p>In this verse of the Bible, the feeling of helplessness and the might of the All-Mighty God is described. Helplessness is compared with the inertness of the clay. And the potter's hands are the workings of God.</p><p>5. <em>Alas,</em><em> and yet what are you, my written and painted thoughts! It is not long ago that you were still so many-</em><em>coloured</em><em>, young, and malicious, so full of thorns and hidden spices you made me sneeze and laugh and now? You </em><em>have already taken off your novelty and some of you, I fear, are on the point of becoming truths: they already look so immortal, so pathetically righteous, so boring! And has it ever been otherwise? For what things do we write and paint, we mandarins with </em><em>Chinese brushes, we immortalizers of things which let themselves </em><em>be</em><em> written, what alone are we capable of painting? Alas, only that which is about to wither and is beginning to lose its fragrance! Alas, only storms departing exhausted and feelings grown old and yellow! Alas, only birds strayed and grown weary in flight </em><em>who</em><em> now let themselves be caught in the hand in our hand! We immortalize that which cannot live and fly much longer, weary and mellow things alone! And it is only your afternoon, my written and painted thoughts, for which alone I have the </em><em>colours</em><em>, many </em><em>colours</em><em> perhaps, many many-</em><em>coloured</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>tendernesses</em><em> and fifty yellows and browns and greens and reds: but no one will divine from these how you looked in your morning, you sudden sparks and wonders of my solitude, you my old beloved wicked thoughts!</em></p><p>Here Nietzsche is describing the thoughts in the human mind which are immortal, ever-changing with infinite possibilities, and how impossible it is to define them truly words.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Good metaphors spice up any piece of art, be it a painting or a poem or a novel. Some writers use whole characters as forms of metaphors, others use symbolism. Learning to write a good metaphor can be a difference between a good piece and a great piece.

<p>This question often pops up, when you need a random direction vector to place things in 3D or you want to do a particle simulation.</p>



<p>We recall that a 3D unit-sphere (and hence a direction) is parametrized only by two variables; elevation <span data-display="false">\theta \in [0; \pi]</span> and azimuth <span data-display="false">\varphi \in [0; 2\,\pi]</span> which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system#Coordinate_system_conversions">can be converted to Cartesian coordinates as</a></p>



<p><span data-display="false">\begin{aligned}  x &amp;= \sin\theta \, \cos\varphi \\  y &amp;= \sin\theta \, \sin\varphi \\  z &amp;= \cos\theta \end{aligned} </span></p><p>If one takes the easy way and uniformly samples this parametrization in numpy like</p>



<pre><code>phi = np.random.rand() * 2 * np.pi

<p>While the 2D surface of polar coordinates uniformly sampled (left), we observe a bias of sampling density towards the poles when projecting to the Cartesian coordinates (right).<br>The issue is that the cos mapping of the elevation has an uneven step size in <em>Cartesian</em> space, as you can easily verify: <span data-display="false">cos^{'}(x) = sin(x)</span>.</p>



<p>The solution is to simply sample the elevation in the Cartesian space instead of the spherical space – i.e. sampling <span data-display="false">z \in [-1; 1]</span>. From that we can get back to our elevation as <span data-display="false">\theta = \arccos z</span>:</p>



<pre id="block-6ecb681a-6f13-49b9-8783-cebd81f25d08"><code>z = 1 - np.random.rand() * 2 # convert rand() range 0..1 to -1..1
theta = np.arccos(z)</code></pre>



<p>As desired, this compensates the spherical coordinates such that we end up with uniform sampling in the Cartesian space:</p>

<p>If you want to further restrict the opening angle instead of sampling the full sphere you can also easily extend the above. Here, you must re-map the cos values from <span data-display="false">[1; -1]</span> to <span data-display="false">[0; 2]</span> as</p>

<p>While browsers are constantly being updated because of their financial 
	use in everything from on-line purchases to on-line investing and banking, 
many web servers are not. What is worse it this: many organizations, including

each present a green lock icon.</p>
<h3><a name="openvms"></a>The OpenVMS ecosystem</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Two companies are currently supporting OpenVMS (but this is about to 
	change)<ul>
		<li>In 2014, HP transferred the rights to develop/support OpenVMS to VSI 
		(<a href="https://www.vmssoftware.com/">VMS Software Inc</a>)</li>
		<li>In 2015, HP split into two companies: HP (most desktop products) and 
		HPE (enterprise)</li>
		<li>HPE continued to support OpenVMS software contracts sold to HP customers 
		before 2015 (they also sold/supported VSI products)</li>
		<li>Early in 2019, HPE removed most OpenVMS stuff (documentation as well 
		as software) from their website including CSWS-2.2-1 (<a href="http://neilrieck.net/docs/openvms_notes_apache.html">Compaq Secure Web Services</a>) 
	based upon <span>Apache 2.0.63</span><ul>
			<li>For example, this link:
			<a href="http://h41379.www4.hpe.com/openvms/products/ips/apache/csws.html">http://h41379.www4.hpe.com/openvms/products/ips/apache/csws.html</a> 
		previously provided both software-downloads and product documentation 
		but now diverts you to this common landing page:
			<a href="https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=a00058693en_us">https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=a00058693en_us</a> 
		(in fact, all HPE OpenVMS software links now drop you here)</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>If you have an OpenVMS support contract with HPE, then you will be 
		able to request the latest version of file MOD_SSL (an Apache module for 
		CSWS) which is based upon OpenSSL-1.0L but does not implement TLSv1.3<ul>
			<li>HPE has announced the end of all OpenVMS support by the end of 2020.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Businesses requiring <strong>CSWS/Apache on OpenVMS</strong> should immediately 
	move their support contracts over to VSI where you will have access to a new version of CSWS 
	based upon <span>Apache 2.4.12</span><ul>
			<li><span>caveat:</span> you may be required to update your OS to OpenVMS-8.4-2 so do not wait until the last minute</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>For companies and/or hobbyists financially unable to move to VMS 
	Software Inc., your the only remaining option is to replace CSWS/Apache with WASD HTTPd 
	(the high quality web server from down-under) which is not based upon 
	Apache.<ul>
		<li>WASD already supports TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3</li>
		<li>"I think" support agreements may be available</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>This web-page will document my efforts to replace CSWS/Apache with WASD 
	HTTPd on a sacrificial laboratory system (we employ a lot of CGI including one SOAP-based 
	feed)</li>

<h2><a name="intro2"></a>Introduction to WASD HTTPd</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://wasd.vsm.com.au/">WASD</a> HTTPd - is a very high quality free 
	web 
		server from <a href="http://www.vsm.com.au/">VSM Software

		<li>it runs on all VMS and OpenVMS platforms: <span>VAX, Alpha, and Itanium</span></li>
		<li>it will run on <span>x86-64</span> when VSI finally

		<li>it is NOT based upon Apache</li>
		<li>it is published with all the source code so if you can program

		<li>it can link to its own SSL libraries which already support TLS-1.3, or HP-SSL (based upon 
		OpenSSL-0.9 and lower), or HP-SSL1 (OpenSSL-1.0 and higher)</li>
		<li>excerpt from page-13 of the book <strong>OpenVMS with Apache, OSU, and WASD</strong>
		<p>
				The idea with WASD was to be a really good VMS-only server: Mark Daniel says, "I 
suffered a bit of a VMS cringe when amongst my UNIX colleagues (VMS was perceived 
to be a bit slow and cumbersome), so I have also endeavored to make WASD as fast 
and efficient as I could, avoiding C run-time library and even RMS code layers 
where it was feasible and worth it. I also wanted a similarly tight scripting 
environment and have spent a lot of time honing this aspect"</p>
		</li>
		<li><span>Trivia:</span> <strong>WASD</strong> = "Wide Area 
		Surveillance Division". WASD was previously known as <strong>HFRD</strong> 
		(High Frequency Radar Division) of Australia's Defense, Science and 
		Technology Organization</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<div>
	<p><strong><a id="executive"></a>Executive Summary</strong>:
	</p><ul>
		<li>What an unexpected surprise. WASD HTTPd is the fastest web server I 
		have worked on to date.<br>I am currently supporting web servers on these 
		production platforms...<table>

		WASD on the oldest hardware is able to out-perform Apache on the newest 
		hardware (caveat: I 
		haven't done any full-load stress tests just yet)</li>
		<li>WASD HTTPd is published with all the source code. This means that if 
		Adelaide gets hit with an asteroid you will be able to fix your 
		own code (provided you have access to the DECC "C compiler)</li>

		<li><span>caveat:</span> do not skip any CUP (cumulative 
		update package) files. I wasted a

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div itemprop="articleBody">  <p>For several reasons, emulation has always fascinated me. A program that executes other programs sounds like such a cool concept. It really feels like you’re getting your money’s worth out of writing it! Beyond that, it definitely feels like you’re <em>building</em> a computer within software. I really enjoyed learning about computer architecture and writing some basic HDL code, but emulation is a much more straightforward way of achieving a similar feeling of generating a machine. I’ve also always had this goal of knowing exactly how <em>Super Mario World</em> worked, ever since I first saw it as a kid. Because of this, writing a SNES/SFC emulator has been on my mind for a while. I decided recently that it was time to take a <a href="https://github.com/rivergillis/chip-8">step forward</a> towards making this happen.</p> <p>So let’s take a look at writing an emulator. A simple, but complete example would involve CHIP-8.</p> <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8">CHIP-8</a> is actually a programming language. It’s really simple too, there’s only <a href="http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM#3.0">35 opcodes</a>. To write an interpreter for it, we pretty much just need to write a program that can execute all 35 different instructions. The <em>emulation</em> aspect of this comes from the bits you wouldn’t normally find in a programming language interpreter. We need a way to display graphics, process user input, play audio, and we need to simulate the hardware mechanisms of a CHIP-8 machine. Things like registers and memory need to be taken into account during execution, and we also need to be careful about timing.</p> <p>Let’s start! For this project, we’ll be using C++. This should be fairly trivial to translate into other languages. If you want to take a look at the complete source, see the <a href="https://github.com/rivergillis/chip-8">project repository</a>.</p> <p>First, a basic main loop. We’ll ignore emulating timing for now.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>// main.cpp</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Our <code>CpuChip8</code> class will encapsulate the state of our virtual machine and interpreter. Now if we implement <code>RunCycle</code> and <code>Initialize</code> we’ll have ourselves a basic emulator skeleton. We now need to discuss the phsyical system we’re emulating.</p> <p>Our CHIP-8 system will be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telmac_1800">Telmac 1800</a>. We’ve got ourselves a pool of 4K of memory, a 64x32 1-bit display, and the ability to beep. <em>Nice</em>. The CHIP-8 interpreter itself is implemented via a virtual machine. We need to keep track of a stack, sixteen 8-bit registers (named V0 through VF), a 12-bit index register (named I), a program counter, two 8-bit timers, and a 16-frame stack.</p> <p>The canonical memory map looks like this:</p> <div><div><pre><code>0x000 |--------------------|
      | Interpreter memory |
      |                    |
0x050 | Built-in fontset   |
0x200 |--------------------|
      |                    |
      |                    |
      | Program memory     |
      | and dynamic allocs |
      |                    |
      |                    |
0xFFF |--------------------|
</code></pre></div></div> <p>You’ll notice there’s no explicit stack here. The program actually doesn’t have a stack to address, that’s only used by the interpreter to implement jumping to functions and back. With this in mind we can draw up a header.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>// cpu_chip8.h</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>We use excplicit integer types to ensure values are over/underflowed correctly. We need to use 16-bit types for 12-bit values. We also have 16 digital input keys, which we store as either on or off within this class. When we hook up input, we’ll find a way to feed that into the class between cycles. The opcode is made easy by the fact that all CHIP-8 instructions are 2 bytes long.</p> <p>So that gives us 0xFFFF=64k possible instructions (though many are unused). We can actually store every possible instruction in a map so that when we fetch an opcode we are able to immediately execute it by calling the associated <code>Instruction</code> in <code>instructions_</code>. Since we don’t bind much data to the functions, which should be able to fit the entire instruction map in cache!</p> <p>Our <code>Initialize</code> function is where to set up the memory map described above:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>// cpu_chip8.cpp</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>Don’t worry about trying to read that file loading code, the C++ iostream library is kind of ridiculous. The gist of it here is that we set everything to 0 and load things into memory that need to be loaded. The fontset here is a series of 16 built-in sprites that programs can reference as they want. We’ll go over how that memory forms sprites later on when we worry about graphics. Our goal is that once <code>Initialize</code> complete we’re set up to execute a user program.</p> <p>Let’s build out a basic <code>RunCycle</code> so that we have a better idea of out to write <code>BuildInstructionSet</code>. If you remember any basic computer architecture, a cycle has a few phases. First you fetch the instruction, then you decode it, then you execute it.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>// cpu_chip8.cpp</span>

Also, since we chose to define <code>Instruction</code> as a function pointer without any arguments, we’re going to have to bind those to the function itself. This requires more work in the initial set-up, but means we completely remove the instruction-decode phase on <code>RunCycle</code>.</p> <p>Let’s dig into the meat of the interpreter, <code>BuildInstructionSet</code>. I wont list the implementations for every function here, but you can find that in the <a href="https://github.com/rivergillis/chip-8">repository for this project</a>.

<p>It’s the year 2020 and we have the immense benefit of thousands of years of history, literature, and technological progress at our fingertips.</p>

<p>Why does this matter? Because with time comes context. Consideration and reconsideration. Deconstruction and reconstruction. Adaptation, further research, new findings, and new examination. Impact. Consequences. Lessons.</p>

<p>Anything old comes with context. Context is gold. Old is gold.</p>

<p>Context helps us evaluate things thoughtfully. It helps us debate things on their merits. In this way we can become better people—and a better people.</p>

<p>Without time, we lose context. Tweets received within seconds have virtually zero context. So what happens? Things are evaluated carelessly because there is no context for thoughtfulness. People attack each other because they don’t have any merits to debate. We become worse people—and a worse people.</p>

<p>Focusing on the immediate tip of the timeline of history—to this extreme—is nonsensical. <em>Now</em> is the least-understood moment in history. If we’re looking to become more informed, is <em>now</em> really the moment we should be examining to the degree we do?</p>

<p><em>Now</em> is a tornado of conjecture with little underlying value and much potential harm: hysteria.</p>

<p>I contend that there is more value in understanding the past in order to understand the present. As an experiment, I’m launching <a href="https://hystoria.100millionbooks.org/" target="_blank">Hystoria</a>, a reddit-like website for rediscovering ideas from the past.</p>

<p>I’ll be posting book snippets and other interesting tidbits I find on it as I work on 100 Million Books, and I hope you do too. You can upvote posts and comment on posts, and the best posts will float to the top.</p>

<p>So what’s different about Hystoria?</p>

<p><strong>Only items produced 5 years ago (or more) will be allowed on the site.</strong></p>

<p>Anything else will be removed. My hope is that this medium will harness the competitive, gamified dynamic of social media to resurface the best ideas of the past. Let’s see if that pans out. I’ll also be pointing people to Hystoria for all new book snippet suggestions.</p>

<p>The site is built with a free and open-source tool called <a href="https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy" target="_blank">Lemmy</a>, and I host the website myself—there’s no “big tech” involvement here. Moderation policies and terms of use will be determined if and when needed. Visit the site with an ad blocker and you’ll notice there are no ads or tracking on it either.</p>

<p>There’s another upside of this site: as you can see by the posting history of this blog, I don’t post very often. It’s been years since I last posted at all, in spite of collecting a lot of stuff worth sharing in the mean time. My excuse is that I have many things to post, and creating blog posts worth reading for each item I find would be a unreasonably onerous commitment. Posting on social media like Twitter or Facebook would be more practical but I don’t like the idea of building a following on those sites for their own sakes. I would much rather use them as conduits for sites I actually own. Hystoria enables that.</p>

<p>So I’ll post more on social sites now too. Follow on <a href="https://twitter.com/100millionbooks" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://facebook.com/l00millionbooks" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, and <a href="https://t.me/l00millionbooks" target="_blank">Telegram</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Doppler effect has been widely used in radar to measure the relative velocity between source and the target. The radar and lidar that use Doppler effect to measure relative velocities are called Doppler radar. Many autonomous or semi-autonomous machines, such as air-plane, autonomous vehicle, are often equipped with Doppler radar.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss the physics and mathematics of Doppler effect for Doppler radar.</p>

<h3 id="ordinary-radar">Ordinary Radar</h3>

<p>In the ordinary radar configurations, the transmitter of the radar sends out a wave, the wave hits a target object and gets reflected, a small portion of the reflected wave will be received by the receiver of the radar. By measuring the time gap between signal transmission and receipt $\Delta t$, we could determine the distance between the radar and the target object $r$ easily.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
r &amp;= \frac{c \Delta t}{2} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $c$ is the wave velocity. Both radar and the target object could be moving. But as long as the wave velocity $c$ is much greater than the relative velocity between the radar and the target object $\Delta v$, the above equation holds.</p>



<p>The ordinary radar is also called time-of-flight radar.</p>

<h3 id="doppler-radar">Doppler Radar</h3>

<p>Different from ordinary radar, Doppler radar could also be used for measuring the the relative velocity between the radar and the target object $\Delta v$.</p>

<h4 id="doppler-effect">Doppler Effect</h4>

<p>Letâ€™s consider the Doppler effect in the simplest 1D scenario. The wave frequency that the receiver measured $f^{\prime}$ is</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\lambda^{\prime} &amp;= \lambda - \frac{\Delta v}{f}  \\
&amp;= \frac{c}{f} - \frac{\Delta v}{f} \\
&amp;= \frac{c - \Delta v}{f} \\
&amp;= \frac{c}{f^{\prime}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $c$ is the wave velocity, $f$ is the source wave frequency, $\Delta v$ is the relative velocity between the source and the target, $\Delta v &gt; 0$ when the source and the target are moving closer, $\Delta v &lt; 0$ when the source and the target are moving farther. Therefore,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
f^{\prime} &amp;= \frac{c}{c - \Delta v} f \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Apparently, when the source and target are moving closer, i.e., $\Delta v &gt; 0$, $f^{\prime} &gt; f$; when the source and target are moving farther, i.e., $\Delta v &lt; 0$, $f^{\prime} &lt; f$.</p>



<p>The Doppler frequency $\Delta f$, which is the difference between the receiver frequency and the transmitter frequency is</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\Delta f &amp;= f^{\prime} - f \\ 
&amp;= \frac{c}{c - \Delta v} f -f \\
&amp;= \frac{f \Delta v}{c - \Delta v} \\
\end{align}\]

</p>

<p>Assuming $c \gg \Delta v$, we have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\Delta f &amp;= \frac{f \Delta v}{c} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>The Doppler effect will also happen to a Doppler radar when the radar and the object are relatively moving. Letâ€™s still consider the simplest 1D scenario. The target object will reflect the wave transmitted from the source. In this case, the target object becomes the source of wave, and the radar becomes the target object since the radar has a receiver. The frequency of reflected wave will be the same as the frequency of the wave the target objects receives, which is $f^{\prime}$. Then the frequency of the wave measured from the receiver on the radar $f^{\prime\prime}$ will be</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
f^{\prime\prime} &amp;= \frac{c}{c - \Delta v} f^{\prime} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Assuming $c \gg \Delta v$, the Doppler frequency $\Delta f$, which is the difference between the receiver frequency and the transmitter frequency is</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\Delta f &amp;= f^{\prime\prime} - f \\ 
&amp;= (f^{\prime\prime} - f^{\prime}) - (f^{\prime} - f) \\
&amp;= \frac{f \Delta v}{c} + \frac{f \Delta v}{c} \\
&amp;= \frac{2 f \Delta v}{c} 
\end{align}\]

</p><p>With this mathematical relationship, by measuring the the Doppler frequency $\Delta f$ on the radar, we could determine the relative velocity between the radar and the target object easily.</p>

<h4 id="phase-shift">Phase Shift</h4>

<p>In practice, instead of measuring the Doppler frequency $\Delta f$, many Doppler radar measure phase shift $\Delta \varphi$.</p>



<p>Assuming $c \gg \Delta v$, the phase difference between the transmitted signal and the received signal, i.e., phase shift $\Delta \varphi$, is</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\Delta \varphi &amp;= \frac{2r}{\lambda} 2\pi \\
&amp;= \frac{4 \pi r}{\lambda} \\
&amp;= \frac{4 \pi r f}{c} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $r$ is the distance between the radar and the target object, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\frac{d \Delta \varphi}{dt} &amp;= \frac{4 \pi f}{c} \frac{d r}{dt} \\
&amp;= \frac{4 \pi f}{c} \Delta v \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Note that $\Delta v = \frac{d r}{dt}$.</p>



<p>This means that if we could measure $\frac{d \Delta \varphi}{dt}$, we could calculate the relative velocity between the radar and the target object. In practice, $\frac{d \Delta \varphi}{dt}$ could be measured easily by transmitting lots of signals in unit time, and measuring the $\frac{\Delta \Delta \varphi}{\Delta t}$.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>Doppler radar is not that sophisticated to understand. We determine the relative velocity by measuring the change rate of Doppler effect phase shift.</p>

		<p><em>This is a guest post from Cierra Nease. Enjoy.</em></p>
<p>Dear new developer,</p>
<p>“Failures” as a new developer are plenty — but you might be asking, why is “failures” in quotes? To fail something is dependent upon one’s perspective. The only true failure is to quit working towards success. Every failure brings a small success in that you learn what the right answer is not. How can you problem solve without a way of marking off solutions that do not work? A failure is simply a solution that didn’t work at that specific time.</p>
<p>We can all talk about how learning and growth come from having failures, but it’s hard to remember that when you feel like you are a failure. Failures do not inherently make the person a failure, and it can be hard to make that distinction in the moment. Sometimes we need someone else to remind us of this.</p>
<p>I’ve had a lot of people in life reiterate this concept to me. The most recent person was a fellow developer named Mike on the Denver light rail. It’s funny what will happen when people participate in communicating and interacting with each other, but that is for another blog post entirely. For now, let’s go back to Mike. Mike overheard me talking to another passenger about being in a bootcamp. When I finished my conversation, he handed me a card and said he’d love to answer any questions I have about becoming a developer. I elaborated on some of my bootcamp experience, which happens to be full of failures.</p>
<p>Mike expressed his number one piece of advice for any developer, telling me: “whatever you do, don’t be afraid to fail.” We started talking about this in depth, and it really resonated with me for the rest of the evening. As a new developer, you really only see senior developers’ successes. Each developer goes through their own learning process which does include failures.</p>
<p>The failures that lead to success don’t stop when you become a “better” developer. If you are looking for a point when you quit failing as a developer, then you are looking for the wrong thing. The more you fail, the more you learn. The more you learn, the more you grow. The more you grow, the better the developer you become.</p>
<p>As a newer developer, I look forward to all of the opportunities to learn, grow, and accept my failures as the wrong solution instead of accepting them as a personal characteristic.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Cierra</p>

                <h3 id="who-makes-up-the-fi-re-movement">Who makes up the FI/RE Movement?</h3><p>Despite its relatively recent popularity, the FI/RE movement is still in many ways ambiguous. Who are these millionaires next door and what common traits are shared among them? Fortunately based off of data obtained from a survey conducted of nearly 1,400 individuals in the r/financialindependence subreddit, we can get a bit more insight into not only those who are pursuing FI/RE, but also those who have already achieved it. Special thanks to u/melonbalon for conducting the survey in the first place!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure><img src="https://www.thriftythoughts.io/content/images/2020/12/UNCLAIMED-PROPERTY--7-.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.thriftythoughts.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/UNCLAIMED-PROPERTY--7-.png 600w, https://www.thriftythoughts.io/content/images/2020/12/UNCLAIMED-PROPERTY--7-.png 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="insights-obtained">Insights Obtained</h3><p>So much data was obtained as part of this survey and the figures reported in the above visual only scratch the surface of valuable insights that could be drawn. Of note however are a couple items:</p><ol><li><strong>Commute times are very low.</strong> Over 20% of respondents noted that it takes last than 10 minutes to get to work. Additionally, nearly 70% had a commute of less than 30 minutes. It's likely that these smaller commute times result in less transportation costs which could be a motivating factor.</li><li><strong>Individuals who have already FI/RE'd are highly educated.</strong> Not only did nearly 85% of respondents have a college degree, but an additional 7% had multiple graduate degrees. Perhaps these individuals have more time for additional schooling post-retirement. It also could be the case that this additional education helped them FI/RE in the first place. Regardless, more schooling was expected in comparison to the respondent group that had not yet FI/RE'd simply given the older average age. </li><li><strong>Respondents favored urban and suburban environments equally. </strong>Additionally this ratio remained constant in both the pursuing FI/RE and FI/RE'd populations. I would have expected far more suburban living, but perhaps the increased cost of living in an urban environment is offset enough by the reduced transportation costs to be appealing.</li></ol>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><hr><p><strong>Aavegotchi</strong> is a DeFi-enabled crypto collectibles game developed by Singapore-based Pixelcraft Studios that allows players to stake NFT avatars with interest-generating <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/atokens">aTokens</a> and interact with the Aavegotchi <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/metaverse">metaverse</a>.

Aavegotchis possess three attributes that determine their overall value and rarity within the Aavegotchi universe: <strong>collateral stake, traits, and wearables.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Collateral stake:</strong>
Each Aavegotchi ERC721 NFT manages an escrow contract address that holds
an Aave-backed ERC20 collateral, or “aToken”. <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/atokens">aTokens</a> generate yield via
Aave’s LendingPool, which increases the quantity of aTokens held in the
wallet. Thus, the amount of aTokens held in the Aavegotchi’s escrow address grows over time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Traits:</strong>
Aavegotchis possess multiple traits that influence their rarity, their performance in mini-games, and the wearables they can equip. Some are generated randomly upon birth, and others depend on user interactions with the Aavegotchi. <strong>See <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/traits">Traits</a>.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Random Traits</strong>: Upon birth, every Aavegotchi is assigned several random trait values using the ChainLink VRF random number generator. Trait values are distributed on a bell-curve, and each trait is assigned a value of Common, Uncommon, Rare, Legendary, or Mythical, depending on its rarity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Kinship</strong>: “Kinship” is not randomly assigned, but rather starts at a fixed value upon birth and increases or decreases based on various factors, such as how long the Aavegotchi has been with the same owner, and how often the owner interacts with it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Experience:</strong> Aavegotchis level up as they gain more experience by voting in AavegotchiDAO and participating in mini-games. Every few levels, Aavegotchis receive one Spirit Point that can be allocated towards increasing or decreasing a certain trait.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Wearables</strong>
In addition to managing the aToken escrow, Aavegotchis also extend the ERC998 Composables standard, which allows them to manage child NFTs, known as wearables in the Aavegotchi ecosystem.
Not every wearable can be equipped by every Aavegotchi. Some wearables may be exclusively equipped by Aavegotchis staked with certain collaterals, those of a certain level, and those with certain traits.
Some wearables can increase or decrease certain traits of an Aavegotchi. For example, equipping a sword may slightly boost an Aavegotchi’s aggressiveness, whereas equipping a Bob Marley shirt may decrease its energy level.</p></li></ul><h2 id="aavegotchi-value">Aavegotchi Value</h2><p>The valuation of an Aavegotchi comes from both from its intrinsic value and from its rarity value.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Intrinsic value</strong>
Intrinsic value is the denominated value of the Aavegotchi’s staked collateral. If the Aavegotchi is staked with 10 aDAI, then the intrinsic value would be 10 aDAI, plus whatever extra aDAI has accrued from the Lending Pool. Initially, only ERC20 tokens listed on the Aave platform (aTokens) will be available as collaterals. However, once AavegotchiDAO launches, the community will be able to vote on which new collaterals to allow.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rarity value</strong>
Rarity value is determined by calculating the rareness of each Aavegotchi’s traits and equipped wearables within the Aavegotchi universe. Unlike other NFT games, rarity is not a fixed value in Aavegotchi. It can change over time as Aavegotchis level up and equip different wearables. Thus, a rare Aavegotchi one week could become common, and vice versa, depending on the overall distribution of traits and wearables within the Aavegotchi universe. This enables a novel concept known as “rarity farming”, which is explained in more detail in the Aavegotchi official whitepaper to be released soon.</p></li></ul><h2 id="the-aavegotchi-universe">The Aavegotchi Universe</h2><p>The Aavegotchi Universe encompasses all the elements that allow Aavegotchis to operate, including Portals, the $GHST Utility Token, AavegotchiDAO, and the Aavegotchi Realm.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p><strong>UPDATE: While these are valid reasons, <a href="https://www.arencambre.com/iphones-are-inferior-to-android-phones-the-value/">scoring them suggests I should still switch to the iPhone</a>.</strong></p>



<p>I am on day 10 of using an iPhone. I came from the Android world.</p>



<p>The iPhone is deficient. I am leaning towards returning it.</p>




<h2><span id="Context"></span>Context<span></span></h2>



<p>Ten days ago, I switched from a Pixel 4 XL to the iPhone 12 Pro Max. I went with this iPhone model because it’s similarly sized to the Pixel 4 XL, plus I value photography.</p>



<h3><span id="Why_I_switched"></span>Why I switched<span></span></h3>



<p>I made the switch due to intellectual curiosity, to overcome limitations of the Pixel 4 XL, and to get on board with the rest of my family.</p>



<p>I am questioning this decision. While the iPhone helps me escape two Pixel 4 XL limitations, iOS’s regressions from Android feel like a heavy burden.</p>



<p>I am inside Apple’s return window, so I can return the iPhone for a full refund. It is tempting.</p>



<h3><span id="Android_only_has_two_worthwhile_brands"></span>Android only has two worthwhile brands<span></span></h3>



<p>My analysis relies heavily on my experience with the Pixel 4 XL. Much of what I say about Android applies to to top-tier Android manufacturers. Among the requirements of top-tier manufacturers is they deliver highly vanilla Android. This includes <a href="https://store.google.com/us/magazine/compare_pixel">Pixel </a>(Google’s in-house brand), <a href="https://www.oneplus.com/">OnePlus</a>, and more.</p>



<p><strong>Samsung is not a top-tier phone manufacturer.</strong> Its hardware is decent, but it has bad software. Samsung replaces Android’s best features with <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00078945/">poor, fussy substitutes</a>. It also adds annoying, pointless bloat. In other words, just to differentiate its brand, it <em>devalues its brand </em>by trashing up its core software.</p>



<p>The Bixby assistant is the best example of Samsung’s stupidity. It’s awful. Samsung killing Bixby might signal that it’s ready to take Android seriously. Until then, Samsung is simply not a top-tier manufacturer.</p>



<p>The Samsung example is important because Apple is the same: <strong>great hardware, bad software</strong>.</p>



<h2><span id="A_note_about_definitions"></span>A note about definitions<span></span></h2>



<p>The article’s language is sometimes imprecise. Truly, if you’re comparing Android to something in the Apple ecosystem, it would be iOS. But that is not how people talk about their phones, so I am using loose terminology in places.</p>



<p>If you’re a True Nerd™ and find my word use upsetting, just associate my word with its parent ecosystem.</p>



<p>This is how several terms are correctly used:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Word category</strong></td><td><strong>Android phone ecosystem</strong></td><td><strong>Apple phone ecosystem</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Operating system</td><td>Android</td><td>iOS</td></tr><tr><td>Manufacturers</td><td>Google, OnePlus, and more</td><td>Apple</td></tr><tr><td>Phone brand</td><td>Pixel (Google), OnePlus, and more</td><td>iPhone</td></tr><tr><td>Phone model (current generation)</td><td>For Pixel: Pixel 4A, Pixel 4A 5G, Pixel 5. For OnePlus: OnePlus 8T, OnePlus 8 Pro, OnePlus 8, OnePlus 7T. There are more current model from other manufacturers.</td><td>iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max, iPhone SE, and more</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Also, some Android features I enjoy are Pixel-specific. While Google freely distributes Android to other manufactures, it reserves some newer features for its own Pixel phones. Sometimes I may mistakenly generalize a Pixel-specific feature as an Android feature. Since Pixel-specific features often eventually end up on other phones, associating Pixel with Android is probably correct in the long run.</p>



<h2><span id="Where_Android_is_better"></span>Where Android is better<span></span></h2>



<p>Android is well thought out. It has a great UX. I really miss its great design.</p>



<h3><span id="Call_screening_Android_wins"></span>Call screening: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>Android’s <a href="https://support.google.com/phoneapp/answer/9118387?hl=en">built-in call screener</a> is excellent. It blocks calls it is confident are garbage. If the caller is in a gray area, it will ask the caller first to state the reason for calling, then show that to me on the screen where I can accept the call. And even if does nothing to the call, I can still use a <strong>Screen Call </strong>button to kick the call to a digital assistant, where the caller is invited to state the reason for the call.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2019/11/call_screen_assistant.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Example call-screen opportunity. (This image shamelessly <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/automatic-call-screen-google-pixel-phones/">stolen</a> from XDA Developers.)</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This may be mostly a Pixel feature right now. Google plans to <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/09/08/google-phone-will-soon-be-downloadable-from-play-store-verified-calls-feature-rolling-out/">extend</a> this to more Android brands. Because Samsung uses its own, poor quality dialer, it’s unclear how Samsung will get this feature.</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> Apple only has a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207099">crude tool</a>: block callers not in your contacts. You can’t report calls or texts as spam.</p>



<p>If you want to be more selective than Apple’s crude tool, and instead block specific spammers, you must add the spammers to your contacts. That’s dumb; it just clutters your contacts!</p>



<p>You can also subscribe to a third party service. That’s grating, because the phone should manage that itself, given that this is a years-old problem.</p>



<h3><span id="Browser_ad_blocking_Android_wins"></span>Browser ad blocking: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>On Android, browser ad-blocking is easy: Switch to the free <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Mozilla Firefox browser</a>. Inside Firefox, add the free <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/">uBlock Origin extension</a>. Then set Firefox as your default browser for happy browsing. Simple! (Android’s Chrome browser does not support extensions.)</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> Install the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adguard-adblock-privacy/id1047223162">AdGuard app</a>, jump through several fussy hoops in the <strong>Settings </strong>console’s <strong>Safari </strong>area, and get nagged about going to paid AdGuard. </p>



<p>Maybe I am fussing too much. The hassle is a one-time step, and AdGuard seems to work decently.</p>



<p>Part of the point of ad-blocking is to make YouTube worthwhile. That leads to my next point…</p>



<h3><span id="YouTube_ad_blocking_Android_wins"></span>YouTube ad blocking: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>To block YouTube’s ads on Android, just view all YouTube content in Firefox with the uBlock Origin extension. Easy!</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> While Safari + AdGuard = ads blocked on YouTube, it’s still a major regression from Android:</p>



<ul><li>Video quality <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/aom6ge/why_does_youtube_only_go_up_to_720p_on_mobile/">maxes out at 720p</a>.</li><li>Every YouTube video in Safari starts as low quality (360p). To change it, on <em>every video you watch</em>, you must wade through the settings menu, and it has to be done before you switch to full screen, because of the next bullet’s deficiency.</li><li>When you’re viewing a video in a browser and switch to full screen, Apple cancels the website’s native video player and forces you to use iOS’s default, bad, native video player. Want to double-tap and skip 10 seconds? Want to access the site’s in-video settings? Want any feature not supported by iOS’s dumbed down video control? Forget it! iOS nukes it in full-screen mode.</li></ul>



<p>Firefox Focus is not a solution. It doesn’t fix iOS’s deficiencies.</p>



<h3><span id="Universal_back_button_Android_wins"></span>Universal back button: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>For at least a decade, Android has had a back button at the bottom of all windows. This means the valuable concept of “take me back” is baked into the Android paradigm. Need to return where you were, in <em>any</em> app? Just tap the back button, on bottom left of the screen. Or use the back gesture (next section).</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> The back button is a mess.</p>



<p>In Safari, it’s on bottom left.</p>



<p>In most other apps, top left.</p>



<p>To get to the prior app that sent you to the current app, find a tiny button between the app’s top-left back button and the clock. And good luck on that; too much of the time, iOS lists a wrong or irrelevant prior app, especially if you got to your current app from a system notification.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="449" src="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1024x449.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1024x449.png 1024w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-300x132.png 300w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-768x337.png 768w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image.png 1225w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Even though the mini back button says otherwise, I was not sent to GroupMe by NPR One! I was sent there by a notification I tapped while NPR One was active.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Even worse, because the non-Safari back buttons are on the opposite end of the phone from where you hold it, you’re less precise with finger positioning. Therefore, when you intend to use a “back” feature, you’ll instead make the phone think you’re trying to pull down the notification area.</p>



<h3><span id="Gestures_Android_wins"></span>Gestures: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>Building on its native strengths, Android’s <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6073614?hl=en">gestures</a> are excellent. They edge out iOS with the back gesture, which I use a lot. No matter what app you’re in, swipe in from the phone’s right to go back. Simple!</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> Without a “back” gesture, you’re stuck fumbling with iOS’s haphazard back buttons.</p>



<h3><span id="Exiting_apps_Android_wins"></span>Exiting apps: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>In Android, you can exit apps with the back gesture or swiping up from the bottom. The back gesture is superior, because it can’t be confused with other gestures.</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> Your only choice is the swipe-up gesture, which sometimes conflicts with normal swipes one does in apps.</p>



<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>I don’t literally mean app-exiting in the computer-science sense. I mean more in a common-parlance sense: you’re out of the app and back to the home screen, or in another app that may have called the current app. One an app is no longer visible, and running in the background, Android and iOS both do fine managing it.</p>



<h3><span id="Ambient_display_Android_wins"></span>Ambient display: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>The Pixel has a great feature: even when you’re not using the phone, it shows the current time on the screen, along with some other useful information. This takes minimal power: thanks to the OLED screen, the main power use is when it lights up the specific pixels that show the time.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="1024" src="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-768x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-768x1024.png 768w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-225x300.png 225w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-1152x1536.png 1152w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-1536x2048.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"><figcaption>Ambient display. This Pixel 4 XL is not active. It’s basically in sleep mode. It uses minimal power to give me useful information on its OLED screen.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> While the iPhone also has an OLED screen, Apple has no similar feature. You have to tap the phone to see the time, which lights up the whole screen.</p>



<h3><span id="Treating_me_like_an_adult_Android_wins"></span>Treating me like an adult: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>Android’s UX language is simply clean. It’s intuitive, simple, and it just works.</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> iOS’s UX feels like a cartoon spoof of a phone OS. Naturally garish colors, toddler-like corner-rounding, goofy font sizes, etc. It’s like iOS’s design semantics were intended to tussle with our innate senses. Barf!</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="473" height="1024" src="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-473x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-473x1024.png 473w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-139x300.png 139w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-768x1662.png 768w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-710x1536.png 710w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-947x2048.png 947w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2.png 1284w" sizes="(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px"><figcaption>When a toddler breaks out crayons and designs a phone, this is what you get.</figcaption></figure>



<h3><span id="Application_organization_Android_wins"></span>Application organization: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>All newly installed Android apps go into the app drawer. This is an alphabetized list of apps, accessed by swiping up from a home screen (when you’re not inside an app).</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4-485x1024.png" alt="" width="485" height="1024" srcset="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4-485x1024.png 485w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4-142x300.png 142w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4-768x1621.png 768w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4-728x1536.png 728w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4-970x2048.png 970w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4.png 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px"><figcaption>Android app drawer.

<p>Suppose you have 150 apps. That is 30 rows of five icons each, all in alpha sort. It’s fast to find any application.</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> It wasn’t until <em>this year</em> that Apple delivered its poor ripoff of the app drawer. Before then, people were stuck with jumbled messes of icons on multiple home-screen pages.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a simple, cheap data pipeline to pull small amounts of data from a stable API and store it in a cloud storage, then <code>serverless functions</code> are a good choice. This post aims to answer questions like the ones shown below</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My company does not have the budget to purchase a tool like <code>fivetran</code>, What should I use to pull data from an API ?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Do I really need an orchestration tool like Airflow for one simple data pull from an API ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the post we cover what a <code>serverless</code> function can and cannot do, what its pros and cons are and walk through a simple API data pull project.</p>

<p>Chances are that you have heard of the term <code>serverless</code>. The term <code>serverless</code> may be misleading. In fact, there is a server on which your code will be running. <code>Serverless</code> refers to the fact that you do not have to manage any servers, but just the code. We will use <code>AWS Lambda</code> for this simple project. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/?c=ser&amp;sec=srv"><code>AWS Lambda</code></a> can be used to run a function without having to provision and maintain a server.</p>
<p>You write a function and deploy it to AWS Lambda. There you can set the function to run based on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/understanding-the-different-ways-to-invoke-lambda-functions/">external triggers</a>. The lambda function will execute the logic and end. Note that you will have a limited time (current max execution time for lambda code execution is 15min) for your code logic to complete. There is also a limit on the memory size(current max is at 3.008GB). In this post we will</p>
<ol>
<li>Start the lambda function.</li>
<li>Download data from a dummy API to local file system.</li>
<li>Copy the downloaded files to AWS S3.</li>
<li>Stop the lambda function.</li>
<li>The lambda function will be scheduled to run every 5 minutes.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s assume you work for a company that wants to pull some data from an API that you have access to and assess the quality of that data. Your responsibility is to pull this data and make it available via cloud storage for other systems to consume and assess quality. Let’s assume that this is your first and only data pull(for now). There is not enough time/ money to set up/buy a data orchestration tool. This project is to validate the value that this data may provide, based on which your company can choose to either continue paying for this data or not.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS Account</a></li>
<li>AWS CLI <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html">installed</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html">configured</a></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="api-documentation">API Documentation</h3>
<p>Let us assume that our API has the following documentation.</p>
<ol>
<li>API endpoint: GET <code>http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts</code> to get user post data.</li>
<li>Query parameters: The data returned from the API is sorted by user_id. Using <code>start_user_id</code> and <code>end_user_id</code> we can query for a range of data based on user ids.</li>
<li>API metadata endpoint: GET <code>http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/number_of_users</code>, will return the total number of user posts.</li>
</ol>
<p>The GET endpoint will return a list of JSON with the format</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
    <span>"userId"</span>: <span>1</span>,
    <span>"id"</span>: <span>1</span>,
    <span>"title"</span>: <span>"some title here"</span>,
    <span>"body"</span>: <span>"some test here"</span>
}
</code></pre></div><h2 id="paginate">Paginate</h2>
<p>When pulling a “lot” of data from an API, it is general best practice to make multiple requests to pull data in chunks. The definition of a lot of data depends on the amount of data being pulled and the API stability. Based on the <code>API Documentation</code> above, we need to</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the total number of user posts.</li>
<li>Split the number into N number of calls, depending on a predefined <code>CHUNK</code> size. Which is the amount of data you want to pull per API call.</li>
<li>Make the API call, pull the data and write it to a local disk storage. You can also store in memory if the data size is sufficiently small.</li>
<li>Some APIs may fail due to network or other issues, add a retry parameter to account for this. In reality this will depend on the stability of the API and the network.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Depending on the size of data and the allocated lambda memory, it may be more efficient to keep data in memory instead of writing to disk and then uploading to S3.</p>
<p>Lets create a folder called <code>dataPull</code> in your project directory and within it a python script called <code>lambda_function.py</code>, starting with the content below</p>

</code></pre></div><p>In the above code snippet, we have the functions</p>
<ol>
<li><code>get_num_records</code> to simulate the GET call to your API to get the total number of user posts.</li>
<li><code>download_data</code> to make multiple calls to the API and only accessing 10,000 data records per API data pull. This 10,000 is defined as a global variable <code>CHUNK_SIZE</code>. In your project you will need to determine what this size is depending on API stability, memory constraints, network connection and general best practice size for that API.</li>
<li><code>parse_data</code> to convert the json data into a row format string, which gets written to a local file.</li>
<li><code>write_to_local</code> to write the downloaded chunk of data into the local file system. In our case if we have 100,000 records we will generate 10 files name <code>0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9</code> with the data for user ids <code>0-10000, 10000-20000,...90000-100000</code> correspondingly. Note the local file system location <code>/tmp</code> will only be available for the duration of a single run of your function.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="concurrency">Concurrency</h4>
<p>In the above snippet, since we are downloading chunks independently we can also make it concurrent using python’s <code>asyncio</code> library. If you are using concurrency be very aware of the number of open connections/ file handlers, etc. You can also manage concurrency at the lambda function level as shown <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-concurrency.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_console">here</a>.</p>
<p>Note some API may not provide the exact number of records, instead you will have to query until no more data is available (usually using some sort of <code>search_after</code> query parameter). In such cases concurrency will be difficult to achieve since you will need the output from the previous call to make the next API call. An example of this is <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/search-request-search-after.html"><code>ElasticSearch's</code> search_after</a>. There is also the <code>from, size</code> type API endpoints which requires the size of data to pull and an id from which to start pulling data as query parameters to the API call.</p>

<p>Since lambda functions are temporary, so are their local storage. We need to make sure our locally stored data (at <code>/tmp</code>) gets stored in a persistent storage system such as <code>AWS S3</code>. Add the below code to <code>lambda_function.py</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Not interested in the back story? </strong>Jump ahead to <a href="#introducing-localizer">Introducing Localizer</a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Before we get into the details of what localizer is and how it came to be, it's crucial that we look at what developer environments were and the motivations behind the ones I create.</p><p>Ever since I wrote my first ever <a href="https://github.com/staymarta/dev">developer environment</a> for the now-defunct <a href="https://github.com/staymarta">StayMarta</a>, I've always focused on one thing: ease of use. For a docker-compose based development environment, this was a relatively simple task. Create Docker containers, write a compose file, declare ports, and they'd be available on my local machine. It was as simple as <code>docker-compose up</code>. While this approach didn't necessarily match what production looked like, it was really the best option available for containers at the time. Options that exist now, such as Kubernetes, weren't available, which rendered <a href="https://www.docker.com/blog/announcing-docker-machine-swarm-and-compose-for-orchestrating-distributed-apps/">equality between production and development a work-in-progress dream</a>.</p><p>Fast forward to 2017, at my first larger-scale startup, <a href="https://azuqua.com/">Azuqua</a>, I had a chance to reimagine what a developer environment looked like under a whole new set of constraints. While Docker Compose works for small teams, it falls apart when you map it to production systems. At the time, our production system was based on Chef. Docker Compose doesn't map to Ruby-based Chef configuration files. When I joined Azuqua, the pain around having separate tooling for infrastructure had become incredibly clear. It wasn't sustainable to have an entire team; write the configuration for our services, communicate with developers why infrastructure can't infinitely scale without good software design, and do it all without blame or single points of failure. Fundamentally this is why I take issue with DevOps teams and prefer promoting the <a href="https://sre.google/">Google SRE Model</a> instead. While at Azuqua, we started a transition to an SRE model and used Kubernetes as a way to help facilitate that.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.jaredallard.me/content/images/2020/12/kind-1.png" alt="KinD Logo"></figure><p>While at Azuqua, I identified the need to run Kubernetes to ease cloud resources' scalability and improve the developer experience. At the same time, this <strong>drastically decreased the developer experience</strong>. While this may seem contradictory at first, it's essential to consider the multiple ways that developer experience presents itself. While at first, it may seem like it's just tooling to test/write code, it's a combination of testing code, writing code, and deploying that code. With the Docker Compose environment at StayMarta, we made the test/build cycle incredibly simple but shifted the deploy aspects onto a bespoke team, the DevOps model. That approach works for small teams, but as you grow, this quickly doesn't scale. If you can't deploy code efficiently, the developer experience is frustrating and promptly turns to an unhealthy relationship with the team responsible for that cycle.</p><p>Going back to how Kubernetes <em>improved the developer experience</em>, which I assure you it does. The benefit to Kubernetes was that it brought a control plane into the mix and focused on being just a container orchestrator. The DSL it does have is highly specific to orchestrating containers and making them work. The control-plane allows self-healing and building tooling to enable all different types of use-cases consistently. While it lacks abstractions, it brings something to developers they've never had before, the ability to deploy code reproducibly. With the introduction of <a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/">minikube</a>, <a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/">KinD</a>, and others, you could now run the same stack you run in production, but locally.</p><p>The ability to reproducibly deploy helps both deployment confidence and the amount of time needed to get from nothing to running in production. However, it's not without its faults. Whenever you start moving deployment tooling onto developers, you've decreased the developer experience. It's unavoidable because you're introducing net new materials, DSLs, and more for the developers to learn. While <a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/">KinD</a> and <a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/">minikube</a> are great projects, they all suffer from needing developers to understand how to work with Kubernetes. You need to be able to build a Docker image, push the docker image into the cluster, delete the application pod, verify if it's even using the correct tag, wait for Kubernetes to recreate the container, and make sure you've configured an ingress route to access it outside of your cluster or use <code>kubectl port-forward</code> to access it. The second that breaks, you're now required to dig into why service connectivity isn't working, why your Docker image isn't in the <code>containerd</code> cache, or other not so easily solved areas. While to someone who's worked with Kubernetes for years now, this isn't very difficult, this is hardly achieving the "ease of use" goal I have.</p><p>Solving these problems is not easy. Debugging Kubernetes is difficult and requires knowledge that can only be solved with education, more tooling, or a combination of both. Unfortunately, these are not cheap. Education is hard to do correctly and tends to result in lots of time writing quickly out of date material that is hard to maintain. While at Azuqua, we encountered this same problem. Very few engineers wanted to learn Kubernetes or invest time in the technology around it. We decided to go back to the basics and focus on a tooling based approach. How do we get the same developer experience level, at a minimum, of Docker Compose with Kubernetes? Our answer ended up being a tool called <a href="https://telepresence.io/">Telepresence</a>. Telepresence describes itself as:</p><blockquote>[...] an open source tool that lets you run a single service locally, while connecting that service to a remote Kubernetes cluster.<p><a href="https://www.telepresence.io/discussion/overview">https://www.telepresence.io/discussion/overview</a></p></blockquote><p>It seemed perfect, a tool that enabled your local machine to act as if it were running in Kubernetes and allow your services to be targeted from inside of Kubernetes. We rolled it out at Azuqua after initial tests showed it worked well, and we went with it. Unfortunately, it didn't last.</p><p>While Telepresence solved the problem of communicating with our local Kubernetes cluster, it spectacularly failed at letting services inside the cluster talk to our local services. When it worked, it worked amazingly, but nine times out of ten, it'd fail in a magnitude of ways. Whether that's failing to clean up after random crashing or slowly taking down the computer's internet connection, it generally wouldn't work. Luckily for us at Azuqua, we had a pretty well-defined system for service discovery and few services that needed to talk to one another directly. The few that needed that could just run outside of the cluster. That allowed us to accept those pains and be successful with Telepresence. To be clear, this is not a hit on Telepresence. It worked very well for us at Azuqua, but it's not a complete solution.</p><p>When I started developing a new development environment for <a href="https://outreach.io/">Outreach</a>, I again tried to use Telepresence as the solution to bridge the gap between our local cluster and our local machine. Unfortunately, it didn't work. We did not have a well-defined service discovery mechanism to work around the bugs, we had a much larger engineering team, and almost all services needed to talk to each other. We found more and more edge cases with Telepresence, and our developer experience was suffering. Our NPS score for our developer environment was at a low of -26, just because of Telepresence!</p><figure><img src="https://blog.jaredallard.me/content/images/2020/12/image-1.png" alt="Chart showing the NPS spread"><figcaption>For comparison, a good NPS is generally +30...&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>It was pretty clear that Telepresence was not going to solve our use-cases. It was time to look into alternatives.</p><p>Telepresence was interesting since it used a VPN to give you access to your resources. However, it also required a hack DNS injector component, which tended to be the primary source of network problems. There weren't many projects out there that seemed to solve this, but one interesting one was <a href="https://github.com/txn2/kubefwd">kubefwd</a>. If you're not aware of Kubernetes port-forwarding, there is a command that allows you to bring down a set of ports for a given service and have them be available on your local machine via <code>kubectl port-forward</code>. Think of the <code>-p</code> argument to <code>docker run</code>, but for Kubernetes. Unfortunately, this didn't support FQDNs (<code>.svc.cluster.local</code>), statefulsets, or all namespaces automatically. It also didn't support reverse tunneling. I wanted to keep the spirit of Telepresence by continuing to be a one-stop tool. Aside from <code>kubefwd</code>, there were seemingly no tools that could do this. Reverse tunneling into Kubernetes alone seemed to be an unsolved problem. To fill that gap, I decided to write <code>localizer</code>.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/jaredallard/localizer">Localizer</a> is a rewrite of Telepresence in Golang, but without the complex surface area. Its goal is to be a simple, no-frills development tool for application developers using Kubernetes. It does this by being easy to use, self-explanatory, and easy to debug. Localizer only supports what Kubernetes networking does, and acts as a daemon. This is most useful when trying to expose multiple services, developers generally had to have many terminal windows to run Telepresence or other reverse tunnel solutions. Localizer moves away from that by having all commands send a gRPC message to the daemon. More on that later. At the core of Localizer is three commands.</p><h2 id="default-creating-tunnels">Default: Creating Tunnels</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.jaredallard.me/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-04-at-1.28.31-PM-1.png" alt="Output from running the localizer daemon"><figcaption>Running <code>localizer</code> on my home Kubernetes Cluster (it's not limited to just local developer environments)</figcaption></figure><p>When you run <code>localizer</code> without any arguments, it automatically creates port-forwards for all Kubernetes Services (this is important), a loopback-interface powered IP address, and adds them to <code>/etc/hosts</code>. Out of the box, this allows code to communicate with Kubernetes services despite being outside of the cluster.</p><h2 id="expose-creating-a-reverse-tunnel">Expose: Creating a Reverse Tunnel</h2><p>The <code>expose</code> command takes <code>namespace/service</code> as an argument that allows you to point a Kubernetes service down to your machine's service instance. When run, it automatically scales down any endpoints that already exist for the service. Localizer then creates an OpenSSH pod with the Kubernetes service's selector, which makes Kubernetes route traffic to the created pod. Localizer creates an SSH reverse proxy over a Kubernetes port-forward (which …</p></div></div>

        <p>We have the wrong idea about future space travel. Our current technology has conditioned us to believe in spaceships as a sterile affair, all metals and plastics. This works for getting to the Moon and back, but if you’re like me that’s not good enough. The frontier beyond the Moon, beyond the Solar System–<em>this</em> is what calls to us.</p>
<p>When one commits to this, one realizes this is going to be a one-way affair. The stars are simply too far away and there will never be any warp drive. When we settle out on our beautifully &amp; brutally precisioned ox cart, our starship and our families will be our home until we pass.</p>
<p>Our starship is so brutally precisioned because it must be. Every single ounce of matter costs an incredible amount of fuel i.e. stored energy to move into space. As the posters on our walls remind us:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.counterengineer.com/images/futurepastcaptaindemingsmaller.png" alt=""></p>
<p>What <em>is</em> aboard a starship is an <em>ecosystem</em>.</p>
<p>☉</p>
<p>There is little waste in a properly functioning ecosystem. The energy that flows into the system is minimally wasted. The ecosystem persists by dissipating energy (mainly the sun’s radiation) through the component parts of the ecosystem (bacteria plants animals you). The material components of these cycle in a carefully coordinated pattern powered by the sun.</p>
<p>Say you have a camera, and this camera is affixed to a single atom of nitrogen in violation of all laws of science. We would see this atom of nitrogen float around the atmosphere and down onto the soil until it gets caught up in, say, a rhizobacteria. This rhizobacteria uses a little bit of stored energy to take up that nitrogen and uses it to maintain itself. We follow this bacteria around until it tragically dies. The nitrogen is  absorbed by a nearby plant, once more made a part of a larger former until again tragically–but in a slightly higher register of tragedy–it dies when it is harvested by humans for food. On ingesting the plant, that bit of nitrogen (plus all of the plants stored energy e.g. sugars) becomes stuck up inside some dude. This dude uses the stored energy to order the nitrogen into some nucleotide, say adenine–the A in ATCG. Our camera now watches DNA.</p>
<p>In the most tragic scene of all the human dies slipping on a banana peel.</p>
<p>Buried in the ground, another bacteria munches up the DNA and respires it back into the atmosphere. The dance begins anew.</p>
<p>Implicitly given the brutal complexity of the processes just described: the dancers must dance <em>well</em> for all the structures to link harmoniously.</p>
<p>☉</p>
<p><img src="http://www.counterengineer.com/images/pastoralringworldCLEAN-SM.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>On the frontier there is always the possibility that we don’t make it. Danger forms a bond between every resident of a starship, and this danger means we indefinitely maintain the systems that work. This is not an easy task. The size and complexity of a starship that carries tens of thousands of people meants there are always <em>things to do.</em> Still, we also know these systems bring human flourishing: the sense that the residents are safe and well while maintaining these systems. It is this that enables the whole thing, the starship, to subsist indefinitely.</p>
<p>It turns out there is plenty of material from the past on how to do this.</p>
<p>Not much changes in these multi-generational starships. The labs occasionally figure out some whiz-bang new tool for the men to gawk over (“With this we can save a couple of microJoules powering propulsion, allowing us to play <em>Mario Kart 64</em>") but they manage to mostly keep this to themselves.</p>
<p>☉</p>
<p>You’re incredulous, that such a feat could be accomplished. From your perspective mailing every citizen something is an impossible task. Here’s the thing: we couldn’t get this starship in the air and then figure out how to make it run well, no. We first constructed starships on Earth, socities that lasted long enough to propel themselves off.</p>
<p>☉</p>
<p>Some back of the envelope calculations: a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_torus">stanford torus</a> with a ring 60 km in diameter and 3 km in width yields ~34 square kilometers of land. A small town and the surrounding supporting country.</p>
<p>The seeding of the first starship proceeds uneventfully. Someone posts on the internet, “Hey, I think it would be a good idea if people interested in building starships all moved to the same town.” Out of all the people on the entire internet, about 10 other people were willing to put this into practice. As it turns out, that is all it took.</p>
<p>The value of living with a multi-generational telos becomes apparent over multiple generations. The town becomes its own ecosystem, producing what it needed to survive locally. The town’s research institution focuses on the dual tasks of maximizing local flourishing while minimizing waste and getting all of it into space. Other towns join in, split, fuse.</p>
<p>One starts on the Moon, the efforts of the “Moonbelt”: USS Tulsa OK, USS Vinita OK, USS Pittsburg KS.</p>
<p>Before long, you can make out <em>it</em> with your telescope, the skeleton of one that goes to Mars.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.counterengineer.com/images/moonring.png" alt=""></p>
<p>☉</p>
<p>Hey, I think it would be a good idea if people interested in building starships all moved to the same town.</p>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">I am trying to kickstart the Common Lisp revolution from 28 november to <strong>10 december 2020</strong></a>, and as of 5 december 2020, it did look like we were going to run out of time, so this is my last-ditch attempt at rectifying the situation before it's too late. <strong><em><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">Please support the Common Lisp Revival 2020 Fundraiser!!!</a></em></strong></p>

        <p>
          Since we are on such a tight deadline, I am soliciting donations of <strong>1000$ or more</strong> from the following organizations and people. This is the only way we can realistically make it in time.
          <br>
          I can confirm that they are all eligible for <a href="https://sponsors.hexstreamsoft.com/about/#perks" target="_blank">Advanced Perks</a>, including <a href="https://sponsors.hexstreamsoft.com/about/#lifetime-perks" target="_blank">Lifetime Perks</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please make sure to <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">sponsor me</a> from an account able to give out doublers, you should see a banner confirming this at the top (when logged in).
          <br>
          Also <strong>beware of prorating</strong>, which might significantly cut down your contribution if you are not careful. Any prorating will be announced on the checkout page, and you may need to sponsor at a higher tier to arrive at the amount that you intended to contribute.

        <p>Dear LispWorks, Dear Usha, Dear Franz, Dear Jans,</p>

        <p>
          One of the biggest divisions within the Common Lisp community remains largely unacknowledged. That is <strong>the division between <em>Open Source and Proprietary</em></strong>.
          <br>
          There is tremendous untapped, latent energy to unlock to help make Common Lisp successful, and we just need a slight paradigm shift to do so.
        </p>

        <p>
          <a href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1213964177657794577" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">We can make Common Lisp a top 5 programming language by 2040</a>, and this will be much easier to achieve if we unify our forces.
          <br>
          <strong><a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/" target="_blank">Through my work</a>, I am working to dramatically expand the Common Lisp community, which is guaranteed to greatly benefit your business</strong>.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>You could boost my productivity almost beyond imagination just by providing me a tiny fraction of a normal salary!</strong>
          <br>
          For instance, 1000$/month would be basically infinite money in my current situation. How about you each contribute 500$/month for 6 months as a trial?
          <br>
          Of course, please consider starting with a large donation to the <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">Common Lisp Revival 2020 Fundraiser</a> before <strong>10 december 2020</strong>, as GitHub will double your contribution!
        </p>

        <p>
          I also urge you to open source more of your technology, not even necessarily out of pure generosity, but simply because it makes so much business sense!
          <br>
          For instance, you could send SHOCKWAVES throughout the world simply by open sourcing <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/products/capi.html" target="_blank">CAPI</a> and <a href="https://allegrograph.com/products/allegrograph/" target="_blank">AllegroGraph</a>!
          <br>
          Inherently, the more you open source, the more you stand to benefit from the great Open Source Marketing Machine!
        </p>

        <p>In fact, I almost wonder if you should also open source LispWorks and Allegro Common Lisp and transform yourself into a services company like Red Hat? It's really hard to compete with world-class open source implementations like <a href="http://sbcl.org/" target="_blank">SBCL</a> these days. But obviously, this would be a more long-term project, and I don't presume to understand your business better than you do or tell you what to do. I'm just suggesting ideas. We stand to greatly benefit from a healthy exchange of ideas.</p>

        <p>
          Please check out the details about <a href="https://sponsors.hexstreamsoft.com/about/" target="_blank">HexstreamSoft Sponsors</a>. I think you may find them very compelling.

        <p>Dear Common Lisp Foundation, Dear Dave,</p>

        <p>Thank you for giving birth to <a href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1041671580957466624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">one of the most important conversations in the Common Lisp community</a>!</p>

        <p>I have reason to believe that your understanding and appreciation for <a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/" target="_blank">my crucial work within the Common Lisp community</a> has only been growing since this historic event.</p>

        <p>I believe you have the necessary knowledge and resources to be a key ally in <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">leading Common Lisp to unprecedented success</a>.</p>

        <p>You are already managing <a href="https://www.common-lisp.net/" target="_blank">common-lisp.net</a> and <a href="https://www.cliki.net/" target="_blank">cliki.net</a>, both crucial resources. It is time to unify our efforts. I <a href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1250142510267224065" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">again</a> urge you to move to GitHub, the best open source platform, and the <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">Common Lisp Revival 2020 Fundraiser</a> is a great occasion to demonstrate to the world what already ought to be quite obvious: <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> is the best code hosting platform, and <a href="https://github.com/sponsors" target="_blank">GitHub Sponsors</a> is the best open source funding platform! Let's leave <q>avoid success at all costs</q> to Haskell!</p>

        <p>
          I am not sure if your corporate processes in any way allow for such a quick turnaround time, or if you can sanely make an exception, but if in any way possible,
          <br>

        <p>Dear Paul Graham, Dear Y Combinator,</p>

        <p><a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/" target="_blank">I have been almost entirely dedicating my life to Common Lisp since mid-2006</a> when I discovered Common Lisp, largely thanks to <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/" target="_blank">your essays</a>, especially <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html" target="_blank">Beating the Averages</a>. After spending 2 weeks reading your essays and researching Common Lisp, I went all-in on Common Lisp and completely abandoned Java. <strong>To this day, this has been the best and most determinant event in my life and I am deeply thanking you for it!</strong></p>

        <p>Basically, I've been running <a href="https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/" target="_blank">an unregistered Common Lisp startup</a> for 14 years. I am planning to register in 2022 at the latest. I have finally started experiencing <a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/#hexstreamsoft-alexa-stats" target="_blank">some visible success</a> this year, as I am finally reaching the interesting point in the exponential curve. <strong>I am requesting your help to further accelerate and embolden this process.</strong></p>

        <p>
          Unfortunately, I believe the traditional Y Combinator process would not be a good fit for me, due to various reasons.
          <br>
          I am requesting a fairly insignificant amount of funding compared to your usual investments, but this would completely change my life.
        </p>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">I am the chief architect of the looming Common Lisp revolution.</a> The revolution would still happen even if you just decided to watch it unfold from afar, but I thought I would highlight your opportunity to lend it a bit of your vast resources and influence, thereby greatly empowering it. Everyone has much to gain from this happening. This is a traditional win-win-win scenario.</p>

        <p>I trust that your world-class expertise in startups will easily detect the amazing intrinsic value and potential of me and my startup.</p>

        <p><strong>Please make a large donation to <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">the Common Lisp Revival 2020 Fundraiser</a> <em>before 10 december 2020</em> if you wish to help kickstart the Common Lisp revolution right now! Thank you.</strong></p>

        <p>Dear Ergodox/ZSA, Dear Erez, Dear Tisha, Dear Florian,</p>

        <p>The <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> is truly revolutionary and life-changing! I predict that it (or its close descendants) will remain the best keyboard on the planet for decades to come!</p>

        <p>Thank you for implementing custom labels in <a href="https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/planck-ez/layouts/ABWNG/latest/0" target="_blank">Oryx</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1237462417577295873" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">as I requested</a>. Your email support is truly amazing, and I was surprised to find that indeed, we have already exchanged <strong>more than 100 emails in 9 months!</strong> I greatly value our great relationship, and here is a perfect occasion to go to the next level!</p>

        <p>
          The <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> is so damn great that I couldn't resist making <a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/hardware/planck-ez/#my-config" target="_blank">an advanced presentation for my custom keyboard layout</a>.
          <br>
          You were so impressed with it that you quickly offered to <a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/articles/planck-ez-interview/" target="_blank">interview me</a>, and I then proceeded to really pour my soul into that article, with quite impressive results I might say!</p>

        <p>
          The kicker? <strong>I did this while I was already late to launch <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">the Common Lisp Revival 2020 Fundraiser</a>! <em>Oh noes!!</em></strong> 🤣
          <br>
          But seriously, I just <em>couldn't wait</em> to share my passion for the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> with the world! That's how goddamn amazing it is!!
        </p>

        <p>I had already been using the TypeMatrix 2030 (a somewhat similar keyboard) for more than a decade, and the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> is at least 20x better! It's easy to infer that I'm probably going to stick to the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> or a close descendant for the next decade at least... As <a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/articles/planck-ez-interview/#alternative-to-qmk" target="_blank">previously stated</a>, I am planning to build much more powerful alternatives to <a href="https://qmk.fm/" target="_blank">QMK</a>, <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/wally" target="_blank">Wally</a> and <a href="https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/" target="_blank">Oryx</a>, all written in Common Lisp, of course. Admittedly, it would take at least a few years before I can start working on this, due to <a href="https://roadmap.hexstreamsoft.com/" target="_blank">more pressing priorities</a>. My <a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/hardware/planck-ez/#my-config" target="_blank">awesome Planck EZ layout presentation</a> is already a good first step towards an Oryx alternative, although it is not yet written in Common Lisp. (I would probably only support the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a>, since that's the only keyboard I find interesting...) <strong><a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/articles/planck-ez-interview/#stenography" target="_blank">I believe the Planck EZ will be the key to unlocking 100x productivity!</a></strong></p>

        <p>
          I think there is already an inherent and fundamental link between Common Lisp and the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a>:
          <br>
          <em>It's only fair to expect that the best programmers would gravitate not only towards the best programming language, but also the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">best keyboard</a>!</em>
          <br>
          Thankfully, we have a tremendous opportunity to make that connection even more concrete today!
        </p>

        <p><strong>As such, I would be extremely honored if you made a large donation to <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">the Common Lisp Revival 2020 Fundraiser</a> <em>before 10 december 2020</em> to help kickstart the Common Lisp revolution right now!

Naval Ravikant, founder of AngelList, describes his companyâ€™s shipping culture in one of his <a href="https://nav.al/build-a-team-that-ships">blog posts</a>. 
</p>
<p>
They like to keep projects to one person. And every person is responsible for shipping something every single week. 
</p>
<p>
Itâ€™s quite a polarizing culture. So much so that Naval makes explicit that their environment is wrong for most people. Theyâ€™re looking for independent people who can ship code and if you donâ€™t fit that type, you should go look elsewhere:

I wish more companies would do this. When youâ€™re able to clearly outline your values, you tend to attract individuals that stick. 
</p>
<p>
And sometimes, itâ€™s just as important to list all the reasons why someone <em>wouldnâ€™t enjoy</em> working at a company as it is to list everything good about the company. 
</p>
<p>
Hereâ€™s an example from <a href="https://www.notion.so/Join-Levels-Remote-Head-of-Marketing-Growth-6e64dba240404eaea9160a48f1c5f24f">Levels Healthâ€™s</a> recent job description:

Information like this is gold dust. Think about the countless <em>years</em> people waste working at companies that theyâ€™re not suited for. 
</p>
<p>
For instance, the role above would be a bad fit for me. Iâ€™m at a stage of my career where mentorship would be helpful and Iâ€™d like to execute on projects that are clearly defined in scope. 
</p>
<p>
If a company is not able to explain to me what would make someone a bad candidate for the role, then that would worry me. If youâ€™re not able to eliminate <em>anyone</em> for a role, then the job position itself has likely not been set up for success.

<h2>Build a team that ships</h2>


<p>
I want to talk a bit more about AngelListâ€™s prolific shipping culture.
</p>
<p>
It reminds me of a ceramics experiment that was done (can be traced back to this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0961454733/?tag=codihorr-20">book</a>) in which the teacher divided the class into two groups. 
</p>
<p>
One group would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, whilst the other solely on its quality.
</p>
<p>
The grading procedure was simple:
</p>
<p>
<em>â€œOn the final day of class, the instructor would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the "quantity" group: fifty pound of pots rated an "A", forty pounds a "B", and so on. Those being graded on "quality", however, needed to produce only one pot - albeit a perfect one - to get an "A".â€�</em>
</p>
<p>
Fast forward to grading time. Can you guess what happened? 
</p>
<p>
It turns out that the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity:
</p>
<p>
<em>â€œIt seems that while the "quantity" group was busily churning out piles of work - and learning from their mistakes - the "quality" group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.â€�</em>
</p>
<p>
Naval acknowledges that shipping at the velocity they do is not ideal. They make mistakes and many of the features they release are half-baked. 
</p>
<p>
But it is also precisely <em>because</em> they ship so much that theyâ€™re able to get it right. Just like the â€œquantityâ€� group, the engineers at AngelList are constantly iterating and testing out their assumptions. 
</p>
<p>
Rather than always being in paralysis mode, they just build the damn thing. And if it doesnâ€™t work, they try again until it does. 
</p>
